the rehabilitation of Line A (from 65% to 70%) and the improvements or conversions of transfer centers 
and rail-road crossings, respectively (from 40% to 48%), the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan 
Agreement and the Implementation Letter mentioned above, as follows:

SCHEDULE 2 
 
Description of the Project 
 
The objectives of the Project are to: (a) support joint private sector-public sector initiatives to 
improve the service quality and coverage of mass transit in the AMBA; (b) support the carrying out of the 
infrastructure improvement obligations assumed by private concessionaires with respect to the AMBA 
passenger rail system; (c) assist in improving traffic safety and urban transport-related environmental 
quality in the AMBA; (d) contribute towards the development of an integrated urban transport (road and 
rail) system for the AMBA; and (e) improve maternal and child health through the delivery of quality 
services, and to strengthen disease surveillance and control activities, all for purposes of reducing the 
acute risk of disease in the Borrower’s territory. 
 
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof as the Borrower 
and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such objectives: 
 
Part A
:
Buenos Aires Subway Infrastructure Improvement
1. 
Rehabilitation (including civil works supervision) of lines B, C, D and E of the Buenos Aires 
subway system, as well as of the Urquiza suburban rail line, by replacing portions of their track without 
deviating from the original existing track bed, renovating their electric substations and electric 
transmission systems, installing automatic signals and an operations control center for the lines, 
improving their passenger stations (such as by installing or rebuilding escalators), improving their 
mechanical workshops, ventilation systems and drainage systems and reconstructing approximately eight 
Urquiza line electric coaches. 
 
2. 
Rehabilitation (including civil works supervision) of Buenos Aires subway system line A by 
completely replacing its track without deviating from the original existing track bed, installing three new 
electric substations for the line, renewing the line’s power transmission system, renovating its signal and 
communications system, expanding the subway operations control center to include control of the line, 
replacing the line’s drainage pumps and ventilation system and installing or rebuilding its station 
escalators. 
 
Part B
:
Urban Transport System Integration
1. 
Major improvements (including civil works supervision) of road/rail transfer facilities by carrying 
out Integration Subprojects (consisting of, e.g., building or improving bus terminals, transfer centers and 
car parks) at selected major AMBA subway and/or rail stations. 
 
2. 
(a)  Minor improvements (such as, e.g., installation of bus-only lanes and other traffic flow 
enhancements, traffic signals, walkways, sidewalks and bicycle parking facilities) at outlying AMBA 
subway and/or rail stations, so as to ease bus, car, pedestrian and bicycle access to such stations; and (b) 
this subparagraph is hereby deliberately left blank.

Part C
:
Traffic Safety Enhancement and Environmental Monitoring
1. 
(a)  Conversion (including civil works supervision) of approximately eight road/rail grade 
crossings in the AMBA into non-grade road/rail crossings, at or near the same sites as the original grade 
crossings (by carrying out Traffic Safety Subprojects involving tunnel or bridge construction); (b) this 
subparagraph is hereby deliberately left blank; (c) carrying out of a study to develop a comprehensive 
strategy to improve the safety of road/rail grade crossings in the AMBA; and (d) implementation of other 
traffic safety measures in the AMBA, acceptable to the Bank. 
 
2. 
This paragraph is hereby deliberately left blank. 
 
Part D
:
Institutional Strengthening
1. 
Carrying out of an integrated urban transport study for the AMBA, which study shall include a 
transport survey and, on the basis of the results of said survey, subsequent preparation of a transport 
model suitable for quantitatively assessing the feasibility and comparative merits of alternative 
transportation strategies for the AMBA. 
 
2. 
Carrying out of studies to develop an AMBA traffic and public space improvement program. 
 
3. 
Provision of technical assistance to ST on:  (a) technical, financial, environmental and social

Integration Subprojects and Traffic Safety Subprojects in particular; and (b) general Project 
administration. 
 
4. 
Provision of training, in the fields of urban transport planning and economics, environmental 
management, traffic engineering and traffic safety management, to Argentine professionals working, or 
likely to work, in said fields with respect to the AMBA. 
 
5. 
Establishment, maintenance and operation, throughout at least the period of implementation of 
the Project, of a public unit for AMBA urban transport planning. 
 
Part E
:
Emergency Drugs and Supplies
Improvement of services related to women’s reproductive health care and prenatal controls, 
including anemia prevention, child delivery, newborn reception, post-partum and child health care, 
through the acquisition and distribution of medical drugs and supplies and iron-fortified milk. 
 
Part F
:
Strengthening of Disease Control
1. 
Carrying out of a program of actions for disease monitoring, control and prevention of 
tuberculosis, dengue and other vector disease control, and hospital infections, through the  acquisition and 
distribution of medical drugs and supplies, vaccines and pesticides. 
 
2. 
Carrying out of a program of actions for disease monitoring, control and prevention of HIV/AIDS 
and other sexually transmitted diseases, through
,
