empowerment of\n            the rural population, including women, youth and other\n            marginalized groups. The project's objectives are to:\n            1) establish an operationally effective and efficient,\n            decentralized system for local development; and 2) increase\n            access of the rural population to basic infrastructure and\n            services. There are four project components. First, Local\n            Investment Fund (LIF) will stimulate local development by\n            transferring grants directly to Rural Development\n            Communities. The fund will support basic infrastructure\n            identified by the communities. Second, support to the local\n            development process will focus on improving the\n            institutional and regulatory framework and equipping Guinea\n            with the tools to analyze and implement local development;\n            increasing local mobilization; and improving capacity of\n            local participants to take charge of their own development\n            and sustain their investments. Third, maintenance and\n            rehabilitation of rural roads will develop a strategy for\n            the management of the rural roads network, implement a\n            priority maintenance and rehabilitation program and support\n            the reorganization of the Maintenance Unit of the National\n            Directorate of Rural Engineering Services (DNGR). Finally,\n            project coordination and management will handle the\n            day-to-day management of the project activities."}, "docdt": "1999-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
