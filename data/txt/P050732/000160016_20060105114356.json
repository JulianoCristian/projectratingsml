The\n            additional financing would also enable preservation of this\n            capacity and implementation momentum while the second APL\n            (Adaptable Program Lending instrument) phase is under\n            preparation. The Credit supporting the Project was\n            originally extended until December 31, 2005 to support the\n            process leading to local elections to replace appointed\n            rural development community (Communaute Rude de\n            Developpement (CRD)) leaders by democratically elected\n            representatives. These elections are planned for December\n            18, 2005, and were the sole remaining trigger for the\n            Project's second phase. At the present time, remaining\n            resources from the International Development Association\n            (IDA) for FY06 are, however, insufficient tofinance the\n            project's second phase (estimated at US$35 million);\n            while it is expected that sufficient FY07 resources are\n            available.  Additional Financing, which would have a closing\n            date of June 30,2007, would thus also help bridge the gap\n            between the end of the first phase and the start-up of the\n            second phase, avoiding loss of momentum in the program.\n            Moreover, as the project has been increasingly used as a\n            vehicle for providing services to communities, two Bank\n            operations (the Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project and the\n            Education for All Project) will face implementation problems\n            if the project's funding is interrupted. Following\n            Midterm Review, the Project had scaled-up its geographic\n            coverage from the original target of 100 to 146 CRDs. The\n            Additional Financing will enable the project to continue\n            capacity-building activities, and support the implementation\n            and updating of local development plans in these 146 CRDs\n            and ensure that the new representative local governments\n            have the capacity to lead participatory local development\n            planning and implementation processes. Continued support\n            will be a stabilizing apolitical influence in participating\n            CRDs. Given that the project covers half the country, it\n            could become a destabilizing factor if a longer-term\n            interruption in financing occurs. After the elections,\n            continued support will be necessary to provide training to\n            newly elected CRD presidents, who will likely be different\n            from those presently in place, as these have been appointed\n            by the central Government. In addition, continued support to\n            the nascent democratization process implies continued\n            investment support to local development to cement achievements."}, "docdt": "2005-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
