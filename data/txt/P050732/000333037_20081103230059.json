Some\n            lessons learned included: decentralization is a long-term\n            and comprehensive effort that requires political support.\n            The major changes expected are likely to meet resistance\n            from some institutions. Therefore considerable effort is\n            needed for new systems to be established and officials to be\n            educated and convinced to accept changes. To achieve\n            successful decentralization, champions are required on the\n            community side to make pressure on the central government to\n            relinquish authority and undertake further reforms to lead\n            to effective decentralization including fiscal\n            decentralization. On the Government's side, change\n            agents with strong leadership and the right vision is\n            required to undertake the courageous reforms for effective\n            decentralization. Fiscal capabilities are critical to\n            long-term viability of local governments. In order for\n            decentralization reforms to be sustainable, they need to be\n            accompanied by effective fiscal decentralization. While\n            local governments have rights over some taxation schemes,\n            the poverty levels make it difficult for them to collect a\n            substantial share of these revenues therefore limiting them\n            in their ability to undertake investment activities.\n            Medium-term efforts should focus on fiscal issues, including\n            sustainable transfers from the central government."}, "docdt": "2008-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
