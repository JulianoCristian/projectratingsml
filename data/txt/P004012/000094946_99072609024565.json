The project objectives were mostly met, and,\n            substantial strengthening capacity was achieved in key areas\n            of the Environmental Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL).\n            However, a certain lack of initiative, and responsibility,\n            may prevent the Agency from improving its ability to control\n            pollution, and, effectively manage environmental\n            adversities. The key lessons learned suggest, primarily,\n            that the establishment of the Project Management Office\n            (PMO) during preparation, with a continued role through\n            implementation, was vital for success. Mainly, and because,\n            it was managed by BAPEDAL, the office thus became the link\n            among not only the Bank, and the consultants, but most\n            importantly, the various potential donors. This contributed,\n            not only to strengthen a new agency's capacity, but to\n            actually resolve difficult issues which arose during\n            implementation. However, a flexible balance in the provision\n            of technical assistance (TA), would have been beneficial,\n            since most of the TA was delivered upon completion, not in\n            an advisory role. Thus, to complement technical components,\n            ideally, counterpart managers per TA team should be\n            assigned, and project design should include mechanisms for\n            TA delivery. This could have fostered that sense of\n            ownership, and, responsibility, needed for enhancing\n            institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
