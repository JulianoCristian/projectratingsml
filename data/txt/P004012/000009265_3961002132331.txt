MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$12 MILLION
TO THE REPUELIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE
BAPEDAL DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$12 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years grace, at the
Bank'. standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing the
BAPEDAL Development Technical Assistance Project.
2.  -    Economic Setting and Background.  Sustained economic growth over the
next decade will be essential to ensure the availability of employment
opportunities for Indonesia's rapidly expanding labor force. As in the past,
this growth will rely extensively on the use of the country's vast natural
resources. While rapid growth of the industrial sector is expected to reduce
the pressure on natural resources in the longer term, the present contribution
of renewable and exhaustible resources to economic development in Indonesia,
In terms of the value added of direct exploitation and primary processing,
represents nearly 40% of GDP. Despite rapid diversification of exports in
recent years, foreign exchange earnings of the primary sectors have
consistently been more than 80% of the total. Over 50% of the work force is
employed in the primary sectors.
3.       Indonesia's emerging environmental problems are also related to the
spatial patterns of economic development. Of the total population of 180
million, about 110 million (62%) are located on the inner islands of Java,
Madura, Bali and Lombok, which together have only about 8% of the land. On
Java, virtually all of the land suitable for agriculture is already under
intensive cultivation, with limited scope for further absorption of labor.
With the rapid growth of urban centers, and the expansion of industry (80% of
which is concentrated on Java), there is likely to be a significant conversion
of prime agricultural land to urban and industrial use. Agricultural
intensification has included a major investment in irrigation facilities.
Although Java is well endowed with rainfall, most of its rivers are less than
50 km long and have small catchments. With seasonal variation in rainfall,
this results in water shortages in dry years. Increasingly, water demands for
agriculture, urban and industrial use will lead to conflicts in water resource
allocation. More importantly, human and industrial waste are causing a
growing (and sometimes quite severe) problem of water quality, with important
consequences for human health, the protection of coastal marine environments
and the prospects for expansion of economic activity in the critical
watersheds.
4.       In the outer islands, with 40% of the population but only 20% of
industry, employment growth has depended primarily on the expansion of
agriculture. Because of the generally low productivity of land here, much of



-2-
this expansion has been based on extensification of agricultural production.
Partly due to problems of insecure land tenure, this has been accompanied by a
significant conversion of forest land to sedentary or shifting cultivation.
Although Indonesia Ls estimated to have an much as 110 million hectares under
forest cover, 97% of which is in the outer islands, nearly a million hectares
a year are being lost -- more than half due to smallholder conversion, about a
quarter due to development projects, and the rest tc -ioor logging practices
and natural and man-made disasters. The cost to the economy of deforestation
is estimated at US$1 billion per year, but this does not include losses due to
watershed degradation or the lose of rare species and genetic diversity.
5.       The pace and pattern of economic growth in Indonesia, therefore, has
given rise to a number of key concerns, including issues of deforestation,
land degrAdation and the loss of biodiversity, mainly in the outer islands,
issues of water resource allocation and quality control, especially in Java,
and issues of urban and industrial pollution control, including hazardous
waste, particularly on the north coast of Java. The emergence of these issues
has led to a growing awareness of the need to ensure the ecological soundness
of Indonesia's development programs and to manage the use of natural resources
in a more sustainable manner over the longer term.
6.       Government Strat2a. The Indonesian Government has had a long-
standing commitment to the basic concepts of sustainable development and
environmental protection, and has already established a legal framework and
regulatory procedures designed to implement those concepts. Further progress
will be required, however, in developing an appropriate policy and incentives
framework and in strengthening the institutional capacity of those agencies
responsible for ensuring the sustainability of Indonesia's development
efforts. In a number of areas, improvements in the policy and incentives
framework will simultaneously help to ensure more efficient growth and
development. Higher energy prices, for example, encourage conservation and,
at the same time, reduce budgetary subsidies. They may also generate global
benefits as a vesult of lower greenhouse gas emissions than would otherwise
occur. In general, pricing and taxation policies are likely to be the most
efficient instruments for environmental conservation and protection, but more
effective institutional arrangements for pollution monitoring and control, and
for the design and evaluation of environmentally sound investment programs,
will also be needed.
7.       Recent progress on both the policy and institutional strengthening
side has been encouraging. In forestry managgment, stumpage fees have more
than doubled, the rate of allowable extraction has been reduced, studies are
underway on the feasibility of plantation forestry (to reduce pressures on the
natural forests), and a Tropical Forestry Action Plan is under preparation. A
national action plan for the orotection of biodiversitX is nearing completion,
and a proposal for funding under the Global Environment Facility is under
active consideration. In land manaaement, the Government has established a
land infoxmation and administration agency, and an inter-mInisterial
commission for land use policy, chaired by the State Planning Minister. In
water resources management, a start has been made in the introduction of
water-user charges in the irrigation sector, and options for improvements in
water sector policies and in the institutional management of water resources



-3-
are under review. In the area of vollution control, initiatives include:
(a) the development of a program to clean up the twenty four most highly
polluted rivers in eleven provinces; (b) pre-feasibility studies on the
establishment of two toxic waste disposal facilities; (c) the elimination of
pesticide subsidies and the introduction of integrated pest management
programs, and (d) the establishment of a new agency responsible for pollution
#ontrol and oversight of the Govsrnments environmental assessment precess.
While these developments aro encouraging, it is clear that much more remains
to be done. The Government is committed to tackling these problems, and has
actively sought the help of the donor community in a number of vital areas.
8.       Bank Strateoa   and Rationale for Involvement.  The Bank's strategy
and operational programs in support of improved environmental management in
Indonesia have evolved rapidly over the past several years, with work on the
first Indonesia environment report initiated in 1987 (Forest. Land and Waters
Issues in Sustainable Development, Report No. 7822, dated June, 1989).  All of
the critical issues cited in that report are currently being addressed through
planned and on-going lending operations, and further analysis on related
issues of sustainability has been incorporated in the Bank's economic and
sector work program.  Two forestry conservaticn projects, for example, are
under supervision, and a third is under preparation. Preparation of a
proposed Global Environment Facility biodiversity project, involving an
innovative "integrated conservation and development" pilot scheme, is about to
get underway. kand resources management is the focus of a sector study now
under discussion with Government, which may lead to a land use planning and
management project.
9.       A sector report on water resources management is underway, and this
will be complemented by a regional study of comparative approaches, both of
which will provide inputs for our recommendations to GOI on improvements in
this area. Projects in the irrigation subsector have already led to improved
policies on pricing and cost recovery, and water supply investments are a
major component in the Bank"s urban sector loans. Planned future projects
will focus on groundwater development for irrigation and village water supply.
A number of projects, particularly in the urban sector, have focused on
identifying the institutional options for improved environmental management at
the local level, especially for urban and industrial sector pollution
monitorino and control. Environmental issues in the energy sector will be
addressed in a study about to get underway, and the next major environment
report on indonesia will focus both on longer-term issues and on the policy
and incentives frimework required for influencing environmental out:omes,
particularly in the area of urban industrial pollution control.
10.       In early 1989, when GOI began to seriously consider the "eed for a
new national agency for the control of environmental pollution, the Bank was
asked to help in securing grant funds to support preparatory activities. A
Japan Grant Facillty proposal was subsequently approved.  The Environmental
Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL) was formally established by Presidential
Decree in June 1990. Consultants engaged under the Japanese Grant, together
with consultants funded through UNDP, Canadian, Belgian and United States
assistance, have been working with BAPEDAL staff to define a flve-year
development program. That plan, which forms the basis for the proposed Bank



-4-
loan, has now been approved by GOl. In this context, the Bank has been
requested to provide an "umbrellaw technical assistance loan which would help
to establish a framework for support from the donor community while, at the
same time, ensuring untied financing in areas not covered by other donors.
Bank support of BAPEDAL is seen by GOI as complementary to our on-going
institutional strengthening activities for improved environmental management
in a number of key sectors, provinces and urban centers.  The Bank's 
leadership in supporting BAPEDAL through the proposed loan is also expected to
help in mobilizing support from other donors and ensuring the efficient use of
such tupport.
:.1.     Past Exoerience with Technical Assistance Loans.  The Bank's
experience with free-standing technical assistance to Indonesia has been
genetivLly good. Five such operations, financed from 1968-1979 have been
reviewed by ORD (March 1988 - Report No. 7156). One subsequent TA loan
(telecommunications) has been closed, another (railways) is currently under
implementation, and a third (infrastructi-ee development) has recently been
approved. The five loans reviewed by OED were seen as extremely valuable in
the preparation of investment proposals, but the results of advisory services
and policy studies were mixed. The same conclusions were reached in a recent
study of the technical assistance components of Bank investment projects in
Indonesia. The lessons for future technical assistance projects are clear:
(a) careful identification of the client/user is necessary to ensure
commitment to the efficient use of Bank funds; (b) effective oversight
mechanisms are required in 001 to ensure that policy studies and advisory
services are properly implemented and that the results are used appropriately;
and (c) the Bank's supervision must be staffed and organized to avoid delays
and other difficulties in carrying out the technical assistance. These
lessons have been incorporated in the design of the proposed BAPEDAL technical
assistance project, as noted further below in paras. 16 and 18.
12.      ProJect Objectives and Description.  The primary objective of the
Project is to assist GOI in implementing the Five Year 8APEDAL Development
Plan, through: (a) strengthening the institutional capacity and role of
BAPEDAL and other agencies of the borrower responsible for environmental
management and pollution control; and (b) designing and implementing pollution
control measures at the central and regional levels.
13.      To achieve these objectives, the loan would provide funds amounting
to US$12 million equivalent to BAPEDAL to finance the provision of technical
assistance for: (a) the review of existing laws, regulations and procedures
relating to pollution control and the development of specific formal and
informal measures to ensure appropriate inter-agency coordination and the
enfore-oment of environmental standards and regulations; (b) design and
development of pollution control systems and procedures, including permits,
incentives, inspection, monitoring and communication systems as well as their
testing and refinement in targeted locations and industries; (c) planning,
establishment, and strengthening of pollution control agencies and
laboratories at the regional level, including technical advice through the
central BAPEDAL for enforcement and compliance staff in selected regional
agencies; (d) assistance with recruitment processes (including the preparation
of functional position descriptions) and the design, development and



-5-
initiation of a training program; and (a) external resource administration,
including the preparation of proposals for donor finua.cing within the
framework of the Five Year DAPEDAL Development Plan, assistance to the BAPEDAL
managers for efficient processing and use of consultant services, and
financial management and accounting services to meet GOI and donor agency
requirements. The Government has indicated its commitment to the principles
underlying the development of BAPEBAL as an effective agency for environmental
protection in a letter dated January 13,. 1992 (see Annex 1). A more detailed
description of the Project is provided in Annex 2.
14.       The total project cost is estimated at US$15 million equivalent, of
which about US$8.3 million equivalent is expected to be in foreign exchange.
The Bank lo&n of US$12 million would finance about 90% of total project costs,
net of taxes. Cost estimate are based on similar contracts presently under
implementation and include: (a) clarifying and strengthening the mandate for
pollution control (including about 100 months of consul-.ancy services);
(b) design and development of pollution control systems and procedures (about
250 months of cor.wultancy services); (c) establishment and strengthening of
regional pollution control agencies and laboratories (about 220 months of
consultancy services); (d) recruitment and training (about 100 months of
consultancy services); and (e) the mobilization and facilitation of donor
support, including program management and administration (about 130 months of
consultancy services). All components will include support of related
workshops, training and operating costs. Physical contingencies are not
applicable; price contingencies are calculated at 6% on local coste and 3.7%
on foreign costs for 1992 and thereafter. The closing date of the loan will
be June 30, 1997.
15.      The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. All
consultant services contracts will be subject to prior review by the Bank. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached.
16.      Aureed Actions.  Agreement was reached at negotiations that
APEDAL's management team (including the Chairman, Secretary and Deputy
Chairmen) would be responsible for carrying out the project, and would be
supported by a Program Management Office (PMO). Agreement was also reached at
*          negotiations on the structure and staffing plan for the PMO.  While most of
the relevant staff are already in place, the appointment of a donor
coordination advisor, in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of
consultants, will be a condition of loan effectiveness. Appointment of two
consultancy assistance officers, an accountant, and an administrative officer,
in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants, will be
effected by Captember 30, 1992. Agreement was reached at negotiations for (a)
review by the Bank of consultant findings and recommendations, and (b) an
annual review with the Bank, in September of eack year, of the overall BWEDAL
work program for the coming year, prepared in accordance with the approved
Five Year BAPEDAL Development Plan.  Detailed terms of reference, short lists
of eligible firms, and a schedule for processing the consultant contracts
expected to be signed during the first year of the project were also agreed at



-6-
negotiations. other arrangements that were agreed at negotiations include:
(a) the specification of standard documents and procedures for selecting and
retaining consultants, in line with standard Bank guidelines; (b) disbursement
arrangements, including use of a Special Account; and (c) project accounting,
auditing and reporting requirements. (Further details are in Annex 2.)
17.      Benefits and Risks.  the direct and immediate benefits of the
proposed project would accrue to BAPEDAL in terms of strengthening its
capacity for leadership in the control of environmental pollution. The
relatively modest level of Bank financing would help to mobilize substantially
larger funds from other donors on concessional terms, and help to ensure their
efficient use. Such project-financed technical assistance will be crucial in
maintaining momentum toward the formulation of a practicLi strategy for
sustainable development in Indonesia and in the development of the
institutional capacity to implement that strategy.
18.      The primary risks of the proposed project are inherent in all
efforts to build capacities of now institutions such as BAPEDAL. The pace of
institutional development is difficult to predict and obstructions may appear
without warning, as they have in the case of virtually all environmental
protection agencies worldwide. Moreover, effective delivery of technical
assistance is difficult in Indonesia and ine!iciencies in its management
could diminish important project benefits. These risks will be minimized by:
(a) securing strong support for the project in the National Development
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) to ensure the sustained provision of adequate
budgetary resources; (b) ensuring close oversight of project activities
through the BAPEDAL management team; (c) continuing to support the Program
Management Office (already established under the Japan Grant) to assist in the
administration of the technical assistance; and {d) devoting adequate Bank
resources to supervision. Supervision of the project during the early period
of implementation will be particularly challenging, since BAPEDAL is an
entirely new institution. This will be partially offset by having the Task
Manager (an institutional specialist) based in the Resident Mission.
19.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

REPUBLIC OF INOONESIA

To Mr. Nicholas C. Hope
Director Resident Staff in Indonesia
World Bank - Washington
Washington, DC
U.8.A.
Dear Mr. Hope:
PrcO2oam BAPEDAL DeveIogMent Technical Assistance Pro iect
I refer to your Letter No. D-OO1/ENVIR/I/92 of January 6, 1992 concerning
the above proJect, and I wish to confirm that the principles, approach and
technical assistance described in the attached Aide-memoire accurately reflect
the Government's intentions.
I would like to note in this context that the Government recognizes the
Importance of enapring eavironmental protection and the sustainable management
of natural resources in the interests of both current economic development and
the health and prosperity of Indonesia's future generations. While the basic
legal framework and procedures for sound environmental managemt have already
beVbstablished, further development of policies, standards and incentives will
be required, and the institutional capacity of the agencies responsible for
environmental management =ut be further strengthened. Particular attention will
be given to developing the capacity of BAPMDAL to enable it to carry out- its
catalytic and facilitative role in pollution control and the environmental
assessment of development projects.
In pursuing the above goals, the Government is committed to:
(a) clarifying and strengthening the mandate of BAPEDAL and relevant
agencies in the regions for the management of environmental impacts;
(b)   developing and implementing effective systems and procedures for the
control of environmental impacts, to ensure effectivs compliance and
adequate enforcement of environmental standards and regulations;
(c)   establishing and strengthening of agencies and laboratories in the
regions for the management of environmental impacts;
(d)   development and iaplementation of effective recruitment and training
programes, first for BAPEDAL Pusat and then for the relevant regional
agencies and laboratories; and

(e) ensuring the effective administration of external assistance within
the framework of the approved BAPEDAL Development Plan.
Finally, I would like to assure you of Government's intention to manage the
technical and financial assistance available to BAPEDAL from the donor community
so as to ensure consistency among the level of aid provided, the evolving
capacity of BAPEDAL to use that aid effectively, and the relative priority of the
various work program elements set out in the BAPEDAL Five Year Development Plan.

BAPEDAL DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
A. Inatitutional Setting
1.       GoI's commitment to the principles of sustainable development has
long been evident in the establishment of aaencies (an environment unit in the
Planning Ministry in 1972, a Ministry for Population and Environment - KLH -
in 1982, and an environmental protection agency - BAPEDAL - in 1990), in the
passage of environmental laws and reaulations (the Basic Law on Management of
the Living Environment in 1982, and regulation PP29 on Environmental Impact
Assessments - the AMDAL Program - in 1986), and in the reform of macroeconomic
volicgls for improved environmental management (including, in recent years,
increased taxes on forestry products, elimination of subsidies for pesticides,
and the introduction of water user charges in irrigation schemes). For
largely historical reasons, however, the mandate for environmental protection
is fragmented, with responsibility for various aspects of pollution monitoring
and control diffused among a rather large number of central and regional
agencies. Appropriate standards for both ambient water and air quality, and
for emissions of specific pollutants, are still being developed. At the same
time, the domestic capacity for environmental impact assessments is weak,
reflecting both the recent introduction of this requirement and the severe
shortage of qualified and experienced staff in the public and private sectors.
2.       Significant progress has been achieved over the past several years
in the area of industrial pollution control through the "PROKASIUW program,
which has targeted the worst sources of industrial pollution in the 24 most
highly polluted rivers in 11 provinces. This program, however, has had to
rely on essentially voluntary agreements with individual firms, and success in
the reduction of pollution loads has been constrained by the lack of clear
legal grounds for enforcing even minimal environmental standards. The
establishment of an environmental protection agency - BAPEDAL - reflects both
the growing recognition of the human and economic costs of environmental
degradation and the Government's commitment to avoid, to the extent possible,
the mistakes encountered in western industrialized countries - especially the
enormous clean up costs from the uncontrolled disposal of hazardous waste.
3.       Consistent with the experience of other countries, the development
of BAPIDAL as an effective environmental protection agency will be a long-term
process, and it will not be easy. GOI clearly recognizes the importance of
targeting BAPODALes initial efforts so as to maximize the impact and
credibility of this agency in the near term. In view of the shortage of local
expertise, considerable reliance on expatriate consultants will be inevitable.
While a number of donors have expressed an interest in supporting this new
agency, the level of financial and technical assistance provided will need to



- 17 -
be consistent with BAPEDAL's absorptive capacity, and particular attention
will need to be given to donor coordination and the management of assistance
programs. Recognizing these needs, COX has prepared a Five Year Development
Plan which is intended both to establish BAPEDAL's priorities for the work
program and provide a framework for mobilizing domestic and foreign resources
to implement the highest priority activities.
S. Proiect Description
Key PrincLiples of Strategv and Amoroach
4.       An understandina was reached during appraiswal that GOI would follow
a number of key jprinciples in imolementinca the grntosed BAPEDAL Develoument
Project, including:
(a) Realistic esoectations: Given the challenges of institutional
development facing BAPEDAL, in particular the national shortage of trained and
experienced pollution control experts in the country and the difficulties of
recruiting them for the public sector, and in view of the experience in other
countries with the time it takes to establish and develop an environmental
protection agency, it will be important to maintain modest expectations about
the scope of BAPEDAL's activities and the pace at which effective pollutior.
monitoring and control systems can be put in place;
(b) _volutionarv change in mandate: Existing environmental laws
and regulations already provide a basic framework for environmental
protection, and future changes are likely to involve a gradual clarification
and enhancement of authority, based on needs that are identified through
experience "on the ground". Experience with the PRORASIH program, for
example, has highlighted the importance of having a legally enforceable
agreement with polluting firms, and inter-agency cooperation in the processing
of enforcement actions, as well as reliable analysis of actual pollution
emissions. In some cases, formal instruments (laws and regulations) may
require amendment, but in other cases existing regulations (such as the
Hinderance Ordinance) and less formal instruments (such as PROXASIR Letters of
Agreement) may be adequate;
(c)  Becognition of trade-offe:  Consistent with GOI's economic
development strategy, considerable attention has been given in recent years to
de-regulating the private sector so as to encourage growth of employment and
exports and to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. The development of
pollution control systems, therefore, should be seen as "prudential
regulation" - i.e., the introduction of standards and regulations that need to
be imposed in order to ensure the viability of the industrial sector over the
longer term, the health and welfare of affected populations, and the
sustainable management of environmental assets. Within this context,
enforcement and compliance activities will need to take into account realistic
assessments of the technological capacity for, and the financial and economic
costs of, full compliance with the desired standards and regulations. Except
in the case of serious threats to human health from toxic and hazardous waste,
therefore, the enforcement process should focus on sustained and "good-faith"
efforts by industries and firms to comply with the desired standards, at a



- 18 -
pace which appropriately reflects the trade-offs between pollution control,
the growth of employment and output, and the efficiency of production in the
private sector; and
(d) Negd for results To justify the commitment of recources, and
to begin to establish the credibility of DAPUDAL as an effective agency for
environmental protection, it will be important to achieve soae visible and
significant outcomes over the next 2-3 years. To do this will require a
"parallel track" approach involving (a) demonstration initiatives to test in
specific cases the principles and preliminary design of enforcement and
incentives systems, while (b) longer-term work proceeds to create human
resource capacities, clarify and strengthen the legal mandate, design and
develop the enforcement and compliance system, and establish effective
regional agencies. Achieving results in the near term will also require a
carefully targeted approach. Focus will be required on the most heavily
polluted areas and the major sources of pollution within those areas.
Teghnical Assistance Under the Proiect
5.       Consistent with the approved Five Year BAPEDAL Development Plan, the
technical assistance to be provided under the Banks loan is designed to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the BAPEDAL and to assist in the
implementation of specific initiatives for pollution control. Financial
support would be provided for a variety of project activities within the key
work program categories identified in the Plan. The assistance would be
action-oriented and include support for consultant services, training and
equipment for the implementation of pollution control. The specific areas in
which Bank assistance has been requested are outlined below. More detailed
descriptions of these activities are provided in the Schedule of Project
Activities, shown in Attachment 2. The followina cateaories of activities
will be eliaible for financing under the_ roposed groject:

Selection of Project Activities
6.       ItyA -a conf irme-d at necotiationsl that all _activities- to be financed
under tU project will be b2ased on the Five Year BAPEDAL Development Plan.
Illustrative activities eligible for financing under the project, including
all those to be initiated in the first project year, are summarized in
Attachment TI.  Detailed TOR and  short list were agrXee at ne8 tiatigosfor
all activities to be initiated in the first iroiect year. includina sum3ort
fox trg Mg. Other activities may be selected during project implementation.
As for all technical assistance under the project, the Bank's procurement
guidelines will be followed. Detailed TOR including implementation schedules
and estimated costs, short lists, letters of invitation and contracts will be
submitted to the Bank for prior review. The Bank will expedite its review and
approval process by delegating its Task Management functions for this project
to the Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI) under arrangements which were
established, and which proved effective, under previous technical assistance
credits.
Af First preference for regional support under the Bank's loan would be
for sub-projects that would link into on-going and completed institutional
strengthening activities under Bank-financed projects in East Java, JABOTADEK,
West Xa.imantan and North Sumatra.

7.       In order to facilitate the selection of future activities and
strengthon overall program management, funds have been rovid_d under the
groiect to surnort an Annual Program Review. Preparations for the Review
would include an assessment of the prior year's results and an updating of the
Development Plan. The Review would be held in Septembbr of each year, and
results would include GOI budget proposals for the upcoming fiscal year.
Logistical and technical support would be provided to BAPEDAL managers by the
Program Management Office (PHO) for the purpose of carrying out the Rei.ew.
C. Proiect Imnlementation and Manaaement
Project MNaame_nt
8.       BAPEDAL's management (includ.ing the Chairman, Secretary and
Deputies) will be responsible for carr-ying out the project, in consultation
with BAPPEMAS. The BAPEDAL management team would be supported by the Program
Management Office (PXO) referred to tarlier. The PMO would report to the
BAPEDAL Secretary for administrative purposes and to the Deputy Chairmen for
substantive and operational purposes. In addition to having general
responsibility for coordination and facilitation of donor assistance to
BAPSDAL, the PHO would have particular responsibility for liaison with the
Bank with respect to management of the proposed project. The PMO staff, most
of which is already in place, includes a donor coordination adviser, two
consultancy assietance officers to work directly with the Deputy Chairmen, an
accountant, an administrative officer and secretarial/clerical staff.
Satisfactory office space has been provided already. The project would
include core financial support for PMO staff, consultants, facilities and
service contracts required for its efficient management, and it is expected
that additional support for the PMO will become available from other donors as
and when needed. Arranoements for the PMO were confirmed at neaotiations and
the emnlovment of the donor coordination adviser, in accordance with Bank
gU3.delines for the use of consultants. will be a condition of loan
effectiveness. Two consultanvg assistance officers, an accountant. and an
administrative officer will be emnolvSd. in accordance with Bank auidelines
for the use of consultants. by §evtember 30. 1992.
Bank Supervision
9.       in view of the range of activities, and the need for flexibility,
individual project activities will be approved and supervised through periodic
consultations between GOT and the Bank. Specific activities would be approved
RSI, which will be responsible for coordinating supervision. Considerable
inputs, however, are likely to be required from Headquarters staff and
consultants, particularly with respect to technical aspects of pollution
control. Such technical staff and consultant expertise will be provided
during the course of supervision, as required. Bank review of planned future
activities will include the procedures proposed for the selection and
retention of consultant services. fareement was reached at nocotiation that

PxoQ ect Cgots and Financing
10.      The overall project cost is estimated at US$15.0 million equivalent
including local taxes estimated at about US$1.2 million equivalent. Detailed
costs for each individual subproject to be financed under the loan cannot be
fully estimated at this time.  However, major cost categories are estimated as
followsa1:
US$ million
(a)  Clarification and strengthening of
BAPEDAL*s mandate                                       1.6
(b) Design and development of pollution
control systems                                        4.1
(c) Establishment and support of regional
agencies and laboratories                              4.7
(d) Design and development of a recruitment
and training program                                   2.0
(e) Mobilization and administration of
external assistance                                     1.9
11.      These cost estimates reflect costs of similar contracts presently
under implementation in Indonesla. The types of consultancy services selected
for financing under the project and the quality of the inputs necessary will
determine the fee and person-month rates to be used, and it is understood that
exceptions to the fee/rate ceilings set by BAPPENAS are likely to be required
on a case-by-case basis for certain pollution control skills that are
particularly expensive on the world market. Allowances have also been made
for price contingencies as follows2 6% on local costs, and 3.7% on foreign
costs, for 1991 and thereafter. The Bank Loan of US$12 million equivalent
would finance about 90% of total estimated project costs, net of taxes and
duties. 90X's share of project costs will mainly be in kind in the form of
counterpart staff and in facilities and services to manage and implement the
project. These are difficult to estimate since, apart from SAPEDAL's own
staff time, services and facilities, the project would draw heavily on staff
time and services from other agencies, including XLH and - especially - the
regional governments.

that model docHMetatiqn. agceotgble to the Bank. will be used for all letters
of invitation and contract". Letters of invitation (LOI) would follow samples
provided in the Handbook on Consulting Services, September 1985, and contracts
would be based on the sample Form of Contracts for Consultants' Services,
March 1989. All contracts will be subject to prior review by the Bank.
13.      The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against 100% of the total
costs of all contracts procured under the project, not of taxes, for
consultant services. In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account
would be opened in tank Indonesia by the Ministry of Finance. The Account
would be maintained in 1S5 and an initial d&posit of US$700,000 (approximately
equivalent to four months estimated average eligible expenditures) would be
made to this Account. Disbursements under the project for contracts below the
value of $100,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of Statoments of
Expenditures (805s). All documentation in respect of SO disbursements will
be maintained in the PRO and will be subject to periodic sample review by the
Bank. All payments for contracts above this threshold would be supported by
full documentation. To the extent possible, all payaents would be channelled
through the Special Account. However, disbursements against expenditures in
respect of contracts involving foreign currency payments could, at GO0
request, also be made under SBRD direct payment procedures, subject to a
minimum of US$100,000 per application. Aaregment was reached at neaoottions
on the abe 2rocurAent and disbursemnt arrangements.
Proiect Renortina. AccoMnts and Audits
14.      The PMO will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports on an
agreed format to the Bank on the status of the project. This report will be
the main instrument for monitoring project accomplishments and will include
the proposed pipeline of future activities, their preparation and approval
status, procurement status of approved activities, and implementation status
of contracted activities.  The PMO will also include in this report the status
of impl emntation of main findings, recommendations and proposed action, etc.
of each activity after completion.
15.      The PMO will maintain separate projects accounts in a form
satisfactory for annual audit. These accounts, including the Special Account,
will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Dank and
will include separate opinions on all expenditures including those made
against 8SOs. The PNO will submit the audited accounts to the Bank not later
than nine months after the close of each fiscal year commencing with FY91/92.
