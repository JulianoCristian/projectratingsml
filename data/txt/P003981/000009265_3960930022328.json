agricultural development\n            by completing and fully developing ongoing small and medium\n            scale irrigation schemes in 13 provinces on the Outer\n            Islands of Indonesia.  A related objective is to assist\n            development of institutional capacity to enable improved\n            coordination of irrigation with agriculture and other\n            related services.  To meet the above objectives, the project\n            will comprise:  (a) a survey, investigations and design; (b)\n            completion of irrigation works on some 130 schemes serving\n            about 273,000 ha, including construction of minor canal and\n            drainage systems and preparation for operation and\n            maintenance (PROM); (c) land clearance and development of\n            about 40,000 ha; (d) agricultural development activities\n            including seed multiplication programs, trials for problem\n            soils and training of farmer groups; (e) land titling and\n            certification; (f) environmental protection, including\n            forest surveys and erosion control; (g) settlement; and (h)\n            coordination and management of irrigated agricultural development."}, "docdt": "1991-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
