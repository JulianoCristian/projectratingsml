Overall, the economic rate of return (ERR) has\n            been re-estimated at 14.2 percent, compared to 17.5 percent\n            at appraisal, obscuring the social and cultural setting,\n            structure and performance of a number of independent\n            irrigation schemes. Half the schemes, in close to\n            three-quarters of the project area, are generating good to\n            excellent rates of return, while an equal number of schemes\n            in one quarter area, only generate marginal to poor rates of\n            return. Thus, a number of key lessons were provided: 1)\n            Complex and centrally managed projects can be successfully\n            implemented through coordination at lower levels of\n            government, where an inter-disciplinary design would\n            encourage cooperation; 2) A sustained integrated approach to\n            implementation may be established through the supervision\n            support from the Bank Resident Mission; 3) Comparative\n            profitability should be considered as a selection criterion;\n            4) Future project design should be adaptable and area\n            specific; 5) The need for developing capacity of local\n            consultants/contractors was specified; 6) Improvement of\n            operation and maintenance is required; and 7) Settlement\n            activities should not have been part of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
