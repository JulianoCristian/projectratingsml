Its basic strategy would be to\n            create this increased capacity on three levels, by: (a)\n            improvements in the organization and operations of the\n            existing national planning and external debt management\n            systems; (b) better definition of policies and investment\n            programs in four key sectors--agriculture, industry, energy\n            and social development; and (c) generating sound projects\n            and improving project management capacity in these sectors.\n            The project would help to promote self-reliance in these\n            areas by stressing training to increase Cameroonian staff\n            skills and experience. The project would include the\n            provision of 24 staff-years of expatriate resident\n            specialists, 320 months of short-term consulting services\n            and related vehicles, office equipment, local staff and\n            operating costs. About one-fifth of Credit funds would\n            finance activities to be identified in agreement with the\n            Association during project implementation which serve\n            project objectives."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
