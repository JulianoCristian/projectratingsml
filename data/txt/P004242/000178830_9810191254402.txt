NATIONAL E LECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
Sixth Power Project
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Sixth Power Project of the National Electricity Board of the
States of Malaya (NEB) consists of transmission lines and substations to
deliver power from the Temengor Hydroelectric Scheme (4 x 87 MW) now under
construction, to the major load centers. About 132.5 miles of 275 kV lines
and associated substations would be built to link up Temengor with NEB's
system at Papan and extend the main system southwards from Port Dickson;
extension of the associated transmission and distribution system and a
control and load dispatching center would also be included. NEB has received
an aggregate of US$139.7 million in five Bank loans since 1958 which will
have helped to finance about 1,010 MW of generating plant additions and
associated transmission lines when the Port Dickson extensions are completed.
The proposed loan would assist NEB in financing the Temengor Scheme and help
raise the total system capacity to 1,409 MW compared to 124 MW at the beginn-
ing of 1963. The projects under previous loans have all been satisfactorily
completed or are now under construction and no significant problems have tirisen
since the beginning of the Bank's association with NEB.
ii.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$68.5
million equivalent of which about US$45.0 million is the foreign exchange
component to be financed under the proposed Bank loan. The local cost com-
ponent of US$23.5 million equivalent is to be financed from NEB's internal
cash generation.
iii.      Malaysia has embarked on a dynamic program to expand the economy.
Steps have been taken to expand agriculture and industry; consequently economic
growth accelerated in the second half of 1972. For 1973, the upswing led to
record performances in almost all sectors of the economy. GNP was 2n% higher
than in 1972 at current prices and per capita GNP exceeded ITS$550. Demand
for power has accelerated in line with the expansion of the economv.
iv.       Responsibility for the power sector rests with three organizatio..-S:
NEB responsible for most of the generation and distribution; the Perak River
Hydroelectric Company Limited responsible for minor generation and distribu.ion
in part of the State of Perak which NEB will take over in 1976; and the Mun-c-
ipal Authority of Penang, responsible for the island of Penang.



- ii -
v.        NEB operates in Peninsular Malaysia and is organized as a modern pub-
lic utility with considerable autonomy; its stock is almost wholly Government-
owned and the directors are appointed by the Minister of Works and Power.
The financial history is good and NEB's present financial position is sound.
About 46% of construction expenditure is expected to be financed from cash
generation in the 7-year period from 1974. A rate of return greater than
8% on net fixed assets in operation is expected throughout the period.
vi.       An expansion program has been prepared by NEB to meet the forecast
growth FY 1974 through 1980. Capital investments are estimated at US$730
million through 1980; the proposed project would account for 10% of this
amount. The program has been developed after comparison of a number of
possible sequences of system development of generation, transmission and
distribution.
vii.      A recent change in the Electricity Act gave NEB power to take part
in electrical equipment and materials manufacturing industries. In view of
the fact that all of the cash generation will be required for construction,
assurances were received during negotiations that NEB will limit its
participation in such industries.
viii.     The project is the only possible means of transmitting power from
the Temengor and Port Dickson plants into NEB's system. Comparison of the
proposed development of the system of which the proposed project is a small
part, with alternative sequences of system expansion showed that the program
proposed is the least cost alternative at discount rates up to 13.0%.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$45.0 million equivalent
for a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
Sixth Power Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Sixth Power Project of the
National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB), for transmission,
distribution and control facilities associated with the Temengor Hydroelectric
Development (4 x 87 MW).
1.02      The project consists of the construction of 275 kV transmission
lines and substations from Temengor to Papan, and from Port Dickson to Malacca,
the extension of the associated transmission and distribution system and the
establishment of a control and load dispatching center.
1.03      The estimated total cost of the Sixth Power Project is M$ 162.4
million (US$68.5 million). The Bank has been asked to finance the foreign
exchange component which is M$ 106.6 million (US$45.0 million) equivalent,
about 66% of the total cost. The local cost component of M$ 55.8 million
(US23.5 million) is to be financed from NEB's internal cash generation.
1.04      The Borrower would be NEB to which the Bank has made five loans
aggregating US$139.7 million. The first loan (210-MA) of US$28.6 million
was made in 1958 for the first stage of the Cameron Highlands Hydroelectric
Scheme. A second loan (350-MA) of US$51.1 million was made in 1963 for the
second stage of the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the first stage of the Prai
Thermal Station and the expansion of transmission facilities. In 1966, a
third loan (458-MA) of US$31.5 million was made for the first stage of the
Port Dickson Thermal Station, the installation of additional generating units
at the Cameron Highlands Scheme, the second stage of the Johore Bahru Thermal
Station and the expansion of transmission facilities. The fourth loan
(579-MA) of US$8.5 million (net of cancellation) was made in 1969 for the
second stage of the Port Dickson and Prai Thermal Stations and for the
expansion of transmission facilities. In 1970, a fifth loan (700-MA) of
US$20.0 million was made for the third stage of the Port Dickson Station
and transmission facilities.
1.05      The projects under the first three loans have been completed and
are operating satisfactorily. The project under the fourth loan was completec
early in 1974 but some minor problems remain to be solved. Under the fiftn,
delays in the manufacture and delivery of equipment have occurred and the
commissioning dates for the first two 120 MW units are estimated to be early
1976 and mid-1976, respectively, about 22 months behind the original schedule.



1.06      The project now proposed is required to transmit the power to
be generated at the Temengor Hydroelectric Development now under con-
struction, to the major load centers. Messrs. K. C. Ling, J. M. Sneddon
and R. V. Sear (Consultant) visited Malaysia in October 1973 to appraise
the project.
II. THE ECONOMY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and its Economy
2.01      Malaysia consists of the penlnsula of Malaya which lies between
Thailand and Singapore, and the States of Sarawak and Sabah on the island of
Borneo. The aggregate area of Malaysia is about 145,000 square miles; in
1973, it had a population of about 11.7 million, growing at a rate of 2.6%
p.a. Per capita GNP exceeded IJS$550.
2.02      The pace of economic growth in Malaysia began to accelerate in
the course of the second half of 1972. The year 1973 was an outstanding
one for the Malaysian economy. The upswing in the business cycle led to
record performances in almost all sectors of thO economy. GNP increased
frow M$ 13.2 billion in 1972 to about M$ 15.9 billion in 1973; a record
increase of more than 20% at current prices.
2.03      Rubber continues to be the main pillat of the Malaysian economy
contributing about 30% of export earnings and 152 of GDP. With the sharp
increase in prices and volume of exports, timber has overtaken tin as
the second largest export earner contributitg 22% of merchandise exports
and 11% of GDP. Tin ranked third representing 13X of merchandise exports
and 6.5% of GDP.  Palm oil has beeome the fourth largest source of export
earnings (7% of merchandise exports and 3% of GDP in 1973).
2.04      Industry is the principal power user, consuming 34.4% of total
energy sales in FY 1973. Commercial use ranked second at 28.6% while
residential users consumed 11.7%. The remainder (25.3%) was used in
bulk supply by other public utilities and mining.
Energy Resources
2.05      Both natural gas and oil have recetitiy been found off the east
coast of the Malay Peninsula and earlier off the cbasts of Sabah and Sarawak.
Production at present is almost 100WOO barrels of oil per day and is expected
to increase to 500,000 barrels in 3 or 4 years, fout times the estimated
total domestic consumption in 1976. Hydroelectric potential is still the
most valuable indigenous energy resource for power, with 293 MW presently
installed.  In 1966, the Canadian Government funded studies of the Temengor
and associated Bersia and Kenering Hydroelectric Schemes by the Shawinigan
Engineering Company (SHENCO), Canada. The first phase of the Temengor Scheme



-3-
(175 MW) to be financed by Japanese, other supplier credits and a loan from
the Commonwealth Development Corporation, is now under construction; the
proposed Bank loan would assist in financing the transmission lines associated
with the project. The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority of Australia
completed a preinvestment study in 1969 on the Pergau Hydroelectric Scheme.
A study is now being made by a group of Russian engineers of the Sungai
Tembeling Scheme.  The Malaysian Government is trying to obtain finance
for technical assistance to make a combined flood control and power
development study of the Trengganu River. Thus the development of hydro
resources is being actively pursued.
The Power Sector
2.06    - Electric power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous
Government-owned entities. The largest of these is NEB which serves
peninsular Malaysia with the exception of Penang Island which is supplied
by a municipally-owned plant, and part of the State of Perak which is supplied
by the privately-owned Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE). The
two states on the island of Borneo are supplied by Government-owned statutory
authorities -- the Sabah Electricity Board and the Sarawak Electricity Supply
Corporation. The present capacity installed by all of these entities is
as follows:
Entity                                   Installed Capacity (MW)
NEB                                                845.0
PEHE                                               142.5
Penang City Council                                 43.3
Sabah Electricity Board                             88.6
Sarawak Electricity Corporation                     54.0
Total             12173.4
In addition, there was a total of 25.5 MW in about 126 diesel plants owned
by small electric companies which supply power to customers on a licensed
basis and 19 MW of privately-owned small diesel units.
Facilities of NEB
2.07      NER's total present generating capacity of 845 MW is made up of
265.4 MW of hydroelectric plant, 540 MW of steam plant and 39.6 MW of diesel
plant. Details of the plants are given in Annex 1. The Nos. 3 and 4 units
at Port Dickson Thermal Station (2 x 60 MW) (Loan 595-MA) are now in commercial
operation and Units Nos. 5, 6, and 7 (3 x 120 MW) (Loan 700-MA) are scheduled
to go into service in 1976. The Temengor plant is scheduled for completion
by early 1978 and will bring NEB's total installed capacity to 1,409 MW and
hydro capacity to 439 MW.



-4-
2.08      Nearly all of NEB's generating capacity supplies the inter-connected
system which covers most of the western side of peninsular Malaysia and
extends from Alor Star in the North to the Southern system around Johore
Bahru (see map). A 132 kV transmission line which will be completed by 1975,
is under construction from the Western system to Kuantan on the east coast
and by 1976 this line would be extended to Pekan and Tg Gelang and by 1978
to Jengka/Jerantut under the project. The transmission lines from Temengor
to Machang, then to Kota Bahru and Kuala Trengganu on the east coast are
scheduled for completion in 1980. Thus the entire peninsula will be inter-
connected and the relatively high-cost isolated diesel stations will be
eliminated.
2.09      IlEB's main transmission system is operated at 275 kV between Port
Dickson and Kuala Lumpur South Substation, a distance of 45 miles. NEB has
also about 585 miles of 132 kV, 311 miles of 66 kV and 549 miles of 33 kV
transmission lines. Distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 11 kV by some
2,349 miles of overhead lines and underground cables as well as by some
214 miles of lines and cables at 6.6 kV, 3.3 kV, and 2.2 kV. Substation
capacity is in excess of 3,489 KVA.
2.10      NEB's system is connected to the PRHE and Penang City Council
systems which are commented on below.
The Perak River Hydroelectric Company (PRHE)
2.11      The Company and its distribution subsidiary generate and distribute
electricity within the concession area in the State of Perak to some 63,431
customers; the bulk of the output is sold to the mining industry. PRHE
is incorporated in the United Kingdom and operates under a concession
granted by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years. The Govern-
ment has decided to exercise its right under the concession agreement
to take the company over in November 1976. Negotiations should start next
year on the settlement to be reached.
2.12      PRHE has a total of 142.5 MW of generating plant of which 27 MW
is hydroelectric and 115.5 MW is steam. 37 MW of the older thermal plant is
soon to be placed on standby so that the company's operating capacity will
be reduced to 105.5 MW by the end of 1974.
2.13      A 20-year contract to purchase power in bulk from NEB was signed
in 1967 under which PRHE was guaranteed 50 MW of maximum demand at a minimum
load factor of 60% by 1969. The company negotiated a revision of this
contract with NEB which increased the supply to 60 MW in 1970 and 110 MW
in 1974 when Port Dickson units 3 and 4 come into service and annual increases
of 10 MW thereafter. The increase in bulk power purchased from NEB results
from the company's decision to phase out some its older generating plant and
not construct any new plants but instead to meet its future power requirements
bv bulk power purchases. This would increase PRHE's purchases from 481 million
kah in FY 1973 to about 910 million in FY 1976.



-5-
Penang City Council
2.14      Special provisions were made in the Electricity Act of 1949 for
the Penang City Council to continue operating its own electricity system
to supply the island of Penang. It has a 40 MW thermal generating station
constructed in 1967, 2.5 MW of old diesel plant and a 0.8 MY hydroelectric
station. The Penang City Council's system is interconnected with the NEB
system by 33 kV and 11 kV submarine cables. The Penang City Council has
decided not to add further generating units to its plant but to take bulk
supply from NEB. It is estimated that Penang's purchases from NEB will
increase tenfold to 66 million kwh by FY 1981.
Power Development Program
2.15      In the future, only NEB will provide generation plant capacity in
Peninsular Malaysia and will in effect supply the entire sector after taking
over PRHE in FY 1976.
2.16      The British Consultants, Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR), in co-
operation with SHENCO, have made a study of NEB's system in which 21 alter-
native sequences of system development were compared. The results of the
study show that the Temengor Hydro Development (4 x 87 MW) followed by the
extension of Prai Thermal Power Station (3 x 120 MW) is the least cost
solution. A further system study is now being undertaken to define the
program of system development after 1981.
2.17      NEB's expansion program which is firm up to 1981 includes the
following:
(a) completion of the works now under construction under
Loan 700-MA (Port Dickson Stage III - 3 x 120 MW);
(b) construction of the Temengor Hydroelectric Development
with an initial installation of two 87 MW generating
units scheduled early in 1978 including provision for
the addition of two further generating units each rated
at 87 MW;
(c) extension of the Prai Thermal Power Station by installing
three additional 120 MW generating units, to be brought
into service in 1979, 1980 and 1981, respectively;
(d) expansion of transmission, distribution and control facilities;
and
(e) further studies and optimization of other hydroelectric
schemes and thermal power stations beyond 1982.



-6-
Rural Electrification
2.18      Rural electrification in Malaysia started in 1957.  Up to August
31, 1972, 1,765 villages with a total of 149,372 customers had been supplied
with electricity. The program is carried out by the extension of already
established distribution areas into the surrounding countryside and by
the construction of small diesel stations, some of which operate on a
12-hour basis. NEB now operates 69 rural stations with a total capacity
of 2,168.5 kW. Finance is provided one-third each by the Federal Govern-
ment, the appropriate State Government and NEB. Project costs for calculating
Government and State contributions include estimated operating losses for
the first 7 years.  In its Second Malaysia Plan 1971-1975, the Government
decided to accelerate the rural electrification program by increasing
its contribution from M$ 15 million to M$ 25 million over the five-year
period. Consequently, projects originally scheduled for 1972 through 1975
were completed during 1973 and new projects were added for 1973, 1974 and
1975. In the first 3 years of the plan period 807 villages covering about
53,000 consumers were electrified; about 50C more villages with 35,0oo
consumers are expected to be supplied before the end of the period In 1975,
representing 17% of the entire rural electrification program since 1957.
The speed of the program is governed by the allocation of funds from the
State Government budgets as NEB meets all requests for extension on the
basis outlined. The program is small relative to NEB's overall operations
and it has no significant influence on NEB's financial position.
III. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be NEB which was established in 1949 by the
Government under the provisions of the Electricity Act enacted that year
and which has developed into a financially sound, well-organized and operated
utility.
3.02      NEB is organized and functions as a modern public utility corpora-
tion with a considerable degree of autonomy. It is both a regulatory and
operating agency, charged with the operation of the electric installations
under its jurisdiction and the establishment of such new facilities as may
be required. It regulates the production and use of electric energy in West
Malaysia and grants licences for the installation and operation of independent
electricity works to be used for public or private purposes. NEB has the
power to set its tariffs (see para 3.08).
3.03      The Board of Directors of NEB consists of a Chairman, Deputy
Chairman and not more than 10 nor less than 5 other members. At present
there are ten members, all of whom serve in a part-time capacity, with the
exception of the Deputy Chairman who is also the General Manager. Members
are appointed by the Minister of Works and Power, subject to terms and condi-
tions he may determine. The present Chairman who is currently the Chief
Secretary of the Government, was newly appointed last year.  The present
members are prominent in the political, labor and business communities.



-7-
Management and S'taff
3.04      During the past threet years NEB has been moving towards a reorgani-
zation of its management structure. Consultants were engaged to assist taking
into account the Government's directive to provide more equitable distribution
of job opportunities among the different races. The principal proposed changes
at the Deputy General Manager level were agreed by the Bank in 1972. Board
approval of the staffing plan for new departments was given in late 1973.
The actual moves of personnel are being made gradually over a period of
months. The reorganization is likely to cause some internal stresses, at
least for a year or so, as the staff becomes accustomed to it and settles
down.   Although only 400 out of a total employment of 10,000 will be affected,
these are of necessity at the higher levels. The new organization chart is
shown in Annex 2.
3.05      Previous loan agreements contained an undertaking that the Bank would
be consulted before appointments were made to the positions of General Manager,
Deputy General Manager or Financial Controller. The undertaking has been
continued for the proposed loan, suitably amended by dropping the position
of Deputy General Manager, as three were created by the reorganization and it
would have been unreasonable for the Bank to insist on consultation about
each appointment.
3.06      The present General Manager is scheduled to retire during 1974 and
the Deputy General Manager, Administration and Management Development has
been nominated to take over; when asked the Bank should concur with this
appointment.
Consultants
3.07      In the past, NEB used consultants to make engineering and manage-
ment studies and for design, procurement and supervision of construction.
The arrangement and performance have generally been satisfactory. Recently
NEB began to use its own staff to design and supervise the construction of
small thermal units (the sixth unit at Johore Bahru Thermal Power Station of
30 MW) and 66 kV and 132 kV transmission lines and intends to undertake the
design and engineering of the Prai extension. Consultants would review the
work and provide the expertise in those areas not covered by NEB staff ex-
perience. PCR, the Board's Consultants for thermal stations until now, consider
such an arrangement feasible and welcome.  The Bank should not object, sub3ec~
to approval of the scope of the work to be performed by NEB and the con-
sultants.
Tariffs
3.08      Under the Electricity Act, NEB has the power to fix tariffs
without reference to any other authority. In practice the Minister of
Works and Power is consulted and he has the right to give directions of a
general character not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. These



- 8 -
provide that total revenues must be sufficient to meet total costs properly
chargeable to revenue including depreciation and interest. This is regarded
as determining the minimum level of tariffs. NEB's stated policy is to
produce a return on its average net fixed assets in operation of at least
8Z per annum and to finance at least 40% of construction costs out of
internal resources. In the past, NEB's internal cash generation has finan-
ced over 60% of the expansion program but this situation will change due
to accelerated load growth and the expanded construction program, considerable
increases in construction costs and the need for increased working capital.
Consequently, greater reliance will have to be placed on borrowings.
3.09      Tariffs have not been revised since 1964 and are therefore not
related to NEB's current costs of system operation in view of the changes
which have occurred since then. NEB engaged Electrowatt of Zurich as Con-
sultants to review tariffs in 1972. A draft report recommending a simplified
tariff structure to produce the same revenue was submitted in August 1973
which is under consideration by Government and NEB. Since the consultants'
tariff study did not investigate the cost of supplying different categories
of consumers, agreement was reached during negotiations and the proposed
loan agreement provides that the Bank would be consulted on any tariff changes
before they were promulgated.
Taxation
3.10      NEB is liable to pay corporation and development taxes, the same
as any other corporation. Corporation tax is levied at a rate of 40% of tax-
able income and development tax ar 5% of gross income. In addition, NEB
normally has to pay import duties, a fuel tax of M$ 17.0 per ton and a surtax
of 2% on imports but has been exempted from these dduties for FY 1974. (See
para 6.08).
Accounting and Audit
3.11      NEB has an efficient accounting organization but experiences some
difficulty in finding qualified staf, although this has not hindered opera-
tions. NEB began to transfer its accounting system to a corputer about
three years ago and the transfer is expected to be completed shortly. A com-
puter based billing system is now being tested in parallel with the present
system and should be operational for parts of the Kuala Lumpur area during
1974.
3.12      Since the establishment of NEB, Price Waterhouse and Company have
been the auditors. Besides carrying out the annual audit, they have advised
on accounting methods and procedures from time to time. A local firm of
accountants, Hanafiah, Raslan, Mahomad and Partners are appointed by the
Board to audit NEB's isolated stations. During negotiations assurances were
received that NEB will continue to employ independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank.



-9-
Insurance
3.13      An existing covenant, requiring NEB to maintain reasonable insurance
coverage has been followed. This covenant is repeated in the agreement for
the proposed loan.
Industrial Participation
3.14      The Government promotes small industry and is presently interested
in establishing local manufacturing capability in electrical meters, paper-
insulated lead-sheathed cable, medium voltage distribution transformers antd
switchgear. NEB would be the sole or major customer for such items during
the early years. Its experience indicates that in such situations it is
forced to purchase at much higher than international prices, that quality
is not always up to standard and that deliveries are often late. In hope of
reducing such risks NEB has therefore decided with Government concurrence to
enter into joint financing arrangements to establish the necessary manufac-
turing plants. Its participation would be at the Board of Directors level,
with the foreign partner providing day-to-day management.
3.15      Rough estimates of the materials and equipment to be manufactured to
satisfy NEB's requirements indicate that the total investment required is un-
likely to exceed M$25.0 million (US$11 million). Provision has been made
for about 50% of this amount in the financing plan as NEB intends to take
a half share in each enterprise. NEB's share is small in relation to its
overall program and well within its capability. A covenant is included in
the loan agreement providing for the Bank's concurrence to any industrial
participation by NEB when these exceed M$25.0 million.
Training
3.16      NEB has a comprehensive staff training program which is run by its
own Education and Training Department. Since 1960, 362 engineering scholar-
ships have been sponsored at overseas universities, mostly in Australia and
UK; of these, 132 have so far graduated. In addition to scholarships at the
college level, NEB has an apprenticeship scheme for technical staff and a
training center is being planned on a 200-acre site at Bangi next to the
Public Works Department's proposed training center. In-house courses are
run to train supervisors and others in modern techniques of supervision arid
methods of work. Senior personnel attend overseas seminars and others are
sent abroad for post-graduate study.
IV. THE PROJECT
Temengor Ilydro-electric Development
4.01      The Temengor Hydro-electric Development, which is now under con-
struction on the Upper Perak River in the State of Perak, was the outcome
of preliminary studies initiated in 1960 under a Canadian contribution to



- 10 -
the Colombo Plan. SHENCO of Canada, financed from a CIDA loan to NEB, pro-
duced a Feasibility Report in 1966; in 1971, NEB decided to proceed with
the project. The Bank had agreed with the Government of Malaysia to consider
financing the foreign cost of the civil works if bids and financing offers,
comparable with Bank terms, were not forthcoming from bilateral or other
sources. In the event, agreement could not be reached on the method of bid
evaluation for the civil works contract and the Bank's offer was withdrawn
by mutual consent. Earlier this year the contract was awarded to a Japanese
contractor after international competitive bidding; it will be financed
from an OECF loan. Canada has also made a soft loan available which may be
used to finance the electrical and mechanical equipment for the power
station. It had always been envisaged that the Bank would finance trans-
mission lines, if not called upon to finance the civil works, and this is
the Bank role now proposed.
4.02      rhe Temengor Hydro-electric Development consists of a rock-fill
dam approximately 375 feet high which will create a reservoir of 4.6 million
acre-feet in gross storage capacity, a power intake leading to four power
tunnels and penstocks, an outdoor powerhouse containing four 87 MI turbo-
generating units ultimately and a switchboard to control the outgoing lines.
Its average annual energy output will be about 908 million kwh. Flood
control and downstream irrigation benefits will also result. The total cost
is estimated at US$101 million. The access road has already been completed.
The Project
4.03      The proposed project will transmit Temengor output to the major
load centers of NEB's interconnected network. It will consist of:
(a) construction and installation of 275 kV transmission lines
from Temengor to Papan to link Temengor with NEB's system
and from Port Dickson to Malacca to extend the main system
southward and associated substations at the Papan and
Malacca terminals of these lines;
(b) extension of the associated transmission and distribution
system;
(c) establishment of a control and load dispatching center; and
(d)  consulting services for system and other studies.
275 KV Transmission Lines and Substations - Temengor-Papan
4.04      The Temengor Power Station will be interconnected with the Western
Networ! by means of a double circuit 275 kV transmission line with duplex
300 mm ACSR conductors terminating at Papan. The route length will be
approximately 94 miles. At Papan a 275 kV double busbar switchyard will be
established with two feeder bays equipped with 275 kV 7500 MVA switchgear.
In addition two 180 MVA 275/132 kV interbus transformers with associated
275 kV and 132 kV switchgear will be supplied to interconnect with the
132 kV system.



- 11 -
4.05      According to recommendations made by SHENCO, a single-pole reclosing
system will be used in line protection. Due to their sophisticated nature
the characteristics of certain critical relays must be specified and these
can only be supplied by a limited number of manufacturers whose products have
given proven performance in similar protection schemes. Since the protection
equipment at the Papan terminal must match that at the Temengor terminal, it
is proposed that it will be purchased without international bidding. The
estimated cost is about US$35,000.
275 KV Transmission Lines and Substations - Port Dickson - Malacca
4.06      'his line would form part of the link between the Central and the
Southern Networks. 2It will be designed for double circuit 275 kV construction
using duplex 300 mm ACSR conductors per phase, to be operated initially at
132 kV. The route length will be approximately 38.5 miles. During the
period when the line will be operating at 132 kV (1976 to 1980), the Port
Dickson end of the line will be terminated at two 132 kV double busbar feeder
switchgear bays originally used for the termination of the Port Dickson to
Kuala Lumpur South double circuit line which has been converted to 275 kV
operation. When the Port Dickson to Malacca line is changed to 275 kV opera-
tion in 1980 it will be necessary to equip two additional double busbar feeder
switchgear bays in the 275 kV switchyard. The requirements at Malacca are:
(a) a 132 kV substation to marshall the new incoming
line from Port Dickson, 132 kV reinforcement to
the south, and interconnection with the existing
66 kV system; and
(b) interbus transformers between the 132 kV and 66 kV
switchyards.
Associated Transmission and Distribution System
4.07      In order to transmit power generated by Temengor and other newly-
added plants to the ultimate consumers, the transmission and distribution
system should also be improved and extended. Some lines of higher priority
have already been carried out by NEB out of its own internal cash generation.
The following lines with terminal equipment are proposed to be included in
this loan:

Load Dispatching Center
4.08      NEB is planning to esta,blish a new load dispatching center for
service in 1977. This is urgentlvr required to operate the larger system
now being constructed and envisaged for the next 10-15 years. Temengor
will be operated as the master reservoir of the system. The new load dis-
patching center will be able to achieve maximum economy and flexibility
of operation of this mixed hydro and thermal system. The new load dispatching
center will be housed in the 8-storey head office extension building in
Kuala Lumpur. The tele-control system will consist of a master controller
comprising duplicated process computers, backup stores and highway change-over
system; computer peripherals; switching micro board and control desks.
Cost estimate
4.09      The cost estimate is based on known costs of similar works completed
or being constructed under previous Bank loans, after allowing for increases
in materials and equipment costs and field conditions. Physical contingencies
of about 10% for overhead lines and 7% for substations are considered adequate.
Price contingencies of 11% for 1975 and 7.5X 1976 through 1979 have been included
to cover escalation during construction. The estimate is summarized below.
(A detailed cost estimate is given in Annexes 3 and 4):

Engineering and Construction
4.10      Engineering studies and specification preparation for the 275 kV
lines were started by PCR in 1973 to enable tenders to be called in the first
half of 1974 and awards to be made in the late part of 1974 after loan signing.
Manufacture, construction and commissioning will take about 33 months;
completion is scheduled for 1977 to coordinate with the target commissioning
date of the first Temengor unit. PCR will be responsible for bidding documents
and supervision of construction. Construction will be by contractors.
4.11      Specification preparation, procurement and construction supervision
for associated transmission and distribution system will be done by NEBts
own staff, which has had previous experience of similar work and are quite
capable of handling these jobs by themselves.
4.12      PCR in association with the Central Electricity Generating Board
of England is assisting NEB in the layout of the control system and prepara-
tion of bidding documents for the load dispatching center.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      The equipment and materials to be financed under the proposed loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines with the exception of the line pro-
tection system mentioned in paragraph 4.05.



- 14 -
4.14      No expenditures are expected to be incurred before the loan is
signed. Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be made against
1OO2 c.i.f. cost of directly imported equipment and materials, 100Z of total
expenditures ex-factory for equipment and materials manufactured locally,
and 70% of total expenditures for imported equipment and materials procured
locally. An estimated schedule of loan disbursements is shown in Annex 5.
Ecology
4.15      The project will not impose any environmental problems as the
transmission lines pass mostly through rural areas; the substations do not
cause pollution and are generally located outside the towns.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Power Market
5.01      The power market served by NEB has had a long history of steady
and substantial growth with a 16% average annual increase in total sales
from FY 1963 through 1969, thereafter the growth rate was 12% in FY 1970, 10%
in FY 1971, 15% in FY 1972, and 14% in FY 1973.   Energy sales for the next
ten years are expected to increase at an average around 13% per annum, 22%
in FY 1975 then gradually levelling off to 10% by FY 1983. Annex 6 shows
the actual and forecast sales of energy. The system maximum demand in FY 1973
was 536 MW. It is estimated at 1900 MW by FY 1983. Annexes 7 and 8 give
a tabulation and chart of the system's peak demand and capability available
to meet the demand.
Least Cost Solution
5;02      NEB's consultants have made extensive studies of the generation
and transmission expansion and have demonstrated that the proposed sequence
of development is the least cost solution to meet the load requirement
up to 1981. It includes the Temengor Hydroelectric Development, the Prai
Thermal Power Station extension and the associated transmission facilities
(see para. 2.17). The transmission lines proposed are the only possible
ways of transmitting the power generated from the Temengor and Port Dickson
plants to the major load centers. Previous studies led to the decision that
the main transmission voltage would be 275 kV in future. Transmission voltage
has already been operated at 275 kV for the section from Port Dickson Thermal
Power Station to Kuala Lumpur South Substation. The sections from Kuala
Lumpur South to Rawang and Woh to Papan are now under construction at 275 kV,
financed under Loan 700-MA. Conductor size has been optimized by bringing
the annual costs and annual power losses to a minimum. The voltage selected
for the Port Dickson to Malacca line was also the result of an economic com-
parison between 275 kV and 132 kV.



- 15 -
Rate of Return
5.03      There is no meaningful way to determine a return on the transmission
and distribution system investment herein proposed as without such investment
the entire work of the Temengor hydro development would be wasted. However,
the adopted sequence of development including generation and transmission
(para 2.17) was found preferable to any other sequence at discount rates us
to 13%. These studies, which were made before oil costs began to soar,
undoubtedly understate the value of the development sequence now underway.
No separate rate of return has been estimated for the project because there
is no way of identifying the portion of system revenues properly attributable
to the sections of the transmission and distribution system involved.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Results and Financial Position
6.01      Policies followed by Government and NEB have enabled the Board's
management to maintain a sound financial position. Since FY 1966 the rate
of return on reasonably valued average net fixed assets in operation has
varied between 8.8% (1969) and 11% (1967); the rate of return was 12.1% for
FY 1973. Debt service coverage on an annual basis was 2.6 times (1973) and
the debt/equity ratio fell from 61/39 in FY 1966 to 45/55 in FY 1973 indicat-
ing a satisfactory capital structure; the current ratio of 1.6 (1973) was
adequate. Local construction costs have been wholly met from internal cash
generation since FY 1966 as have portions of the foreign costs, together
aggregating to about 60% of total investment in plant and facilities. Income
Statements and Balance Sheets for FY 1966 through 1972 are shown in Annexes
9 and 10.
Financial Forecasts
6.02      NEB's financial forecasts show that contributions to construction
will not continue at the high level of 60% achieved in the past; a contribu-
tion of 46% is estimated for the period FY 1974 through 1980. Although
the Malaysian dollar has been revalued upwards by about 20% against the
US dollar since currency parities began changing in 1971, increased equipment
and construction costs and acceleration of the construction program will
combine to render the internal cash generation just sufficient to meet loci-
costs and provide adequate working capital. Detailed Sources and Applications
of Funds Statements FY 1974 through 1980 are shown in Annex 11.
6.03      Measures have been taken to minimize cash requirements to maintain
the past sound financial position. The measures were:
(a) to postpone some projects; and
(b) to eliminate others which although desirable, were
not essential.

6.05      The proposed Bank loan of US$45 million equivalent would cover about
66% of project cost. The balance of US$24 million equivalent (34%) for local
c08tS would be financed from retained earnings. The project represents 10%
of NEB's 1974-80 capital expenditure program, as shown above. The detailed
capital expenditure program (1973-80) is shown in Annex 12.
6.06      Finance has been arranged for the greater part of the M$ 231 million
Temengor project. Although firm arrangements have not yet been made to finance
the foreign cost of the electrical and mechanical equipment, no difficulty is
anticipated in arranging suppliers credits for the items involved.  The project
will be financed 1/ by a loan from the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) of M$ 114 million (49%) covering the foreign and part of the
local cost of the civil works; a loan of M$ 29 million (13%) from the British
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) to cover local costs; a loan from
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) of M$ 7 million (3%) to
cover engineering and supervision costs; assumed suppliers credits of M$ 34
million (14%) for electrical and mechanical equipment; the remainder, M$ 47
million (21%) would come from NEB's internal cash generation.
Future Operating Results
General
6.07      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 3,145 GWh in FY 1973
to 7,757 GWh in FY 1980, an average annual growth rate of about 14%. Demand
is assumed to remain relatively inelastic to rising oil prices.   Revenue
per kwh is forecast to average about M4 9.0 (US43.8) during the forecast
period.   Revenues are forecast to increase from M$ 237 million in FY 1973
to M$ 805 milion in FY 1980, an average annual growth rate of 19%; operating
expenses are forecast to increase at an average growth rate of 23% indicating
that a tariff increase may become necessary later in the decade. Income
Statements FY 1973 through 1980 are shown in Annex 13.
6.08      Although NEB's tariffs contain a fuel variation clause which
enables energy charges to be increased or decreased during any month when
the cost of fuel is higher or lower than a given base price, Government, as
part of its price control policy to combat inflation, has kept electricity
tariffs including fuel surcharges, at the levels that prevailed before the
fuel crisis. Government has so far persuaded the oil companies (Shell and Esso)
to honor the existing fuel contract for NEB's main thermal station which
expires in 1978 and has exempted NEB from customs duties for FY 1974. (see
Annex 16 for fuel prices). The position will be reviewed about the end of
FY 1974 when a decision will be taken whether or not fuel price increases
are to be passed on to consumers. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that irrespective of the decision taken, NEB will earn the minimum 8/
rate of return required by current loan agreements and that any finance gas

would be covered by Government (about M$ 270 million FY 1975 through 1980 if
the minimum rate of return is earned). The financial projections are based on
the assumption that 100Z of past and future fuel price increases will be
recovered from the second quarter of FY 1975 onwards.
Rate of Return
6.09      Except for FY 1974 when the tariff fuel surcharge will not be
applied, the rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation is
estimated to be lowett in FY 1979 (9.4%); for all other years through FY 1980
it is estimated to exceed 11X. Currently the rate of return covenant with
the Bank provides for 8% and it was agreed in negotiation that this be
repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
Debt/Equity
6.10      NEB's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period. Cash generation will cover requirements and maintain an
acceptable debt/equity ratio of about 46/54. Balance Sheets PY 1973 through
1980 are given in Annex 14.
Operating Ratio
6.11      An upward trend from 67% (1973) to 802 (1980), is forecast for
the operating ratio, again indicating that tariff revision may become
necessary during the last ye&rs of the forecast period.
Current Ratio
6.12      The current ratio has varied in the past between 0.7 (1966) and
1.8 (1971). Consumers receivables have been about 1-1/2 motiths revenue and
are estimated to continue at this level through FY 1980. Other receivables
have been forecast to remain at about the FY 1973 level. Inventory levels
are adequate at about 3.5% of gross plant and are forecast to be maintained
at this level throughout the forecast period. Year end cash requirements
are forecast to increase to a maximum of about M$ 20 million in FY 1980 and
although not covered in each of the forecast years, overdraft facilities
are available to meet any emergency need for funds which may arise in day-to-
day operations. The current loan agreement limits short-term borrowing to
MS 10 million; in order to cover possible short-term cash requirements and
in view of the increased size of NEB's operations, the proposed loan agreement
provides that this limit be increased to M$ 20 million.
Debt Control
6.13      Long-term debt outstanding at end of FY 1973 has been valued at
the currency exchange rates that prevailed when loans were drawn. Revaluation
of outstanding loans at rates of exchange ruling on August 31, 1973 would
result in a gain on revaluation of M$ 12.4 million. Debt service coverage
on an annual basis will be greater than 2.0 times for all years through FY 1980.



- 19 -
The current debt control covenant provides that, except as the Bank and the
Borrower shall otherwise agree, internal cash generation of the past fiscal
year or a later 12-month period prior to the incurrence of such debt, shall
not be less than 1.5 times future maximum debt service on all debt drawn down.
Coverage on this basis would vary between 1.5 (1974) and 2.1 (1976) times
during the forecast period and was 1.8 times for FY 1973. This covenant is
repeated in the proposed loan agreement. Debt statements are shown in Annex
15.
Debtors
6.14      NEB has no consumers in serious arrears.  NEB takes deposits from
consumers as security for outstanding bills and these amounted to M$ 24
million at end FY 1973. In addition, bank guarantees were held for M$ 15
million against consumers accounts which, together with deposits, exceeded
consumers outstandings and unbilled energy by about M$ 4 million.  Consumers
deposits at the year-end have been about 1O.5Z of electricity revenue in
the recent past and deposits have been forecast at this level for each year
of the forecast period.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points and appropriate covenants included in the agreement for the proposed
loan:
(a) tariff changes (para 3.09);
(b)  industrial participation (para 3.15);
(c)  rate of return (para 6.09); and
(d)  short-term borrowing (para 6.12).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$45 million
equivalent, to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya for
a period of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

ASSUMPTIONS IN FINANCIAL FORECASTS
1. Revenue
Bulk supply to the PRME area has been projected on the basis of the
current contract. The fuel variation charge on tariffs has been assuned to
apply to all areas of Western Malaysia, recovering about 100% of projected
fuel cost increases excluding FY 1975 when about 75% is recouped, and has
been projected at the following rates:
Fiscal Years       1974      1975     1976     1977     1978     1979      1'980
Average M¢/kWh        0      1.6       2.0      1.1      1.1       3.4      3.4
2. Fuel Costs
Fuel oil prices from January 1974 have been estimated as follows:
(a) M$47.00 per ton for Port Dickson Power Station
through FY 1978 and at M$215.00 per ton there-
after;
(b) M$215.00 per ton for other thermal power
stations;
(c) M$235.00 per ton for heavy fuel oil;
(d) M$1.20 per gallon for low speed light diesel
oil; and
(e)  M$1.35 per gallon for high speed light diesel
oil.
3. Relief from Customs and Other Duties
Exemption from fuel oil duties, customs duty, surtax and sales tax
for FY 1974.
4. Operation, Maintenance and Administration
The forecast of operation, maintenance and administration costs _s
based on a detailed analysis of cost per kWh sold by each station at the end
of 1973.
5. Depreciation
NEB's depreciation is based on the straight-line method and averages
annually about 3.8% of gross plant in operation.

6. Corporation Tax
NEB is liable to pay about 40g of annual net profit adjusted in
accordante with the Tax Ordinance, as Corporation Tax. The amount varies
substantially each year due to the effect of accelerated depreciation
allowances given by the Tax Ordinance on the commissioning of plant.

NEB's projected borrowings are assumed on the followirng terms:
(i)    the proposed IBRD loan of M$107 million (US$45
million equivalent) assumed to be at 7.25% for
a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace;
(ii)   balances to be clrawn on IBRD Loans 579-MA1 and
700-14A amounting to M$38 million (US$16 million)

Cooperation Fund of M$114 million (US$48 million)
at 3V for 20 years including 7 years of grace;

Development Coroporation of M$29 million
(Us$12 million) at 74 for 23 years including 5
years of grace;

to meet foreign costs of future projects at 74
interest for terms of 20 to 25 years including up to
6 years of grace; and
