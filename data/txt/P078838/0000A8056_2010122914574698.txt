                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The first project development objective (PDO) will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the monetary authorities to improve the design and
                         implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The FTAL will achieve this objective by helping the Central Bank to define a strategy to re-capitalize the Central
                         Bank in view of the large quasi-fiscal deficit it is incurring as a result of the banking crisis management; by developing the monetary and financial regulations to
                         be issued by the Monetary Board required by the recently approved LMF and; by helping the Ministry of Finance to implement an efficient debt management
                         strategy. The second PDO will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial regulatory agencies to reduce risks and increase efficiency,
                         transparency and accountability of financial activities. The FTAL will achieve this objective by strengthening the institutional capacity of the Banking, Securities,
                         Insurance and Pension Superintendencies, with particular emphasis in the institutional development of the Superintendency of Banks and; by modernizing the
                         financial infrastructure, particularly the country's payments and securities settlement systems. While the restructuring of the project did not contemplate
                         changes in the project's development objectives, it has to be noted that the Superintendence of Insurance will not continue participating in the program, as the
                         government has requested that the funds assigned to the Superintendence if Insurance be reassigned equally among the other implementing agencies.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No
