development objective\n            will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of\n            the monetary authorities to improve the design and\n            implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The project\n            has the following ten components. Component 1) the Central\n            Bank has generated an important quasi-fiscal deficit as a\n            result of the banking crisis management. Component 2) focus\n            on the areas of IT auditing function, external audits\n            accountability, institutional strengthening, implementation\n            of risk-focused supervision and full implementation of the\n            off-site manual. Component 3) seeks to support a gradual\n            development of the market through two major elements\n            focusing on securities markets, and government debt\n            management and fixed income markets. Component 4) will\n            include review and update of the legislation; implementation\n            of risk-based supervision; procurement of IT systems.\n            Component 5) focuses on five areas where institutional\n            capacity would be needed in the medium term: strategic\n            planning, institutional development, human resource and IT\n            and implementation; establishment of appropriate technical\n            and regulatory framework for survivor and disability\n            benefits; investment policy advice on appropriate\n            regulations and linkages to other capital market reforms;\n            training of supervisory staff and; creation of database and\n            production of periodic reports in coordination with other\n            agencies. Component 6) will support a comprehensive reform\n            of the payments system, including the launch of safer and\n            more efficient systems and an improved legal and oversight\n            framework. Component 7) regulatory developments of the\n            Monetary and Financial Law (LMF) include bank resolution and\n            deposit insurance, penalties, consolidated supervision,\n            capital adequacy, fit-and-proper criteria for bank managers\n            and directors, loan classification and provisioning rules,\n            adoption of market risk criteria, limits and enforcement of\n            credit to related parties, adoption of best practices for\n            corporate governance and strengthening of the bank's\n            internal controls. Component 8) A draft law intended to\n            change the functioning of the Ministry of Finance is\n            currently being discussed in Congress. Component 9)\n            Contingencies that could occur from an intensification of\n            the banking crisis. Component 10) Financial Statements\n            Audit.
