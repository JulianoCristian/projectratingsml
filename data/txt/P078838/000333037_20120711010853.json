"Ratings for the Financial Sector\n            Technical Assistance Loan (FSTAL) Project for Dominican\n            Republic were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: during difficult times and when\n            there is limited implementation capacity it is important to\n            keep the design of a project simple even if the project is\n            smaller. This project was too complex with multiple\n            implementing agencies. Given the limited experience with\n            financial sector operations in the Dominican Republic the\n            FSTAL should have been structured as a simple project with\n            clean implementation arrangements or alternatively with a\n            longer execution period and a phased approach, in which\n            triggers will be established for each phase of\n            implementation. If successful, a follow up operation or\n            phases of a longer duration project could have maintained\n            the continuity of institutional support while being more\n            responsive to changing technical assistance (TA) needs over\n            time. The best indicator of project sustainability is\n            borrower engagement in follow-up operations. The FSTAL tried\n            to address too many challenges in the financial system but\n            it should have been more selective particularly with the\n            high degree of uncertainty at the time of project design."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
