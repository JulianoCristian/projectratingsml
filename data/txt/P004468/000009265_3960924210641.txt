FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LN. 1661-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Highway
Project, for which Loan 1661-PH was approved on March 6, 1979 for the sum
of US$100.0 million. Loan closing was originally scheduled for December
31, 1983, but was extended to June 30, 1987. An amount of US$0.4 million
was cancelled and the last disbursement took place on January 21, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Country Department II, of the Asia Regional Office and is bused on a draft
report prepared by the Department of Public Works and Highways; the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 3, 1989, for comments by
August 21, 1989, but none were received.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1661-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SIMAY
Introduction
1.    Despite significant expansion of the Philippit.e road network during the
1970s, the overall condition of the country's roads was poor throughout the
decade. This reflected the concentration of government resources on road
construction at the expense of maintenance as well as the effects of
inappropriate initial design and construction. The Fourth Highway Project was
therefore directed at building up the maintenance capabilities of the Ministry
of Public Highways (MPH) by supporting a Highway Maintenance Program and
providing financing for the procurement of much-needed maintenance equipment
and spare parts, workshop machinery, tools and equipment, as well as the
construction of workshops throughout the country.   This was complemented by
programs of highway construction/improvement and road restoration to return
badly deteriorated roads to maintainable condition and by technical assistance
and training to help develop improved maintenance procedures and to equip local
staff to carry out their duties more effectively.   Project maintenance and
restoration activities comprised the second part of a five-year Program which
was based on the findings of a study financed under the Second Highway Project
(Loan 950-PH) and begun under the Third Highway Project (Loan 1353-PH).  The
construction/improvement program included ten national road sections totaling
about 365 km and seven feeder road sections totaling 73 km.
Objectives
2.    The major project objectives were to provide improved transport services
to the rural population through reconstruction, restoration and maintenance of
deteriorated national and connecting feeder roads; to upgrade maintenance
procedures and operations for national and secondary roads; to train MPH staff
to  carry  out  their  assigned  tasks;  and  to  strengthen  the  planning,
administrative, engineering and maintenance capabilities of provincial highway
authorities.   The project loan for US$100 million was approved on March 6,
1979.
_Implementation Experience
3.    Project implementation was severely delayed by almost four years.  In the
early project period,  the major delays were caused bv:  (a)  lengthy and
cumbersome MPH contractor prequalification procedures that delayed bidding and
award of contracts for construction/improvement works by 14 months; (b) delayed
completion of the first phase of the road maintenance and restoration program
under the Third Highway Project, which put off the start of the program's
second phase under this project; and (c) slow selection of consultants for
technical assistance.
4.    Implementation improved in the early 1980s as a result of two 12-month
action programs agreed with the Bank but suffered further delays in 1984 due to
cutbacks in local counterpart funding as the Government sought to decrease the
mounting public sector deficit.  At the same time, contractors were faced with
50-60% increases in prices for construction materials (following devaluation of
the peso in October 1983   i   ,1984)              t           1

limited to only 30%. Continued high interest rates and tight credit conditions
aggravated the contractors' problems, and works slowed or stopped altogether.
The small local contractors responsible for project vorkshop construction were
particularly affected by this situation and implementation of that component
came to a standstill.   While conditions began to normalize in 1985,  the
political events of 1986 and funding shortages throughout this period made
implementation difficult. However, by the time of loan closing on Jine 30,
1987, the project was substantially finished, with the exception of six
workshops which were completed by force account and financed by the Government.
Results
5.    Although project civil works suffered from long delays, the quality of
work, when finally completed, was generally good. Procurement of maintenance
and workshop equipment was largely problem-free, and training and technical
assistance provided under the project strengthened capabilities in a variety of
areas. Technical experts engaged for the project were particularly effective
in helping MPWH develop an improved maintenance management system which was
tested in four pilot areas and subsequently introduced countrywide.
6.    The total project cost was USS193.7 million, about 5% lower than the
appraisal estimate of US$205.0 million due to the devaluation of the peso which
offset the effects of higher average construction costs. From an exchange rate
of P 7.40 to the dollar in 1979, the peso sank to an average of P 14.86 to the
dollar during 198C-87.   At the same time, actual construction costs for
national and feeder roads were 54% and 50% higher than expected. The Bank loan
financed all foreign exchange costs related tc the project, while the
Government financed all local costs.
7.    Due to the implementation delays, loan closing was extended from December
31, 1983 until June 30, 1987.   Since devaluation of the peso would have
resulted in a large surplus of undisbursed loan funds, the Bank approved two
Special Action  Programs  in 1983 and  1985 to accelerate  disbursement  by
increasing the percentage of civil works expenditures financed under the loan.
As a result, only US$400,000 of the loan remained undisbursed at loan closing.
8.    Economic returns from project investments were generally satisfactory.
Actual rates of return for the national roads constructed/improved under the
project ranged from about 9% to 32%, and averaged 20%. Considering the much
higher than expected construction costs, this compares favorably with the
average 25% return expected at appraisal.
SustainabilitY
9.       Given that (i) the   quality  of  construction work under the project
was generally good, (ii) road maintenance was assigned the highest priority in
the Ministry of Public Works and Highways (MPWH), (iii) the maintenance
organization  in  the  Ministry  was   strengthened   and  its  planning  and
operations improved, (iv) the Maintenance Division in MPWH was given equal
rank and importarce with other divisions in the Ministry, and (v) the
reestimated rate of return of the project is about 20%, it seems likely that
the project will be sustainable, provided that the Government in the future
will be able to make available the necessary funds for road maintenance.

delays, caused principally by the economic crisis prevailing during the
implementation period, did not lessen the determined efforts of the responsible
agencies to push through project implementation. The project wvs valuable in
continuing and expandiaxg efforts begun under the Third Highway Project to

IPHILIPrINES
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1661-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.1      During  the  1970s,  the  Philippines  made  significant  advances  in
development of its transport sector, far exceeding progress in the previous
decade both in terms of funds expended and results achieved. Annual public
transport expenditures increased from P 282 million in 1968 to P 3,100 million
in 1978, with highways absorbing about 74% of the transport total.   As a
result, the road network expanded from 63,000 km in 1969 to 119,600 km in 1978.
Although projections for 1979-85 indicated that interisland shipping and air
transport would carry increasing shares of the traffic load, about 58% of
transport investment in 1979-82 was allocated to the roads subsector.   This
reflected the continued dominance of road transport on the two major islands of
Luzon and Mindanao where nearly 80% of passenger traffic and 44% of freight
traffic traveled by road.
1.2      Despite this high level of investment, the condition of the Philippine
road network was for the most part poor.  In 1978, only 41% of the national
highway system and 13% of provincial roads were paved (compared with about 95%
and 20%, respectively, in Thailand); the rest were either gravel or unsurfaced.
Furthermore, many paved and unpaved roads were in poor condition because of
inappropriate initial design and construction, and inadequate maintenance.
Existing roads were also frequently damaged by severe flooding in the rainy
season and overloading of trucks.
1.3      The reasons for inadequate road maintenance were many:  there was no
proper organizational set-up or staff capable of carrying out the required
tasks; funds allocated for maintenance were either inadequate as the Government
concentrated on road construction or were diverted to construction or other
activities; and maintenance operations and procedures were ill-defined.
Essential items of equipment were unavailable when and where needed, hand tools
were in short supply, workshop facilities to service and repair equipment were
grossly inadequate, and many depots were cluttered with broken-down equipment
in scrap condition. Moreover, years of neglected road maintenance had resulted
in the deterioration of a large part of the network to a point where it could
not be maintained by normal methods; restoration works were needed to put the
roads in a maintainable condition. While measures were taken under previous
Bank-assisted projects to address these problems, including a maintenance study
carried out during the First and Second Highway Projects (Loans 731 and 950-PH)
and implementation of the first phase of a Five-Year Maintenance Program under
the Third Highway Project (Loan 1353-PH), further assistance was needed if
maintenance was to continue to improve.
1.4      Implementation of these earlier projects was generally satisfactory.
Due to civil disturbances in the project area, implementation of the First



Project was delayed, but the economic return at completion was satisfactory.
The Second Project was delayed by about 18 months by the poor performance of
one contractor, but the economic return at project completion was again
satisfactory. Implementation of the Third Project, begun in 1977, experienced
extensive delays from the start, due to poor contractor performance and a lack
of local funds. The latter problem resulted partly from the Government's poor
fiscal position and partly from poor handling of budget preparation and
presentation by the Ministry of Public Highways (MPH).1 Ultimately, however,
the project achieved most of its objectives, including improvement of road
maintenance, identification of further roads for improvement, and strengthening
of MPH staff capabilities.   The Fourth Highway Project was intended to
supplement and complement efforts begun under the previous project.
2. PROJECT FORMUIATION
Project Identification
2.1      The Fourth Highway Project was identified on the basis of findings of
two sets of studies: road feasibility studies carried out by consultants in
1975 which identified road sectio' requiring improvement, and the Highway
Maintenance Study (para. 1.3) complea - by consultants in 1975. The feasibility
studies recommended a program of hir iay reconstruction and improvement for a
total of about 1,150 km of national roads and about 500 km of feeder roads,
from which 543 km of national roads and 196 km of feeder roads were selected
for the Fourth Highway Project. The Highway Maintenance Study recommended a
Five-year Maintenance Program which included (a) target annual budgetary
requirements for routine and periodic maintenance; (b) restoration to a
maintainable level of about 13,200 km of deteriorated sections of the national
road network; (c) procutement and management of mairtenance equipment and spare
parts; and (d) a highway maintenance marft.l.  The first two years of the
program were undertaken under the Third Hige ay Project (which focused on Luzon
Island) while the remaining three years were to be implemented under the Fourth
Highway Project which would encompass the whole country.  Maintenance Study
recommendations for the improvement of maintenance operations, the repair of
existing maintenance equipment,  the purchase  of new workshop equipment,
machinery, tools and spare parts and the construction of area/base workshops
were also addressed under the project.   The Fourth Highway Project therefore
comprised improvement of high priority roads, the second phase of the
Maintenance Program and continued strengthening of highway staff capabilities.
Obiectives
2.2      The major objectives of the project were: (a) to provide improved
transport services to the rural population through reconstruction, restoration
and maintenance of deteriorated national and connecting feeder roads; (b) to
upgrade maintenance procedures and operations for nationrl, and secondary roads;
(c) to train MPH staff to carry out their assigned tasks; and (d) to strengthen
1 MPH was subsequently renamed the Department of Public Works and Highways
(DPWH).



the planning, administrative, engineering and maintenance capabilities of
provincial highway authorities.
Description
2.3      The project comprised the following components:
(a)   construction and improvement of eight national road sections totalling
about 345 km and six feeder road sections totalling about 63 km;
(b)   implementation of the second phase (1980-82) of the Five-year Road
Maintsnance Program, including: restoration of about 8,400 km of roads
(of which some 1,430 km would be financed by 'she Bank); the
construction or enlargement of one central equipment depot, 7 regional
base and 32 area workshops; and procurement of road maintenance
equipment as well as necessary parts and components for existing
equipment;
(c)   continuation of an axle load control program begun under Loan 950-PH
with the procurement of additional weighbridges;
(d)   procurement of soils and materials testing equipment;
(e)   advanced technical training overseas for permanent staff of MPH
and the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development
(MLGCD);
(f)   technical assistance to: (i) MPH to help implement an expanded rcad
restoration program;  (ii) MLGCD to initiate a program for improved
administration, planning, design, construction supervision and
maintenance of provincial roads; (iii) MPH to assist in making
required organizational, administrative and operational improvements;
and  (iv)  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Transportation  and
Communication (MPWTC) to continue ongoing transport planning advisory
services; and
(g)   consulting services for construction supervision of project roads, and
for detailed engineering and construction supervision of workshop
construction.
Project Appraisal and Loan Processing
2.4      The project was first appraised in October/November 1977 on the basis
of  substantially  completed  detailed  engineering  and  economic  analysis.
However, in view of the very slow progress in implementing the Third Highway
Project, furthet processing of the Fourth Project was held in abeyance in order
to give MPH more time to improve progress in maintenance and restoration work
under  the  previous  project.    The  Fourth  Project  was  reappraised  in
October/November 1978 in view of headway made during the intervening year when
the Bank had intensified supervision of the Third Project.



2.5      The Bank loan for the project was negotiated in January 1979, the loan
for US$100 million was approved by the Board on March 6, 1979 and became
effective on June  12,  1979 as scheduled.   There were no conditions  of
effectiveness.
3.  PROJECT ITPLEMENTATION
Revisions to the Project
3.1      The Loan Agreement for the project was amended on various occasions
to: (a) increase the rational roads construction/improvement component by 20
km, to 365 km; (b) include feasibility studies and detailed engineering for
MPH's bridge reconstruction program as '-411 as construction of an additional
feeder road (10 km); and (c) reduce the physical targets for the road
restoration program from 5,264 km of roads and 3,187 ditches/shoulders to 1,820
km of roids including drainage works.
Overview of Implementation
3.2      The project experienced delays from the very start of implementation
and continued to do so throughout its course. Initiation of project works was
delayed by several months due to a change in Ministers at MPH and the decision
of the new Minister to revise some project arrangements.   Subsequently, its
implementation proceeded slowly and suffered further delays, primarily as a
result  of  three  factors.    First,  due  to  the poor performance  of many
contractors under the earlier project, MPH revised and tightened its
prequalification procedures. The new procedures were rather cumbersome and
time-consuming, and delayed prequalification of contractors for the project's
road construction and improvement works. Second, implementation of the second
phase of the road maintenance and restoration program under this project could
not begin until completion of the first phase, which was delayed by slow
contracting and inadequate planning for the use of local funds. Finally, the
technical assistance component was delayed by slow selection of consultants.
3.3      To improve project implementation, MPH agreed on two action programs
in 1981 and 1982 which substantially improved project progress in 1982 and
1983. However, the project suffered further implementation delays in 1984 due
to cutbacks in local counterpart funding as the Government, complying with an
IMF stabilization program, sought to decrease the mounting public sector
deficit.   As a result, MPH was forced to stop payments for all ongoing
contracts for four months in mid-1984 and the contractors either slowed down
works or stopped them altogether.  At the same time, contractors were faced
with 50-60% increases in prices for construction materials (following
devaluation of the peso in October 1983 and May 1984) and contract price
escalation provisions limited to only 30%. This, in conjunction with continued
high interest rates and tight credit conditions, made it difficult for the
contractors to continue execution of contracts awarded before 1983. The small
local contractors responsible for workshop construction under the project were
particularly affected by this situation and had to stop their work almost
entirely. In 1985 MPH approved the payment of adequate price escalation costs
for the workshop contracts, and the contractors resumed work.   Due to the
substantial delay experienced in this component, a new action program for



- 5 -
workshop construction was agreed in February 1985, with completion envisioned
in April 1986.
3.4      However, due to the political events of 1986 and related uncertainties
with regard to budgetary support and continuity of key staff responsible for
implementation, a complete dry season was lost in 1986; subsequently, the
Government's shortage of local funds and intricate budgetary procedures caused
further delays. By the time of loan closing on June 30, 1987, the project was
substantially completed, with the exception of six workshops which were
completed by force account and financed by the Government. As a result of the
many delays, project completion was about four years later than expected.
Project Progress by Comgonent
3.5      Construction of National Roads.  Construction of the national roads
waa carried out under ten separate contracts costing from US$2.5 million to
US$14.7 million each and averaging US$7.3 million.   Following international
competitive bidding, two contracts were awarded to a Korean firm, one to an
American-Korean firm, and the rest to local contractors.   A comparison of
estimated and actual contract costs and timing is given in Table 1.
3.6      Bidding and award of contracts was delayed by 14 months due to lengthy
prequalification procedures. Construction started in late 1981 and progressed
satisfactorily until late 1983 when economic conditions in the country brought
on further devaluation of the peso, sudden price increases and the imposition
of high interest rates, a difficult credit situation and tight cash position.
Against this background, project construction was delayed by the contractors'
lack of adequate or sufficient equipment, equipment breakdowns and lack of
spare parts, and the contractors' lack of capital and insufficient cash
support.   In  early  1984,  construction  progress  slowed  significantly,
particularly in three of the contracts.
3.7      The Government, with some encouragement from the Bank, decided to
assist project contractors by: (a) adjusting unit prices for the balance of
work as of November 1, 1983 to current prices on a no-loss-no-gain basis; (b)
liberalizing and extending the scope and application of advance payment for
materials on hand, particularly asphaltic materials; and (c) liberalizing the
application of provisions for recoupment of advance payment and the release of
retention monies.
3.8      Five contracts were completed by end-1984 and another two by mid-1985
while the remaining three contracts were not completed until mid-1987.
Implementation of the latter contracts went as follows:
(a)   Digos-Jct. Sulop-Malalag Road contract slowed down by end-1983, but
with government assistance was completed in April 1985. However, it
was not officially completed until 1987 due to extension of the
contract as discussed below;
(b)   Jct.  Sulop/Malalag-General Santos City Road suffered considerable
delays and by late 1985 it was decided to delete about 20.5 km from
this subproject. The unfinished section was, however, later awarded to



.
-6 -
the contractor for the Digos-Jct. Sulop/Malalag Road which was
recently completed. This was agreed as both sections were contiguous
and the contractor was willing to accept the deleted portion under the
same contract conditions and contract price as the original contract,
and further, no mobilization cost was added. The whole length of the
road was substantially completed by June 1987.
(c)   Sigma-Roxas Road progressed satisfactorily from start of construction
in November 1982 to mid-1983 when the country's difficult economic
conditions began to adversely affect progress.   Termination of the
contract was considered several times but works were continued in view
of the good quality of works, the contractor's commitment to the
project despite the prevailing economic conditions and the perception
that the works were needed. The contract was substantially completed
by the first quarter of 1987.
3.9      Considering  the conditions  under which  construction  took place,
overall implementation of the national roads program was satisfactLry, and the
quality of work was generally good.
3.10     Feeder Road Construction.  The seven feeder roads constructed under
the project, totaling about 73.7 km, were grouped into five contract packages
ranging in cost from US$0.60 million to US$2.50 milAon.  Four of the contracts
were undertaken by local contractors while one was undertaken by a joint
venture of a local and foreign contractor. Two contracts suffered excessive
delays mainly due to: (a) poor contractor job organization and lack of
managerial skills; (b) the contractors' inadequate equipment and shortage of
spare parts; and (c) the adv-rse economic conditions prevailing during the
construction period.   In addition, construction of the Escalante-Danao Road
suffered when the foreign partner in the joint venture withdrew and the local
partner had to struggle to complete the project. Both the Escalante-Danao Road
and the Dumangas Port Road were substantially completed by the third quarter of
1987. A comparison of estimated and final contract costs is given in Table 1.
3.11     Road Restoration.   This component continued the Road Restoration
Program begun under the Third Highway Project and comprised MPH's 1981-84
program, the primary objective of which was to restore 2,500 km of national
roads. Restoration works mainly involved resurfacing, shaping of shoulders and
improvement of drainage. The program for the four-year period was reduced to
2,021 km (224 road sections rather than the 228 originally planned) due to
limited local counterpart funding and poor contractors' performance. A total
of 409 km were resurfaced with bituminous pavement, and 1,612 km were
regraveled and 3 km of shoulder ditch improved for a total cost of P 353.5
million. Progress under this component is shown in Table 1.
3.12     Workshop Construction and Im2rovement.   The project included the
construction or improvement of 39 workshops in the Visayas and Mindanao areas
and one Central Equipment Depot in Metro Manila, to complete MPH's nationwide
network of equipment repair and maintenance workshops. Design and construction
supervision were carried out by a foreign consulting firm and construction was
undertaken by 43 local firms.



-7-
3.13     Censtruction started in late 1982 and as of December 31, 1987, 34
contracts were completed or substantially completed, and six were terminated,
to be finished by the Government through force account. Like the highway civil
works components, workshop cot.struction under the project suffered from the
increased prices, tight cash position, high cost of money and peso devaluation
which accompanied the country's difficult economic condition starting in late-
1983. The unit price adjustment made in November 1, 1983 for tne balance of
work (para. 3.7) helped to revive construction activities, although the smaller
contractors carrying out this component continued to be hard hit by problems
related to the faltering economy.
3.14     Procurement of Goods.   The bulk of purchases under the project,
consisting mainly of road maintenance equipment and spare parts, workshop tools
and machinery, and soils and materials testing equipment, were made from 1982
to 1985.   Extension of the loan closing date allowed the acquisition of
urgently needed additional equipment. In accordance with Bank guidelines, all
procurement was undertaken through Internat-ional Competitive Bidding, except in
three cases where international shopping was more appropriate. Some equipment
originally to be purchased under this project was financed under the Third
Highway Project using surplus funds remaining under the loan.
3.15     All items were shipped or delivered by December 31, 1987.   While
procurement under the project generally went as planned, a few problems were
encountered; for example, about 500 pick axes bought from a local supplier
failed to meet the specifications and could not be accepted, and another
suppli;r failed to deliver 40 portable conveyors.
3.16     Consulting Services.   Originally,  foreign consultants were to be
employed for technical assistance and supervision of construction; however, the
new MPH Minister who took office shortly after project start-up decided to
engage local management and engineering consultants to assist his staff in
implementation management. The foreign technical assistance team assigned to
MPH was thus reduced from 18 to 6, and the local consulting firms that
undertook detailed engineering of the project roads (working with the MPH
regional offices) were also engaged to supervise their construction. The local
consulting firms and the MPH supervision teams were supported by some of the
expatriate consultants funded under the project, but after expiration of the
expatriates' contract in 1984, their support was gradually phased out.
3.17     For area/base workshops, both detailed engineering and construction
supervision were undertaken by the same joint venture consulting firm.  The
consultants were demobilized in November 1987 when the MPH regional office took
over all remaining works.
3.18     Training and Technical Assistance.  The project included an advanced
technical training program for selected MPH and MLGCD staff responsible for
handling the more difficult and complex problems involved in managing a large
highway network. In all, 20 staff received overseas training, including three
who received master's degrees with emphasis on highway design, bridge design
and soil engineering, and 17 who received practical training, special seminar-
workshops and on-the-job  training for senior executives  and middle-level



officials. All participants were returned to or appointed to appropriate key
positions.
3.19     The project provided technical assistance to MPH for design and
construction, workshops and ej'tipment, and soils and materials testing.  For
maintenance, six foreign maintenance experts were provided to work with MPH
Bureau of Maintenance staff at headquarters and in four pilot regions.   These
experts helped to introduce a new maintenance management system based on
production targets and involving the scheduling, directing and reporting of
road maintenance work.   Technical assistance was also provided for the road
restoration program, a vehicle dimensions and axle loads study and feasibility
studies for reconstruction of bridges on national roads. For MLGCD, the project
provided  two  consultants  to  assist  MLGCD  in  establishing  necessary
organizational and administrative arrangements for the preparation and
implementation of the Rural Roads Improvement Project (Loan 1886-PH).   Two
additional engineers were also employed to assist MLGCD prepare for appraisal
of that project. All assignments were completed satisfactorily.
3.20     During the project period, the MPWTC unit responsible for transport
planning and slated to receive technical assistance under the project was
absorbed into the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Consultants providing transport
planning advisory services were therefore supplied to MOT and performed
satisfactorily.
3.21     The project financed technical assistance to the Construction Industry
Authority of the Philippines (CIAP) and three short studies on the availability
of credit to contractors, equipment leasing operations, and construction
industry data base requirements. Advanced training for two CIAP staff members
in construction technology and construction project management was also
provided. The CIAP technical assistance, studies and training were carried out
satisfactorily.
Project Costs and Financing
3.22     The total project cost was US$193.7 million, about 5% lower than the
appraisal estimate of US$205.0 million due to the devaluation of the peso
which compensated for higher than expected construction costs (Table 2).   Due
to devaluation, the exchange rate went from P 7.4 per US dollar in 1979 to an
average of P 14.9/dollar during 1980-87.   At the same time,  the average
construction cost for national roads was US$20,000/km compared to the
US$13,000/km estimated at appraisal, while the average construction cost for
feeder roads was US$9,000/km compared to US$6,000/km at appraisal. Therefore,
in terms of US dollars, actual construction costs for national and feeder roads
were 54% and 50% higher, respectively, than expected at appraisal. Part of this
increase can be attributed to the significant delay in bidding (para. 3.2)
which resulted in contract costs about 18% higher than appraisal estimates.
Cost increases due to design and/or quantity changes were small (less than
10%), indicating that detailed engineering was well done and construction
supervision was more than adequate. In terms of local currency (peso) costs,
the cost for civil works was about 208% of the appraisal estimate, alJhough the
total project cost was only 125% of the appraisal estimate. The Bank loan of
US$100.0 million covered the foreign exchange costs of the project (US$100.3



-9 -
million according to Government records and US$99.6 million according to the
Bank) while the Government financed all local costs.
Loan Disbursement
3.23     A compariaon of actual and estimated disbursements is provided in
Table 3. Slow disbursement at the start of project implementation was due to
delays  in the prequalification  of contractors.    The  slow and prolonged
disbursement during the latter part of the project period was largely due to
problems resulting from the country's economic constraints. Disbursement was
further adversely affected by the continued devaluation of the peso which, if
not addressed, would have resulted in a large surplus of funds under the loan.
The Bank attempted to accelerate disbursement by increasing the percentage of
expenditures financed under the loan in conjunction with two Special Action
Programs (SAPs) approved in November 1983 and April 1985. Under the Programs,
disbursement percentages for civil works were increased as follows: for
construction/improvement of national and feeder roads, from the original 55% to
70% under the first SAP then to 80% under the second SAP; construction of
workshops, from 22% to 40% then to 70%; and road restoration, from 30% to 40%
then to 60%. The project loan was originally scheduled to close on December
31, 1983, but did not close until June 30, 1987 after three extensions. About
US$0.4 million of the loan was cancelled at loan closing.  A comparison of
estimated and actual loan disbursements by category is shown below.

4. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
The Ninistry.of Public Highways
4.1      Institutional Development.   The Fourth Highway Project strengthened
and supplemented the contribution of the Third Highway Project to development
of all road sector institutions, especially MPH. As a result of these projects,
MPH's maintenance capability, in particular, showed significant improvement as



- 10 -
maintenance activities were finally given due importance and attention. After
MPH merged with the Ministry of Public Works in 1981, to become the Ministry of
Public Works and Highways (MPWH) maintenance was assigned the highest priority
in the MPWH program and, the maintenance organization under the merged Ministry
was strengthened and its planning and operations improved.   Following four
successful pilot projects, which were implemented with the help of the six
experts financed under the project, the new planning and operations procedures
tested  under  the  pilot  projects  were  adopted  nationwide  and  the  MPWH
Maintenance Division was given equal rank and importance with other divisions
in the Ministry, including the Construction Division.
4.2      Performance  under  the  Project.        In  the  course  of  project
implementation, MPWH was able to take innovative and positive actions to ensure
project completion despite the national financial and economic difficulties
prevailing at the time.    The more important of these actions were:
(a)   MPWH caused Presidential Degree (PD) 1594 and its implementing rules
and regulations governing infrastructure contracts to be issued in
June 1982, which principally sought to:
(i)   simplify and improve contract management procedures;
(ii)  streamline administrative requirements;
(iii) help develop the contracting industry; and
(iv)  clarify  ambiguities  and  establish  adequate  control  for  more
effective contract administration.
(b)   In F;bruary 1984, MPWH was successful in securing authority to review
and readjust (for inflation) the unit prices of existing contracts for
projects financed by the Bank.  Although funds were still released
late, this action helped almost all ongoing projects, including
contracts under the Fourth Highway Project; and
(c)   Internal controls were instituted to facilitate the processing of
progress payments as well as change orders.
The Rolg of the Bank
4.3      The project widened the area of cooperation between the Government and
the Bank as it continued the dialogue started under the previous projects and
expanded into succeeding projects.   The project also assisted the local
construction industry in identifying problems ailing the industry and
ultimately in overcoming these problems.
4.4      The Bank's involvement in the project contributed to improvement in
the capacity of MPWH for road planning, construction and maintenance and as
well  as  the  development  of a  transport policy  capability.    Generally,
maintenance of all roads, both national and rural, came to be regarded with
increased importance and priority.

4.5      Bank  staff  assisted  in  identifying and overcoming  the problems
associated with project implementation. This support, which was particularly
valuable in gaining increased Bank participation in project financing and
adjustment of contract unit prices on a no-gain-no-loss basis, contributed
greatly in overcoming implementation difficulties and pushed the project to
complstion through the economic and financial difficulties experienced in the
country.
5. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.1      The  economic  analysis  of  the project  carried  out  at  appraisal
considered quantifiable benefits related to the road construction, maintenance
and restoration components. Benefits from investments in national and feeder
roads were determined as the difference in road user costs with and without the
project, for both normal and generated traffic.   Benefits from travel time
savings, restricted to working time (and excluding passenger time savings), and
the reduction in road maintenance costs were also considered.   The economic
evaluation of the maintenance program was based on the difference in costs to
the economy of carrying out minimum maintenance without the project, compared
to the program executed with  the project.    Evaluation of project  road
restoration was based on benefits arising from savings in vehicle operating
costs due to improved road conditions. The eight national and six feeder roads
originally included in the project had rates of return ranging from 16% to 32%.
The maintenance component was expected to have a return of 68% and the
restoration component 25%.   The project was expected to have an overall
weighted average rate of return of about 50%.
5.2      Since  the project's  maintenance  and restoration  components  went
relatively smoothly and their economic returns are not in doubt, it was decided
that the post-evaluation of project investments would be limited to the more
problematic construction/improvement component.
National Roads
5.3      The national roads improved under the project are located in the five
largest islands of the country,  namely:   Luzon,  Panay,  Negros,  Cebu and
Mindanao.   The road projects supported development of an intensified and
efficient transport network system, particularly in the provinces of Albay,
Iloilo, Capiz, Negros, Cebu, Davao and Cotabato.  The areas served by these
*      roads are densely populated or important to agriculture by producing commercial
crops such as rice, sugar, coconuts, coffee and citrus fruits which require
immediate and efficient access to trading centers or to refineries or milling
centers for processing.
5.4      Traffic growth rates expected at appraisal for the period 1981-2000
ranged from 5.2% to 7.0%, except for the road section in Albay (Tabaco-Ligao),
which had an expected traffic growth rate of 4.0%. In general, these rates are
lower than the actual growth rates observed, which range from 5.6% to 7.2% (see
Table 5). The higher than expected rates probably indicate a gradual uptrend
in the national economy. For purposes of re-evaluation, in estimating future
(1987-2007) traffic growth rates, passenger traffic growth is based on future



- 12 -
population and income growth rates in the respective provinces; however, future
truck traffic (commodity traffic) growth is assumed to be the same as the GDP
growth rate in 1986-92 and to remain constant during 1993-2007 at the 1992
level.
5.5      The rates of economic return estimated at appraisal ranged from 19% to
23% with an overall rate of return of 25%. The ex-post returns range from about
6% to 26%, with the three lowest returns being about 6% for Janiuay-Calinog, 8%
for Tabaco-Tiwi and 11% for Sigma-Roxas (see Table 6). The overall return for
this component is 15%, somewhat lower than exp;cted due to the higher
construction costs.  Details of the vehicle operating costs used for this
analysis are given in Table 7.
Feeder Roads
5.6      These roads connect major highways to neighboring municipalities and
provincial capitals and were included in the project to help develop relatively
isolated regions with dense populations and regions with a potential for new
rural settlements.   They were re-evaluated in terms of their First Year
Benefit/Cost Ratio, although the appraisal evaluation was based on costs and
benefits over an assumed service life of 10 years for gravel roads and 20) years
for bituminous surfaced roads. The quantified benefits include only savings in
operating and maintenance costs.   Due to lack of consistent data at the
barangay level, a before and after comparison is possible for only three of the
seven feeder roads constructed/improved under the project, i.e., Old Sagay
Road, National Road-Bulanon (the two road sections have been considered
together) and Anonang-Daanbantayan.
5.7      Appraisal traffic growth rate projections for these roads during 1981-
2000 were 5.2% and 4.8%, respectively, lower than the 6.2% and 6.3% indicated
for 1987-2007, based on results obtained from the 1986 traffic count. Present
and projected traffic on the roads is shown in Table 8. The appraisal
evaluation of these roads showed economic rates of return of 15% for Old Sagay
Road, 15% for NR-Bulanon and 16% for Anonang-Daanbantayan. This corresponds
fairly closely to the re-evaluated returns of almost 15% and 19%, respectively
(Table 9). Table 10 shows details of the vehicle operating costs used for the
re-evaluation.
6. CONCWNSIONS
6.1      In general, the project objectives were achieved, and the major
delays, caused principally by the economic crisis prevailing during  the
implementation period, did not lessen the determined efforts of the responsible
agencies to push through project implementation. Road restoration and
maintenance work were well supported and given adequate emphasis.  Highway
civil works were also well executed and rates of return for the related
investments were within targets. The various studies, technical assistance and
training provided under the project have contributed to institution building.
Most significantly, the project helped to focus the Government's attention on
the low priority previously given to road maintenance nationwide.
