Public Highway and Local\n            Government and Community Development; and (c) strenghthen\n            planning, administrative, engineering and maintenance\n            capabilities of the provincial highway authorities.\n            Construction and improvement of 345 km of national roads\n            would result in a reduction in vehicle operating costs. The\n            six feeder roads totaling 63 km would help develop\n            relatively isolated regions with dense populations and with\n            potential for new rural settlements. The five-year road\n            maintenance program is expected to yield considerable\n            savings in vehicle operating costs for the entire network.\n            The main risk in the proposed project concerns the quality\n            of the implementation performance of MPH in carrying out the\n            road restoration and maintenance programs."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
