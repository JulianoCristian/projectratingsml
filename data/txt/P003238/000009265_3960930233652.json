In\n            the short term, the strategy aims at making the mining\n            sector more efficient and productive than currently, so that\n            mining can continue to generate the resources needed to\n            support recovery and diversification of the Zambian economy.\n            In the longer term, the strategy will support the\n            development of new copper mines by private investors.  The\n            project will achieve the objectives by:  (a) assisting\n            Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) to improve its\n            mining and metallurgical operations with a particular focus\n            on lowering costs; (ii) supporting development and\n            implementation of a comprehensive corporate plan which will\n            include an efficient phase-down plan for certain ZCCM mining\n            operations with depleting reserves; (iii) assisting ZCCM in\n            joint-venturing its undeveloped copper resources and in the\n            divestiture of subsidiaries and/or assets with little direct\n            relation to mining; (iv) supporting a program to encourage\n            new private investments in gemstone mining; (v) facilitating\n            the preparation of a plan to assist small-scale miners,\n            especially gemstone miners; (vi) developing a long-run\n            strategy for Maamba Collieries; and (vii) assisting in\n            developing environmental regulations for mining and\n            providing support to the protection of the environment in\n            the areas mined by ZCCM, Maamba and the small-scale miners."}, "docdt": "1991-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
