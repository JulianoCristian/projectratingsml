The project aimed to support\n            three organizations: the majority Government-owned Zambia\n            Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (ZCCM), the Ministry of Mines\n            and Minerals Development (MMMD), and Maamba Collieries. The\n            project objectives relating to MMMD and Maamba Collieries\n            were largely successful, but those relating to ZCCM were not\n            accomplished. Project sustainability is rated as uncertain.\n            The failure to assist ZCCM precludes sustainable solutions\n            in that component. However, the outlook for long-term\n            sustainability of the mining sector is positive, provided\n            the ongoing privatization of ZCCM is completed. Bank\n            performance is rated as satisfactory. Bank staff worked\n            rapidly and intensively in response to Government requests\n            and in the face of deteriorating ZCCM performance. Borrower\n            performance is rated as satisfactory. Although ZCCM\n            management was unable to correct deteriorating performance,\n            the Government and MMMD worked well in preparation,\n            implementation, and cooperation with the private sector. Key\n            lessons learned revolve around the importance of:\n            flexibility in the design of project operations; design of a\n            regulatory and legal framework to support private sector\n            investment; the articulation of clear policies; and\n            technical assistance operations as a starting point for\n            sector reform. The project revealed the impact of these\n            concepts on project responsiveness to changing conditions;\n            on privatization initiatives; and on consensus building.\n            Also, a clear separation of objectives and associated\n            components can allow for partial successes. Finally, the new\n            organizational structure, of a Country Director supported by\n            a Country Team, enabled team operations across institutional boundaries."}, "docdt": "1998-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
