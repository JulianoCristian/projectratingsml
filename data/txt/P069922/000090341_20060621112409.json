Lessons\n            learned from the project: The project has clearly\n            demonstrated the economic benefits and the value of\n            undertaking retrofitting and mitigation works. The Bank\n            should have dealt more forcefully with the institutional\n            strengthening component of the project from the start.\n            Requiring that Government counterpart funds be made\n            available by loan and credit effectiveness greatly\n            facilitated initial project implementation. For large\n            mitigation works, design and supervision contracts should\n            preferably be procured on a competitive basis rather than\n            under a government appointed consultant arrangement. The\n            Bank needs to consider requiring performance guarantees in\n            consultant contracts and applying penalties for late\n            submission of expected outputs."}, "docdt": "2006-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
