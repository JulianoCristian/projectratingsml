This environmental\n            assessment focuses on the potential negative impacts of\n            those works at Queens Park - Grand Mal, and Grand Roy -\n            Palmist. It reviews the legal and institutional framework,\n            and its weaknesses, basically under the Land Development\n            Control Authority, responsible for land use management,\n            although discussions also involved other government\n            agencies. The key issues identified included beach\n            protection and improvement; preservation of fishing sites;\n            pollution control, road safety, and, public awareness.\n            Although no significant negative impacts are expected,\n            measures to mitigate beach and marine environment, traffic,\n            and public inconveniences, include beach replenishment works\n            to prevent beach erosion, and, alternative fishing methods,\n            such as \"ringing\", should replace net fishing,\n            inconvenient due to the construction of new sea defenses\n            Excavation works should be limited to the dry season,\n            avoiding vegetative degradation. Appropriate waste storage\n            sites to avoid oil/petrol spillage, and contamination, will\n            be identified for final disposal, as set by public\n            standards. An environmental monitoring system should be\n            established, for evaluation by relevant agencies. Traffic\n            signs, and a traffic management plan will appropriately\n            address road safety measures."}, "docdt": "2000-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
