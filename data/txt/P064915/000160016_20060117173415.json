These are among the lessons\n            learned: 1) Institutional modernization and capacity\n            improvement is difficult in countries where donors compete\n            for staff from the same pool of capable professionals. 2)\n            Extension agents are the main source of agricultural\n            information for producers. 3) Equally important as\n            generation of new production technology is the relevance of\n            that technology in the broadest sense and along the entire\n            production-marketing chain. 4) Supporting small farmers\n            involves establishing the right balance between equity and\n            efficiency. 5) There is a need to strategically think about\n            the institutional arrangement for managing competitive\n            funds. 6) Within a competitive fund, a dedicated fund has to\n            be established to cater for special groups, such as\n            indigenous inhabitants and women. For 7) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation goes beyond the Logical Framework. The indicators\n            identified in the Logical Framework need to be revised as a\n            project evolves during project implementation. The\n            establishment of a functioning monitoring and evaluation\n            system allows the Logical Framework to be dynamic, rather\n            than a document that remains the same throughout project\n            implementation. Due to the absence of a functioning\n            monitoring and evaluation system, the results of new\n            activities such as the 8) The involvement of co-financers in\n            the full monitoring and supervision of project\n            implementation enhances cooperation."}, "docdt": "2005-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
