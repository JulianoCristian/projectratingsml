    and Rural Education Project for Nicaragua are as follows:\n            outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Agricultural Research and Extension project for Peru are\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the Agriculture\n            Technology Development Project for Colombia are as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Agricultural Technology Development Project for Brazil are\n            as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation\n            of research projects. The lack of hard evidence about the\n            results of Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) investments in\n            research and extension is a considerable shortcoming of all\n            but one project. In each of these countries, agricultural\n            productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with growth\n            increasingly based on intensification rather than area\n            expansion. All institutions need a portion of the budget\n            that is core funded to cover costs of maintenance and\n            upgrading of physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS\n            usually only fund operating costs and the subprojects they\n            finance have only 2-3 years' duration. The CGS model is\n            more likely to strengthen the strongest agencies providing\n            research and extension services than it is to reduce the\n            disparities between the strong and the weak. The principle\n            of competition between alternative service providers breaks\n            down where the range of providers is limited and many of the\n            potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable\n            sub-project proposals."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
