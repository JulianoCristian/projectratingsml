The agricultural\n            technology project sought to address this problem by\n            establishing an efficient, demand-driven agricultural\n            technology, knowledge, and innovation system. The focus of\n            the project was mainly to provide rural households and\n            communities with a broader access to sustainable\n            agricultural, forestry and natural resource management\n            services and innovations, and to stimulate higher\n            productivity. Over the project period, yields of basic\n            staples (maize, beans, and rice) rose by 23 percent on\n            average, the largest increase within the six Central\n            American countries. Farmer incomes in surveyed\n            representative farms increased 25-84 percent. It seeks to\n            broaden the access of rural households and communities to\n            sustainable agricultural, forestry, and natural resource\n            management services and innovations, thereby stimulating\n            higher agricultural productivity."}, "docdt": "2007-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
