With 8) In an operation\n            with this set of objectives to reach small micro- and\n            medium-sized enterprises and previously disadvantaged\n            individuals, it is essential that attention is to be\n            maintained on that goal. 9) Standardization of processes\n            facilitates information and knowledge management for Program\n            Managers and Senior Managers. 10) Impact studies show that\n            in retrospect the project could have given out a lower level\n            of subsidies. The lesson can be drawn that where Government\n            transfers are used as support mechanism, an impact review\n            upstream including a control group would help to make\n            adjustments at mid-term review."}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
