The\n            environmental impacts anticipated are considered minor, and\n            are largely associated with the impacts of construction,\n            some minor disturbance of the coastal vegetation, and\n            alteration of the submarine community in the vicinity of the\n            discharge pipe. Construction, operation, and maintenance of\n            the wastewater treatment system represents the principal\n            sources of potential negative environmental impacts\n            resulting from the project. Poor construction promoting\n            leakage of transmission lines, failure of the operator to\n            properly dispose of solids collected from the system, and\n            failure to maintain the submarine discharge in good working\n            order are the principal risks from the project. The\n            mitigation of the environmental impacts associated with this\n            project are largely related to insuring that the design and\n            construction is adequately implemented (contract clauses in\n            project bidding documents will contain environmental\n            requirements and contracts will be evaluated on that basis),\n            personnel are adequately trained, and that the operation of\n            the facility complies with project requirements over the\n            life of the project."}, "docdt": "1999-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
