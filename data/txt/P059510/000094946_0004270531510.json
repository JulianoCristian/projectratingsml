private sector in the provision of water supply services in\n            selected tourism areas. The components will: 1) include the\n            construction of wastewater conveyance systems, treatment\n            installations, and submarine out-falls in the Sosua region.\n            Existing sewage will be connected to the treatment plant,\n            along with the necessary construction of pumping stations;\n            2) prepare, and implement the private sector participation\n            process for the provision of water supply services in the\n            Puerto Plata, Sosua, and Cabarete region. It includes\n            procurement drafting for the management of these services in\n            the pilot region, technical assistance to support the\n            evaluation/selection process, and, to design contracting\n            regulations; 3) monitor coastal environment, testing the\n            effectiveness of the small-diameter submarine out-fall,\n            through key indicator variables, and their effect on\n            wastewater disposal; 4) in partnership with the Pan-American\n            Health Organization, training and dissemination practices\n            will form the basis for a case study on the technical\n            viability of small-diameter out-falls; 5) provide technical\n            and financial support to design control regulations on\n            operational, and environmental aspects."}, "docdt": "2000-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
