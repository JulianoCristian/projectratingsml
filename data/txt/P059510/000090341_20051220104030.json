Following are lessons\n            learned from the project: The investment component of the\n            project was designed to be readily managed, funded and\n            supervised. The institutional component of the project would\n            have benefited from a comparable, less-aggressive approach.\n            The outcome of the project is totally consistent with the\n            conclusions of the Quality at Entry Assessment performed in\n            April 2001. In the opinion of the panel that performed the\n            assessment, the LIL was adequate for piloting the ocean\n            outfall technology. There should always be an institutional\n            contingency plan for reform projects."}, "docdt": "2005-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
