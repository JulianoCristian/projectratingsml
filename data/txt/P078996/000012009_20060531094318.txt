Tei-nis                   IDA terms with a foi-ty-year maturity, including a grace period o ften
                          years.
Schedule o f disbursement Single tranche o f SDR41.8 million, US$60 million equivalent, to be
                          released upon effectiveness expected in July 2006.
Description               The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-6) i s tlie third in a
                           series o f three operations supporting the implementation o f the PRSP in
                          tlie period 2004-2006. The PRSP has four strategic pillars: (i) accelerating
                          broad-based growth; (ii)promoting access to social services; (iii)
                          increasing employment and income-generating activities for tlie poor; and
                          (iv) promoting good goveiiiance. Tlie PRSC series supports the PRSP
                          implementation under three components consistent with the four pillars o f
                           the PRSP: (i)growth and employment creation; (ii)human resource
                           development; and (iii)good goveiiiance. Under tlie growth and
                           employment creation component, PRSC-6 supports institutional reforms
                          that    will increase     private  sector   participation  in the     cotton,
                           telecommunication and energy sectors, thus accelerating growth through
                           higher investment and improved productivity and competitiveness. Tlie
                           second component includes policies to lower the cost o f services and
                           improve access and quality in tlie education, health, social protection, and
                          water sectors. The third component encompasses policy measures to
                           strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement, and control. This
                           component also supports the strengthening o f public sector performance,
                           greater decentralization, and better environmental management. The
                           proposed operation i s an integral pait o f the Bank's assistance strategy
                           discussed by Executive Directors in June 2005. Tlie next series o f three
                           PRSC will continue the suppoi-t to PRSP iniplenientation along tlie same
                           directions, but with a greater focus on growth aiid decentralization.

Benefits                   The proposed operation would allow tlie Goveiiinieiit to pursue its policy
                           objectives laid out in the revised PRSP and its accompanying Priority
                           Action Plan (PAP) within a structured macroeconomic fianiework by
                           providing sound financing for the execution o f the Government's 2006
                          budget.Over the period 2004-2006, it i s expected that the refoiiii program
                           under tlie series o f three annual PRSCs (PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and PRSC-6)
                           would help tlie Government in achieving a 6 percentage point reduction o f
                           the poverty headcount. It would also help the Goveiiiment in making
                           progress toward reaching some key Millennium Development Goals
                           (MDGs), namely, school enrollment, literacy, child and niateiiial
                           mortality, aiid access to safe water. Lastly, expected benefits include
                           strengthening the sustainability o f development efforts, better governance

                     through improved public financial management and modem civil service,
                     and improved services delivery through greater deconcentration and
                     decentralization.
Risks               The risks for the operation arise from the country's weak institutional
                     capacity, adverse developments in commodity prices and exchange rates,
                     and regional instability.

                     Risks for program implementation remain due to important capacity
                     constraints   in conceiving,     executing,   monitoring,   and evaluating
                     government programs, particularly decentralization and program-based
                     budgeting. Burkina Faso's vulnerability to external shocks, notably the
                     fluctuation o fpetroleum and cotton prices, or the drift inthe exchange rate
                     between the dollar and the Euro to which the CFAF is pegged at a fixed
                     exchange rate, threaten macroeconomic stability and growth. Regional
                     instability, notably the political crisis in C6te d'Ivoire where live several
                     hundred thousands o f BurkinabC, could trigger a major humanitarian,
                     social and economic crisis.

                     The capacity risks are mitigated through donor harmonization that reduces
                     transaction costs and alleviates a heavy tax by donors on the meager
                     capacity in the public sector. The approval o f capacity buildingprojects
                     including two Bank projects also help to address the institutional capacity
                     issue. The risks o f commodities and currency shocks are mitigated by the
                     strong track record o f the Government in adapting to external shocks
                     through adjustment o f fiscal policy; by an independent monetary policy
                     with a solid record o f low inflation; and by the willingness o f the
                     international community to deliver additional assistance if needed.
                     Regional initiatives and UN-led efforts to solve the political crisis in C6te
                     d'Ivoire are addressing the risks o f spillover.

              PROPOSED SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                                           TO BURKINA FASO

                                          I.INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document proposes a Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-6) for
Burkina Faso, to be presented to the Executive Board on June 20, 2006. PRSC-6 amounts to
SDR41.8 million or U S 6 0 million equivalent, and would be the last in a series o f three PRSCs that
supports the implementation of the PRSP in the period 2004-2006. The PRSP and its Joint Staff
Advisory Note (JSAN)' were considered by the Executive Board on May 3, 2005. The PRSP pillars
are accelerating equitable growth; improving social service delivery; increasing employment and
income generating activities for the poor; and promoting good governance.

2.      PRSC-6 is aligned with the Africa Action Plan (AAP),2 an outcome-oriented framework with
specific actions, quantitative indicators o f results and an assessment o frisks. The principal objectives
underpinning the AAP are: (i)managing for results; (ii)building capable states and improving
governance; (iii)    strengthening the drivers o f growth; (iv) buildingthe capacity of excluded groups to
participate in and benefit from growth; (v) strengthening the impact o f partnerships; (vi)
implementingthe IDA14partnership at the country level; and (vii) scaling upprogress to the MDGs
and using aid most effectively. The AAP was discussed by the Executive Board on September 7,
2005.

3.      PRSC-6 i s an integral part o f the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)3 discussed by the
Executive Directors on June 28,2005. The CAS defines Bank support for the PRSP duringFY06-09,
through analytical work and financial products. The strategic objectives o f the CAS reflect the four
pillars o f the PRSP: (i)    accelerated and shared growth; (ii)      improved access to basic services; (iii)
increased employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv) better governance with greater
decentralization. The CAS i s characterized by a stronger focus on results, an increasingly
programmatic approach, and enhanced support for country systems and capacity.

4.       PRSC-6 focuses on key measures to attain the Government's foremost objectives under the
PRSP. These measures are organized under three components consistent with the four PRSP pillars:
growth and employment creation; human resource development; and good governance. They are
described in the Letter o f Development Policy in Annex 1 and will result in higher income growth
and employment, improved efficiency in the use o f public funds, greater transparency and
accountability inpublic sector management, and more effective public service deliveryto the poor.

5.       Progress in implementing the reform program has been sustained since the approval o f
PRSC-54 in May 2005. Output growth was 7.5 percent in 2005 and was mostly driven by the
agnculture sector which provides a living to 95 percent o f the poor inBurkina Faso. The fifth PRSP
Annual Progress Report and related JSAN are considered by the Executive Boardjointly with this
proposed operation. It describes progress in the access to and quality o f basic services. It also
discussesprogress ingovernance, decentralizationand sustainable development.

6.       PRSC-6 i s uiideiyiiiiied by the joiiit framewoi-k for budget support agreed upon by all donors
providing budget support and spearheaded by the Goveiiinient. Tlie framework lias enhanced donor
haimoiiizatioii and has cut significantly on transaction costs for the Goveiiinient. Subject to
satisfactory perfoi-niaiice on tlie program outlined in tlie proposed credit, it i s envisaged that a new
series o f three annual PRSCs will support PRSP irnplementatioii in tlie period 2007-2009. The new
series i s part o f the CAS, and will coiitiiiue effoi-ts initiated under the first six PRSCs while putting
more emphasis on growth and decentralization.


                                    11.COUNTRY CONTEXT

7.       Burkiiia Faso i s a landlocked country o f about 12 million inhabitants with a iiai-row natural
resource base and significant vulnerability to exteiiial shoclts such as ei-ratic rainfall and adverse
development in commodity prices. Poverty lieadcount was 46 percent in 2003 with 95 percent o f the
poor living in rural areas. Per capita iiicoine was about USS350 in 2004 compared to USS450 for low
income countries and US$490 for Sub-Saharan African. Social indicators compare poorly to the
average in Sub-Saharan Afiica: in 2004 literacy rate was about 26 percent and life expectancy at
birth was 43 years, compared to 35 percent and 46 years for Sub-Saharan Africa. Burkiiia Faso was
ranked 175"' out o f 177 countries in tlie 2005 Humaii Development Index (HDI) published by the
UnitedNations Development Program (UNDP) (see Box 1).

8.       Against tlie backdrop o f the difficult initial conditions and environment, Burkina Faso lias
demonstrated great resilience and track record o f sound policy iiiipleiiieiitatioii. The political
eiiviroiiiiieiit in Burkina Faso lias reiiiaiiied stable, aiid tlie country lias achieved macroeconomic
stabilization coiisequent to fiscal discipline. Three successive program under the IMF's Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were completed and a fourth PRGF i s currently
iniplenieiiting well. Tlie growth rate o f gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 6.0 percent since
1994, compared to an average population growth rate o f 2.5 percent. Burkina Faso was among tlie
first countries in Sub Saharan Afkica to present a full PRSP in 2000, and one o f tlie few to have
completed a fdl revised PRSP. Progress in PRSP implementation lias been steady as laid out in five
PRSP APRs to date. However, despite tlie gains and the track record, there remain important
challenges for attaining most MDGs.

9.       Presidential elections were held on November 13, 2005. The iiicumbeiit President Blaise
Conipaore woii a third temi o f five years with over 80 percent o f the vote. The elections were
deemed fair and transparent by inteiiiational observers. Municipal electioiis took place on April 23,
2006, and resulted in tlie elections for the first time o f local goveiiiments for 302 newly established
rural communes. In 2006, tlie political situatioii in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire should be monitored
carefully as a key element o f Burkina's exteiiial environment, Developments in tlie inteinational
prices o f cotton and oil prices could also have a key impact on Burltina's development outcome in
2006.

  I                          Box 1:Burkina Faso and the HumanDevelopmentIndex
    UNDP defines the HDI as a composite index that measures the average achievement in a country in three
    dimensions o f human development: a long an healthy life, as measured by the life expectancy at birth;
    knowledge as measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined gross enrollment ratio for primary,
    secondary and tertiary schools; and a decent standard o f living, as measured by GDP per capita in
    purchasing power parity(PPP) U S dollars.
    Burkina Faso has been consistently ranked at the bottom o f the HDIsince the first publication in 1993. This
    outcome often comes as a surprise to many observers who struggle to reconcile Burkina's poor ranking with
    reports o f recent progress inthe country. However, the inconsistency is just apparent.
    First, the HDI does indeed reflect development progress inBurkina Faso as illustrated in the table below.
    The HDIhas steadily increased since 1975 but initial gaps and parallel progress inother countries have led
    to no ranking changes for Burkina.

     Year          11975           1980        1985        11990           1995         2000         2003
     HDI           10.253        I10.273     II0.297       I0.305        1I0.311      I10.328      1I0.317

    Second are data issues ranging from coverage and quality to timeliness. The Human Development Report
    Office relies on international data agencies to collect the various indicators used in the HDI. However,
    international data series have sometimes lagged behind national data because o f coordination issues. For
    instance in the case o f Burkina Faso: indicators for life expectancy at birth and literacy rates are derived
    from the population census o f 1996. The estimate for life expectancy at birth is also based on a HIV
    prevalence rate o f 4.2 percent, while UNAIDS official estimate for 2004 is 2.4 percent.
    Third, it is unlikely that Burkina will move up quickly on the HDI ranking even if sustaining current
    progress, the reason being large initial gaps and the nature o f variables inthe HDIsuch as the literacy rate
    and life expectancy at birthrates which could reflect recent actions and programs only over time.

Growth and Prices

10.      Burkina Faso's external environment remained challenging in 2005. Prices of cotton -
Burkina's main export commodity -fell by about 15 percent in2005. Oil prices rose by 43.4 percent,
bringing the cumulative rise to 88.0 percent since 2004. The protracted political and economic crisis
inneighboring CBte d'Ivoire also continued to strain the Burkinabe economy through disruption of
the supply lines, higher transportation costs, loss o f markets, and lower workers' remittances.
Nevertheless, continuous sound economic management has muted the impact o f these external
adverse shocks. Table 1summarizes key economic indicators for Burkina Faso.

11.      Real GDP grew by 7.5 percent in 2005, driven mainly by a record cereal and cotton
production. Cotton production reached a record level of 642 thousand tons following the
liberalization o f the sector and the impetus brought on by two new private companies. Cereal
production increased by 39.0 percent as a result o f policies towards the development of agncultural
water systems, small-scale imgation, integrated management o f soil fertility, research and
development, as well as good rainfall. Industry and transport sectors also contributed to output
growth, through spillover o f the cotton production. The ginning industries and the transport sector
benefiteddirectly from the processing and transportation of the large cotton production. Inaddition,
all industries benefitedfrom a strong demand spurred by record-income receivedby cotton producers
(about US$270 million, equivalent to 4.2 percent o f GDP in2005).

12.      Inflation measured by changes in the consumer price index was 6.4 percent in2005, up from
-0.4 percent in 2004. The price hike was mainly a result o f highfood prices following a poor cereal
harvest in200412005, and to a lesser extent it reflects higher transportation costs following the rise o f
international fuel prices. Excluding food items and transportation, price level remained flat in 2005.
The impact o f higher prices on the real effective exchange rate was somewhat mitigated by the
strengthening o f the dollar against the CFAF, but overall the REER appreciated by 4.0 percent in
2005. Overall, Burkina was still able to maintain most o f the competitiveness gained with the
devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994. As a result o f the large swings in international cotton and oil
prices, terms of trade deterioratedby 31percent.

Fiscal Development

13.      Burkina Faso has continued to implement a prudent fiscal policy, consistent with medium-
term fiscal sustainability, low inflation and growth. The 2005 budget was executed smoothly
notwithstanding challenges resulting from adverse terms o f trade shocks and uncertainties about
external assistance. Inparticular, the rise in oil prices led to an increase ingovernment consumption
o f petroleum products and subsidies to the electricity company. Regarding external assistance, HIPC
debt relief fell short of initial projections (-18 percent) as a result o f lack o fparticipation o fnon-Paris
Club creditors. Inaddition there was a shortfall inproject grants, partly due to implementation issues
inthe educationsector.

 14.     Expenditures were lower than inthe financial program: expenditure and net lending was 20.6
percent o f GDP in2005 against 22.9 percent in the financial program5. There were planned increases
in current outlays due to salary increases - the first since 1997      -  and hiring o f teachers and health
workers with the objectives to make progress toward the MDGs. Overall, poverty-reducing social
expenditures increased from CFAF145 billion in 2004 to CFAF174.3 billion in 2005. However, the
subsidies to the electricity company were higher than programmed because o f the increase in
international oil prices. The subsidies rose to CFAF18 billion, and undermine the equity o f public
spending. In2006 and 2007, the Government i s planning to increase electricity tariff as agreed under
the energy sector program financed by the Bank and several other donors. The tariff adjustments and
increased reliance on imports of cheaper electricity will gradually eliminate the subsidies to the
electricity company. The slow pace o f project execution, essentially externally-financed projects,
more than offset the increases incertain categories o f spending.

15.      Revenue in2005 increasedby 11percent compared to 2004 and slightly exceeded the target
set in the financial program. Several government actions have made possible this revenue
performance. The continuous implementation o f a pass-through mechanism of international oil
prices into domestic petroleum prices has insulated petroleum revenue from the increase o f
international prices. The Government introduced a revised taxpayer identification number, thus
facilitating the control o ftax compliance. It also stepped up the monitoring o f tax collection effort by
instructing the Large Taxpayer Directorate to carry out more than 60 tax audits. In addition, the
Government produced quarterly progress reports for activities in three large tax offices inthe city o f
Ouagadougou. The collaboration with all revenue administration (tax, customs and treasury) was
also strengthened. Nevertheless, revenue as a percentage o f GDP remained l o w at 12.6 percent,
resulting inlarge fiscal deficit.

16.      The overall fiscal deficit - excluding grants - was 8.0 percent o f GDP in 2005, down from
8.5 percent o f GDP in 2004. The deficit was mostly financed by concessional external assistance,
and there is no evidence o f crowding out o fthe private sector. While significant inthe past, domestic
debt has declined rapidly in recent years in part because o f requirements by the West African
Economic and Monetary Union -- to which Burkina Faso belongs -- to phase out indebtedness to the
common central bank. In2005, domestic debt represents only 5 percent of GDP, and it i s projected
to decline further over the medium term. Net external financing was equivalent to 8.0 percent o f
GDP, in which grants represented about 4.1 percent o f GDP. Budget support (grants and credits)
were disbursed as scheduled, reflecting the impact o f the new arrangement for budget support on
resources predictability.

ExternalDevelopments

17.      Burkina Faso was hit hard in 2005 by a massive deterioration in its terms o f trade (see
Tablel). Cotton export earnings declined by 5 percent compared to 2004, even when exports in
volume had increased by 28 percent. On the other hand, oil imports rose significantly by 54 percent.

                                                   - 5 -

Put differently, oil imports represented 90 percent of cotton exports earning in 2005, against 57
percent in 2004. As a result, trade deficit inpercentageo f GDP increased from 6.9 percent in 2004 to
8.5 percent in 2005. The balance o f services also deteriorated because of higher transportation cost,
including from the disruption o f the Cote d'Ivoire supply lines and the opening o f longer and more
expensive routes to Togo, Ghana and Benin. The current account deficit (excluding current grants)
deteriorated from 11.0 percent of GDP in 2004 to 12.3 percent of GDP in 2005. The deficit was
financed by external financing and by running down gross international reserves which declined
from the equivalent of 6.7 months of imports in 2004 to the equivalent o f 5.4 months o f imports in
2005.

lMonetary Developments

18.     Burkina Faso i s a member of the Zone Franc and a supranational Central Bank implementsa
monetary policy consistent with the peg to the Euro. Prudent monetary policies have resulted in a
good record o f low inflation. In early 2005, a rapid expansion o f credit to private sector led the
monetary authorities to raise reserve requirements from 3 to 7 percent in order to curb the credit
expansion. The latter was partly driven by the rise o f crop credits as a result o f record cotton
production. Credit to private sector increased by 17.1 percent at end-December 2005, down from
23.5 percent inJune 2005. Money supply increasedby 11.3 percent in2005 as a result o fa decline of
2.9 percent innet foreign assets and a rise o f 14.2percent innet domestic assets.

Growth and Prices Outlook

19.     International cotton and oil prices will remain major determinants of the economic outcome
in2006. Current indications are that cottonprices could somewhat rebound from their record-low of
2005. Ina January 3, 2006 press release, the International Cotton Advisory Committee forecasts that
the Cotlook A Index will average 65 cents per poundin2005/06, up 13 cents from last season, on the
basis of a projected increase in net imports by China. The price increase will be a welcome relief to
cotton companies which suffered financial losses inthe previous season. On the other hand oil prices
are expected to rise again in 2006, thus further straining the Burkinabe economy through higher
transportation and production costs.

20.     On the basis o f the aforementioned external environment, real GDP growth rate is projected
at 4.4 percent in 2006 down from 7.5 percent in 2005. The single most important factor i s the
expected return of cereal production to average trend, following the 39 percent increase in 2005.
Cotton production i s expected to increase as a result o f stable producer prices and new investments
made by all three cotton companies. Miningproduction could also pick up in 2006. Higheroil prices
will limit the contribution o fthe industryand services sectors (transportation).

21.     Inflation i s projected to slow in 2006 because inflationary pressures from higher oil prices
will be offset by a large decline in food prices after the record cereal production at end-2005.
Inflation at end-2005 was 4.5 percent, below the annual average o f 6.4 percent. With the
maintenance o f sound fiscal and monetary policy, price increase will remain modest at 2.1 percent,
consistent with the inflation inthe Euro zone. The low inflation will have a positive impact on the
real effective exchange rate, thus improving competitiveness and growth prospects in the tradable
sector.

2006 Budget and Financing Requirements

22.     The 2006 budget reflects the priorities o f the PRSP. Budget allocations for priorityministries
such as basic education, health, agriculture and infrastructure, match or exceed those in the base case
o f the MTEF. Expenditures and net lending will increase to 22.3 percent o f GDP, against 20.6
percent in 2005. The increase in spending i s mostly due to the hiring o f teachers, the financing o f a
program to increase school attainment for girls, and the financing o f the decentralization reform,
particularly the transfers o f education and health responsibilities to local governments and the
organization o fmunicipal elections.

23.     The budget includes appropriations for subsidies to the electricity company (SONABEL) and
for butane and lamp oil. The subsidy to the electricity company i s capped at its level o f 2005
(CFAF18 billion), notwithstanding the projected increase in international oil prices. The issue o f
subsidies to SONABEL i s discussed in detail in the policy areas section o f this report. The budget
has also limited subsidies (CFAF3 billion) for fertilizers in the cotton sector. The subsidy was first
introduced in 2003 in the aftermath o f a major political crisis in C6te d'Ivoire that disrupted the
supply lines and led to an increase in transportation costs and fertilizer prices. The mitigation
measure will be phased out in 2007. The budget does not include a support to the price mechanism in
the cotton sector.

24.     Revenue collection i s expected to increase as a result o f the continuous implementation o f
revenue-enhancing measures, including the completion o f the taxpayer census in Ouagadougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso in early 2006 and the implementation o f the computerized revenue management
system (Circuit Informatisk de la Recette, CIR). Revenue as a percentage o f GDP i s projected at
13.3, up from 12.6 in 2005. The overall fiscal deficit - excluding grants  - i s projected at 9.0 percent
o f GDP and will be essentially financed by external financing (Table 2), including by the proposed
PRSC-6, disbursements under the IMF's PRGF, debt relief from HIPC and the MDRI, and program
support by other multilateral and bilateral donors (Afncan Development Bank, European Union,
Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland).

External and Monetary Projections

25.     Cotton exports will rebound in 2006 but because oil imports will remain high, the trade
deficit will only improve from 8.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 7.7 percent in 2006. The trade deficit
will remain higher than its level in 2004 before the rise in oil prices. The balance o f services and
income is projected to be broadly stable in 2006, and as a result, the external current account deficit
-excluding transfers-would improve at 11.3 percentofGDP, from 12.3 percentin2005.                    The
current account deficit will be hlly financed by net current transfers (2.6 percent), capital transfers
(4.2 percent), net external disbursements (3.1 percent), private capital inflows (0.7 percent), and by
drawing down international reserves (0.7 percent). Gross international reserves will be equivalent to
4.6 months imports, which seem to be adequate.

26.     The supranational national Central Bank will pursue its prudent monetary policy in 2006,
with the explicit objectives o f containing inflation. Money supply is projected to increase by 7.3
percent in 2006, in line with increase in the nominal GDP. Credit to the private sector would
increase by about 10 percent, which is evidence there i s no crowding out o f private investors and
also indicates the monetary policy i s not overly restrictive.

Debt Sustainability

27.      A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by Fund and Bank staff using
the DSA template for low-income countries. The DSA does not take into account the impact o f the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).Based on the analysis o fthe baseline scenario and several
alternative scenarios, the Staffs concluded that Burkina Faso's debt dynamics are sustainable but the
country faces a moderate risk o f debt distress. The full DSA i s summarized inAnnex 8.

28.      Burkina Faso's external debt stock net o f HIPC debt relief stood at USD 1.75 billion at end-
2004. 72.6 percent o f this debt i s owed to multilateral creditors, such as IDA (49.2 percent), the
Afncan Development Bank (18.1 percent) and the IMF (5.3 percent). Most o f the bilateral debt i s
held by non-Paris Club members, some o f whom have not yet delivered their share o f debt relief.
ECOWAS has not indicated that it will participate inthe HIPC initiative.

29.      In April 2002, Burkina Faso reached the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative. At the time, it was judged that exogenous factors outside o f the government's control
(such as falling cotton prices) had contributed to a significant deterioration o f Burkina Faso's debt
outlook and the country became the first HIPC to obtain an additional topping-up o f the Enhanced
HIPC assistance. As o f end-2004, Burkina Faso's debt situation looks more optimistic than had been
projected at the Completion Point. Despite adverse exchange rate movements and higher than
anticipated new borrowing, the country had a NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio that was below the one
projected at the Completion Point (183.1 percent and 192.5 percent respectively).

30.      The findings from Debt Sustainability Analysis lead the Staffs to conclude that while
Burkina Faso's debt dynamics are sustainable, the country faces a moderate risk o f debt distress. The
debt situation is sustainable because, with the exception o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio, all debt
indicators remain well below the policy-contingent indicative thresholds, both under the baseline and
under the alternative scenarios. The NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio breaches the indicative threshold
for some years under the baseline before improving gradually in the outer years o f the projection
period. Taken as a whole, the Staffs didnot view the temporary breach o f that threshold as indicative
of a fundamental debt problem.

31.      However, the results from the alternative scenarios underscore the need for the authorities to
continue to implement sound macroeconomic policies and reforms towards achieving higher export
growth and other growth-enhancing measures. The alternative revenue scenario highlights the
importance o f maintaining efforts to improve revenue collection. Those reforms combined with
unwavering resolve to attract financing at favorable terms -- preferably through grants -- would help
Burkina Faso in achieving progress towards the MDGs while maintaining external debt
sustainability.

MultilateralDebt Relief Initiative

32.      On March 28, 2006, Executive Directors o f the IDA approved Burkina Faso's eligibility to
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). MDRIrelief by IDA will be provided o n future debt
service falling due on the end-2003 debt stock and the provision o freliefwould start as o f July 2006.
Until2044, accumulated debt service savings for Burkina Faso with IDA would amount to SDR497
million.

33.      On December 21, 2005, the IMF Executive Board approved debt relief for Burkina Faso
under the MDRI(see Press Release No 05'286). The IMFwill provide 100 percent debt relief on all
debt incurred by Burkina Faso to the IMF before January 1, 2005 that remains outstanding. This

                                                  - 8 -

amounts to approximately US$89 million, or USS82 million excluding remaining assistance under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.

34.              IMF and IDA Directors noted that Burkina Faso has qualified for MDRI because o f its
overall satisfactory recent macroeconomic performance, progress inpoverty reduction, and improved
public expenditure management. The Directors o f the African Development Fund (ADF) will
consider Burkina Faso's eligibility to the MDRIin M a y 2006. ADF will provide debt relief as o f the
end-2004 debt stock, and debt relief i s expected to be delivered retroactively as o f January 2006. For
memory, ADF owned in 2004 18.1 percent o f Burkina Faso's external debt stock net o f HIPC debt
relief, equivalent to US$317 million. The impact o f the MDRI on Burkina Faso's debt sustainability
i s summarized in figure 1.

 Adequacy of the MacroeconomicFramework

 35.              The macroeconomic framework i s adequate for the purposes o f the proposed PRSC 6. This
 assessment i s based on the solid track record o f macroeconomic stability which has created the
 conditions for growth o fper capita income while maintaining debt sustainability.

 36.              The Government has achieved macroeconomic stability- despite adverse external shocks-
 through prudent monetary and fiscal policies. Average inflation has been kept below 3 percent inthe

                                                                                      - 9 -

past decade, which has helped to prevent an appreciation o f the real effective exchange rate, thus
preserving the competitiveness gain from the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994.In turn, the renewed
competitiveness i s a main factor behind the recovery o f the cotton sector which now accounts for
about 70 percent of total exports earnings. In the medium-term macroeconomic framework, the
Government aims at maintaining annual inflation rate below 2 percent, consistent with inflation in
the Euro zone and the peg to the Euro. Because inflation i s equivalent to a regressive tax, recent
achievements on that front as well as ongoing policies appear to be pro-poor

37.     The equity in fiscal operations was considered in the Poverty Assessment report completed
by the Bank in July 2004 (Report no. 29743-BUR). The broad conclusions on the fiscal reforms
undertakenby the government in the late 1990s (trade reform, lower trade tariff and introduction o f a
VAT), and more recent efforts to improve the collection o f the progressive income tax, support the
view that the revenue collection i s equalizing. This effect arises from the reduction in the tax burden
on imports and exemption o f unprocessed food from the domestic taxes (VAT). The customs and
VAT reform have reduced some o f the high barriers for agricultural inputs, thus contributing to
growth inrural areas where the vast majority o f the poor (90 percent) are occupied.

38.     The Public Expenditure Review (Report No. 29154-BUR) completed in June 2004 indicates
that the budget overall poverty focus i s adequate with an increasing share o f the budget going to
social expenditures. Poverty-reducing social expenditures increased from 4.7 percent o f GDP in
2003 to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2004. There i s a focus o f expenditure on the most deprived regions to
build and equip schools and health centers and a focus on raising female education rates. For
instance, since 2001, the Government i s providing subsidies to the 20 provinces with the lowest
school attainment rate (eliminating school fees and providing school materials to pupils from poorest
households). Recently, the Government has protected priority spending when resources levels were
inadequate. For the medium term, the Government has finalized a Social Protection Strategy that will
identify policies to insulate the poor against shocks. The completion o f the social protection strategy
is a benchmark under the proposed operation.

39.     As a member o f the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Burkina Faso
complies with the criteria of the Convergence, Stability, Growth and Solidarity Pact that calls for a
surplus in the primary fiscal balance. However, overall fiscal and external imbalances are large
because o f the low resourcesbase and the subsequent low revenue to GDP ratio. While Burkina Faso
i s implementing reforms to improve revenue collection, it has kept fiscal and external imbalances at
levels consistent with available concessional financing. There i s no inflationary financing o f the
deficit and no crowding out o f the private sector. Burkina's external debt dynamics remain
sustainable even when excluding the impact o fthe MDRI.

40.     Macroeconomic stability and low inflation have contributed to the economy growing on
average by 6 percent since 1994, among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Growth was mainly
driven by the amcultural sector, in part due to policies that have prevented the appreciation o f the
REER. There has been a large decrease inthe poverty rate giventhat most o fthe population live in
rural areas and thus depend on agnculture. The Bank's Poverty Assessment (PA) indicates that
economic growth has resultedin the poverty headcount decreasing from 54.6 percent in 1998 to 46.4
percent in 2003. The PA also concludes that the target poverty rate reduction to 30 percent by 2015
can be achieved ifthe country maintains an annual real GDP growth rate of approximately 5 percent
as envisaged inthe medium-term macroeconomic framework.

41.     The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF) approved a three-year PRGF
arrangement on June 11, 2003 to support the Government's economic reform program for 2003-06.


                                                 - 10-

The fifth review of the current PRGF arrangement was completed on March 13, 2006, thus.keeping
up with a perfect record of successful PRGF arrangements since 1994. In completing the fifth
review, the IMF noted that macroeconomic management remains strong and the authorities have
established a good basis for coping with the external shocks that emerged during the second half of
the year 2004, while pursuingpoliciesto achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.


        111. BURKINA FASO'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

42.     The Government approved a second full PRSP (PRSP-2) in 2004. PRSP-2 builds on the
achievements under the first PRSP, and further improves the quality of the poverty reduction strategy
by strengthening the participatory base, introducing a regional dimension, and designing a
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system that addresses the issues identified in the first PRSP.
PRSP-2, its accompanyng Priority Action Plan (PAP) and a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were
reviewed by the Executive Directors in May 2005, in parallel with the PRSC-5. The JSAN presents
inmore detail the strengthsofthe revisedPRSP, and outlines the steps andpolicy directions needed
to help the authorities address gaps inthe poverty strategy.

43.     PRSP-2 builds on the same four pillars as the original PRSP: (i)accelerating equitable
growth; (ii)  ensuringthat the poor have access to basic social services; (iii)expanding opportunities
for employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance.
The proposed operation supports the implementation ofPRSP-2 along these four pillars.

44.      Specific government programs under the first pillar include ensuring macroeconomic
stability, increasingthe competitiveness o f the economy and reducing factor costs, providing support
to productive sectors and accelerating development in rural areas where the majority o f poor live.
Under the second pillar, Government aims to improve the access to and quality of education, health
and nutrition, potable water and sanitation, housing and social protection. Under the third pillar,
programs seek to reduce the vulnerability o f agncultural activities, modernize agriculture, provide
support to producers' organizations, increase and diversify rural income, and open up rural areas.
Under the fourth pillar, governance and decentralization issues are addressed. The logical framework
of PRSP-2, including a description o f the policies and programs to be implemented in 2004-2006, i s
presentedinannex 2.

45.     The new PRSP expands the number of priority sectors which now include - in addition to
health, education, and rural development - food security, access to potable water, HIV/AIDS, social
inclusion, gender, environment, employment and informal sector, development o f small and medium
enterprises and industries, including small-scale mining, security, rural electrification and ICT
programs. The expanded list o f priority sectors - a result o f the large consultations during the
revision o f the PRSP - poses new challenges for the financing o f the strategy and the capacity to
implement it. The Government will need the support of its partners to adequately hnd these
priorities given the constraints on its ability to mobilize additional domestic resource. The new
resources shouldbe preferably in grant terms to prevent the risk o f debt distress. The MDRIi s a first
step inthat direction.

Participatory Process

46.     PRSP-2 preparation was highly participative. Ten regional consultations were organized
bringing together about three thousand (3,000) participants from the 13 regions of the country.
Stakeholders represented diverse socio-economic groups in addition to public officials. The


                                                 - 11-

objectives o f these regional consultations were to reflect the views of the stakeholders in these
regions, and to provide each region with a regional PRSP. Meetings were also held with all the heads
o f ministerial departments with the primary objective to strengthen the link between PRSP and the
ongoing sectoral policies. These meetings allowed to build ownership o f the PRSP among key
officials  in sectoral ministries, restate the role o f sectoral policies and programs in the
implementation of PRSP and led to the broadeningo f sectoral coverage with the introduction of new
themes such as public security, youth employment, social exclusion, gender and development,
environment and living standards, SMIs/SMEs, rural electrification, small-scale mining, and
migration. These meetings stressed the needto add a matrix o fperformance indicators to the revised
PRSP and to devote particular attention to national capacity building.

47.      Two stocktaking workshops were held in Bobo-Dioulasso and in Ouagadougou. The latter
brought together about sixty participants from the public administration, the University and Research
Institutes, the private sector, and civil society organizations. The workshop reviewed an independent
assessment o f the draft PRSP and made suggestions about the relevance o f the strategic options and
policies described in the draft. Civil society organizations took the initiative to organize a forum
aimed at enhancing their ownership o f the PRSP and contributing to the revision process and to its
implementation.     The final declaration o f the forum i s summarized in Box 3 o f the PRSP-2
document.

48.      A national conference on the PRSP was also held, involving approximately 600 participants,
including members o f the Government, representatives o f the deconcentrated, and decentralized
administration, the private sector, civil society organizations which included producer organizations,
the Children's Parliament, representatives o f the thirteen administrative regions, and donors. PRSP-2
was also brought before the Economic and Social Council, an institution with broad representation
(public administration, private sector, and civil society). The council devoted its first session o f 2004
to the PRSP review.        The major recommendations set forth in the report submitted to the
Government were taken into account. Furthermore, in implementation o f the provisions o f Articles
 101 and 112 o f the Constitution, the Minister o f Economy and Development submitted the new
version o f the PRSP to Parliament, a critical step inasmuch as Parliament approves the national
budget.


                          IV. BANK SUPPORTTO THE PRSP

                                              LINKTOCAS

49.      The FY06-09 CAS was discussed by the Executive Directors on June 28, 2005. The CAS
builds on the revised full PRSP and large consultations to define a results framework that explicitly
defines the assumed causal links between IDA-supported activities, direct outcomes of these
activities and the country's higher-level development outcomes. Specifically, the CAS will seek to
contribute to the following outcomes:

50.      Accelerated and shared growth. IDA support enhanced regional integration, expanded and
diversified export earnings, an improved investment climate, decentralized urban development to
promote urban-rural linkages, and economic infrastructure needed to reduce factor costs and
stimulate private sector investment and growth.

51.      Improved access to basic social services. IDA continue to support access to basic education
and improved quality o f teaching, expanded coverage o fbasic health care and HIV/AIDS prevention


                                                   -12-

and treatment and increased access to clean water and sanitation, particularly in urban areas. IDA
will also provide technical input for better targeting of social protection to the most vulnerable
groups.

52.     Increased employment and income opportunities for the poor. A two-pronged approach
focuses, first, on the labor market and employment strategy for urban workers. Second, IDA support
efforts to reduce risk, increase revenues, upgrade economic and market infrastructure and enhance
women's opportunities in rural areas, along with promoting community-based land and natural
resource management for sustainable development.

53.     Better governance with greater decentralization. Governance affects the achievement o f
development outcomes across all strategic pillars and sectors. Efforts to enhance governance and
accountability are integral to all IDA-supported activities. Particular emphasis i s placed on
supporting a more efficient judiciary, promoting public resource management and increased
decentralizationand strengthening local capacity and participation inpublic policy decisions.

54.      The proposed operation is an integral part of the FY06-09 CAS. It fits well with the key
features o f the FY06-09 CAS which are a stronger focus on results; an increasingly programmatic
approach to reduce transaction costs associated with outmoded project approaches; and enhanced
support for country systems and capacity. The CAS notes that self and independent evaluation o fthe
first PRSC series in Burkina concluded that increased reliance on development policy lending has
effectively supported implementation o f the PRSP while improving predictability o f aid flows and
encouraging harmonization and alignment among external partner. As Burkina implements its
revised full PRSP, the CAS proposed PRSCs that would be fbrther results-focused, better
harmonized with other budget support and would help to strengthen national capacity to monitor and
evaluate progress.

                        COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS


Collaborationwith the IMF

55.      IDA and IMF's partnership in supporting Burkina Faso's development strategy has been
excellent over the past few years. Bank and Fund managements have reviewed the Government's
PRSP through joint staff advisory notes, reaching understanding on the strength o f the PRSP as well
as on ways that the two institutions could assist the authorities inaddressing shortcomings. Bank and
IMFBoards discussedthe PRSP-1andPRSP-2, andthe five PRSPAPRs to date. IDAand IMFstaffs
have continued to carry out joint missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic policy dialogue
with the Government.

56.      The two teams have been consulting early in the preparation o f their operations in order to
avoid cross-conditionality or overlap conditionality. For instance IMF staffs have shared their
mission briefs and mission reports with Bank staffs. Bank staffs have invited IMF staffs in the
concept review and the decision meetings o f the PRSCs. The coordination has been usefbl to take
account o f the other institution's views inthose areas where it has the lead and thereby enhance the
quality and consistency o f policy advice. In addition, staffs o f both institutions have attended the
other's Board sessions to respondto the Executive Directors' concerns.

57.      Bank and IMF staff executed joint analytical work with the HIPC AAP in June 2004 and a
Debt Sustainability Analysis in June 2005. The Bank has used analysis by IMF staffs to define
PRSC measures pertaining to public finance management and the monitoring o f external assistance.

                                                 - 13 -

The IMF has relied on the Bank experts in the areas of privatization o f the energy and
telecommunications sectors and removal of administrative obstacles to the creation of enterprises
and private investment. IMF and Bank staffs have also worked jointly inthe cotton sector, with IMF
staff focusing on the impact on government finances and the banking sector, while Bank staff took
the lead onthe sector's structural reform agenda.

Collaboration with Other Donors

58.      InJanuary 2005, the Government of Burkina Faso and a group ofpartners6- including the
World Bank - signed a joint Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) that creates a common
framework for delivering budget support based on the adequacy of the macroeconomic performance,
sound public sector resource management and effective PRSP implementation. With Germany and
the African     Development Bank subsequently joining the MOU, all budget supports are now
regulated by this new framework. The M O Uis centered on the government's priority action program
(PAP) that operationalizes the revised PRSP, and a jointly agreed performance matrix. The M O U
was presented in annex 7 of the PRSC-5 program document. The By-laws of the M O Uare presented
inannex 11ofthis programdocument.

59.      The proposed PRSC-6 is aligned with the new donor harmonization framework. While a
joint performance matrix was not prepared at the time the policy matrix for PRSC-6 was considered
by the Board in May 2005 (during the review of PRSC-5), adequate coordination has assurance a
broad alignment with the joint matrix that was subsequently prepared. A full alignment i s expected
with the next series of PRSC. An independent evaluation of the M O U was carried out in February
2006. The evaluation noted that - overall - the new framework was effective in cutting transaction
costs, and aligning support with the budget cycle. In 2005, actual disbursements o f budget support
were CFAF93.1 billion (3.3 percent o f GDP), equivalent to 99.1 percent o f programmed support.
Over 75 percent o f that support was provided in the first three quarters. The independent evaluation
recommended the Government and its partners in the M O U to strive to further improving the
alignment with the budget cycle, harmonize donors' preparation missions and the planning o f
analytical work, and further streamline thejoint performance assessmentframework.

60.      The independent evaluation reviewed the functioning o f the M O U based on six criteria, the
outcome of which i s presented in table 3 below, the higher the score the stronger the contribution to
the functioning o f the M O U for budget support. Dialogue: measured by the participation to the bi-
annual ordinary sessions. A participation at a high-level (mission chief and/or or resident
representative) scores 2, while a participation at a technical level scores 1. The participation to the
technical meeting provides a score o f 1. Harmonization: measured by the chairmanship o f a
thematic and sectoral commission, or the Secretariat for the budget support group (score o f 1).

61.      Alignment: the first indicator is the share o f budget support in total assistance, with a score
of 3 for a share above 50 percent, a score of 2 for a share between 25 and 50 percent, a score o f 1for
a share between 5 and 25 percent, and a score of 0 othenvise; the second indicator relates to the flow
of information to the ministry of finance regarding total aid. It i s assumed that the information flow
i s ideal for aid implemented by the Government (score o f 2), and informationflow i s less perfect for
donors-executed assistance(score o f 1).

62.      Predictability: a first indicator is the availability o f a multi-year financing agreement, with a
3-year (or more) agreement scoring 3, other frameworks scoring 1, and the lack o fagreement scoring
0; a second indicator relates to disbursement schedule: there is a score o f4 for a disbursement inthe

  EuropeanUnion, Denmark, France, Netherlands,Norway, Switzerland

                                                      - 14-

first quarter, 3 for the second quarter and so on. Single tranche operation scores twice than multi-
tranche operations (for instance 8 in the first quarter). Coordination: donors that have had a seat on
the Secretariat score 2.

                                  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

63.       The linkages to other Bank operations are discussed inthe description o f the policy areas for
this proposed operation. In summary, the CAS recognized the PRSCs as the main instrument for
providing support to PRSP implementation, but it also stated that complementarities o f efforts
between programmatic support, capacity building activities and investment lending are keys to
ensure efficient use of Bank resources. Three operations are direct companions to the PRSC series.
First, the administration capacity buildingproject (FY05) which aims at buildingcapacity for policy
formulation and implementation,               streamlining public administration, modernizing personnel
management, and enhancing the poverty focus o f expenditure. It also reinforces the capacity of
planning directorates (DEP) to evaluate policy outcomes and make more effective use o f available
poverty statistics and result indicators under the PRSP process. Second, the statistical capacity
buildingproject (FY04) which addresses the issue o f capacity and shortcomings inthe M&E system
by strengthening data collection and reporting. Third, a decentralized urban capacitybuildingproject

Growth and EmploymentCreation

Objectives
65.      Accelerate real gro\.s.tli and reduce the iiicideiice o f poverty. Improve the competitiveness and
economic perfoiiiiaiice o f tlie cottoii sector. Introduce private sector participation in the utilities
sector, thus increasing access, loweriiig cost and enhancing competitiveness. Improve investment
climate to promote private investment.

Areas o f faster progress
66.      Burkina has achieved macroeconomic stability. As a result o f strong niacroecoiiomic
perfomiaiice, real GDP growth lias averaged 6 percent in 2001-2005, and was driveii by tlie
agriculture sector which provides a living to the majority o f the poor. I t is estimated that povei-ty
iiicideiice lias reduced by about 5 percentage points siiice 2003.

67.      Burkina lias had a stellar perfoiinaiice in the cotton sector. Tlie legal monopoly o f SOFITEX
was removed and the sector i s now liberalized. Two newcomers and SOFITEX alike are niakiiig
significant investments. Production increased from 276 thousand tons in 2000 to 75 1 thousand tons
in 2005. Burkina is iiow the largest cottoii producer in Africa. Burkina exports to over 50 countries,
iiicludiiig the major textile producers. Tlie sector has perfectly weathered the recent fall in
international cottoii prices without public subsidies (other than for a small subsidy for fertilizers): the
three cottoii companies have repaid their debt to the coniiiiercial banks by end-2005. Several studies
for the diversification o f crops were also undertaken. Cereal production was also the highest ever in
2005.

68.      The cellular telephone market was liberalized and the sector i s growing fast. Subscribers
increased from 240 thousands in 2003 to about 400 thousands in 2005. The telecoiiiniuiiicatioii
sector i s regulated by an independent regulatory agency eiisuriiig iiitercoiiiiectioii with tlie state-
owned fixed lines under fair conditions. The rural telephony was liberalized at end-2005 and the
Govemnient has requested expression on interests for private participation in that segment.

Areas o f slower progress
69.      While tlie government has brought ONATEL to tlie point o f sale, and concluded the
privatization o f oiie hotel, the divestiture program has stalled overall, particularly in the energy
sector. The privatizatioii o f ONATEL was not successfLi1 because o f unfavorable teinis related to
goveiiinieiit's share in the capital o f the company. The Goveiiiiiient has now relaunched the
privatizatioii with more favorable teims, providing outright majority to the private pai-tner.
Iiivestnieiit climate refomis are picking up with the creation o f one-stop shops for business start-up
formalities, but Burkina stills ranks poorly in the global iiidex for business climate, notably for labor
market. Progress in the energy sector, stai-tiiig with the regulatory framework, and improved
investment climate would be areas o f focus in the next series o f PRSCs.

Areas o f faster progress
 71.     A number o f measures laid the ground to achieve a significant iiicrease iii supply o f
 education services at sustainable expenditure levels. The Goveiiiiiieiit provided sufficient fiiiaiicing
 for the expaiisioii o f tlie education sector through the national budget. It expanded teachers training

by ending the automatic hiring of graduates of teacher training colleges into the civil service. The
government continued the subsidization of school supplies inthe 20 provinces with lowest schooling
levels. It expanded the number of schools equipped with running water and sanitation facilities.
Gross primary enrollment rates increased from 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 58.1 percent in 2004-
2005.

72.     The g o v e m e n t introduced policies and institutional measures rendering all preventive
services at the primary health care level free o f charge. A vaccination campaign was successfully
implemented. Between 1999 and 2005, vaccination rates increased from 60 to 111.7 percent (BCG),
from 42 to 96.2 percent (DTCP3), from 53 to 84 percent (measles), and from 50 to 84 percent
(yellow fever). Prices of essential generic drugs were reduced through a reduction of the profit
margins o f the National Drug Procurement and Distribution Company (CAMEG) in 2002. As a
result, tracking surveys conducted as part o f the PRSP process indicate that the measure resulted
ina 15-30percent decline of the cost of standard medical interventions. To increase funds at the
health district level, the government introduced the delegation o f credits to district managers and
66 petty cash accounts (rkgies d'avance) were created in 2003. Infant and under-five mortality
rates decreased during the 1998-2003 period, inpart due to increased coverage o f primary health
services. Infant mortality rate reached 83 deaths per 1,000 live births, down from 105 in 1999.

Areas o f slower proa-ess
73.      Inthe education sector, after the initial attention on increasingenrollment, the focus should
now shift on improvingquality which remains poor. Inthe health sector, nutrition issues also remain
o f concern, and would need to be tackled within a multisectoral framework. Lastly, there remains
the issue o f personnel management evidenced by the difficulty to post education and health workers
inrural and remote areas. Financial incentives introduced in 2005 have not had an impact yet. This
issue will be a priority focus of the next series of PRSCs, in the context o f the ongoing
decentralization reform.

Good Governance

Obiectives
74.      Improve link between resources allocation and the objectives o f growth and poverty
reduction. Improve transparency in public expenditure management. Improve personnel
management. Improve local service delivery through the implementationo f decentralization reform.

Areas o f faster progress
75.      Budget preparation has improved with the introduction o f a global MTEF, ensuring
alignment o f budget allocation with PRSP priorities. The integration o f the global MTEF into the
budget preparation cycle in 2002-03 also led to increasingrealism o f revenue targets and improved
the budget arbitration. Budget execution is also more effective with the operation o f a computerized
expenditure management system that captures all domestically financed expenditures, and the
deconcentration o f spending authority. The delegation o f credits to regions and provinces i s effective
and i s helpingto to accelerate delivery o fbasic services. The deconcentration o f issuance o fpayment
orders has been steadily expanding since a successful pilot in2003 inthe second-largest city, Bobo-
Dioulasso, has been effective. Procurement reforms were fully implemented, including the adoption
of procurement decree in line with international best practice, the adoption o f manual of procedures
and new standard bidding documents, and the creation of a procurement reform committee
comprisingof satakeholders from public as well as civil society.



                                                  - 17-

76.      Budget reporting and good governance have strengthened, allowing improving efficiency of
spendingand fighting against corruption. An independent Supreme Audit Court was created and the
government caught up with its legal obligation to submit budget execution reports and accounting
statements. The Government also created and staffed a High Authority for the Coordination o f the
Fight against Corruption. These achievements should be strengthened by further increasing the
capacity o f audit institutions. A good governance plan was prepared and disseminated to all
provincial authorities. A budget management reform plan (Plan d'action pour le renforcement de la
gestion budgktaire or PRGB) was adopted in July 2002, integrating the recommendations o f the
CFAA, and is being implementedwith the support o f all donors.

77.      The adoption o f the decentralization law and the selection o f governors at end- 2004 was a
major achievement directly supported by the PRSCs and the projects portfolio. The law has fulfilled
its role o f requiring central government to start coming to gnps with fiscal and administrative
decentralization. The effective transfers o f competences and resources to sub-national governments,
thus improving service delivery, is the new challenge that would be supported by the next series o f
PRSC.

Areas o f slower urogress
78.      Civil service reform has also advanced with the development o f the computerized civil
service payroll and salary management system (SIGASPE). The government also instituted a new
personnel management system based on mission letters and performance reviews. However, there
are still missingmodules inthe SIGASPE (notably in career management and statistical module) and
dissemination has been limited. The implementation o f a merit-based promotion system i s not
effective yet.


                                          LESSONSLEARNED

79.      The Bank approved its first credit to Burkina Faso on February 11, 1969. IEG conducted a
country assistance evaluation (CAE) o f IDA'Ssupport to Burkina Faso over the period FY88-FY00,
and recommended that IDAplay a greater role inhelping the Government establish a framework for
integrating the activities o f all donors, reforming governance, scaling up decentralization, and
reorganizing the cotton sector. IEG also identified a critical need across all sectors for better
monitoring and evaluation. Lessons drawn from the implementation of the previous CAS (FYOO-
FY05) include the recognition that sustained commitment to sound policies creates the basis for
accelerated growth; diversification and decentralization are critical to more inclusive growth; and
strengthening capacity and country systems will enhance results and sustainability, and lastly
progress on simplification and harmonization has laggedbehind rhetoric.

80.      These lessons are taken into account inthe new CAS. They are also reflected inthe choice o f
PRSC as the main financing instrument o f the CAS, and in the scope and content o f these PRSCs.
The CAS states that the use o f the PRSC instrument to support implementation o f the poverty
reduction strategy -- and harmonization o f budget support among donors -- has been a major benefit
for the client including by strengthening capacity and country systems. The focus o f this proposed
operation and future PRSC i s also on accelerating broad-based growth and moving to greater
decentralization.

Lessonsfrom the Implementationof PRSC 1-5

81.     The ImplementationCompletion Reports o f PRSC-3 'and PRSC-4" observed that the PRSCs
have reinforced country's ownership and improved development outcomes, but noted that despite
these achievements, a number o f challenges remain in stimulating growth and diversification;
improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue; aligning budget support with the budget cycle;
improving the link between policy actions and the monitoring and evaluation framework, reducing
transaction costs associated with lack o f harmonization inthe delivery o fbudget support.

82.     These lessons have been reflected in the design o f the PRSCs as they have emerged. In
particular, there is a continuous emphasis on growth and employment creation; the improvement o f
PRSC-related sectoral dialogue i s being achieved through the development o f sectoral MTEF for the
health (PRSC-5) and education (PRSC-6) sectors; there i s an increased focus on evidence-based
policy making with the adoption o f the PAP; alignment with the budget cycle has improved with
disbursements now planned around the government's mid-fiscal year; there is greater harmonization
with the adoption ofthe unified framework for budgetary support.


                                          ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

83.      The government's development strategy and the series o f PRSCs continue to benefit from a
variety of analytical work. Several analytical reports were completed in FY04-FY05. Analytical
works completed in FY04 include a Public Expenditure Review; a Rtsk and Vulnerability
Assessment; an Investment Climate study by FIAS, and a Gender Assessment. In FY05 the Bank
completed a Poverty Assessment and a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The
CPAR findings guide the procurement reform in the next series o f PRSC. The Bank joined several
other donors to undertake a pro-poor growth study. Inaddition, the Bank and the IMFworked jointly
with the IMF to update the Accountability Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) on the tracking of
poverty expenditure under the Heavily IndebtedPoor Country (HIPC).

84.      A set o f studies are underway to assist in identifylng priority reform fur spurring growth,
diversification and employment. These studies scheduled for completion in FY06 include a labor
market study and an investment climate assessment (ICA). In late 2005, the Bank also camed out
short technical missions to support the design o f the decentralization reform and a social protection
strategy. The studies and technical missions conductedby BurkinabC and Bank teams would help the
Government revise its PRSP and PAP, and will feed in the reforms programs supported by the next
PRSC operations.

85.      In addition to the analytical work described above, the next series o f PRSC will be
underpinned by a country economic memorandum (CEM), a Financial Accountability Assessment
(possibly using the PEFA framework), an Integrated Trade Framework study, a Financial Sector
assessment and a Decentralization Notes, all to be completed in FY07. Beyond FY07, AAA will
relate to a Poverty Assessment and a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment. Coordination o f
analytical work will be sought under the MOUfor budget support

      V. THE PROPOSEDPOVERTYREDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                        PRSC-6DESCRIPTION


Rationale and Objectives

86.     The proposed PRSC-6 is the third in a series of three annual operations supporting the
implementation o f Burkina Faso's second Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2004-2006. PRSP.2 builds
on the achievements of the first PRSP while innovating on several dimensions: it i s grounded on a
stronger participatory basis, has a more effective M&E system, and benefits from improved donor
coordination through the adoption of a unifiedbudget support framework. Achievements under the
previous PRSCs are generally positive as illustrated by an 8 percent reduction o f poverty incidence
between 1998 and 2003. The proposed operation i s fully aligned with the Africa Action Plan and the
Bank's FY06-09 CAS.

87.     PRSC-6 support PRSP objectives o f     (1)raising growth and equityina stable macroeconomic
environment, thus ultimately reducing the incidence o f poverty; (ii) increasing access to and quality
o f basic social services; (iii)
                               improving employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv)
improvinggovernance with a particular emphasis onpublic sector management.

Scope

88.      The proposedPRSC-6 has three components consistent with the four PRSPpillars: (i)     growth
and employment creation; (ii)   humanresource development; and (iii) governance.
                                                                       good

89.      Under the growth and employment creation component, the proposed operation supports
reforms in the rural, telecommunication, and energy sectors as well as on investment climate (labor
market, regulatory framework) to lower factor costs, increase productivity and favor new
investments.

90.      The second component includes policies inthe education, health, socialprotection and water
infrastructure, to lower the cost o f services, increase access, improve service quality, and reinforce
monitoring and evaluation.

91.      The third component encompasses policy measures to strengthenbudget formulation, budget
execution, procurement, budget management and ex-post control, public sector reform and
decentralization, and environmentalmanagement.

Benefits

92.      The proposed operation would support the Government inpursuingits policy objectives laid
out in the revised PRSP and its accompanying Priority Action Plan (PAP) within a structured
macroeconomic framework by providing sound financing for the execution o f the Government's
2006 budget. It would also provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and
institutional reform to strengthen the overall performance of the economy and contribute to poverty
alleviation. Over the period 2004-2006, it i s expected that the reform program under the series o f
three annual PRSCswould help the Government to achieve a 6 percentage point reduction o fpoverty
 incidence, and increase private sector participation in the cotton, telecommunication and energy
 sectors thus accelerating growth through higher investment and improved competitiveness. It would

                                                  -21 -

also help the Government in making progress toward reaching the MDGs, namely, increase school
enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to safe water, and
strengthen the sustainability o f development efforts.

Overviewof progressmadeunder PRSC-6

93.     Table 4 summarizes the status o f the prior actions for PRSC-6 and table 7 presents a
quantitative assessment o f achievements to date under PRSC4-6. Several outcome indicators are still
missingreflecting the need to strengthen monitoring and evaluation system as already envisioned
under the next series o f PRSCs. Overall, Burkina has maintained a strong pace in reforms
implementation, and has achieved solid results in income growth and poverty reduction, access to
basic services, and better governance. Progress achieved provides a solid basis for moving into
PRSC-6.

GrowthandEmployment Creation
94.     Real GDP growth rate averaged 6.2 percent per annum in 2004-2005 on account o f strong
cereal and cotton production. It i s estimated that the strong growth in sectors providing a living to the
majority o f the poor has resulted ina decline o f poverty incidence from 46.4 percent in 2003 to 42.4
percent in 2005.

95.     Cotton sector reforms were pursued with the inclusion o f two new private ginners in a new
inter-profession for the cotton sector. The State does not have a voting power at the board o f the new
inter-profession. The private management o f the sector and the participation o f producers are
resulting in excellent performance: cotton production increased by 16.9 percent in 2005 against a
benchmark o f 5 percent. Burkina Faso i s now the largest producer inAfrica.

HumanDevelopment
96.     Access to education has improved particularly for girls and in disadvantaged areas. The
adoption o f a sectoral MTEFi s helping rationalize and increase the efficiency o f education spending.
The Government recruited 3,000 teachers and built 1,427 new classrooms. Table 7 indicates that all
education targets but one were matched or exceeded in 2005 (school enrolment rate, school
enrollment rate in disadvantaged areas, primary completion rate, literacy rate, and ratio o f textbooks
to student). The missed target relates to the admission rate in first grade (actual o f 69.7 percent
against a benchmark o f 70.7 percent). However, the target for the same indicator in 20 most
disadvantaged areas was largely exceeded: actual o f 59.6 percent against a target o f 48.8 percent.
Access could have been higher had the schools construction program and teachers recruitment been
executed as planned. These are two areas where additional efforts are still needed, although
Government should also turn its attentionto quality issue.

97.     The Government i s implementing a system o f subsidies for obstetrical emergencies in order
to reduce cost o f assisted births and improve maternal mortality. It has continued the policy o f free
vaccination and distribution o f vitamin A. Targets in the vaccination program were exceeded in
2005. Several health outcome indicators could not be measured because the latest households'
survey or HDS (Health Demographics Survey) dates back from 2003. Nevertheless, available
indicators show that assisted births and the percentage o f health centers meeting personnel
requirements were below the target in 2004. If these poor results are confirmed when the 2005
indicators are available, they will point to the need to accelerate staffing reforms, particularly inthe
context o f the decentralization, to increase the number o f staff inremote areas.

Governance
98.     A National Good Governance Programwas adopted in July 2005. A National Policy Against
Corruption is being finalized. The parliament adopted the 2006 budget in line with the MTEF 2006-
2008 and with the PRSP priorities. The share o f the budget (excluding financing from HIPC relief
and externally-financed projects) allocated to social sectors (health, education, and social action)
increased from 22.6 percent in2003 to 26.6 percent in2005.

99.     The effectiveness o f budget execution was enhanced with the extension o f delegation o f
credits to six ministries against a target o f 4 ministries. Nevertheless the budget execution rate in
priority ministries remains lower than programmed reflecting improvement need inthe management
o f delegation o f credits, particularly in the health sector, andor cumbersome procedures in
externally-financedprojects. The transparency inpublic resource management has improved with the
stepping up o f procurement audits. The Government also adopted an action plan for the reform of
national procurement system based on the recommendation o f the 2005 CPAR. The 2004 budget
execution report was submitted to the Parliament in September 2005, and was subsequently adopted
by the latter inearly 2006.

100.    The building blocks o f the decentralization reform are taking place. The Government
adopted the draft law on the resources and expenses o f local governments. It also adopted the draft
decree for effective transfer o f functions and assets to urban communes. It has also continued the
deployment o fthe CICL (an Integrated accounting system for local governments).

Cotton Sector Reform

Description

102.    Despite the recent problems associated with the fall in world prices, cotton has been a
success in Burkina Faso. Indeed, thanks to sustained development efforts using an "integrated
sector" approach, the country has been able to make cotton its primary export product and the most
widespread cash crop. There are an ever increasing number o f cotton farmers (around 130,000 in
1997 and 200,000 in 2002, representing 18 percent o f the labor force) and cotton farming provides
direct income for some two million persons in Burkina Faso. Cotton sales tripled from 20 percent o f
total exports in the 1980s to 60 percent in the early 2000s, and even reached 71 percent in 2004.
Cotton i s the primary "endogenous" source o f foreign exchange for Burkina Faso, also accounting
for over 6 percent o f GDP and 2 to 4 percent o f government revenue. Cotton i s one o f the main
products used to promote both the modem industrial and the traditional sectors. On the other hand,
Burkina Faso i s probably the WAEMU member country that i s most dependent on a single export
product.

Challenges

103.    Sustaining the remarkable achievements and average annual production growth o f 10percent
since 1990, (among the highest rates in the sub-region), would require to improve y e l d and the
efficiency o f ginning operations. Yields have remained stable at about 1 ton o f seed cotton per
hectare. While technical analyses show that Burkina Faso continues to benefit from a significant
competitive advantage in the cotton sub-sector, production costs, excluding the purchase price from
farmers, remain high compared to those in other countries in the sub-region (for example, variable
costs inBurkina Faso are 40 percent higher than in CGte d'Ivoire, inpart reflecting higher electricity
costs).

Government Actions

104.    The Government i s a shareholder in SOFITEX - the previous monopoly until the
liberalization in 2004  - but has allowed the company to be privately managed.          As a result,
SOFITEX has maintained a prudent management and a rational commercial policy. In 1998,
government reduced its share in SOFITEX from 65 to 35 percent, by transferring 30 percent o f the
shares to UNPCB, the producer organization. In2004, through an open and transparent competitive
tender, SOFITEX's assets the central and eastern regions were sold to two new private companies
(SOCOMA and FASOCOTON). The latter reform was supported by PRSC-4 and PRSC-5.
Government has also beenpreparing a strategic plan for the cotton sector.

Bank's advice and recommendation

105.    Policies spearheaded by the Government o f Burkina Faso have been instrumental in
transforming the country into a leader in cotton production in Sub-Saharan Africa. To consolidate
progress, these policies should be pursued, notably by strengthening producers and private ginners


                                               - 27 -

through the creation of a strong inter-profession, and supporting the transition to a more liberalized,
open and competitive sector. The main objectives o f the strategy should be: (i)strengthening the
sector's competitiveness and maximize benefits for producers, including through a more efficient
fertilizers and pesticides markets; (ii)implementing the regional program on bio-safety; (iii)
supporting diversification o f cotton farming systems, including the adoption o f new technology,
small-scale mechanization, and the introduction o f new varieties o f cotton seed.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

106.     PRSC-6 has supported the creation o f a new inter-professional association for the cotton
sector that includes the two new private operators. The measure i s a follow-up to the liberalization
reforms supported under PRSC 4-5. The objectives are to strengthen coordination in the sector. The
new association was established in February 2006, and i s currently chaired by the producers'
organization.

Non-cotton Agriculture Sector

Description

107.     Agriculture remains the dominant sector o f economic activity in Burkina Faso, accounting
for about 30 percent of GDP, providing employment and income to more than 80 percent o f the rural
population, and generating 60 to 70 percent o f export earnings. Faster agnculture growth will have
several beneficial effects: on poverty reduction: through an increase in rural producers' incomes;
improved trade balance through higher exports earnings and reduced food imports; improved equity
because agnculture i s the main income source for food-crop producers, the poorest group inBurkina
Faso, and more than 90 percent o f the poor live in rural areas; on overall economic growth through
positive externalities and spillovers on non-farm sectors and jobs (transport, trade, food industries
etc).

Challenges

108.     Water resources are scarce. Rainfall i s low and irregular and poses a serious risk for farmers.
This situation pushes them to adopt extensive farming techniques that contribute to soil depletion,
The difficulties o f water management have hindered the development o f irrigated agricultural,
severely limitingpossibility o f crop diversification;

 109.    Rural farmers are not well integrated to markets. A reason i s that the great majority of
farmers engages in subsistence farming and grows very few cash crops. Therefore, they sell little
agricultural produce (only 15 percent of the grain crop i s commercialized) and purchase little
fertilizer and agricultural equipment. Inaddition, producing surplus requires the existence o fmarkets
for such surplus and access to these markets (roads).

 110.    Land degradation i s a major development challenge which cuts across issues o f poverty,
health, the environment, economic growth. It can seriously undermine the achievement o f the
Millennium Development Goals, particularly MDG 1 and MDG 7. Land degradation has a negative
impact on agricultural productivity, vulnerability, integrity and function o f ecologcal systems and
landscapes, carbon storage, hydrological and nutrient cycles, and ultimately, on food security and
economic growth. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) i s a critical component o f the response to
land degradation problem at multiple levels o f impact, from farm and community levels up to
watersheds and basins. S L M combines technologies, policies and activities aimed at integrating
economic incentives with environmental concerns to enhance production, reduce the level o f risk,

                                                   - 28 -

protect natural resources and prevent soil and water degradation in an economically viable and
socially acceptable manner.

111.     Land tenure system is also an issue in rural areas. InBurkina Faso, despite the importance o f
land issues, there i s no proper land policy document particularly inthe rural areas. The only existing
legal document is the Land and Agncultural Reorganization (RAF) document. Written during the
revolutionary era in 1984, the RAFwas revised in 1991 and 1996 respectively. Initially, it was meant
to solve the problem of access to and the use o f land and other natural resources. But in practice, the
RAFexists side by side with customary landlaws, andthe two are often competing.

112.     Beyond the difficulty inthe implementation o f the RAF, the issue o f land tenure and farming
in the rural areas is a matter o f concern. Incertain farming areas, access and land control and its
resources, are often sources o f conflicts among users. The absence o f land tenure in the agriculture
sector (inrural areas) also impedes investments inagriculture.

113.     There i s also a need to rationalize the role o f the State in the rural areas, reform rural
institutions, including the National System o f Rural and Agncultural Training. Several studies and
recent development performances o fmany Asian and Latin American countries demonstrate positive
correlation between the degree/extent o f instruction and successes in poverty reduction and
agricultural growth. It i s important to note that, in Burkina Faso like many Sub-Saharan African
counties national training strategies are non-existence and inoperable. To achieve the millennium
objectives and reduce poverty by half, it i s important and indispensable to reconsider agricultural
system training in a comprehensive way in Burkina Faso following the examples o f Senegal, Benin
and Mali.

Government Actions

 114.    Under PRSC-5, the Government has prepared a text consolidating and harmonizing the
principles and rules o f the execution o f missions transferred or delegated to regional agncultural
chambers (CAR), producers professional organizations (OPA), the inter-professions, and the private
sector, including the modalities and conditions for such as transfer: the new text aims limiting the
State to supervisory functions and transfer other functions to other stakeholders in the sector. The
text clarifies the roles and responsibilitiesfor agncultural development. It is expected that the larger
role o fproducers will improve the economic performanceo fthe sector.

 115.    The Government has finalized the institutional audit o f the Ministry of Agriculture, Water,
and Fisheries (MAHRH): The implementation o f the audit recommendations will help improve the
efficiency and quality o fbasic services o fthe Ministry.

 116.    The Government has continued the implement actions plans for cereals: The action plans
aims at creating favorable conditions for improving the profitability o f cereals production, a key
 element for food security, poverty reduction (cereal i s grown by the poorest producers), and for
agricultural diversification.

 117.    Burkina Faso has also initiated several pilot rural land tenure initiatives. Thus, one could
mention land tenure pilot operation (OPSF) within the framework o f national program for land
management (PNGT2), rural land plan in Ganzourgou province, the ongoing local development
project o f the West (PDLO-Houet) etc.           With regard to improving land tenure issues, the
Government, through the Ministry o f Agriculture, has, launched the preparation o f National Policy
 for Rural Land Tenure. A first draft o f the document was conducted in2004 with the assistance o f an
 international law firm. An extensive consultation process o f the draft i s in progress. The revised

                                                  - 2 9 -

document that will come out the consultative process should be adopted by the Government by
December 2006. It i s expected that local Governments in rural communes and Village Development
Councils will endorse the policy document by June 2007 before it i s enacted into law by December
2008.

Bank's advice and recommendation

118.    Government's strategy to support professionalization o f the agncultural sector through a
legal framework conducive to the emergence o f agricultural professional organization based on an
approach that involves the participation o fproducer representatives seems adequate.    `



119.    The Government's strategy to pursue the divestiture of productive and marketing activities,
while strengthening its role in providing support and advice to private operators (extension, research
and development, information on market conditions) and undertaking efforts to develop sector-
related infrastructure (transport, water etc) and improve the quality o f human resources (basic
education, technical and commercial extension) addresses issues that are relevant. Burkina Faso can
realize substantial gains with respect to growth in productivity and agricultural output by reducing
transport costs and improving services, by implementing water management and irrigation
techniques, by better educating the labor force. The Bank and other partners also fully support the
government inmoving forward on clarifymg land tenure status inrural areas.

120.     Because of the Government's commitment to address land degradation, the interest of
development partners in supporting the scale-up o f SLM, the on-going reforms in Burkina Faso, and
the formulation of the CPP, there is a conducive environment for the Bank (in alliance with its
TerrAfhca partners) to assist the government indeveloping and implementing a comprehensive SLM
agenda in Burkina Faso. In particular, the Bank's activities in land management should align and
support the activities planned and implemented in the CPP. The time i s therefore opportune for the
Bank to take the initiative to respond to the call for better coordination between donors and support a
multi-donor SLM initiative so as to increase the efficiency o f ongoing and new investments in
support of developments in the rural areas. Recognizing that, in order to make a substantial
contribution to reducing the poverty level, a coordinated effort i s required so that positive
experiences can be up scaled and out on a much larger scale than i s possible with the hitherto all too
fragmented approach.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

 121.    Inline with a renewed focus on its core public functions, the Government (FASONORM)
has worked with technical committee representing all relevant stakeholders to define draft standards
and labels for oilseeds products (sesame, cashew nut, shea) and cowpeas (nikbk). The standards
were finalized and adopted in April, 2006 after due process. The introduction o f the standards has
the potential to facilitate trade and the transfer o ftechnology.

 122.    The Government has reduced vulnerability o f agricultural activity through the continuous
building o f manure pits and hydro-agricultural installations. The Government has also improved
access to rural areas through the buildingo f rural roads and the maintenance o f departmental roads.
It has begun the implementation of the action plan drawn from the recommendations o f the
institutional audit o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, Water, and Fisheries (MAHRH). In particular the
restructuring o f the MAHRH was approved on March 22, 2006 in line with the recommendation of
the institutional audit.




                                                   - 30 -

123.    The Government is implementingaction plans for cereals, cowpeas, and oilseed. However,
progress i s limited in providing support to the emergence of professional exporters within the
Oilseed Council o f Burkina Faso and the actors of the cowpeas streams. There are also delays in the
adoption of the texts on the principles and rules on the execution o f missions transferred or
delegated to CRA, OPA, inter-professions, and the private sector.

124.    In the next series of PRSCs, it is proposed to focus on: reducing the risks linked to
agriculture activities, and improving land tenure security. Specific activities include: adoption of the
new land tenure law in rural areas; promoting soil fertility and water management techniques,
promoting small-scale water supplyhnigation systems, establishing and promoting national
awareness and preparedness mechanisms to help manage locust infestations, diversification o f
farming systems, promoting pilot land tenure security program in targeted provinces, and increasing
the visibility o f successful local land management practices. Given the emerging partnership to
support SLM in Burkina Faso, the Bank's activities on land in the medium-termshould align and
support the framework beingestablished by the CPP.

125.     It is also proposed to support the formulation, adoption and implementation of a national
strategy for agncultural and rural training which will include the training o f the rural youth,
continuous training of farmers, and training o f staff and agncultural technicians who will ensure
elaborationand implementation o f coherent agricultural policies.

Livestock Sector

Description

126.     Livestock production accounts for about 10 percent o f GDP and between 15 percent and 20
percent of exports in the 2000s. Burkina Faso i s the second highest exporter o f livestock products
(mainly live animals) on the regional market (WAEMU) behindMali. Livestock provides incomes
(partially or totally) for 86 percent o f the population. The most vulnerable producers and
socioeconomic groups of the sector represent the largest contributors to the sector. Smallholders are
producing about 95% of total meet production, 95 percent o f total milk and 60 percent o f eggs. It i s
also among these smallholders groups that the highest potentialities for improvement are found.
Financially and economically, the sector i s performing well both on local market and on export.
Indirect contribution includes exports o f hides and skins, food industry, animal traction and organic
fertilizers for the agricultural sector. The sector has the potential to play a major role in the
diversification of the economy, exports growth, food security andpoverty reduction.

Challenges

127.     The livestock sector has many challenges to address, amongwhich the most important are (i)
the insufficient national supply to cope with the growing demand in livestock products, (ii)          the
insufficient competitiveness o f products to comply with sanitary standards requested by markets and
consumers, (iii)   the difficulties for the small producers (economic and social aspects) to access
markets and benefit from increasing demand opportunities and (iv) a deteriorating security in
sustainable access and use o f resources for pastoralists; (v) a preoccupying animal health situation
and a high risk of emergence of major epizootic and zoonotic diseases; (vi) a lack o f appropriate
mechanism to prevent, and efficiently manage, external shocks such as animal diseases or pests
(locust), droughts.

 128.    To address these challenges, the control o f animal health as well as food safety aspects i s
crucial since it helps secure the assets o f the Poor, enable intensification and for the livestock

                                                 - 3 1 -

products access national and regional markets. Reinforcement o f Official Veterinary Services i s with
these regards a priority.

129.     Despite the existence o f clear competitive strengths, recent trends have raised concerns about
the potential for increased production and exports in the livestock subsector. Since 1998, exports
have virtually stagnated, and indeed there has been a decline in live animal exports. Although live
animal exports are still competitive, the export o fmeat i s being hampered by inadequate preservation
facilities, competition from imports (e.g. Argentina), and especially the weak market for all the by-
products (the so-called `fifth quarter').     However, there has been rapid growth in the market for
leather goods and crafts in recent years, thanks to the implementation o f a vigorous policy in the
craft and tourist industries.

Government Actions

130.     Under the Livestock, Poverty, and Growth Initiative (IEPC) covering 2002-04 and providing
an in-depth poverty and growth-oriented analysis o f the livestock sector, the Government has
developed a strategy for the livestock sector, with support from the World Bank and the FAO. The
Action Plan and Investment Program for the Livestock sector (PAPISE) was revised to take into
account the outcomes o f the IEPC. One pillar o f the strategy i s the reinforcement o f the public
services and actors.

131.     In this context, the Government has recently made sizable investments to modernize and
expand the slaughterhouses in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso in order to boost meat production
and exports. It has also implemented some prophylactic programs against major animal diseases
affecting economy o f the sector (PPCB, NCD) and human health (rabies). However, the vaccination
coverage i s too l o w to have a significant impact. A center for African swine fever was established in
the province o f Kompienga

Bank's advice and recommendation

 132.    Inthe livestock sector, priority support to the public sector/government shouldconsist in:

 133.    Reinforcing the official Veterinary Services, in charge o f animal health and food safety
(the current crisis with the outbreak o f the Avian Flu in Burkina has demonstrated their importance
to the policy-makers). It i s proposed that, while the PAFASP will focus on technical aspects for the
reinforcement o f the VS capacities (design o f inspection procedures and actions plans), the PRSCs
will (i)help design and implement a new policy in terms o f human resources management
(recruitment, provision o f former and continuing education) for the VS (and laboratories) to have
sufficient and competent agents to ensure their public core-functions. Using the grid for the
evaluation o f the V S designed by the World Organization for the Animal Health (OIE) will be the
basis to assess the needs for human resources; and (ii)      anime discussions on the repartition o f the
national budget among ministers and how to allocate the minister o f livestock with sufficient funds
to ensure their core missions;

 134.    Reinforcing the legal and regulatory framework, with as the main issue to be addressed
the clear definition o f the roles between the private and public sectors in terms o f animal health
delivery. Recommendations provided during the regional OIE / FA0 / IBAR / ALive seminar in
Tchad (February 2006) will serve as references and guidelines. Itwill also be revised to comply with
the WAEMU sub-regional legal framework, as part o f the regional integrationprocess.



                                                   - 32 -

135.    The forthcoming activities aiming at strengthening the public sector will have to take into
account the achievements o f the PRSAPVPNDSAII and o f current programs (PACE"). It i s also
recommended that they follow the recommendations o f the ALive Partnership, which provides a
comprehensive development framework for the rational and concerted development o f the livestock
sector insub-Saharan Africa.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

136.    Measures under PRSC-6 aimed at making the IEPC operational, with a number o f measures
ranging from the adoption and implementation o f an action plan for the promotion o f poultry and
meat exports (definition of standards, label, conditioning, and training o fprofessional exporters), and
increased protection against the Newcastle disease and the contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia.
The preparation o f the action plan for poultry and meat exports i s underway, and the Government has
also continued its vaccination campaign although the coverage remains low.

137.    Itis proposedthat the following activities take place as part o fthe next PRSC series:

    Assessment o f Veterinarian Services (and laboratories) needs interms o f human and financial
    resources (on the basis o f the gnd for V S evaluation draft by OIE); design of an action plan to
    allocate sufficient funds and agents to the VS (and laboratories) at the national and district levels;
    Revisiodconsolidation o fthe legal and regulatory framework in the livestock sector, in
    alignment with sub-regional legislation (WAEMU) and regional recommendations (ALive);
    Implementation o f an action plan to: (i) (providing scholarships for veterinary/technicians
                                                   train
    schools) and recruit VS agents, and (ii)      provide resources (communication tools, vehicles,
    vaccines) for the VS at national and districts levels to ensure their minimumcore-functions.


Telecommunication

Description and challenges

138.    Despite the positive impact in the provision of mobile services due to the liberalization
measures taken by the government, the population still has limited access to telecommunications
services.   Rural and remote communities (where 80 percent o f the population lives) have a
telecommunication penetration ratio o f less than 0.25 lines per 1,000 people.

Government actions

139.    To lower factor costs and entice investments in the sector, the government has pursued the
privatization of the telecommunications operator. A first attempt to bring ONATEL to the point o f
sale was not successful because pre-qualified bidders did not find favourable the terms o f the
privatization.

140.    Inthe wiredtelephone services andthe operation ofsatellite terrestrial terminals (VSAT), the
5-year monopoly o f ONATEL legally ended on December 31, 2005. The exclusivity period was
meant to help ONATEL adjust its operating costs during the transitory period and be prepared to
face competition on all its market segments. The protection has created additional and costly
distortions to the economy because o f the total control o f ISP (Internet Service Protocol) market by



  PACE : Programme Pan-Africain de Controle des Epizooties (EU)

                                                        - 33 -

ONATEL, tariffs have remained abnormally high (a 128 kbit/s i s billed at US$1400 monthly
comparedto US$200 indeveloped countries).

Bank's advice and recommendation

141.     The Bank has supported government efforts to further improve the terms o f the privatization
byproviding an outright majority to potentialbiddersfor ONATEL.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

142.     On March 16, 2005, the Government agreed to revise the terms of the privatization of
ONATEL by keeping a minority share of 23 percent. The privatization process was relaunched but
delays linked to the procurement o f a privatization advisor will not allow completing the original
PRSC-6 measure which was to bring ONATEL to the point of sale and transfer assets to the new
operator. It i s now expected that these measures will be completedby December 2006.


Energy Sector

Description

143.     The role of energy services in achieving sustainable growth is critical but increasing
access would need to be achieved against extremely low starting point and unfavorable
physical conditions. A low 12 percent o f the population has access to electricity (about 40 percent
inurbanareas andabout 1percent inruralareas). Per capita consumptionis 22kwh inBurkina Faso,
compared with 100 kwh in Cameroon, 200 kwh in Senegal and 270 kwh in Cote d'lvoire. The
majority of the population (about 90 percent) still depends on wood energy (firewood and charcoal).
Burkina Faso has no significant known fossil fuel resources. Petroleum product consumption is
entirely dependent on imports (about 400-450,000 tons annually). The country's hydroelectric
potential i s limited, with less than 100 MW o f potential capacity in 5 identified sites. Two
hydropower plants have been developed with 27 M W o f installed capacity and 16 MW o f available
capacity. These plants are vulnerable to erratic rainfall conditions. To expand modem energy
services to rural and peri-urban populations, the interconnection to gnd systems o f neighboring
countries seem to be the most promising options.

Challenges

144.     Burkina Faso faces three main challenges in the energy sector: (i)to solve production
capacity constraints to meet an increasing demand for electricity; (ii)to improve the efficiency and
equity of electricity operations by reforming tariff and subsidy policy in a context o f high supply
costs; and (iii) expand access o f energy services to rural andperi-urban population.
                 to

145.     Need of additional capacity to meet increasing demand for electricity. The demand for
electricity continues to grow at an average of about 7 percent a year inthe Bobo-Dioulasso Regional
Network (CRCB) and in the Ouagadougou Regional Network (CRCO), in line with output and
income growth. Additional power generation capacity i s not following at the same pace creating
important capacity constraints. The transmission interconnection from Ferkessedougou (Cote-
d'Ivoire) to Bobo Dioulasso, in 2001, has alleviated this situation to a certain extent, but shortages
are still important in the CRCO. Available capacity inCRCO i s subject to substantial uncertainty as
SONABEL, the state-owned power company, is considering retiring about 20 MW of capacity by
2006 as some units reach the end o f their economic lives. If the retirement o f thermal units takes


                                                - 34 -

place as scheduled, SONABEL would need at least 30 MW o f additional capacity to fill the
generation gap.

146.    Increase efficiency and equity by reforming tarijJs and subsidies, and selecting least-cost
electricity supply solutions. SONABEL has high electricity supply costs that stem in part from its
complete dependency on imports for its large fuel needs for thermal generation electricity.
Questionable investment decisions in hydropower development and provision o f electricity to very
small, isolated load centers have also adding to the financial burden o f the company. As a result,
electricity tariffs inBurkina Faso are amongst the highest in Sub-Saharan Afnca, averaging U S cents
2lkWh. Yet, even these high tariffs do not reflect full costs and SONABEL has relied on public
subsidies and on-lending from the Government for its operations and equipments needs.

147.    Tariffs were not adjusted between 1994 and 2004. At the devaluation o f the FCFA in 1994,
the Government also decided to provide subsidies to offset the increased costs o f imported inputsfor
SONABEL. The company has since then purchased its fuel consumption at an administrated price
below market prices. The level o f fuel subsidies has steadily increased inthe recent years with higher
oil prices, and reached about US$35 million in 2005. The Government implemented a first step in
the tariff adjustment process, with a 10 percent raise in the average electricity tariff in November
2004. However, after the decade-long tariff freeze and large increase o f input costs, further tariff
adjustments are required to ensure the financial sustainability o f the sector, eliminate subsidies and
ease the prospects o f looming contingent liabilities.

148.    The current tariff and fuel subsidy policies are not equitable and sustainable as they benefit
the wealthiest consumers and their costs increases in proportion to the growth in electricity
consumption. Moreover, the subsidy artificially lowers the cost o f thermal generation for
SONABEL, thus creating a disincentive to invest in transmission lines to connect secondary centers
to the main gnd, and encourages the company to continue to rely on small thermal generators for
secondary centers.

149. Expanding access of energy sewices to rural andperi-urban populations: For BurkinaFaso
to reduce significantly the incidence o f poverty, there i s a crucial need to expand access to modem
energy services. The prevailing low levels o f access constitutes a severe handicap for the
development o f small and medium size productive enterprises and it limits the impact o f existing
social programs. In the past, Burkina Faso has benefited from support of many donors to improve
energy access levels but unfortunately, these efforts were mostly scattered, and successful pilots were
not scaled up. There i s a need to develop a spectrum o f innovative service delivery mechanisms
adaptedto local conditions and constraints, drawing from lessons learnedinpast interventions.

Government Actions

150.     Over the past seven years the Government has been puttinginplace key buildingblocks
for reforming the regulatory environment of the electricity sector. These reforms were initiated
in 1998 with the breakup o f SONABEL's distribution monopoly, followed in2000 by the adoption
of a Letter o f Sector Development Policy emphasizing a private-sector led energy sector
development. The broad lines o f the restructuring o f the sector were completed in 2004 when the
generation segment was opened to competition, and the transmission and distribution segments were
bundled into two sub-regions. The first sub-region covers the current perimeter of SONABEL; the
second sub-region covers all the area outside SONABEL's perimeter. Operations in the second sub-
region will be eligible for financing through the Rural Electrification Fund (REF). The Government
also decided to implement a leasing arrangement, splitting SONABEL into a publicly-owned assets


                                                 - 35 -

company and a privately-ran management company. In 2005, the Government voted in a law which
aimed at providing regulatory provisions in the energy sector.

151. To fill the supply gap on the CRCO, the Government has opted to builda transmission
line from Bobo Dioulassoto Ougadougou, thus extend the interconnectionwith the grid power
of CBte d'Ivoire. The interconnection provides a substantially lower cost solution than the
alternative o f further investing in generation capacity. The 225 kV Ferkessedougou             -  Bobo
Dioulasso transmission line has a transfer capability o f 120 MW (compared to a 23 MW peak
demand on the CRCB) and the purchase price for SONABEL i s about U S cents 7/kWh.
Nevertheless, the reliability o f the international interconnection needs to be further developed, and
the Government should develop a sound strategy to address the production capacity deficits in the
short term while the interconnection with neighboring countries i s underway. Burkina i s providing
strong support to the WAPP (West A h c a n Power Pool) to advance the Ghana-Burkina
interconnection.

152.     The Governnment has recently completed a study o f tariff mechanisms that will allow
reforms inthat area. It has also launched a 14 MW power plant financed by IDA under PSDP.

Bank's advice andrecommendation

153,     The recent paradigm shift towards the consideration o f least-cost options including
interconnection with neighboring countries, as well as concrete steps towards public-private
partnership in the power sector, are appropriate policy responses to issues in the power sector. As a
result, the Bank has resumed its support to power sector with the approval in 2004 o f a US$64
million grant, the first Bank-financed project since two decades. The Bank i s also preparing an
Energy Access Project that would explore ways to increase access o f modern energy services to
support productive activities and social services. At this juncture, the Bank and AFD support the
Government inits continuous efforts to strengthen the legal and regulatory environment, particularly
the revision o f the regulatory framework to ensure that the roles and responsibilities o f sector
institutions are clearly laid out.

Measuresundertakenas part of the proposedoperation

154.     The measures under PRSC-6 aimed at promoting private sector participation inthe electricity
and petroleum sectors to improve management and to reduce supply and production costs. It was
expected that the Government will issue tender for the selection o f a private operator for the
management o f SONABEL, as well issue bidding document for the private participation in the
capital o f SONABHY. Progress was limited to the launching o f accounting and financial audits o f
these two companies. These audits are integral parts o f the bidding documents and their completion
will determine the schedule for completing the measures sought under PRSC-6, most likely in early
2007. In addition, clarifications are needed in the on pricing policy and mechanism, regulatory
framework before advancing private participation inthese two companies.

155.     Policy options to be discussed in the context o f the next series o f PRSC include the review o f
the equalization policy in the electricity sector; tariff reforms; the strengthening of the legal and
regulatory framework including clarity on the roles and responsibilities on institutions, the
elimination o f fuel subsidies, tariffs increase in 2006 and 2007, followed by the adoption of a
transparent tariff setting mechanisms through an automatic adjustment tariff mechanism, the
selection o f a strategic partner for SONABEL, and the introduction o f private partnership into
SONABHY.

InvestmentClimate

Description

156.      Since it embraced market-oriented policies in 1991, the Government o f Burkina Faso has
implemented significant reforms in the areas of macroeconomic management; trade, markets and
price liberalization; tax reform; privatization; banking sector restructuring; regulatory reform;
implementing the WAEMU-wide competition policy; and adopting new business laws under the
OHADA treaty. While these reforms have helped Burkina enjoy a commendable average income
growth of over 5 percent, the economy remains agrarian and poorly diversified thus pointing to an
unfinished agenda. A key element of the latter is the investment climate as evidenced in Table 5
below which provides a snapshot o f Burkina Faso's ranking on the 10 core indicators of the Doing
Business report.

Challenges

 157.     Burkina Faso i s performing poorly across the ten topics defining the ease o f doing business
(see Table 5). In particular, Burkina Faso seems to be the worst performer worldwide for the topic
related to labor markets regulation. In September 2004, the Parliament enacted a new Labor Code
which i s a positive step in the right direction but still falls short o f international standards.
Furthermore, some o f the application decrees o f the new Code were never adopted. The ongoing
discussions on the business climate in Burkina Faso and the labor market study under preparation
will provide the opportunity to further advance the support to government's reform inthat area.

 158.     As for the judicial services, PRSP-2 acknowledges that despite ongoing reforms there are
still many problems resulting from a shortage o f human resources, with only 300 judges for a
population o f 12 million; and inadequate funds, equipment, technology, and information. PRSP-2
notes that only eleven high courts o f the planned 45 are currently operational, while only 100 of the
350 planned departmental courts are. Other problems arise from the costly fees charged, which seem
to be beyond the means of some segments o f the population, and the fact that many defendants are
unaware o f their rights. PRSP-2 went on to describe delays in the handling o f applications, bribes

paid to circumvent these delays, and delays in the settlement o f disputes, all as implicit costs that,
along with the direct production and marketing costs, discourage entrepreneurs and hamper
investment and growth.

159.    The privatization o f key utilities (energy, water, and telecommunications) was decided by the
Government and endorsed by Parliament since July 2001, with the objectives o f fostering
competition, reducing factor costs and increasing access to and quality o f services, ultimately
resulting in additional competitiveness and equity. Unfortunately, other than a successful opening o f
the cellular market to private operators and a not yet successful attempt to privatize the national
telecommunication company, progress inthat area has been slow.

GovernmentActions

160.    The Letter o f Private Sector Development Policy adopted by the Government in July 2002
defines a four-pronged approach that seems still valid: (i)Improving the climate for private
investment (upgrading existing legislation, standards, and regulations, and carrying through reforms
to make a decisive improvement in the court system, speed up the enforcement o f court rulings,
combat fraud, and attract and safeguard domestic and foreign capital); (ii)    Continuingprivatization
of public enterprises (particularly in the telecommunications, energy, and water sectors); (iii)
Strengthening private sector support institutions and building business capacities; (iv) Strengthening
theprivate sector's role.

 161.   The Government has followed up on that approach by strengthening the "trade point" and
making operational the Burkina Faso Entrepreneurs' Center that i s providing effective business
development services. It established a Competitiveness Committee, composed o f public and private
sector representatives, to make recommendations and monitor progress in this area, with the
objective to reduce the cost o f doing business in Burkina Faso. An independent regulatory agency
(ARTEL) supervises competitive practices in the telecommunications sector where costs have
declined by 30-50 percent. In 2004, the Government liberalized the former monopoly in the cotton
sector, by opening up the sector to two private companies. Significant investments have taken place
since then and Burkina Faso i s now the leadingproducer inWest and Central Africa.

 162.   InFebruary 2005, the Governmentorganized a workshop -withthe support o fIDA, IFC and
FIAS   - to address issues pertaining to business environment. On June 21, 2005, as a result o f that
workshop, the Government established the CEFOREs (Centre de Formalith des Entreprises), one-
stop shops that are spearheading the simplification o f administrative requirements for creating,
operating and closing business. Under the aegis o f CEFORE, several administrative steps are being
consolidated, and others eliminated.

 163.   Inthejustice sector, the Government is implementing a National Action Plan for the Reform
of Justice that consists o f (i)strengthening the judiciary sector and providing adequate legal
safeguard to judges and magistrates; (ii)    providing infrastructure, equipment, and both human and
financial resources needed by the judiciary system; (iii)   enforcing laws and regulations; (iv) creating
an arbitration court; (v) attenuating the complexity o f the law, through a combination o f several
measures (drafting a code o f established laws, compiling case law reports, distributingbrochures and
 guides explaining the law in lay terms, translating important legislation into national languages, and
 dissemination o f the law through all appropriate channels, including a legal website with periodic
updates).

Bank's advice and recommendation

164.    The Government should be commended for recent reforms in improving the business
climate. However, bolder and more comprehensive efforts are needed to improve investment climate
and boost private investment, including reducing administrative red tape, strengthening property
rights, and enhancing labor market flexibility and better enforcing judicial decisions. The
Government should sustain recent reforms by a swift implementation o f the action plan it has
designed to improve business climate.

165.    For judicial services, Government's strategic options outlined above seem valid.          The
Government should pursue implementation vigorously, translating this high-priority agenda into
budget allocation. IDA-fundedPACDE i s providing assistance on judicial institutional reforms (e.g.
improving the operations o f the commercial registry, strengthening the judiciary inspection function,
and setting up an arbitration court).

166.    Completing the privatization o f the utilities would yield enormous benefits: boost private
investment; increase access to and quality o f these services; and free up public resources for
investments in sectors such as basic education and heath care services.

167.    Lastly, the Government should take full advantage o f key studies currently under preparation
(Investment Climate Assessment, Trade Study, Financial Sector Review, and Labor Market Study) to
update its reform agenda inthese areas.

168.    PRSC-6has supported the simplification o f administrative requirements for private investors,
reducing the time and cost to create business. Some progress has been reported through the creation
of CEFORE, business centers where potential investors could accomplish all the requirements to
create a company. As a result, the number o f days to register a business i s now 7, down from 15 in
2004.

BasicEducation

Description

 169.   Despite significant progress in recent years, educational attainment in Burkina Faso remains
low, and the country faces enormous challenges as it strives to achieve universal primary education
by 2015. Education in Burkina Faso is characterized by low enrollment rates in primary and
secondary education, high illiteracy rate among the adults, and persistent regional and gender
inequalitiesin educational attainment.

 170.   The gross primary school enrollment rate in Burkina Faso increased from 35 to 60 percent
between 1994 and 2005, but it still remains one o f the lowest in SSA (86 percent on average).
Enrollment in secondary education in Burkina Faso i s also very l o w (15 percent in 2004), with large
differences across gender (8 percent for girls), location and income groups. The 2003 household
survey shows that literacy rate was as low as 32.3 percent in 2003. The situation i s even more severe
inrural areaswhere one out o ffive men and one out o ffourteenwomen are literate.



                                                - 39 -

171.    Poor quality of education. Academic achievement i s also low: standardized tests o f learning
achievements show that only 25 percent o f sixth-grade students perform at that level in French and
mathematics. In addition, students lack appropriate pedagogical materials. Despite the efforts made
in the past years to ensure one textbook for 2 students and to reduce the cost o f teaching materials,
only 40 percent and 22 percent of students have one textbook for their own use in reading and
mathematics, respectively. Teachers' qualification i s also declining due to the recruitment o f lower-
paid teachers to reduce highcost o f salaries.

172.    Poor efficiency of the Education System. Resources are wasted at all levels due to the high
repetition rates and drop out rates within the system. At an average repetition rate o f 18 percent at
the primary level, the actual cost o f educating a student through the six years o f primary i s 3.5 times
more than what it would be had there been no repetition. Similarly, educating a student at the lower
secondary level costs 4.4 times, and at the upper secondary it costs 3 times.

Challenges

173.    A key issue in the sector is the financial sustainability o f expanding services given the
existing cost structure o fprimary education. Teachers' costs are relatively high, and represent several
times the per capita GDP. School construction costs are also a key issue to the financial
sustainability o f the program. The Government i s already channeling a large share of public
resources to the education sector. In addition, the sector i s already highly dependant on external
assistance and Burkina Faso is one o f the countries that were selected under the fast track initiative
of the EFA (Education for All) to receive additional funds. In that context, although measures to
improve efficiency and access could increase intake to some extent, the government would not be
financially able to meet the investment and costs required by the targeted enrollment rate o f 70
percent unless lowering constructionand teachers' costs.

174.    As for teachers' costs, the Government has opted to expand community schools where
teachers are recruited by communities on contract and paid (with public financing) less than civil
service teachers. For classrooms, high construction costs are compounded by poor school
construction management in place, which stand in the way o f rapid expansion o f supplying basic
education services. The Government i s attempting to address this obstacle by involving NGOs in
school construction.

Government Actions

175.    The Government's strategy for the development o f the education sector i s outlined in its
Education Policy Letter o f M a y 2, 2001. Under the Education Policy Letter, basic education i s
maintained as a national priority. The enrollment effort is pursued and intensified to reach an
enrollment rate o f 70 percent and an adult literacy rate o f 40 percent by year 2011 and to improve
both the quality and cost-effectiveness of education. The MEBA prepared a Ten-year Plan for Basic
Education (Plan Decennal de Developpement de I'Education de Base). The Ten-Year Plan presents
specific objectives and programs and outlines implementation arrangements and time frames.

176.    The main development objective o f the Ten Year Program i s to lay the foundation for
accelerating the development o f basic education, while ensuring adequate quality and financial
sustainability. The programs involve communities and NGOs to: (i)             increase access to basic
education by intervening on both the supply and demand side; (ii)          improve the school-learning
environment by offering programs and instructional materials ; (iii)strengthen capacity for
decentralization and budgetary support by strengthening financial and procurement management and


                                                 - 40 -

monitoring the education system.; and (iv) improve the equity and cost-effectiveness o f the
expenditure by increasingnon-salary expenditure.

Bank's advice and recommendation

177.    The overall performance o f the education system has been improving slowly but steadily
duringthe past five years, butthe challenge still remains interms o fcoverage, qualityand efficiency.
Those who are enrolled are receiving low quality education, resulting in high repetition rates and
large waste o f the limited resources available for the sector. There are also serious inequities in
coverage between urban and rural areas, between boys and girls and between the poor and rich.
While the current sectoral strategies and action plans highlightsome o fthese issues, it i s important to
ensure budget allocation, execution and management need to be better geared towards better
education outcomes. The following are the key recommendations:

178.    Improve budget planning and execution. Further improvements in budget planning and
execution may include the following: (i)   make the entire education sector a priority sector, not only
basic education; (ii) greater involvement o f the regional departments in the budget planning process
to ensure their needs are reflected in the budget; (iii)approve annual work plan at the regional level
based on a regional MTEF; (iv) simplification o f procurement procedures and credit-related
regulations inMESSRS to avoid unnecessary delays inbudget execution.

179.    Improve budget decentralization and monitoring, and the efficiency of resource
allocations within the sector. Given the success o f the delegated credit system under MEBA,
budget decentralization could be hrther improved by: (i)      extending the delegated credit system to
secondary and higher education; (ii)    reinforcing the capacity o f both MEBA and MESSRS at the
regional and provincial levels to manage the implementation of provincial action plans for improved
planning, execution and monitoring o f budgets, through greater skill development and a simplified
system o fbudget management and monitoring o f results; (iii)    Strengthening the accountability o f the
schools and EPAs through a system o f information recording, and audits to ensure appropriate use o f
funds; (iv) Improve the efficiency o f resource allocations within the sector. At present basic
education i s allocated about 80 percent o f all the resources for the sector, thus creating large gaps in
others levels.

 180.   Improve the quality of education. It is necessary to strictly apply the measure regarding
sub-cycles and extend it ifpossible to the first grade o f secondary education. While the system is in
place, it needs to be strengthened. Sufficient financing should be made available for school-based
activities to improve quality, and teaching and learning hours should be increased.

 181.   Better integrate primary and secondary education and scaling up the public-private
partnership. An emerging issue, as enrollments in primary are rising, is greater pressure on lower
 secondary. The education system needs to address this in a timely manner not only in terms o f the
 financing needs, but also in terms o f management and organization o f the sector as a whole. In that
context, the approach piloted in secondary education under the Post Primary Education Project was
 quite successful (see ICR o f the PEPP, Report No 31668-BUR). It may also be worthwhile to study
whether the approach could be applied to primary education.

Actions undertakenas part of the proposed operation

 182.   PRSC-6 support to the education sector in Burkina Faso i s complementary o f the Basic
 Education Project which remains the main instrument for Bank's assistance to the implementation


                                                  -41 -

o f the Government's Basic Education Ten-Year Program (PDDEB). The Basic Education Project
also aims at building the capacity o f the Ministry o f Basic Education (MEBA) in the areas o f
financial management, budgeting, procurement, monitoring, evaluation and donor coordination, to
prepare the transition to programmatic support.

183.    Under PRSC-6, the Government has finalized a sectoral MTEF for primary and lower
secondary education, taking into account the resources needed to attain the PDDEB objectives
and the MDGs in the education sector. The Government has also strengthened the program-
based budget for the primary education sector. In principle, the education sector has been
implementing a program-based budget since 2001. Inpractice, these program-based budgets are not
comprehensive: for example, personnel expenditures were not reflected until 2006. In addition, the
link with MDG and PDDEB objective was tenuous and a consistent medium-term framework was
missing.

184.    The Government has continued the policy of subsidizing schooling in the 20 provinces
with the lowest school enrollment rates. For poor families, the costs of education can be a critical
deterrent to participation in education. According to the 1998 Priority Survey, 24 percent o f people
aged 7-14 do not attend school due to its high cost. Although fees are not mandatory for primary
education in Burkina, the cost of supplies and other expenditures weigh heavily, as do the
opportunity costs, particularly for poor families where children contribute importantly to the family
economy. It i s estimated that children contribute to between 5 and 35 percent o f the total household
consumption. Government's support to the provinces with lowest school enrollment rates has
included the supply o f educational stationeries, building classrooms and supplying equipment. In
2004/2005, PDDEB donors provided support to the Government in piloting a mechanism o f direct
grants to pupils. Given the success o f the pilot phase, the program will be scaled up in 2005/2006.
However, there i s the need to review the criteria for selecting the 20 priority provinces, which in
addition to the current single criterion o f gross enrollment rate could include criteria that encourage
demand for education, especially for girls, and quality (completion rate).

185.    The Government has updated the PDDEB. The first phase of this ten-year program was
completed in 2005. The Government has worked with local stakeholders and the donor community
to draw lessons from the implementation of the first phase in finalizing the design the second phase
o f the program for 2006-2010. There i s now greater harmonization in donor procedures with the
adoption o f a SWAP and the poolingo f external resources.

186.    The Government has introduced the delegation of credits to the lower secondary
education. Such mechanism introduced in the basic education sector has been a positive
development as it makes local actors accountable and enhances the transparency o f the budgeting
process, as well as the efficiency o f the supply o f educational services. For lower secondary
education, the resources for decentralized units (DRES) come in the form o f a budget allocation for
equipment expenditures within the Appropriations Law, and they are managed at the central level.
The centralized ordering system poses many problems with delivery to the site. The equipment often
arrives late because the DRES has no budget for transportation, and often these materials are
dispatched with significant loss or damage. The new delegation o f credits i s effective with the 2006
budget. Trainingprograms have takenplace for the manager o f these credits.

 187.   The preparation and implementation of an action plan to increase teaching hours has
been delayed. A study carried out under PRSC-5 indicated that effective instructional hours are 660
hours on average, significantly below the medium term objective o f 900 hours, and the OECD
average o f 1000 hours.      An action plan should be prepared to follow up on the short-term


                                                  - 42 -

recommendation of 800 teachinglearning hours. Activities that are sought include strengthening
supervision, increasing resources for inspectorates, extending the government payroll and personal
management software to all regions, and empowering local communities. Improving teaching hours
will be a powerful way to improve the quality o f education at low cost. The Government received
grants from the Bank inlate 2005 to finalize and implement the action plan.

188.    Beyond the overall support to the decentralization reforms, notably the transfer o f primary
education responsibilities to local governments, the next PRSCs will support increasing the
affordability o f education services for households as well as for the Government. The measures
include preparing, adopting and implementing regulatory texts pertaining to compulsory and cost-
free basic and lower secondary education, in accordance with education policy law. This measure
will be accompanied by reforms o f PTA and o f the fees system in secondary education. An
additional measure will be to continue the policy o f subsidizing schooling in the priority provinces
while reviewing the criteria for selecting these provinces. Lastly, the ministry o f education will
monitor trends in unit costs inthe primary education sector. Unit costs are the single most important
factor defining the affordability o f achieving universal enrolment. High unit costs and low
educational outcome also could point to imbalances in the mix o f spending (salaries vs. non salaries)
that shouldbe addressed.


Health

Description

189.    Despite promising trends in some health service and outcome indicators, Burkina Faso
remains "off track" to achieving the MDGs for health. Most key indicators for child health and
nutrition worsened during the 1990s, but in the past five years, child mortality has declined (from
219 per thousand in 1998/99 to 184 per thousand in 2003) and coverage o f preventive and curative
health services improved (the percent o f children hlly vaccinated increased from 22 percent to 44
percent). But juvenile mortality (ages 1-5) remains at the same level as in 1993 -- probably due to
limitedprogress incombatingmalaria and child malnutrition.

 190.   Communicable diseases are the main causes o f morbidity and mortality. Malaria i s the
biggest killer o f children, followed by diarrhea, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. Yet only 7
percent o f children and pregnant women slept under insecticide-treated bednets in 2003, and child
malnutrition i s worse than a decade ago, with 38 percent o f children suffering from chronic
malnutrition in 2003). Burkina Faso has one o fthe highest HIV prevalence rates inWest Africa, with
an estimated 2.3 percent o f adults infected nationally in 2004, with higher rates in urban areas and
among high-risk groups     - although prevalence appears to have stabilized. Maternal mortality rates
are high (estimates ranging from 484 to 1000 deaths per 100,000 births). The percentage o f women
delivering at health facilities has increased slowly (to 39 percent in 2003), but only 5 percent o frural
women use modem contraception.

 191.   The major source of modern health care for the rural and poor majority o f Burkina Faso
remains the public health system, which i s organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
The number o f government health facilities has increased over the past decade, but geographic
access remains a constraint in many rural areas. About 58 percent o f the population lives within 5
km o f a health facility, and 19 percent live 10 km or more-with        an average distance to a health
center o f nine kilometers. University and regional hospitals all enjoy a degree o f managerial
autonomy, and receive their budgets through a direct transfer from the central government.
Traditional medicine continues play an important role in health care and treatment, particularly for


                                                 - 43 -

the rural majority, for reasons o f culture, cost, and ease o f access. Nongovernmental and religious
organizations operate health centers and district hospitals under a framework agreement with the
ministryo fhealth.

Challenges

192.    Government allocations to health have increased inrecent years, but current sector financing
i s inadequate to achieve the MDGs and to meet other internationally agreed targets (such as the
Abudja declaration for malaria). While health i s identified among priority sectors for the PRSP, the
percentage o f the national budget allocated for health has remained relatively unchanged (between
10% and 11%, excluding debt service) for the past several years. Yet while it i s important to further
increase the resources allocated to the health sector, the equity and efficiency o f existing health
spending (both public and private) must be improved, as well as the quality and financial
accessibility of health services, in order to accelerate progress toward the health objectives laid out
inthe PRSP andthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Government Actions

193.    The Ministry o f Health's 10-year health strategy (Plan National de development sanitaire
(PNDS), 2001-2010) identifies key priorities and program objectives for the health sector, including
increased accessibility o f health services, improved quality, increased financial access for the poor.
The eight priority programs for the PNDS are: increase geographic coverage o f health services;
improve the quality and utilization o f health services; strengthen the fight against communicable and
non-communicable diseases; reduce HIV transmission; improve the quality and distribution of
human resources in the sector; increase financial accessibility for the population; increase health
sector financing; and strengthen capacity in the sector. The new National A I D S Strategy (2006-
2010) is organized around five strategic priorities ("Axes Stratkgiques"), including:                (i)
Strengthening prevention o f HN and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and promotion of
voluntary testing and counseling (VCT); (ii)Re-enforce access to medical care and support for
persons living with HIVIAIDS; (iii)      Strengthen protection and support for persons living with
HIV/AIDS and other vulnerable groups; (iv) Re-enforce partnership, coordination, and resource
mobilization; and (v) Strengthen surveillance o f the epidemic, monitoring and evaluation, and
promotion of research.

 194.    Inaddition, to complement structural reforms supported by the PRSCs, the government and
Bank have negotiated a $47.7 million Health Sector Support and Multisectoral AIDS Project
 (HSSMAP), which will provided integrated support to health and HIV/AIDS through two pooled
donor fbnding mechanisms: one managed by the Ministry o f Health, the other by the Secretariat o f
the National AIDS Council. This project was approved by the Board on April 27, 2006, and will
 close in September 2009.

Bank's advice and recommendation

195.    Increase health sector financing, with priority given to interventions necessary to
achieve MDGs. Even with additional resources allocated through the budget and donor financing
(including the HSSMAP), additional resources need to be mobilized the accelerate progress toward
MDGs and ensure financing for priority interventions. Priorities include subsidized distribution of
treated bednets and o f new malaria drugs; ensuring adequate financing and increased coverage for
essential child and reproductive health services at district and community levels; and improved
fundingfor exemptions or risk sharingmechanisms for the poorest.

196.    Strengthen results-based budgeting and monitoring system for the health sector, and
improve the efficiency and equity of resource allocations within the sector. While resources for
the health sector remain insufficient, existing resources could be more efficiently allocated to
accelerate progress toward the MDGs. The Ministryo f Health prepared in 2004/04 its first Medium
Term ExpenditureFramework (MTEF), which has the potentialto become the basis for results-based
financing system, and to strengthen the Ministry o f Health's ability to negotiate for additional
resources from Finance and international partners. Planning tools, the arbitrage process, and related
reforms need to be further strengthenedat bothnational and decentralized levels, however, to ensure
that annual work programs are aligned with the disease burden. An integrated system for tracking
and reporting expenditures (budget, donor, cost recovery) would also improve program monitoring.
During negotiations for the HSSMAP, the Ministry o f Health (MOH) agreed to prepare a
consolidated annual Program o fWork, integrating all sources of financing, beginning in2007.

197.    Improve equity and financial accessibility for preventive and curative services. Recent
efforts to reduce margins on medicines and provide key preventative services for free appear have
improvedutilization of health services by the poor, but financial accessibility remains a barrier to use
of health services by the poor, particularly for emergency and curative services. Nearly 90 percent o f
health expenditures by the poor are purchase o f medicines, but medical providers often prescribe
drugs that are unnecessary or inconsistent with official protocols. Implementing a rational
prescription program would thus significantly improve both financial access and quality o f health
services. Subsidizing procurement and distribution o f treated bednets would be among the most cost-
effective measuresavailable to reduce child mortality. The financing and institutional framework for
subsidizing priority services and providing subsidized or free care to the very poorest also need to be
further defined. Health insurance i s limited to a small percentage o f the private formal sector, and



                                                 - 45 -

despite widespread interest in "mutuelles" and micro-insurance schemes, less than 3% o f the rural
population i s currently covered.

198.    Improvethe reliability,monitoring, and accountability of sector funding at districtand
community level. While trends are positive, funds from both government and partners are often
arrive late or at less than budgeted amounts, and making it difficult to manage and execute programs.
Despite some deconcentration within the Ministry o f Finance, management o f budget and HIPC
funds remain centralized by MoF. Inaddition, the Ministryof Health needs to put inplace a system
to annually record receipts, expenses, and account balances at the district and community level
(including for government budget, donor, and cost recovery funds), and to strengthen oversight o f
community cost recovery funds (COGES).

199.    Improve accountability and performance management of hospitals. The Government
currently transfers resources directly to national and regional hospitals without a clearly defined
performance agreement, and current texts allow for limited oversight and control by the central
ministry o f hospital performance. Yet the central government also imposes various unfunded
mandates on hospitals (such as subsidized care for civil servants and students). Performance
contracting for hospitals has been introduced in the context o f the pooled donor fund for health, but
shouldbe expanded to include budget transfers.

200.    Improve distributionand motivationof healthpersonnel. The inequitable distribution o f
health personnel i s a long-standing problem in the health sector, which will require a multi-pronged
approach, including: (a) strengthening incentives for practice in rural and poor areas, including
possible financial incentives, and priority for training and professional advancement; (b)
decentralization o f recruitment and budget posts to the regional and district level; (c) strengthen
systems for human resource planning, training, and management, including making the human
resources software system operational.

201.    Ensure effective planning and implementation of decentralization. The existing
decentralization law calls for transfer o f health facilities, budgets, and personnelto urban communes
in 2006, with a similar transfer to rural communes by 2008. Key details regarding the timing and
content o f the decentralization remain to be clarified, however, and the dialogue among the Ministry
of Health, MATD and the Regions needs to be strengthened.

202.    Develop an integrated approach to community-level health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS
interventions.Most excess mortality and morbidity is due to community- and household-level
factors. Reaching the MDGs will require developing the institutional and financing framework for an
integrated approach to community-based health, nutrition, and HIV interventions, in coordination
with health authorities, village development committees, and local NGOs/CBOs.

Actions undertakenas partof the proposedoperation

203.    The Government will strengthen the health MTEF for 2006-09, and ensure adequate
financing for the healthsector, in linewith PNDSobjectives and MDGs: The MOH engaged in
an intensive process to prepare its first MTEF in 2004/05, and has initiated development of regional
health MTEFs as well. This first MTEF adopted a "needs based" approach to advocate for additional
funding, which strengthened its hand in negotiating the 2006 budget. To further strengthening the
MTEF, next steps include: (i)strengthening the annual arbitrage process to determine priorities
based on actual budget and donor financing, and to mobilize the additional funds necessary to
achieve the MDGs; (ii)strengthening technical content o f MTEF, including links to MDGs and


                                                   - 46 -

better defining criteria for allocations among districts and hospitals; (iii)establish a common
program and budgetcoding system to improve linksbetween MTEF,budget, and donor funding.

204.     An evaluation could be necessary to draw appropriate lessons and define priorities for
subsequent reforms in the implementation of the rkgies d'avance. To improve flexibility o f
budget financing at decentralized level, the government established cash advance accounts for all
health regions and districts in November 2002. While the health ministry welcomed this reform, it
experienced a number o f problems and delays in its first two years, including delays in nominating
and training district account managers ("regisseurs"); inadequate communicationbetween health and
regional Treasury officials; overly rigidrules governing use o f the accounts; and confusion regarding
the use o f the "regies" as opposed to "normal" government procurement procedures (which are
better adapted for large orders o f medicines or supplies). The Ministry o f Finance significantly
improved the flexibility o f procedures in 2005, but districts have encountered difficulties in
justifying expenses intime to receivedsubsequent tranches.

205.     The Government is implementing a system of subsidies for obstetrical emergencies and
for normal deliveries: As a PRSC-5 "trigger",         the M o H developed a strategy for subsidizing
emergency obstetrical care, as well as to reduce the cost o f normal deliveries in health centers. The
recommendations of the study and working group were discussed and validated at stakeholder
workshops in March and October 2005. The estimated cost for an 80 percent subsidy for cesareans
and a 50 percent subsidy for normal deliveries i s CFAFl.4 billion. This amount was integrated into
the 2006 budget proposal o f the M o H (divided among several budget categories and HIPC). On
March 22, 2006, the Government formally adopted national strategy for subsidies for obstetrical
emergencies. The new subsidy system has the potential to significantly increase use and financial
access to maternal health services and the next challenge i s ensuring effective institutional
arrangements for implementation and monitoring. The HSSMAP will provide complementary
support for technical assistance and monitoring o f this strategy.

206.     The Government has reviewed the fee structure for hospitals with the aim to develop a
contracting system for hospital services. The current fee structures for hospitals are outdated with
little correspondence to the actual cost o f services, and in practice fees vary considerably from one
hospital to another.     The government commissioned a background study (financed through the
budget) to review current costs and fee for services, and to make recommendations for revisions and
exemptions for the poor. The recommendations o f this study now need to be implemented and
monitored by hospital administration and the Ministry o f Health. In addition, while public hospitals
 enjoy a degree o f administrative autonomy with regard to management o f financial resources, there
i s no performance contract or performance monitoring agreement between the central ministries and
hospitals. This reduces accountability to hospital administrators and contributing to high rates o f
absenteeism among senior specialists, reducing the quality o f hospital care.        In late 2004, the
government approved a new statute for public hospitals, which will facilitate the development o f
internal and external contracting arrangements, and in2005, the Ministryintegrated hospitals for the
 first time into the PADS program (the pooled health fund, which will be supported by HSSMAP),
which required them to prepare performance-based action plans, and to prioritize improving
information and accountability systems. The next step will be to expand the contracts to include all
 sources o f financing, including budget transfers. The Hospital Directorate in the Ministryof Health
has initiated the development o f model contracts (i)between the central MOH and hospital
 administrations; (ii)between hospital administration and various departments (e.g., pediatrics).
 Implementing the former will require revision o f current texts, to strengthen the MOH's oversight
role over public hospitals.



                                                  - 47 -

207.     The revision o f the texts o f local health management committees (COGES), and the
development o f an action plan for decentralization and performance contracting with
communes have been delayed by the discussions o n the broader decentralization reform.
Community management committees (COGES) were established to manage the proceeds o f
revolving drug funds, and to strengthen the participation o f communities inhealthcare. However, the
election i s not always transparent, and there have been cases o f corruption. Because the question o f
revising COGES texts i s closely tied to the ongoing process o f decentralization, the Ministry o f
Health has initiated a consultation process among key departments in the Ministry and other
stakeholders, including the ministry responsible for decentralization.         Draft revised texts were
developed in early 2004, and further revised during workshops in 2005. The link between the
COGES texts and decentralization needs to be further clarified, however. For this reason, the
Government i s encouraged to develop an Action Plan for decentralization o f health services, and to
begin develop a framework for performance contractingbetween the central ministry and urban and
rural communes, to ensure effective service provision.

208.     The Government has taken some steps to implement an action plan to improving
distribution and motivation o f health personnel but progress needs to be accelerated.
Inequitable distribution o f health personnel i s a long-standing problem in Burkina Faso. With
technical support from the World Bank and WHO, the government has developed an action plan for
human resources in the health sector, involving M O H staff, representatives o f the ministries o f
finance and civil services, and representatives o f health workers' unions.         The action plan was
officially adopted by the "Comite de Suivi" o f the PNDS in March 2005. The action plan includes
priorities for reforms (e.g., decentralization o f budget posts), technical support and capacity building,
as well as recommendations to improve staff motivation (including a proposal for additional
payments for health staff working remote zones). The costs have been estimated and integrated into
the MTEF, and a provision made in the 2005 to provide "primes" for personnel working in remote
areas, which was implemented in December 2005 (with retroactive payments to health staff for the
year). But decentralization o f budget posts and recruitments will be necessary to address structural
imbalances in personnel distribution, and decentralization o f management o f careers and personnel
dossiers would improve flexibility o f staffing and reduce health worker frustration. Continued
attention from senior officials in MoH, Finance, and Fonction Publique i s necessary to maintain
momentum on these reforms.

209.     The Government should still establish an intersectoral coordination framework and
action plan for malnutrition. Despite high levels o f child malnutrition, the issue remains poorly
understood and receives insufficient attention. With support from the Bank and partners the Ministry
of Health has undertaken a secondary analysis o f existing householddata to better understand causes
of child malnutrition. The results are consistent with evidence from other countries, namely that
malnutrition i s a result not just o f inadequate household food security, but o f access to clean water,
child feeding and sanitation practices, and access to health care. Government now needs to
strengthen the multisectoral framework to address malnutrition, including through integrating
nutrition into an integrated package o f community health, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS activities.          A
proposal has been developed by the Ministry o f Health, but needs to be validated and adopted by
government. Inaddition, the HSSMAP (through the pooled fund) will support the development and
implementation o fan integrated package o f community health and nutrition activities.

210.     The Government has improved the quality o f care by implementing an Integrated
Management o f Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) in 15 districts. Effective implementation o f IMCIhas
been shown to be an effective means to reduce child mortality at both facility and community levels.



                                                   - 48 -

It is expected that IMCI will be scaled up to an additional 15 districts in 2006, with others to be
covered by 200718.

211.    The Government will continue and ensure effective implementation of the policies of
free vaccination, antenatal care, and vitamin A distribution. The policy of free vacation and
prenatal care has helped improve coverage of these services, although continued monitoring and
supervisioni s necessary to ensure that the policy i s beingapplied uniformly through the country. The
MOH has developed a long-term strategy for vaccine program sustainability incollaboration with the
Global Vaccine Initiative. New mechanisms for community distribution of vitamin A need to be
established once polio vaccination campaigns are discontinued. The costs o f these policies are
integrated into the health MTEF, and can be supported both through the national budget as well as
through the pooled donor fund.

Social Protection

Description

212.     Social protection plays an important role in the fight against poverty. A lack o f assets and
inability to use appropriate risk management instruments render individuals and households
vulnerable to increased poverty if those affected are unable to manage or mitigate the impact o f
shocks. The recently finalized Bank's study on risk and vulnerability in Burkina Faso identified
weather-induced shocks and shocks related to fluctuations o f the terms of trade, regional instability,
as well as limited access to markets and social infrastructure as main sources o f vulnerability in the
country.

213.     Burkina Faso has a number o f publicly funded risk management programs, but lack o f
critical data make it difficult to assess their effectiveness. The programs are heavily dependent on
external financing that threaten their sustainability. Whatever information that i s available suggests
some programs target geographically, while others such as micro finance target individuals. Most
programs seem to have very limited impact, mainly because o f inadequate financing, lack o f
institutional structures to implement programs, and lack o f coordination between various Ministries.
Lack o f donor coordination i s also hurtingthe efficiency o fthese programs.

Challenges

214.     A major problem encountered inthe assessmento f current social protection interventions in
Burkina Faso is the lack of data on expenditures and beneficiaries. Inparticular, the lack o f basic
data on the profile o f beneficiaries, costs and targeting limits the usefulness o f this analysis.
Therefore, in order to be able to assess the impact o f SP programs, it is absolutely essential to
generate base line data on beneficiaries and control groups. It is also crucial to identify priority
interventionareas, estimate the cost and sources o f financing.

Government Actions

215.     In 2002 the Government created a national multisectorial team responsible for the
preparation o f the country's social protection strategy. The document is expected to provide a
consolidated and comprehensive framework for social risk management in Burkina Faso. Since its
creation, the national team has benefited from a continued technical assistance and financial support
from the Bank and ILO. The Bank has also supported the preparation of SP strategy by undertaking
a series o f analytical work, most notably the Burkina Faso Risk and Vulnerability Assessment study.


                                                  - 49 -

216.    A draft strategy prepared by the national team has been discussed at a number o f national
workshops and technical seminars, and it was also presented in a series o f regional SP conferences
organized by the Bank, the most recent one being in July 2005 in Tunis. The final report identifies
the following main areas of intervention: (i)    improved access to basic social services by the most
vulnerable groups (les indigents); (ii)  extension o f the social security in the informal sector; (iii)
development o f informal health insurance schemes (les mutualitis); and (iv) reforms o f the existing
social security mechanisms, inparticular the CNSS (la CaisseNationale de la Sdcuritd Sociale).

Bank's advice and recommendation

217.    The national social protection strategy i s a step forward towards a better understanding o f
existing social protection mechanisms and development o f better-targeted and more efficient risk
management instruments in Burkina Faso. Still, there may be the need o f further work on the
prioritization o f policies and programs proposed in all four pillars o f the strategy since the range o f
these activities i s too broad cannot be implemented within the available fiscal space. In particular,
the Government should cost the proposed measures and identify possible source o f financing within
the MTEF. Detailed analyses on targeting and improving efficiency o f social protection interventions
would also yield benefits.

Measures undertakenas partof the proposedoperation

218.    As agreed under PRSC-6, a national SP strategy was finalized and is awaiting a formal
approval by the Cabinet.

219.    Based on the findings o f the strategy and discussions with the Government, it i s
recommended to include in the next round o f PRSCs the following measures: (i)           development o f
operational targeting methods to identify the most vulnerable households (indigents) to benefit from
SP interventions; (ii)  adopt and implement a pilot strategy on conditional cash transfers in education
nutrition and health for the indigents; and (iii) reforms o f the CNSS (Caisse Nationale de la Securiti
Sociale) byreviewing its operations and reducing its highoperations costs.

220.    The proposedreforms o f CNSS will allow to: (i) better social security for workers by
                                                            provide
improving the efficiency o f the institution; (ii) the burden o f high levels o f social security
                                                    lessen
contributions for employees and employers (including the Government) and create new jobs; and
(iii)extendthe social security for SMEs and self-employed.

Water and Sanitation Sector

Description

221.    In2005,75 percent of BurkinaFaso'spopulationhadaccess to safewater supply and32
percent had access to sanitation. To achieve the MDGs by 2015, an additional 5 million people
would need to have access to water supply, and 7 million to sanitation, out of an estimated
population o f 17million in2015. The MDGtargets for water supply, i.e. providing access to 85% of the
urban and semi urban population and to 80% of the rural population, can probablybe reached by 2015 if
current investment level is sustained. For sanitation, current sector capacity would have to be multiplied
by 6.5 to reach the MDGtarget, i.e. provide 61% ofthe populationwith improvedsanitation facilities by
2015. However, even ifthe MDG's would be reached; it would remain 3 millionpeople without access to
potable water and about 7 million without adequate sanitation in2015.




                                                   -50-

222.     ONEA, the national water supply and sanitation utility is in charge o f urban centers and
considered as a good performer compared to other African countries and benefits from a strong support
o f the donors community. The DGAEP" o f the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources i s
responsible for the provision o f water and sanitation services in rural areas and small towns (below
10.000inhabitants). Ineach one of the 13 regions there is a representation of the Ministry of Agriculture
with a water supply and sanitation service. About thousand five hundred water points are constructed
every year inrural area.

Challenges

223.      The major challenges for water and sanitation lie in rural areas where most of the poor
people live. These challenges include : (i)the move from projects towards sector programmatic approach
and budget support; (ii)   the decentralization reform which will bring 350 new local governments, with
responsibilities for WSS provision and implementation o f the Water Resources Management policy; (iii)
the sustainability of the water service, as 23% of the 29,500 pumps and 40% of the 360 piped water
systems are broken down, due to lack o f spare parts for old pumps, inadequate management and the lack
of efficient cost recovery; (iv) the urgency to increase focus on hygiene and sanitation to maximize health
benefits.

Government Actions

224.      Since 2003, the Government has been undertaking a series of actions to reform the
institutional framework and the development strategy for the water and sanitation sector.
First, the strategy for the urban water sector is implemented through a 3-year performance contract
signed between ONEA and the Government. The current contract for the period 2003-2007 includes
the ZIGA project. Second, the Government officially approved in 2003 a National Integrated Water
Resources Management Action Plan aiming at creating Basin agencies and Water management
committees at local level. Finally, the decision was taken in M a y 2005 to move to programmatic
approach. A roadmap to achieving the MDG was adopted with the following actions for 2005-2006 :
(i)organizationofregularmeetingsandannualjointgovernmentldonors sectorreviewtostrengthen
sector coordination under the leadership o f the DGAEP; (ii)      completion o f an inventory o f all water
points, to be used as baseline for measuring progress; (iii)      definition o f key indicators, norms and
standard and reporting procedures for monitoring and evaluation and ; (iv) elaboration o f a first
2007-2009 results-oriented Program budget, aiming at improving sector planning and increasing
level and predictability of resources flows into the sector.

225.      For sanitation, the DGEAP is preparing a national sanitation strategy that will underpin the
design and implementation o f new programs inrural areas. Inthe two main cities (Ouagadougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso), ONEA has developed and implemented for about 10 years an innovative hygiene
and sanitation promotion campaign, usingNGOs for social marketing and local masons. About 9,000
sanitation facilities are constructed every year. This program i s regarded as a model for urban
sanitation policy development and provides the basis for replication andor extension in other urban
and semi urban settlements.

Bank's advice and recommendation

226.      The Bank i s supportive o f the move towards programmatic approach as decided in May 2005
by the government for the rural water and sanitation sector (RWSS). Programmatic approach is
effectively considered as the best way to engage with fundamental policy reform, improve

predictability o f funding, stimulate donors' harmonization and alignment with country system,
maximize the impact of both government and external finance and scaling up sustainable RWSS
service delivery.

227.     Successful implementation o f the programmatic approach in the RWSS will also require a
significant strengthening of DGAEP capacity at the central and regional levels, including significant
increase in its operational budget. Coordination will be critical to ensure both the successful
implementation o f the programmatic approach and the efficient use o f resources available from the
donors group and government, particularly for technical assistance, capacity building to sector
institutions, equipment, and targeting o f vulnerable groups or provinces.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

228.     The operation of new water concessions in 13 provinces has been delayed. The
Government has prepared a draft strategy for water sector management and maintenance policies for
water infrastructures in rural and semi-urban areas. The draft strategy was discussed by all
stakeholders on February 2, 2006. A revised strategy will be finalized in the first half o f 2006, and
will define the final options for implementingthe reform o f the management and the maintenance o f
the water facilities and infrastructures in 13 provinces.

229.     The Government has completed sanitation strategic plans for 4 secondary cities (Fada
N'Gourma, Ouahigouya, Banfora and Koudougou). The completion o f the remaining 6 sanitation
strategic plans was delayed by weak capacity, including inadequate funding. As indicated above, a
model sanitation program i s underway inthe two major cities.

230.     It is proposed that the next series o f PRSC will support measures to increase access to,
affordability and sustainability o f WSS in rural and semi-urban areas given the relative better
conditions and prospects inurban areas.

231.     A trigger for the next PRSC would be the effective implementation o f the activities o f the
roadmap established by the Government to reach the MDGtargets for water and sanitation, including
adequate funding for the program budget o f the General Directorate o f Water and Sanitation
(DGEAP) and for the expansion o f the hygiene and sanitation promotion program o f the urban water
public utility (ONEA) to four new towns where strategic sanitation plans are available.


                                          GOOD   GOVERNANCE


Public Finance Management

Description

232.     Burkina Faso has been implementing an ambitious reform agenda since early 2000 with the
adoption in 2002 of a consolidated action plan to improve the budget management system (Plan
d'Action pour le Renforcement de la Gestion Budge`taire, PRGB). Achievements to date include: (i)
stronger budget legislation; (ii)improved resources allocation with the availability o f a global
MTEF; (iii)   enhanced effectiveness in budget execution with gradual deconcentration o f spending
authority; (iv) effective budget management software (CID for computerized management o f budget
operations; SYGADE for debt management, SIGASPE for personnel and payroll management); (v)
improved budget reporting and auditing with the introduction o f an independent Audit Court. IMF


                                                  - 52 -

and Bank staff carried out a HIPC A A P in 2004 and concluded that Burkina Faso had a solid budget
management system, and it met 9 out o f 16 benchmarks established under the HIPC initiative.

Challenges

233.    Enforcement of budget legislation. Burkina Faso has a solid legislation on budget
management. The challenge i s to further enforce the texts already adopted by scaling up
dissemination and implementing training plans.

234.    Monitoring of poverty-spending through improvement in budget classification. Burkina
Faso has already a good economic and administrative classification o fbudget data. The Government
has adopted the WAEMU's classificationo f the functions o f government (COFOG) which comprises
14 functions and 126 sub-functions. However, functional classification needs to be operationalized.
Inparticular, the Government would need to further define poverty spending and integrating them
into the existing functional classificationthrough the addition o f special markers.

235.    Foreign-financed investments are not fully integrated in the government budget
information system, thus rendering difficult the task of planning sectoral and overall
development programs. The reporting on a significant part o f foreign financed investment spending
i s weak and spending cannot be tracked through the computerized expenditure system. Some donors
do not report their activities, particular those financed by grants. Similarly, large amounts o f
expenditure are incurred by NGOs in the social and other priority sectors while very little
information on them i s available to the government. Efficiency and effectiveness o f budget
management would benefit from a better monitoring o f expenditures financed by external sources.

236.    The link between budget and the PRSP will be strengthened when MTEF and program
budgets will be generalized across all ministries. Burkina Faso has made significant progress in
the preparation o f a global MTEF but sectoral MTEF are lesser used: as o f end 2005, only the
Ministry o f Basic Education and the Ministry o f Health had sectoral MTEF although additional
efforts are needed to make them more operational. The Government i s preparing a methodological
note on global and sectoral MTEFin view o f assisting six line ministries to adopt MTEFby 2007. In
July 2005, the Government also organized a workshop on program budget experiences, and proposed
to re-launch the program starting with an update o f sectoral policies and programs.

237.    The effectiveness of the internal audit system should be improved. The internal audit o f
budget implementation i s conducted by the DCCF for ex ante audits; and by IGF, technical
inspectorates, and HACLC for ex-post audits. The DCCF had 160 audit officers in 2004, including
 12 with electronic visa authority in the CID. DCCF considers that, to improve the speed and
efficiency o f its operations significantly, its staff must be increased to 250. Owing to inadequate
staffing, the IGF often cannot carry out its annual work plan, especially as it i s increasingly involved
inproject audits. At any rate, the amount of expenditure auditedbythe IGFis too small to affect the
behavior o f units involved in the various stages o f competitive bidding and procurement.
Furthermore, the efficiency o f ex ante and ex post auditing i s also somewhat diminished because
accountingfor government property i s not practiced.

238.    The experience of budget deconcentration has been generally positive and the challenge
i s now to extend it to all ministries. Burkina Faso initiated a procedure for granting credit to the
peripheral units known as   ((crtdits dtltguts D. The procedure aims at giving spending authority to
the beneficiary structures. This procedure has helped to improve the efficiency o f public
expenditures although its impact was limited by the centralization o f the payment stage. T o address

the issue, the Government initiated the deconcentration o f payment order which i s now effective in 5
regions and should be extended to 12 regions by end-2006. The Government has decided to
progressively extend the procedure to all ministries and relevant institutions. An evaluation o f the
requirementsand costs for such extension is underway with the support o fthe Bank-funded PRCA.

239.    The Budget execution reports are now prepared within twelve months after the closing
of the fiscal year but they are not always supported by accounting statementsyet. The setting up
o f the Audit Court (Cow des Comptes) established the conditions for an independent evaluation o f
the budget execution reports, but the annual budget o f the Audit Court remains low at CFAF60
million, and its President does not have spending authority. Inaddition, the ability o f the Audit court
to issue a certificate o f conformity rests on the possibility to compare the accounts as held with
budget administrator (budget execution report or comptes administratifs) with those held by the
public accountants (accounting statements or comptes de gestion). While there has been some
progress in the production of the accounting statements o f the three principal public accountants,
more remains to be done, specifically for local governments and noncommercialpublic entities.

Government actions
240.    The Government has continued the implementation o f PRGB, a comprehensive reform
program on public finance management issues, from the institutional framework, to the budget law,
to budget execution and budget control. PRGB defines the actions needed to address these issues and
it includes a result framework to assessperformance. The PRGBis a key element o fthe Performance
Assessment Framework o f the MOU for budget support. Recently, the Government has taken steps
to enhance the effectiveness o f PRGB by sharpening its strategic content and defining a medium-
term expenditure framework for public finance management reform.

Bank's advice and recommendation

241.    The Bank views the PRGB as relevant in addressing public finance management issues in
Burkina Faso. Indeed, PRGB i s underpinnedby the CFAA carried out in 2001 with the support o f the
Bank and several other donors. Specific measures that the Government could implement include
improving the monitoring of externally-financed projects; establish an accounting system for
government property; identifying and monitoring poverty reduction expenditure through adequate
marker in the functional budget classification; strengthening ex post audits by the IGF and IGE,
increasing the staff of audit units, reviewing the status o f inspectors, and making effective use o f
HACLC reports; expedite the production o f budget execution reports, the Treasury's general balance
and the accounting statements of all public accountants; revive the production o f sectoral MTEF and
strengthen the link between PRSP and Budget processes.

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

242.    The government i s developing a computerized system to improve the monitoring of
externally-funded capital expenditure. It has designed an action plan for a complete information
system based on the debt management software SYGADE. It has established a project task force to
customize SYGADE to take into account grants, and to develop interfaces between SYGADE and
the computerized expenditure circuit (CID) and the State integrated accounting system (CIE). As
originally sought, the task would be completed intime for the implementation of the 2007 budget.

243.    The Government is developing an accounting system for government property. The
physical verification o f government property was completed for all provinces (43) but Houet (Bobo-
Dioulasso) and Kadiogo (Ouagadougou). The physical verification was also completed in the


                                                - 54 -

commune o f Ouagadougou (province of Kadiogo). A private firm was hired to build the accounting
system. The completion o f the task i s scheduled inthe summer 2006.

244.     It has continued the deconcentration of budget operations. The delegation of credit was
introduced for the Ministryo f secondary and higher education, and for the Ministryo f Justice.

245.     The 2006 budget was adopted in line with the MTEF 2006-2008 and the PRSP
priorities. The MTEF was prepared and discussed in April 2005 at the launch o f the budget cycle
preparation. Within the overall ceiling set under the MTEF, the authorities significantly increased the
allocation for non-wages recurrent expenditures in priority sectors, including health, social action
and national solidarity, basic education, secondary and higher education and rural development.

246.     K e y reforms to be implemented inthe next series o f PRSCs would include: (i)  improving the
monitoring of poverty-spending through the budget functional classification; (ii)strengthening
program-based budget at the sectoral levels; (iii)  further improving the capacity o f the Audit Court
and other audit bodies, and making public annual progress reports on their recommendations; (iv)
accompanying the deconcentration and decentralization reform; (v) disseminate information on
budget and improve civil society organizations capacity to analyze the budget.

Procurement

Description

247.     Procurement i s a priority issue in Burkina Faso for strengthening public expenditure
management, improving governance, transparency, efficiency, equity and integrity. The total volume
of public procurement i s large and increasing. Public procurement financed by external resources
represents about 66 percent o f the total procurement as a result o f the large share o f external
financing    in non-wage expenditures. Available statistics indicate that noncompetitive tender
represented 11percent o ftotal tender in2004.

Challenges

248.     A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was carried out in 2005 (see box 2). It
assessed the quality of the national procurement system against the 12 benchmark indicators
proposed by the Working Group composed o f OECDiDAC and the World Bank. The assessment
indicated a score o f 55 percent out o f a best o f 100 percent (see figure 3 below). The CPAR also
assessed the performance o f the national procurement system in 2000, prior to the implementation o f
the first series o f PRSCs, and found out a score o f 31 percent, which points to some progress
between 2000 and 2005. Should all the recommendations o f the 2005 CPAR are implemented, it is
 expectedthat the score o f the procurement system wouldbe 76 percent by 2010.

249.    To a large extent, the score in 2005 reflects new goalposts introduced by the CPAR.
Government's record in implementingprocurement reforms during the first series o f PRSCs was
excellent. The score also indicates the need to shift attention to implementation and effective
operation o fprocurement systems.

Government Actions

250.    After the 2000 CPAR, the Government has launched a vast reform and capacity building
programs. It began to prepare annual public procurement plans. It adopted a new decree on public
procurement, and procedural manual and standard texts were validated in February 2004. The new
decree establishes clear and exhaustive rules promoting transparency in competition, describes
explicitly the responsibilities of the bodies involved, particularly those of the Central Directorate for
Public Procurement (DCMP), and outlines a conflict resolution system. Internal and external public-
procurement audits were conducted with a view to greater transparency. External audits were also
carried out for the years 2001,2002 and 2004, with financing from the European Commission. Other
actions include: (i) extension o f the scope o f public procurement to administrative contracts for the
delegations and the concessions o fpublic services; (ii)  creation o f an independent appeal mechanism
for contract awards through the setting up o f the "Comite Permanent de Reglement Amiable des
Litiges" (CRAL); and (v) establishment o f a mechanism for an effective application o f sanctions
applicable to civil servants and the private sector (bidders and suppliers/consultants and contractors).

25 1.    InDecember 2004, a presidential decree established CNCS (a committee for the monitoring
o f procurement reforms) that comprises stakeholders from the public sector as well as from the civil
society, including private sector representatives and an NGO active in anti-corruption drive. The
creation o f the CNCS provides a formal and effective institutional framework to coordinate and
follow-up the implementation o f the procurementreforms aims.

Bank's adviceandrecommendation

252.     The 2005 CPAR concluded that despite improvements in the procurement regulatory and
institutional framework, there are still some weaknesses, including: (i)    the restrictions applicable to
the scope o f public procurement; (ii) central tender board (DCMP) being responsible for both
                                         the
regulating public procurement and implementation; (iii)      the lack o f an appeals mechanism to deal
with complaints duringthe biddingprocess; and (iv) the lack o f an adequate institutional framework



                                                  - 56 -

 to determine the nature of the faultsierrors for the application of sanctions. These elements are in the
 action plan drawn up from the CPAR.

 253.       The Government should provide adequate resources to CNCS to ensure it can perform its
 tasks and duties. Finally, CNCS should put in place an M&E system for the action plan in order to
 track progress and make necessaryrecommendation during implementation.

 Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

 254.       On March 1, 2006, the Government has adopted an action plan for procurement.reforms
 based on the recommendations of the 2005 CPAR.

 255.       Next PRSCs will support the implementation of the procurement reform action plan. A
 trigger for PRSC-7 would be: (i)             adoption of a decree for the creation o f a regulatory agency for
 public procurement (ARMP); (ii)               revision of the attribution, composition and fimctioning o f the
 Central Directorate for Public Procurement (DCMP); (iii)                  creation o f specialized procurement units
 for principal contracting authorities/administrations, defining their attribution and functioning, and
 providing more responsibilities to the managers of these contracting authorities. ARMP would be
 operational by 2008 and will manage the monitoring and evaluation systems. A list of performance
 indicators will be prepared by the Government and CNCS with the support of the Afncan
 Development Bank and the World Bank during the mid-term review of the implementation o f the
 CPAR action plan, currently scheduledfor June 2008.

 Participatory Approach: The Minister of Finance andBudget agreedto aparticipatory approachthrough the establishment of a
 tripartite nationaltask force- the ComitiNational de Coordination et de Suivi (CNCS) composedby the public sector, the
 private sector and the civil society inorder to ensure ownership of the public procurement reform. The CNCS was createdby a

  Decentralization

  Description

  256.      Political decentralization started inthe 1990s and was pursued in 1995 and 2000 with the
  elections o f about 50 city councils. InDecember 2004, a new decentralization law was adopted
  "Code Ge`nkraldes CollectivitksTerritoriales" (CGCT). It was a significant step forward, since it
  settled some of the issues related to the institutional architecture of Burkina Faso territorial


                                                             - 57 -

system, which is now as follows: (i)at the decentralized.,level,                13 regions, 49 urban
municipalities and from 2006, 302 rural municipalities; (i)at the deconcentrated level, 13
regions, 45 provinces, and 350 districts (ddpartements).

257.    Communal elections took place on April 23, 2006. The creation of 302 new communes and
o f 13 regional councils, the transfer of competencies to the 49 urban communes (i.e. Primary Health
Care, pre-school education and primary education, culture, youth, sports and leisure), and the
continuation o f the deconcentration process in support of the new local governments would represent
significant challenges for central and local governments. An inter-ministerial committee was created
to improve coordination between MATD, which leads the decentralization reform, the MFPRE,
responsible for defining the strategic orientation of the deconcentration policy as well as human
resource management, and the MFB, responsible for the financial implications o f the reform. This
coordination needs to be sustained, since key decisions and options remain to be taken.

Challenges

258.    The main challenges for a successfil decentralization are the following: (i)          transfer o f
human resources to the local governments; (ii)        adequate finding for local governments through
transfers andor tax sharing; (iii)    restructuring o f central and deconcentrated ministerial units to
provide support to the newly established local governments, and improving coordination between
these structures and capacity constraints at the national level; (iv) building capacity o f the new local
governments.

Government Actions

259.     In order to address these major issues, the following actions have been taken by the
Government.

260.     The MFPRE has enacted a decree on deconcentration with the stated objective to provide
technical support to the local governments while continuing the implementation o f responsibilities
which remain under the control o fthe central Government.

261.     As for human resources, the decision was taken to retain the current civil service workforce
underthe management o fthe central government. Staffs who are currently working on activities that
are transferred to local governments will only be seconded to the latter, and their salaries will be paid
bythe central government. The decision takes into account concerns expressedbythe employees and
trade unions as for an effective transfer to local governments. However, this option has significant
risks as it introduces distortions in the lines o f accountability. In addition, because central
government jobs are not usually linkedto a geographical area (other than for newly recruited staff in
health and education), retaining staff in the communes could be a challenge. Inorder to allow local
governments to recruit new staff, an existing decree on a local civil service i s beingrevised.

Bank's advice and recommendation

262.     There is a strong need to clarify the scope o f deconcentration. It is crucial that the future
status o f currently deconcentrated units such as the provincial directions for the education sector be
determined (whether or not they are transferred to local governments).

263.     There i s a risk of multiplication o f structures, with related issues of overlaps, coordination
challenges, and overstretched capacity. It i s important to carefully assess the need for creating new


                                                   - 58 -

deconcentrated units: not all ministries need to be deconcentrated; not all ministries need to have a
technical unit in all the country (for instance, the tax department decides on deconcentration based
on the potential for tax collection). It would be critical to carefully assess the financial and capacity
implications o f any deconcentration options.

264.    The relationship between the governorate and the technical unitsmust be clearly expressed.
Since the Governor i s the Administrateur de Crkdits, and she i s also given the authority to manage
human resources, it i s important that her mandate be carefully regulated in order to avoiding delays
in implementing policies and in transferring necessary resources to the lower levels o f the
administration and to the service delivery units.

265.    Lastly, it i s important to clarify the financial resources for local governments so as to avoid
what has beena crux o f decentralization inthe sub-region: "the decentralization o f the problems".

Measures undertaken as part of the proposed operation

266.    The Government has defined the framework for the transfers of resources and
competences to the communes. It has adopted a draft law that defines the resources and expenses o f
local government. Inparticular, the draft law defines a general-purpose grant (unconditional) for the
recurrent budget of local governments as well as a general-purpose grant for their capital budget. The
draft law also defines local taxes and tax sharing mechanisms with the central governments. In
addition the government has defined the accounting and financial regime for local governments,
including budget and accounting classification. Furthermore, the government adopted draft
devolution decrees for the effective transfers o f resources and assets to urban communes. The
Government also adopted a priority actions plan to assist new regional councils and rural communes.

267.    The Government has continued the deployment of the CICL which is now operational
in 8 regions. The software CICL is an integrated accounting system for local governments. Its
creation was a key preparatory step for the decentralization as it ensures an adequate fiduciary
framework for public spending at local levels, including the ability to produce accounting statements
(comptes de gestion).


Civil Service Reform

Description

268.    A national plan for the Comprehensive Reform of Public Administration was adopted in
 199813.Main axis are: (i)       deconcentration o f human resources management to line ministries; (ii)
adoption o f more flexible hiring arrangements; (iii)          introduction o f a merit-based evaluation system
for civil servants and; (iv) gradual extension o f an integrated administrative and payroll information
system (SIGASPE). Next reforms in this area will be devised under the overall decentralization
reform.




 l3
  Three main documents spell out the Governmentpolicy on State Reform:
        The Riforme Globale de Z'Administration Publique (ComprehensiveReform ofPublic Administration, RGAP) (1998),
        The National GoodGovernancePlan (1998-2003),
        T h e Decree 2002-253/PRESiPMadopted on July 1gth2002.

                                                        - 59 -

Challenges

269.    The most pressing issues are: over-centralization which creates delays and inadequacies in
assigning posts, murky recruitment criteria and persistence o f the seniority criterion for promotions,
absence of regionalized recruitment creating a return movement towards the urban centers and
therefore inadequate allocation o fhuman resources nationwide, absence o f HRplanning and forecast
policies, absence of training policies and professional training culture, diffi'cult retention o f trained
staff inpublic structures.

270.     Decentralization i s adding a new challenge. The option o f transferring staff was not retained,
and staff from areas transferred to the local governments will be seconded to the latter, which needs
to be carefully supervised to ensure local governments get the services they are entitled to.

GovernmentActions

271.     Decentralization o f human resources management started in 1998 with the creation o f
Human Resources Directorates (DRH) in all ministries and the creation o f a computerized tool for
human resource management, the SIGASPE. SIGASPE terminals have been installed in various
ministerial departments, starting in large ministries -together with training o f the staff. The goal i s
now to deploy the tool at the regional level (cf. decentralization section).

272.     Prerequisites for the implementation o f the long-awaited evaluation policy are being tackled:
progress has been made in(i)    training the managers in charge o f evaluating their staff on establishing
results-based contracts and conducting a performance evaluation interview, and (ii)defining job
profiles for each ministries.

Bank's advice and recommendation

273.     Government's plan to update SIGASPE to include a management module will allow
institutions to actively manage their staff, and progress i s needed inthat area. The update should be
linked to an active policy o fprofessional training, supported by public training institutes. As already
envisaged, the completion o f the remaining modules o f SIGASPE (statistics, allocation, promotion)
should also be accelerated.

274.     A clarification o f the roles between MFPRE (in charge o f civil service and reform o f the
State) and line ministries could also improve human resource management. Lastly, the Government
should move on its program to ensure that SIGASPE i s deployed in all ministries, and the merit-
based evaluation system i s implemented inall ministries

Measuresundertakenas part of the proposedoperation

275.     An actionplan for the deployment o fSIGASPE to lineministrieswas adoptedinMarch2005
butthere hasbeen little progress since then.

                     PROPOSEDFRAMEWORK THE NEXTSERIESOF PRSC
                                                FOR

276.    PRSC 7-9 will support CAS implementation in FY07-09. The design o f the reform program
under PRSC 7-9 will be completed duringthe preparation o f PRSC-7 in FY07, in close coordination
with Government and other donors inthe budget support group. The next series will be underpinned
by ongoing analytical work such as a Trade Study, an Investment Climate Assessment and a Labor
Market Study. The completion o f a country economic memorandum, a decentralization study, and a
Financial Management Assessment (possibly using the PEFA framework) will also help in the
formulation o f the reform program.

277.    Consistent with the CAS, the next series would provide support to the implementation o f the
four PRSP pillars: (i)accelerated and shared growth; (ii)   improved access to basic social services;
(iii)increased income and employment opportunities for the poor; (iv) better governance and
increased decentralization. The PRSC series will complement other sectoral investments in the CAS
by focusing on the first and fourth pillars. Annex 6 and Annex 7 provides an initial discussion on the
issues o f decentralization and growth, respectively. Annex 7 discusses the drivers for growth, a key
lesson i s that a balanced approach i s needed to foster growth in Burkina: while the more intuitive
policies described under the first pillar will promote growth, it i s equally important to invest in
human development and governance which could be powerful drivers for growth.

278.    Figure 5 adapted from the CAS (see Annex 5), and table 8 summarize the proposed core
indicators for the next series and the proposedtriggers for PRSC-7, respectively.

                                          POVERTY      AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

279.     It is expected that the reform program supported by the proposed PRSC-6 would improve the
living conditions o f the poorest segment o f the population. A critical analytical underpinning for the
proposed PRSC-6 is the Poverty Assessment (PA) which exploits the household data from 1998 and
2003 data to study the links between growth and poverty in 1998-2003 and, under possible hture
growth paths, explore options to enhance the poverty impact o f growth, and respond to
macroeconomic shocks. The P A shows that growth has a significant impact on poverty and that the
growth-inequality trade-off is fairly small in Burkina Faso. A one percent growth results in a 2
percent decline in the poverty gap, the average distance between the poor and the poverty line. A one
percent increase in inequality, measured by the Gini index, would need to be compensated by about
1.4-1.5 percent more growth in Burkina Faso, a number that i s small compared to several other
countries that have previously been studied. Inrural areas 0.8-1.1 percent more growth would suffice
to compensate for a one percent increase in inequality, but in urban areas it would require 3.3-3.4
percent more growth.

280.     The P A findings as regards the trade-off between growth, poverty, and inequality, provided
additional rationale for PRSC-6 focus on a growth path driven by improved productivity in the rural
and cotton sector, and broader private sector participation in the secondary and tertiary sectors,
including in the utilities sector. In addition, drawing from the findings o f the Risk and Vulnerability
Assessment ReportI4 ,this PRSC series to which PRSC-6 belongs has supported the introduction o f
social protection measures (OVC) inthe Government's poverty reduction strategy.

281.     The proposed operation and subsequent PRSCs would also have a positive impact on the
poorest segment o f the population through the increased focus on decentralization. First,
decentralization i s expected to increase efficiency in the use o f resources and therefore enhance
growth perspectives.           The efficiency gains stems from the informational advantage that local
governments have compared to the Central Government, and also from the closer scrutiny they are
subject from local population. N o t all empirical studies agree on this positive relation between
decentralization and growth but more recent papers strongly support the intuitive hypothesis.I                        S 16 17

Second, in addition to the growth contribution, decentralization i s also likely to improve services
delivery to the poorest as it tends to raise the accountability o f local governments as providers o f
local services. Nevertheless, there are also risks to decentralization as noted by PRSP-2 which
mentions the risks o f capture by local elites. For this reason, it would be beneficial for future PRSC
that a full PSIA be undertaken on the impact o f decentralization on growth and services delivery to
the poorest.

282.    The ministry o f finance and budget (MFB) will be responsible for overall implementation o f
the proposed PRSC-6. The Secretary o f the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring o f Financial
Programs and Policies (SP-PPF) in the MFB will lead the government technical team with
representatives o f the Ministries o f Finance and Budget; Economy and Development; Health; Basic
Education and Literacy; Secondary Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research;
Environment and Living Conditions; Agnculture, Water and Fisheries; Commerce, Enterprise
Development, and Artisanship; Energy and Mines; Decentralization; and representatives o f public
enterprises.

283.    Bank's supervision effort will be aligned with the government-led monitoring and evaluation
system underpinning the revised PRSP, the Priority Action Plan, and the Unified Framework for
Budgetary Support (UFBS). The specific benchmarks and outcomes to be monitored under PRSC-6
(see annex 3) are extracted from the government overall development program (annex 2), thus
providing significant benefits in reducing transaction costs for the Government. The joint
performance matrix under the UFBS was not available at the time o f PRSC-6 preparation, and
therefore there are some minor differences between the two matrices. The PRSC-6 team will work
with the authorities and the other donors under the UFBS to ensure that coordination o f the
supervision efforts will increase predictability and aid alignment with the budget cycle. In assessing
the implementation o f the PRSP/PRSC, the UFBS will take into account factors outside
government's control that may alter the underlyng assumptions for a successful PRSP
implementation. Such factors include declining terms o f trade, weather-related disaster, shortfalls in
external assistance, regional instability etc.

284.    Public financial management system.The 2001 CFAA and CPAR were key inputs in the
preparation o f the government's budget management reform program (Programmede Rkforme de la
Gestion Budgitaire, PRGB), as were the 2004 HIPC AAP.                          The Government i s also using the
findings o fthe recently completed 2005 CPAR to update the PRGB.The PRGB is supported bymost
donors providing budgetary support, and is a core element o f the MOU for budget support. Under
PRSC-1 to PRSC-5, most recommendations o f the CFAA and CPAR have been successfully
implemented. The government i s implementing annual audit procedures recommended by the
CFAA. PRSC-6 i s buildingup on the achievements under the first PRSCs by supporting the further
strengthening of ex-post audits, and by including additional measures to enhance transparency o f
budgeting and timeliness o f accounting (see annex 3). In particular, PRSC-6 has supported the
adoption o f an action plan based on the findings o f the 2005 CPAR. In the context o f PRSC-6
preparation, the Bank has reviewed fiduciary arrangements. Overall, the Bank has judged
implementation performance o f the PFM reform program to date and government's commitment to
PFMimprovements as satisfactory.

285.    Safeguardassessmentof the CentralBank'*.The Central Bank of the West African States
(BCEAO) is the common central bank o f the West African States, which includes Burkina Faso. In
2005, IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment o f the BCEAO and found that progress

has been made in strengthening the BCEAO's safeguard framework since 2002 when the last
safeguard assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a full set o f audited financial
statements, and improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IMF staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the
explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled for the next fiscal
year, with a view toward a graduate alignment with International Accounting Standard (IAS), as
adopted internationally by other central banks. Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in
place, mechanisms have been established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and
follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened. The external
auditor has apprised the Board o f Directors o f the BCEAO o f the quality o f internal controls in June
2003.

286.    IMF staff identified a number o f areas where further steps would help solidify the progress
made in recent years. The main recommendations relate to: (i)improving the external audit
process by adopting a formal rotation policy and further enhancing the transparency o f the financial
statements by adopting IFRS in full; (ii)enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function
by further strengthening the reportingto management o fthe BCEAO.

287.    Bank financial management specialists visited Ouagadougou in October 2005 and
reviewed the flow of funds arrangement between the Central Bank and the National Treasury.
The team met with Central Bank and Treasury officials. It also met with members of the Budget
Support Group (UE and Switzerland) that have been funding an annual audit o f the flow o f
budgetary funds between the Central Bank and Treasury. The team concluded that current
arrangements are adequate, with fiduciary risks within acceptable risk tolerance levels. However, the
team recommended the information systems o f these two institutions to be linked, so as to minimize
delays and discrepancies in flows reporting, thus eliminating cumbersome reconciliations.

288.    Disbursement and Implementation Arrangement: It i s proposed that the credit of US$60
million equivalent be disbursed immediately upon effectiveness. The untied budget support will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development program and not tied to any
specific purchase and no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the credit becomes
effective, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a Government account at the Central Bank
which forms part o f the country's foreign exchange reserves; and as a due diligence measure, IDA
will obtain confirmation from he government that the amount of the credit has been accounted for in
the country's budget management system (say within 30 days o f disbursement). If,after depositing in
this account, the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to either: (a) apply the
corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to IDA. N o dedicated
account i s required. The administration of this financing will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finances and Budget.

289.    The Bank has determined that the specific actions supported under the proposed PRSC-6 are
not expected to have a significant effect on Burkina's environment and natural resources. The

potential environmental impacts o f the series o f PRSC 4-6 stem from its sectoral coverage. However,
these impacts, which are mainly linked to the measures for rural development, divestiture program
and reform o f the energy sector, as well as to investments in education and health, should not be
extensive; nor will they be irreversible.

290.    The PRSC team has assessed the readiness o f the borrower to deal with environmental
issues. The assessment found that Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations pertaining to
environmental assessment but that compliance with such regulations i s weak. Like many other IDA
countries, Burkina Faso prepared a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) at the beginning o f
the 1990s.Unlike in the other countries, however, the NEAP o f Burkina Faso was not reflected in a
coherent investment program, which could have included capacity-building components. The result
was delays in creating the regulatory framework, a lack o f experience and limited capacity in certain
areas o f environmental management, particularly environmental assessment. The current regulatory
framework for the country's environmental management i s the result o f a slow but steady
development o f environmental law, including land law, forest law and mininglaw.

291.    The team focused on the institutional and technical capacity o f the government agencies
involved in supervising environmental assessment (EA). The Environment L a w enacted in 1997
describes the situations inwhich an environmental assessment o f development activities i s required,
as well as the procedures to be followed for its preparation. Typically, the law requires that any
development activity likely to produce major adverse environmental impacts should be the subject o f
an environmental assessment, which must be endorsed by the Ministry o f the Environment. The law
also requires that a public consultation should be organized with the affected parties/communities to
discuss potential impacts and ways to mitigate them. However there i s a lack o f clarity in the
responsibilities o f the institutions responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations. In
addition, the lack o f technical capacity and awareness both within the Government and in the non-
government sector for applying EA to development operations constituted a major obstacle to
obtaining a higher level o f compliance with the regulations enacted.

292.    On the basis of this assessment, the PRSC team agreed that EA capacity buildingwould be
the focus o f the measures proposed to deal with environmental issues in the PRSCs. Inthat context,
PRSC-6 i s providing support to measures aiming at strengthening government's capacity for
environmental and natural resource management: (i)implementation o f capacity-building program
on environmental issues including the inclusion o f their cost in the MTEF for 2006-2008 and the
2006 annual budget; (ii)   creation o f cells in sectoral ministries in order to strengthen compliance
with national regulations; (iii) improved supervision o f the management o f ligneous forest resources
bymeans o f effective improvements andpromotion o fbiomass energy.

293.    Furthermore, there i s a close and direct link between PRSC-6 and Bank-supported sectoral
investment projects as regards compliance with environmental issues, and these accompanying
sectoral investment operations have their own environmental management plans (EMPs) formulated
to offset the main environmental impacts identified during their evaluation. These sectoral EMPs
also contribute to offset adverse environmental impacts. These projects are: (i) the Community-based
Rural Development project; (ii)    the Basic Education Sector project; (iii) Response to HIV/AIDS
                                                                           the
project; (iv) the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development project; and (v) the Energyproject.

                                     R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

294.     The risks for this operation include: (i) weak capacity at the central and decentralized level;
(ii)commodity and currency rates risks; and (iii)   regional instability.

295.     Weak Capacity i s a moderate risk. The capacity o f the administration to formulate and
execute programs remains weak. Continued weaknesses in implementation capacity, particularly in
line ministries, may hamper improvements in service delivery. The preparation and implementation
of program budgets can only advance hrther if the capacity o f the civil service i s improved. Inthis
respect, the Bank has prepared a PER in FY04 to give guidance for further improvements in the
budget process, especially as regards integrating the budget and PRSP processes and objectives. In
the area o f public sector management, the Bank i s financing a capacity buildingproject approved by
the Board on March 22,2005 to accompany and complement PRSC-6 and future PRSCs. Inthe area
of monitoring and evaluation, the Bank finances a statistical capacity building project. The Bank i s
also preparing a Capacity Building Project to accompany the decentralization reform in the urban
areas.

296.     Commodity prices and currency shocks are moderate risks in 2006. Burkina Faso i s
heavily vulnerable to fluctuations o f world prices for cotton and oil, and to the appreciation o f the
EURO - to which the CFAF is pegged at a fixed rate - against the US$. High oil prices drain
international reserves, and increase petrochemicals, electricity and transportation costs with adverse
impact on the overall economy. Since cotton i s the main export product o f the economy, low
international prices hurt the country's performance and sternly affect about 2 millionpersons inrural
areas where most o f the poor live. The potential fiscal impact o f continuous low cotton price i s also
significant. The continuous depreciation o fthe U S dollar i s also a threat to the competitiveness o f the
economy. Under this operation, the Bank i s promoting reforms to improve efficiency in the energy
sector, including privatization and regulatory reforms. The Bank also helps the Government in
implementing far-reaching cotton sector reformpolicies through the PRSC series. The Bank has also
a flexible approach in the amount of PRSC financing to respond          -ifneeded - to external shocks.
Regarding the currency shock, support under the PRSC will provide the authorities with non-
inflationary deficit financing, thus helping to keep the real effective exchange rate at an adequate
level. A last mitigating factor i s the Government's proven ability to weather significant adverse
shocks, including the 30 percent decline o fterms o ftrade it experienced in2005.

297.     Risks of regional instability are moderate risks in 2006. Burkina Faso being a landlocked
country, it totally depends on its neighbors for delivery o f goods to and out o f the country, and this
geographical dependence makes the country's economy vulnerable to any political instability in the
region. Recently, the political and security context in neighboring CBte d'Ivoire has been a concern.
So far, the negative impacts of the crisis have been mainly economic - trade, transport linkages and
Government revenues. The humanitarian and social impacts o f large numbers o f displaced people
have been relatively limited although this could change if the situation deteriorates in light o f the
close economic and social links. Iflarge numbers o f BurkinabC return from CBte d'Ivoire, it will put
a severe strain on the delivery o f social services, which i s already weak and stretched.

298.     The risks posed by the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire are being somewhat mitigated by the
adjustment already made by the economy when the crisis first erupted in late 2002, notably the
opening o f new routes to Benin, Togo and Ghana. The risk i s also alleviated through a regional
response to the impacts o f the crisis on neighboring countries by the African Union and regional

bodies. Membership in regional integration organizations, including ECOWAS and the CFA Zone
arrangement, not only provide mediation opportunities but also generate pressure for a prompt
resolution of conflicts. Moreover, it i s expected that the Government o f Burkina Faso will continue
to demonstrate its commitment to the peaceful resolution of this conflict through continued support
to the implementation of existingpeace agreement. Ifthe situation in Cote d'Ivoire deteriorates with
more Burkinabe returning home, the Bank could consider increasing PRSC financing to provide
timely support to the Government and host communities.

    Washington, D.C. 20433
    U.S.A.

    Subiect:Letter o fDevelopment Policy

  Mr.President:

  1.    The aim o f this Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) i s to outline recent developments in
  Burkina Faso's economic and social situation and the related prospects over the next two years. This
  LDP i s based primarily on the revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Priority
  Action Program (PAP) 2005-2007 associated with it. Program implementation details are contained
  inthe implementation report 2005. The LDP focuses on the executionofthe Government's program
  o f key reforms, which i s supported by the poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) from the World
  Bank.

        1.STATE OF IMPLEMENTATIONOF THE PRSP:
           THE CONTRIBUTIONOF THE PRSCs

  2.    Despite the unfavorable global economic environment (ongoing crisis in CGte d'Ivoire, low
  cotton prices, leap in oil prices), the economy o f Burkina Faso has remained on the path o f growth
  and real GDP grew by 7.1 percent in 2005 thanks to record levels o f grain and cotton production.
  The progress made is remarkable when compared to 2004, when real GDP rose by 4.6 percent.
  Inflation was contained at 6.4 percent despite price pressures for agricultural and petroleum
  products. After a good crop season in 2005/06, agncultural product prices dropped in late 2005,
  which led to a significant decline in inflation in 2006. The budget deficit and external deficit were
  financed in their entirety by grants or loans on highly concessionary terms. The strong improvement
  inmacroeconomic performancewas recognizedbythe IMF's Executive Board, which completed the
  fifth review o f the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) on March 13, 2005.             The
  advances made under the reforms supported by the sixth poverty reduction support credit (PRSC VI)
  are in line with the four pillars ofthe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).

              1.1.Acceleratingbroad-basedgrowth
  3.    The state budget i s the instrument for operationalizing PRSP priorities. The budget law for
  2006 passed by the National Assembly in December 2005 was underpinned by the Medium-Term
  Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 2006-2008, which was aimed at ensuring optimal financing o f the


                                                   - 8 4 -

poverty reduction program by improving revenue and curbing non-priority expenditure. Increased
efforts were made to implement the reforms initiated in previous years under the Action Plan to
Strengthen Fiscal Management (PRGB), an integral part o f the Priority Action Program o f the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PAP-CSLP).

4.    With a view to accelerating economic growth and ensuring that its benefits are shared more
broadly, the Government pursued the implementation o f measures aimed at enhancing the
competitiveness o f the agncultural and agro-alimentary sectors.        Thus, after eliminating the
monopoly in the cotton sector in 2004, an interprofessional association-including    the three cotton
ginning companies, cotton growers, and the various stakeholders in the sector-was     established on
February 21,2006.

5.     In the area of export promotion, the process o f developing standards and labels for oilseed
(sesame, cashew, shea) and cowpeas, which began in 2005 with the actual formulation o f draft
standards, i s now finalized with the completion o f the public enquiry required before certification.
Other important measures such as the development o f the export promotion strategy for livestock
and beef and the implementation o f the cereal action plan are beingpursued to the same end.

6.    The Government has continued to implement structural reforms aimed at bolstering private
sector- led economic growth, thank to its privatization program, improvements in the regulatory
framework, and reductions inthe administrativebarriers to private investment.

7.    To improve the business climate and enhance the competitiveness o f the Burkina Faso
economy, the ONATEL privatization process was again pursued with the signing on January 30,
2006 o f a services contract with the investment bank tasked with assisting the Government. Review
o f Law No. 16-20051ANestablishing general regulations on electrical power supply in Burkina Faso
will make it possible to fine-tune the institutional framework and clearly define the powers o f the
regulatory body for the electricity subsector, and to continue with the process o f privatizing
SONABEL and SONABHY.

8.    The Centre de Formalites des Entreprises (CEFORE) [Business Formalities Facilitation
Center] established by Decree No. 2005-332/PRES/MCPEA/MFB/MTEJ/MJ o f June 21, 2005 has
been operating in Ouagadougou since January 9, 2006. Implementation o f this decree has led to a
reduction in the time required for completing all the formalities for launching a company from 135
days to 7 days and a reduction in the number o f legal formalities from 8 to 4. An arbitration center
has been established to speed up settlement o f work disputes.

             1.2. Promoting accessto basic social services by the poor
9.     Under the second pillar o f the PRSP, which promotes basic social services, especially basic
education and health, social protection, potable water, and sanitation, much progress has been made
intaking into account the most vulnerable social groups when implementing sectoral programs.

10. Based on budget law appropriations, allocations to the social sectors (basic education and
literacy, health) continued to be supported during 2005, and accounted for 25.3 percent o f the total
budget excluding debt service, tax exemptions, and externally financed programs, as against 24.6
percent in 2004. The shares o f health and of basic education and literacy in the budget increased
from 10.2percent and 14.4percent in2004 to 12.3 percent and 15.8 percent in2005.

             1.2.I. Access to basic education services


                                                - 85 -

11. The Government continued to strive to meet its goals in line with the commitments made
under the ten-year basic education development program (PDDEB).              A mid-tern review o f the
PDDEB conducted in December 2005 highlighted the wide concept o f basic education and new
initiatives now available such as the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI, initiative
25/2005). Other actions taken included increasing the budget for the basic education program and
continuing the school grants program in the twenty provinces with the lowest enrolment ratios.
Overall, based on data from a flash survey conducted in December 2005 by the Ministry o f Basic
Education and Literacy (MEBA), the gross enrolment ratio stood at 60.24 percent and that for girls
54.50 percent, reflecting increases o f percentage points and y percentage points, respectively, over
the 2004 levels.

12.    Consistent with the goals o f the PDDEB and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in
education, a sectoral MTEF covering the Ministryo f Basic Education (MEBA) and the Ministry o f
Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research (MESSRS) was drawn up during the first
quarter o f 2006. It provides an overview of the education system in order to better channel activities
while at the same time ensuring linkages throughout the education system.

             1.2.2.      Access to health services
13.    Within the context o f combating poverty, the Government indicated its determination to
promote access to health services on the part o f the poor. This commitment includes limiting the
impact of health care payments on the incomes o f poor households, in particular through the
implementation o f a national system for subsidizing emergency obstetrical care (SOU) and assisted
childbirth with a view to assuming the costs incurred by the poorest and improving the quality o f
related health care. The strategy was adopted by the Council o f Ministers on March 22, 2006. This
measure, in force since early 2006, should contribute to a significant reduction in infant and maternal
mortality by 2015, consistent with the commitments undertaken in the MDGs. Under the 2006
budget law an overall provision o f CFAF 1,472 millionhas been made, o f which CFAF 934 million
will come from resources under the HIPC Initiative to provide free medical attention for mothers and
infants. Along the same lines, most health districts have taken steps to introduce a schedule o f fees
for professional and hospital services, subsidize treated mosquito netting, and assume the costs o f
treating infantile diseases.

 14.    Inorder to improve health infrastructureinoutlying areas, a plan o faction for staffmotivation
and distribution and for setting o f compensation according to area o fpractice has been implemented.
Its aim i s to guarantee an equitable distribution o f personnel throughout the country.

 15.   Provisional findings suggest that steps taken by the Government with the support of its
development partners to implement free vaccination programs, including the distribution o f vitamin
A supplements to children under age 5, produced significant results in 2005. Thus DCP3, BCG,
yellow fever (VAA), and measles (VAR) vaccination rates are respectively 96.2 1 percent, 111.70
percent, 84 percent, and 84 percent.

          1.3.   Increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor
 16.   Improving the skills o f the poor and thereby improving their income-generating capacity as
well as encouraging their participation in the production process constitute the third pillar o f the
CSLP and the related program o fpriority reforms.




                                                   - 8 6 -

17.   In2005, robust growth inproductioninthe cotton sector meant that producers received income
equivalent to CFAF 110 billion. The creation of a new interprofessional association in the cotton
subsector in February 2006 should make it possible to improve stakeholders' productivity and
stabilize cotton farmers' incomes inthe mediumand long term.

18.    In an environment marked by a decline inthe price of cotton, several actions have been taken
with the aim o f diversifying agncultural products. Thus, the Burkinabe h i t and vegetable company
(SOBFEL) has been established at Bobo-Dioulasso in order to ensure better promotion o f the fruit
and vegetable subsector. Fruit and vegetable production increased by 50,000 metric tons. Cereal
production was also strong, no doubt because o f the good rainfall during the crop season but also
because o fthe contribution from dry season cultivation.

             1.3.1.  Promoting good governance
19.    The Government, aware that good governance i s an important factor in combating poverty, has
continuedto implementstrategies to consolidate it. A national policy document on good governance
covering the period 2005 -2015 was adopted inJuly 2005.

20.    Improving the mechanisms for managing public finances and improving the decentralization
process continued to be the Government's primary concerns in2005. The priority action plan for the
program to strengthen budget management (PAP-PRGB) continues to be the frame of reference for
conducting reforms inthese areas.

21.    In 2005, a top priority of the Government was to operationalize the general organizational
framework for budgetary support to implement the PRSP (CGAB-CSLP by its French acronym), the
protocol for which was signed on January 11, 2005. Internal rules setting out the roles o f the various
stakeholders in the dialogue were adopted (May 15, 2005) and a joint matrix agreed upon by all
partners providing budgetary assistance (World Bank, Afncan Development Bank, European
Commission, Germany, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands). This matrix
will serve as the basis for selecting the disbursement criteria for the various contributions. The
CGAB-CSLP protocol calls for an independent assessment each year that the partnership i s in
operation as well as an audit o f the financial flows o f budgetary support provided by the partners.
The September 2005 session adopted terms of reference for conducting these two activities, which
commenced inFebruary 2006. It also provided an opportunity to take stock o f the implementation of
the CGAB matrix, the updating of the work program for the last quarter of 2005 and for 2006, the
disbursements made in 2005 and the forecasts for 2006, the criteria adopted for technical and
financial partners (TFPs) in the CGAB matrix, the missions scheduled for 2005 and 2006, the status
of the recommendations made in the TFPs' joint assessment o f PRSP implementation, and the
management o f public finances in 2004. Inaddition, a draft assessment o f the activities carried out
in2005 underthe CGAB-CSLP was prepared, and aprogramofactivities for 2006 was drawnup.

22.     Measures were taken in2005 to introduce an accountingsystem for government property. The
physical verification was completed in 43 provinces and inthe commune o f Ouagadougou, after the
training o f the government officers who will manage the process and a phase o f sensitizing regional
authorities. The physical verification will continue in Bobo-Dioulasso in the next weeks. The
information collected in the 43 provinces i s compiled in a support environment specially developed
for this purpose that will facilitate the automatic transfer o f this information to the management
software now being developed by a cabinet hired for that purpose inNovember 2005. The software
will be available inthe third quarter 2006.


                                                 - 87 -

23.   Significant efforts were made in 2005 to comply with obligations for the end o f the fiscal year.
The Ministry of Finance and Budget will now assume responsibility for the production o f aggregate
balances o f Treasury accounts, operating accounts, and draft budget settlement laws are now part o f
the ongoing management o f that ministry's structures. The draft 2004 budget settlement was
submitted to the National Assembly in late August 2005 and was passed during the current session,
which began inearly March 2006.

24.    On March 1, 2006 the Council o f Ministers adopted the plan o f action arising out of the
second analytical review of public sector procurement (CPAR), -along with the associated
conclusions from the recommendations emerging from the audit of public sector procurement for
fiscal 2004. Implementation o f the plan of action will be supervised by the Comite Nationale de
coordination et de suivi des riformes duns le secteur des marchis publics (CNCS) [National
Committee for Coordination and Monitoring o f Public Sector Procurement Reforms], which was
established inlate 2004 to coordinate the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).

25.   Intandem with actions to consolidate procedures for public sector procurement, the General
Finance Inspectorate steppedup its conduct of field audits ofprocurement contracts. Inall, 24 audits
of such contracts representing, excluding contracts executed under agreements entered into with
FASO BAARA, approximately 10 percent o f the total value o f public procurement tracked in the
expenditurecircuit in2005, as compared to 15 audits in2004.

26.   Improvement in the quality of expenditure management continued to be a top priority for the
Government in 2005. Following the Government's selection o f UNCTAD's SYGADE public debt
management software as the primary tool for managing external financing, a project group was
established inMarch 2005 to see to its proper implementation. In implementingthe action plan for a
complete information system based on the software SYGADE, the project group will: (i)        customize
SYGADEfor the monitoring of external financing, (ii) interfacebetween SYGADE, and the
                                                         develop
software CID and CIE, and (iii) operators for the use o f the new system. The project team has
                                 form
beenprovided with the knowledge necessaryto master the installation o f the SYGADE software and
carry out the associatedsystem administration procedures.

27.   Even while adapting SYGADE to monitor external financing, during 2005 all external
financing agreements relating to externally financed project and program loans (330) were entered
into the SYGADE system, as against the projected target o f 80 percent. It should also be noted that
56 grant agreements of all types, amounting to CFAF 400 billion, have been input into the system.
The training of software users began with the staff o f the public debt directorate and will continue
with other stakeholders as the interfaces and other tools are developed, which is expected to get
underway inApril 2006.

28.   Regardingdecentralization, significant progress was made when the Council of Ministers at the
February 1, 2006 and April 16, 2006 sessions, adopted several texts in relation to the legal
framework for the transfer o f resources and competences to sub-national governments (collectivitis
territoriales). These texts are: (i)
                                   a draft law identifylngthe revenue and expenditure o f sub-national
governments inBurkina Faso; (ii)   a decree on the financial and accounting regime applicable to sub-
national governments; (iii)a draft devolution for effective transfer o f competences and assets to
urban communes; (iv) a draft decree on the internal rules for the councils o f sub-national
governments; and (v) a priority actions program to assist the regional and rural councils. The aim o f
these provisions i s to harmonize the legal framework applicable to all sub-national governments and
ensure that they have the resources necessaryto cover their various financial obligations.

     2. OUTLOOKFOR THE PERIOD2006-2007

29.   The Government will continue to take action to further PRSP operationalization and to
improve dialogue with the partners involved in that process.

         a. Acceleratingbroad-based economic growth
30. Inthe macroeconomic area, the Government plans to continue the program o f reforms inorder
to better underpin economic growth, by focusing on the contribution o f the private sector.

31.   To enhance the competitiveness o f the economy and promote the private sector, the
Government will continue to support entrepreneurs (in the oilseed crop and cowpea subsectors) and
will implement the strategy for developing the livestock, beef, and leather and hides subsectors.
Reforms will also be introducedwith a view to promoting investment inmininginBurkina Faso.

32.   The Government will accelerate its privatization strategy in order to finalize the process by the
end o f 2006. Other crucial measures to be taken in order to improve the competitiveness of the
economy include a call for tenders for the management o f SONABEL, the startup o f the works on
the transmission line between Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou, and the initiation o f a bidding
procedure for SONABHY to open its capital to the private sector.

33.   These measures are expected to lead eventually to reduced cost and increased supply o f
electricity.

         2.1.  Guaranteeingbasic social services and social protection to the poor
34.   Government policy aims at maintaining sizeable resources allocated to the social sectors. Over
and above ongoing social programs, these appropriations will fundtargeted wage increases for health
and education staff inthe rural areas and incentives designed to enhance staff motivation.

35.    The policy o fproviding school subsidies inthe 20 provinces with the lowest school enrolment
ratios will continue. Furthermore, to improve the quality o f the educational system the Government
will develop a plan o f action for increasing the number o f hours o f actual teaching. Steps will be
taken to update the PDDEB and to finalize the 2007-2009 medium term expenditure framework
(MTEF) for the education sector in order to provide a coherent planning framework for the
development o fbasic education.

36.   In the health sector, a system for a comprehensive monitoring o f resources allocated to
hospitals, health districts, storage and distribution facilities, and management committees o f
community health centers (CSPSs) will be designed and set up in 2005-2006. The Government will
continue its program o f free vaccinations and will put inplace a multisectoral focus group inthe area
of nutrition and food security.

            2.2.  Promoting employment and income-generating activities for the poor
 37.  The Government's job creation priorities for the period 2005-2006 include enhancing the
professionalism o f the stakeholders involved in the various agricultural subsectors. To that end,
provisions governing the exercise o f functions to be transferred or delegated to other stakeholders in
the   subsector   (regional   agricultural  chambers    (CRAs),    producer organizations (OPAs),
interprofessional bodies, and the private sector) will be enacted.  A plan o f action for oilseed crops
and cowpeas will be implemented in the same period. The above measures will contribute to the



                                                 - 89 -

creation o f acceptable jobs and a significant increase in rural incomes. Moreover, in 2006 the
Government will draft and adopt a plan o f action for implementinghydro-agricultural improvements
(including catchments).

            2.3. Promotion of good governance
38.    Regarding local governance, the Government i s committed to the effective implementation o f
decentralization. It plans to strengthen that process, particularly by complying with the agreed-upon
deadlines for transfemng resources and responsibility to the communities and by effective
deployment o f the software for the integrated accounting system for subnational governments (CICL)
to all regions.

39.    In the area of budget management reform, the Government will have essentially two major
challenges in 2006: finalizing its strategy for strengthening public finances (SRFP) and
implementing its related plan of action on the one hand, and basing the capitalization o f budgetary
support coordination on the smooth runningo f the CGAB-CSLP on the other hand.

40.    Regarding the CGAB-CSLP, an activity program for 2006 has already been adopted. This
program aims principally at encouraging dialogue between the Government and its development
partners within the framework o f implementing the poverty reduction strategy and promoting best
practices in the area of budgetary support. The program, in particular, provides an opportunity for
capacity building which should contribute to increasing the level of budgetary support
simultaneously while improving the predictability o f disbursements. Projected budgetary support
included inthe budget law stands at CFAF 97.8 billion in2006, compared to the CFAF 93.05 billion
mobilized in2005.

41.    Further improvements continue to be made in budget preparation procedures aimed at
establishing close linkages between the PRSP process and the budget. The Government's efforts in
this area are aimed at imparting a sense o fownership to the use o fbudget programmingtools (global
and sectoral MTEFs and program budgets) in the sectoral ministries, by providing training to the
principal stakeholders in the budgeting process. Moreover, a sectoral MTEF in the public finance
sector will be developed in order to underpin, over the 2007-2009 period, a deepening o f budgetary
reforms under the sectoral strategy for strengthening public finances that will be called upon to
replace the budget management reform plan (PRGB) as o f 2007. The Government plans to complete
the development of the integrated revenue circuit (CIR), to implement its first module, and finalize
and put into operation the software o f the accounting system for government property.

42.    Budget execution and control will be also reinforced. In this respect, a detailed attention will
be given to the implementation o f the action plan resulting from the Procurement Assessment
Review, with a focus on the creation o f a regulatory body, the reorganization o f the Central
Directorate for public procurement, and the introduction o f appropriate monitoring mechanisms in
ministries with significant spending level. In addition, a substantial effort will be made to reinforce
the capacity of the audit institutions.

43.    To support the decentralization agenda, the government will provide adequate resources to
sub-national governments allowing them to ensure their development in line with the objectives of
the regional Poverty Reduction Strategies and to improve the living conditions o f the populations,
particularly inrural areas.




                                                  - 90 -

44.    The Government i s convinced of the relevance of the initiatives and measures outlined above.
They have been designed with a view to implementing the program o f priority actions under the
PRSP. With the support of the World Bank through future poverty reduction support credits
(PRSCs), their implementation is expected to contribute to strengthening the macroeconomic
fi-amework and to promote more robust and sustainable economic growth, which i s necessary for a
significant reduction o fpoverty.

                                     Annex 5: Decentralization
            Decentralization in Burkina Faso: Current Situation and Road Ahead

A.     Background

1.     Decentralization in Burltina Faso could be traced as early as in 1926 when Bobo-Dioulasso
was erected as coniniune by colonial rulers, followed by Ouagadougou in 1952. In 1955 tlie
autonomy o f both communes was further extended, and they were rejoined by four other communes
(Banfora, Kaya, Koudougou and Ouahigouya) at the independence in 1960. However, the post-
independence experiences o f deceiitralizatioii were short-lived as Burltiiia Faso went through a long
period o f political turnioil and military rules. The Constitution o f June 2, 1991 reinstated civilian
rules and established the broader framework for the current decentralization. The first set o f
decentralization laws was adopted in 1993, and subsequently revised and expanded in 1998 (Texte
d'Orientation de la Decentralisation, TOD). Burltina Faso enacted a far-reaching decentralization
law on December 21, 2004, the Code General Des Collectivites Territoriales. Local elections took
place on April 23, 2006.

B.     Objectives

The main objectives of tlie decentralization are to:

       Strengthen democratization by empowering local citizens and promotingpublic participation
       inthe managemelit o fpublic affairs
       Promote grassroots' development, improved delivery o f public services, infrastructure
       development and better management o f natural resources
       Strengthen local govenialice.

C.     The Decentralization Framework

2.     Tlie Code defines a two-tier government level (central, local).              Local governments
(Collectivites Territoriales) have legal personality and fiiiaiicial autonomy, and are o f two kinds: the
Communes and the Regions. The communes are divided into urban communes and rural communes.
Tlie introduction o f rural communes in 2006 i s a major milestone as it resulted in a full
communalization o f tlie territory. Currently, there are 13 regions, 49 urban communes and 300 i-ural
communes. The 13 regions are a grouping o f urban and rural communes.

       The Urban Communes

3.     An urbancommune is a geographical unit that includes at least one peiiiiaiieiit agglomeration
of 25 thousand inhabitants and whose economic activities can generate budgetary resources o f at
least CFAF25 million (article 19 o f CGCT). An urban commune could be developed into a commune
with special status, when its principal agglomeration has a population o f at least 200 thousand and its
econoniic activities could generate annual budgetary resources o f at least CFAFSOO million (article
23 o f CGCT). As o f 2006, Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso are the only communes with special
status.




                                                 - 112 -

        The Rural Communes

4.      A rural commune is a cluster o f villages with a population of not less than five thousand
inhabitants, and whose economic activities can generate annual budgetary resources of at least
CFAFS million (article 27 o f the CGCT). In the rural communes, Village Development Council
(CVD) are established to contribute to the elaboration and implementation o f communal
development plans; run local development programs in the Village; participate in the animation o f

                          Box 1:Decentralization in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper

   The experience of urban municipalities revealedsome problems that mayjeopardizethe viability and effectiveness of
    the decentralized territorial government units. This is particularly true with regardto:

              Local governments' capacities for strategic planning, consensus building, strategic and operational
              management,and regionalplanning, which are often inadequatefor local developmentneeds
        0     Uncertainty about the availability of resources and the decentralized authorities' effective control over them,
              which makes it difficult to draw up public plans that meet local needs. The decentralized government units'
              inability to raise sufficient resources has been exacerbatedby widespread poverty and the weak purchasing
              power of the population
              The laws and regulations, along with some centralized practices still being applied, which prevent local
              governments from being full partnersinthe nationaldevelopment process
              Decentralized capacities and structures, which are still too weak to provide effective support for the
              decentralizationprocess
               Local government bodies and structures which are not yet completely open to participationby civil society
               and the private sector.

    The policy o f transferring powers and resources, as well as the local capacity building policy, are bound to help
    eliminate most of these constraints. The division of powers, ways, and means is being set out in policy laws and
    regulations on decentralization. This is based on a system that i s capable of providing adequate solutions to some of
    these problems.

    For this purpose, the following provisionsare under consideration:

         (i)        The subsidiarityprinciple, which states that the central government will only intervene if the task cannot
                    be performedsatisfactorilyat a lower level of government
         (ii)       The clusteringin authorityblocsof the responsibilitiesto betransferred
         (iii)      Simultaneoustransfers of responsibilitiesandresources
         (iv)       The possibility o f temporary or permanent transfers of staff dealing with the transferred powers, and
                    even the transfer of buildings and equipment
         (v)        An arbitration commission to assess the responsibilitiesandresourcesto be transferred
         (vi)       Complianceby localgovernmentswith national defense obligations.


    In 2003, the Government drafted a strategy paper for implementing decentralizationin order to ensure the successful
    completion of the process. The goals set out inthe strategy paper are: (i)   speeding up the decentralizationprocess, (ii;
    mobilizing adequateresources, (iii)   capacitybuilding, and (iv) coordination of the stakeholders indecentralization.

    Eight strategic areas have been identified for attainingthese goals:
         (i) Completingtheinstitutionalframework
        (ii)      Completingdeconcentration inkeepingwith the centralgovernment's new role
         (iii) Transferringresponsibilitiesandresources
         (iv)     Financingdecentralization
         (v)      Capacitybuilding for stakeholders
         (vi)     Long-termdecentralizationplanning
         (vii)    Consultations and coordination
         (viii)   Information, communication, and social mobilization

D.      The Decentralization Process

5.      Two key features of the decentralization process in Burkina Faso are progressiveness in
implementation and asymmetric arrangements for the different types o f local governments. The
overall process also appears to be very much top-down although one can point to various pressure at
the grassroots levels, specially in urban areas where decentralization seems now well established
with three popular elections since 1995 (1995, 2000, [2006]).

Description

6.      Burkina Faso has opted for a gradualist approach o f decentralization reform as opposed to a
more comprehensive approach. For instance, among the 11 functions slated for devolution in the
decentralization law, the authorities plan to transfer a smaller set o f 6 priority function to the urban
communes in 2005/2006. Inrural communes and the region, the transfer will take place within three
years after the election of local councils. The authorities have explained the rationale behind the
incremental approach: (i)  an holistic approach could overwhelm the financial and technical capacity
o f the central Government to accompany the reform program; (ii)        some o f the local governments
may not have the capacity to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to them; (iii)       a breakdown in
services delivery because of inadequate preparationmay buildresistance against decentralization and
trigger reversals.

Assessment and Agendafor reform

7.      Decentralizationreform is often the result o f history, political experiences, the strength o f the
social fabric, and internal dynamics in a given country. Therefore, while the authorities' choice for a
gradual and incremental approach may be appropriate to the local circumstances, one observation
and two recommendations could be made. The observation i s that the asymmetric approach may be
inevitable, given the heterogeneity of the local governments (see table below). The smaller urban
commune (Gayeri) has a population of 3,509 and the largest one (excluding Ouagadougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso) i s Koudougou with a population o f 92,346

 8.      The first recommendationi s to define transparent rules for the transfers o fresponsibilities. At
present, the process leading to effective transfer seems to be at the sole discretion o f the central
government while the decentralization law clearly states the subsidiary principles and the list of
 functions to be devolved to local governments.

 9.      The second recommendation is to clarify the lines of responsibilities and accountability
between central and local governments when there are joint responsibilities or when the States retain
 some roles duringa transition period.

E.      Political Decentralization

Description

10.     Political decentralization i s characterized by several criteria, inc1udingl9: (i)adequate
safeguard against arbitrary dismissal; (ii)security o f existence o f local governments; (iii)  popular
election o f local council members; (iv) provisions for popular recall of local governments. Against
these criteria, Burkina Faso has some positive aspects o f political decentralization such as the
affirmation in the 1991 Constitution o f the decentralization option; the election o f local councils
through popular vote; and the definition o f pre-determined conditions under which centrak
authorities could disband local governments or dismiss mayors. On the other hand, there are no
provisions for popular recall o f local governments.

Assessment and Agendafor reform

11.     Overall, the new decentralization law introduces major gains in political decentralization:
council members for the new rural communes [were selectedbypopular vote inMarch 2006. It i s the
first time that in the management of local affairs, voice has been given to about 75 percent o f the
population. In the medium term, a reform option to be considered would be the introduction o f
popular recall mechanisms for ineffective local governments. The central government should also
consider strengthening the appeal mechanisms against dismissal o f local government.

F.      Administrative Decentralization

Description

12.     Administrative decentralization appears to be very limited. Delegation o f responsibilities
instead o f devolution seems to be the most appropriate characterization o f the ongoing reform in
Burkina Faso. Indeed, the central government retains large ex-ante controls o n most decisions that
should be taken by local governments (see table 2 below).          Local governments can engage in
contractual arrangements with public or private entities but there should be a prior approval from the
central government if the arrangement has financial implications. In addition, local governments do
not have relevant authority on the staff transferred to them as part to the transfer o f responsibilities.
In particular, the decision to promote or fire these staffs remains with the central government, thus
introducing distorted incentives in the lines o f accountability. On the positive side, Burkina Faso has
elected to establish a local civil service. It i s therefore expected a realignment o f the lines of
accountability when all staff will be member o f the local civil service and therefore subject to hiring,
promotion and firing by local governments.          This would happen when central staffs currently
transferred will reach retirement or leave offices.

                     Table 2: Controls of local governments by the central government




Assessment and Agendafor reform


13.      It should be first noted that the decision to maintain transferred central staffs under the
authority o f the central government i s a request o f workers who have judged there were little
incentives to join the local civil service. A first agenda of the reform would be therefore to tackle
these issues which make unattractive local civil service. It seems that the main fear is about the fiscal
situation o f local governments and their ability to pay salary regularly. A successful fiscal
decentralization would be a positive step towards enabling local governments to attract competent
people inthe local civil service.

 14.     The salaries for local civil servants are set by a national law, and they are uniform across all
jurisdictions and parts o f the country. This lack o f flexibility may be counterproductive because it
fails to take into account the different circumstances across jurisdictions and the importance o f
adequate wage settings for the affordability o f public services. The Government should consider
allowing local governments to pay salaries within a range (+- 20 percent?) o f currently established
salary scale for local civil service20.

 15.     The control o f local governments seems skewed toward top-bottom accountability and ex-
ante controls. The central government should consider buildingbottom-up lines o f accountability by
allowing residents in the various jurisdictions to discipline incompetent and inefficient local
governments. As mentioned earlier, a mechanism for popular recall o f failing local governments
could be envisaged. Furthermore, controls on services delivery and outputs shouldbe privileged over
ex-ante controls.

G.       Fiscal Decentralization

 16.     The decentralization law states that all responsibilities o f local governments should be
matched by appropriate transfer o f resources through a mix o f taxing powers and transfers. Local
governments could also supplement these two sources o f resources by borrowing. Expenditures
assignment, tax assignment, transfers and borrowing conditions are discussedbelow.

         ExpendituresAssignment

Description

17.      The decentralization law assigns expenditures according to three principles o f subsidiarity,
progressiveness and compensation. The subsidiarity principle means that activities are assigned to
the level that can best deliver the service. The progressiveness principle i s that responsibilities are
transferred only gradually to local governments. The compensation principle i s equivalent to
"finances follow responsibilities". Each assignment (expenditure and finances) i s provided by a
devolution decree adopted by the central government. Expenditures are assigned to the region and
communes on an exclusive basis (such as preschools), shared basis (secondary education) or by
delegation. The decentralization law indicates that expenditure assignment should be implemented in
compliance with National defense framework. A law21 defines mandatory activities o f local
government (article 20).

18.      There are 11 activities that should be eventually transferred to local governments: (1) land;
(2) communal development and physical planning; (3) environment and natural resources
management; (4) planning and economic development; (5) health and hygiene;(6) education, literacy
program and vocational training; (7) culture, sports and leisure; (8) civil defense, assistance and
social protection; (9) management o f cemeteries and funeral services; (10) water and electricity; (11)
marketplaces, slaughterhouses and trade show and fairs.

19.      Among these, six activities were to be transferred to urban communes as early as in 2005.
These are (1) preschool programs; (2) basic education and literacy programs; (3) health; (4) culture;
(5) sports; (6) youth and leisure. Activities will be transferred to the regions and rural communes
within three years after the installation o f their deliberative bodies. The latter should take place by
2007 at the latest.

Assessment and Reform Agenda

20.      The principles (subsidiarity, full-funding) that underpin the division o f responsibilities
between central and local governments are sound and should be further elaborated, strengthened and
implemented. For instance, one further argument within the subsidiarity principle i s that central
government's involvement i s required in the presence o f spillovers between jurisdictions. The
division o f responsibilities should also encourage economic efficiency by favoring the level o f
government that could supply a given service at the lowest cost. The central government should not
attempt to provide services for which local governments have strong informational advantage.

21.      It would be critical to effectively transfer responsibilities and resources as described in the
decentralization law. As stated in the discussion on the decentralization process, any merit o f the
progressiveness approach i s overshadowed by the lack o f rules about the conditions under which the
transfers o f activities to local governments would be effective. At present, expenditures o f local
governments represent a meager 5 percent o f total public expenditures despite several years of
decentralization reforms in urban areas. In areas o f shared responsibilities (education, health), the
role o f each level of government should be clearly defined.

Tax Assignment

22.     Taxing authority remains largely with the Central Government which raises more than [95]
percent o f consolidated public sector revenues. Under the decentralization law, the regions will not
have taxing powers.

23.     The central government retains control over the determination of base and rates on the most
significant local taxes: trading license tax (patente), property taxes, tax on the informal sector, land
and property rental taxes (taxes dejouissance). Local governments have autonomy to revise base and
rates on few other taxes: rehse collection and disposal taxes, entertainment taxes etc. Currently, the
proceeds of the land and property rental tax (taxes de jouissance) i s shared with the central
government.

24.     The central government has control on the collection o f local taxes because the public
accountants for local governments are also agent of local branches o f the Treasury Department o f the
Ministry of Finances and Budget, and they collect the taxes before transfer to local governments.
This organization parallels the situation in France where treasury officials have two mandate and
report to local and central authorities. However, these agents are evaluated and remunerated by the
central government and that dictate their loyalties. It has been noted that the central tax and treasury
administrations have sometimes requested material support from local governments inorder to carry
out the tax collection.

Assessment and Reform Agenda

25.     Tax assignment appears to be limited in Burkina Faso. There are many good reasonswhy the
central government would retain some tax authority: ensuring macroeconomic stability, minimizing
administrative costs, promoting fiscal equity; and the specific nature o f some taxes such as mobile
bases, multi-stage taxes (VAT), and customs taxes that cannot be handle at the local level. However
these reasons should be balanced against equally good reasons why local governments should have
tax authority: to the extent possible local spending should be financed on taxation on local residents
so as to ensure efficiency and selectivity inthese spending.

26.     The Government has discussed several options or studies during a workshop held in
December 2005 on the resources and responsibilities for local governments2'. Ifimplemented, these
options and studies will provide a goodbasis to engage the reform o f local taxation:


    0   Reestablish the taxation o f motor vehicles. The latter was eliminated in 1994 to offset the
        adverse impact o f the devaluation of the local currency in domestic prices. To compensate
         for that loss, the central government started to transfer a share 10 percent of petroleum
        products taxation to local governments. The motor vehicle tax i s potentially a significant
        potential source of revenue for large cities.

    0   Fully transfer the taxe dejouissance to local governments. At present, the share o f local
         governments ranges fi-om 25 to 30 percent

    0   Transfer the land andproperties transfer tax (droits de mutations) to local governments

    0    Consider a sharing arrangement for the VAT

    0    Review the feasibility o f taxation on rural lands. Inthe present situation, the ability o f rural
         communes to raise revenue i s extremely limited

        Transfers

Description

27.     Direct transfers o f the central government to local governments consisted untilrecently o f a
general-purpose grant equivalent to [lo] percent o f the taxes levied on petroleum products (TPP).
The transfers were introduced in 1994 as a way for the Central Government to compensate local
governments for the elimination o f the local tax on vehicles (motors and non-motorized). The
amount of the transfers in2005 was CFAF2.3 billions.

28.     In addition to these direct transfers, resources are channeled to local governments through
several externally-funded projects. It i s estimated that local governments have received CFAF 43
billions from that source inthe period 1996-200223,o fwhich the Bank provided 43 percent.

29.     The government has prepared a draR law24that describes the transfers to local governments
in the new decentralization framework. Two types o f grants are planned for 2007. The first is a
general-purpose grant (unconditional) for the recurrent budget o f local governments. It is composed
of two parts reflecting equalization objectives (per capita) and needs (activities transferred to local
jurisdictions). The second i s a general-purpose grant for the capital budget o f local governments. It is
also broken down in two parts based on population size and on quality, quantity and nature o f
infrastructures transferred to localjurisdictions, respectively.

30.      A particular feature o f the transfer mechanism in Burkina Faso is the existence o f transfers
between local governments, from the communes to the regions. The regions do not have taxing
authority, and they received from the communes within their jurisdiction, 10 percent o f the proceeds
o fpredeterminedtax categories.

31.     With the delegation o f activities to local governments, civil servants (mostly teachers and
health workers) carrying out these activities will continue to do so and their costs (salaries) will be
considered as conditional grants from the central government. No estimates on the size o f these
conditional transfers are available yet but could be significant. New recruitments (starting in 2007)
will take place inthe framework of the local civil service, and the central government will transfer
conditional grants for the payments o f these workers.

32.       A Government working group has also proposed a mechanism for transferring resources to
local government^^^. In addition to the two general-purpose grants presented above, the working
group discussed a specific-purpose (conditional) capital grant for the implementation o f sectoral
programs (health, education) based on a contractual arrangement between the central government
and local governments. The working group details the distribution o f the general-purpose grant
amongjurisdictions and between recurrent and capital spending.

33.       First,two-thirds o fthe total grant is allocated to the recurrent general-purpose grant while the
remaining third i s allocated to the capital general-purpose grant. Second, each general-purpose grant
i s split among jurisdictions according to the following rules: (i)10 percent for the regions; (ii)                            20
percent for the urban communes; and (iii)                70 percent for the rural communes. Within jurisdictions,
50 percent o f the allocations are distributed on a per capita basis and 50 percent as a lump sum in
equal parts for eachjurisdiction. It i s unclear how the distribution was done among jurisdictions but
it was reportedthat the criteria used couldbe the population sizez6.

          Size of the Grants

34.       There i s no explicit discussion in the resource law about the size o f the general-purpose
transfers. The working group mentioned above has proposed these transfers to be financed with 15
percent o f the petroleum product tax, up from the current level o f 10 percent. In 2006, the
Government has estimated that the size o f the transfers should be CFAF3.3 billion, up from CFAF2.3
billion in 2005, reflecting the creation o f about 300 rural communes. There does not seem to be a
clear formula that has ledto that estimate.

35.       However, the draft resources and spending law requires local governments to spend at least
20 percent of their own revenue on their capital budget, and the latter should be at least equal to 33
percent (a third) o f the total budget (article 23). From these criteria, one can derivate a formula for
the size o f the transfers: Transfers = 0.33 x Budget - 0.2 x own Revenue. This would define an open-
ended grant scheme which will reward big local governments and those with poor revenue
performance. This unintended goal underlines the need to better define the rules for the size o f the
transfers.

36.       As for the specific-purpose transfers, their actual size will ultimately depend on the
performance o f the project implementation units. In addition, a full account o f these resources will
also depend on the integration o f externally-funded projects external resources in the government
accountingsystem.

          Distribution of the Grants

37.       The draft law indicates that the modalities for appropriation o f grants are determined, each
year, by a joint decree o f the Minister o f Decentralization and the Minister o f Finance and Budget.
The working group articulates a formula-driven scheme that offers a solid starting point, but it i s just
one of the schemes reviewed by the Government during the 2005 December workshop on fiscal
decentralization.

38.      Tlie first observation is that there seems to be lot o f uncertainties  011 tlielevel o f resources
that will be made available to local goveiiinieiits, and tlie first priority is to clarify the rules o f the
games: what would be the size o f tlie grants? How would it be distributed?

39.       Regarding the size o f tlie general-puipose grants, tlie goveniiiieiit should consider
distributinga predetermined percentage of total central revenues. In Rwanda, the fiscal law allows
for 1.5 percent o f domestically collected revenue to be distributed to tlie districts for their recurrent
budgets. Tlie law also eiivisages a common development fund which was initially set at 10 percent o f
total revenues, even it i s now equivalent to 2.5 percent o f total revenues.21 In the case of Burkina
Faso, the general purpose grants represented 0.6 percent o f total revenue in 2005, comparing poorly
with tlie 4.0 percent in Rwanda. Using the total revenues instead a particular tax will also a more
stable stream o f resources.

40.       Regarding tlie distribution o f the grants, the draft resources law already includes some sound
principles as equalization (per capita allocation) and a measure o f needs, The challenge i s to finalize
the foiniula so as to eliminate all discretionary elements. Equalization could be further pursued by
taking into account poverty headcount in tlie jurisdictioiis where it i s available. Tlie goveniment
should also include in tlie design o f tlie transfer, an element that encourage

41.       As for conditional grants, their effectiveness could be limited given tlie fungibility of
resources. Conditional grants also contribute to tlie fragiiieiitatioii o f local budgets and lessen tlie
traiispareiicy o f budget implementation. If maintained, there should be restricted to cases o f
spillovers with closed-ended matchiiig grants, and tlie conditionality should be based on some
measures o f outconies instead o f inputsispending.

42.       Capacity building programs should be initiated for local govenimeiits to ensure that tlie
fiduciary eiiviroiiiiieiit and tlie competeiices in budget plaiiniiig and execution for resources
traiisfeired are at least comparable than in tlie central goveniment. Tlie accompanying capacity
buildingand urbanproject is specifically designed to that end.

43.       Tlie Goveiiinieiit should eiicourage donors to provide assistance to local governments by

I                  Box 2: Tlie Local Government Development Program (LGDP) in Uganda                                                i
 The LGDP was intciided to devolve development funds through the Local Development Grant (LDG) and Capacity Building
 Grant (CBG) to 31 districts and 13 municipalities,

 The LGDP developed an approach which combined building local governance with the implementation o f development
 investments. The LGDP provided non-sector specific development grants to local governments according to a transparent
 formula. Local governments qualified to access these grants once they have achieved specified niiniiiiuin governance criteria.
 Local governments were required to co-finance the developnient funds received with 10 pel-centcontribution in cash, in addition
 to scheme-specific local contributions from communities.

 Central to the LGDP design was the annual assessnients of local governments against the pre-set governance criteria (the so-
 called tnininiuni access conditions) and performance criteria. The niiniiiiuiii conditions determined whether a district or a sub-
 county is eligible to access the Local Government Fund. The performance criteria, assessed in retrospect, determined whether a
 local government is eligible for a reward or penalty (i.e. whether the amount of the Development Fund is to be increased or
 decreased from the next financial year).

 The niinimum conditions (access criteria) included:
 Development planning capacity (e.g. availability of council-approved District Devclopnient Plan and functional planning
 coniniittees)
 Financial Management (e.g. proper maintenance of accounts, adherence to procurement regulations)
 Technical capability (e.g. capacity to supervise engineeringworks)
 Program specific conditions (e.g. 10 percent co-financing)

 Districts which did not meet the niininiuni access criteria could still benefit from the Capacity Building Grant (a separatc
 funding-line under LGDP) in order to qualify for development funding in future.

 Districts and sub-counties operated under incentive and penalty system linked to good governance and service delivery. Those
 that performed well against specified performance criteria received an increase in their allocations in subsequent years (an
 additional 20 percent), whilst those that performed poorly had their investment funds reduced by 20 percent.


           Borrowing Rules

 Descriptio11
 44.       Bonowing of local governments is subject to prior authorizationby tlie Central Government.
 The proceeds o f these loans should finance investments exclusively. The teiiiis and tlie conditions
 under which such borrowing could take place are defined by a decree prepared by tlie Ministiy o f
 Finances and Budgetand approved by the Cabinet.

 Assessnieizt and Reforin Agenda
 45.       At this stage of the decentralization reform, concerns about macroeconomic stability
 probably dictate the rigid framework for borrowing o f local goveiiiments. Tlie issue could be
 revisited in tlie medium to long term, once the creditworthiness o f local goveiiimeiits and their
 budget manageiiient capacity are strengthened.

           Description

           Regulatory Framework
 46.       Tlie government has prepared a draft decree2* setting the rules and principles for local
 budgets and the teiins for tlie management of assets owned b y or delegated to local goveiiimeiits
 (article 1). Key features of tlie decree are described below.

47.     The central government approves the initial and supplementary budgets o f local
governments. Local budgets have to be balanced and the recurrent budget should have a surplus at
least equal to 20 percent o f own revenues. There i s mandatory spending determined by law which
should be itemized in local budget. The central government can reestablish the balance o f local by
reducing optional expenditures as needed.

Budget preparation

48.     Local budgets are voted by the councils and submitted to the central government for
approval. The government has 45 days to issue a decision. It can ask for any modifications and has.
the ultimate word. The Central Government can refuse to approve the budget o f local governments in
the following case: (i)the budget i s not compliant with laws and regulations; (ii)mandatory
expenditures were not included; (iii)     resources are lower than mandatory expenditures; (iv) there
seems to be an underestimation or overestimation o f spending andor revenues. Ifthe local budget i s
not approved by the beginning o f the fiscal year (January l), Central Government can authorize
                                                                 the
the local governments to collect revenue and undertake spending on the basis o f the previous budget.

Budget Nomenclature

49.      Local budgets are classified by Section (recurrent budget and investment budget), and by
Chapter, Article and Paragraph, all of the latter describing spending by nature only. The lack o f
functional classification or even an administrative classification i s a serious concern as far as the
monitoring o fpoverty-spending and development outcomes i s concerned.

Budget Execution

50.      The head o f the local council i s the budget administrator (ordonnateur) and has the spending
authority. She implements the budget in coordination with the financial comptroller and the
municipal accountant who are officials o f the Ministryin charge o f finances. A financial comptroller
i s posted by the Ministry o f Finances and Budget with each local government. She clears - ex ante -
all decisions from the local governments that have a financial implication. The municipal accountant
i s also the head o f the local branch o f the National Treasury Department (DGTCP). She collects
revenues and executes payments for the local governments. CICL (Comptabilite Integree des
Collectivites Locales, CICL), an accounting software, i s operational in few communes.

Budget Control and reporting

 51.     As for the national budget, the administrative controls o f the financial operations o f local
governments are exerted by the financial comptroller, the General Inspectorate for Finance (IGF), the
 State General Inspectorate (IGE) and the Technical Inspectorates o f line ministries. Inparticular, the
 financial comptroller carries out ex-ante controls o f all financial decisions of local governments,
Only a written notification from the Ministry o f Finances and Budget can override a decision by the
financial comptroller denying an expense.

 52.     As for the national, thejurisdictional control is carried out bythe Audit Court. However, it i s
not effective yet for local government. The task for the Audit Court will be even more challenging
 given it will now have to audit 350 administrative accounts (held by the head o f the local council)
 and 350 comptes de gestion (held by municipal accountants), instead o f49 inthe present situation. In
principle, the Audit Court should reach an opinion on the integrity o f budget implementation by
comparing the comptes administrat$ and the comptes de gestion. However, few comptes de gestion

                                                  - 123 -

are available. Administrative accounts are more available but large gaps remain. Administrative
accounts    for   the    years    up to    2002     are   posted    on    line:  http:/lw~~~.iiiforoute-
communale.nov.bf'/df7.htnl

       Assessment and recommendations

53.     A critical reform is to introduce a functional classificationin line with similar reforms at the
central government. At the minimum, an administrative classification should be taken into account
so as to allow a consolidation o f all public spending. A reform i s needed to allow the tracking of
poverty-relatedspending, and to link inputs to outcomes.

54.     The Government should finalize all the functions of the CICL and complete its deployment
in all local government. The Government should consider establishing hubs to centralize the
accounts of the communes where there i s no power.

55.     The capacity of local governments should be strengthened in the area of public financial
management, including procurement. In the short-term, local governments should get the support
needed to prepare their administrative accounts as required by the regulation. Inthe medium term to
long-term, the communes should start introducing medium-term budget planning and program-based
budgeting.

56.     Within the current framework, the capacity o f the Ministry o f Finances and Budget to
accompany the fiscal decentralization i s critical. As required by the regulation, the MFBwould need
to accelerate deconcentration, and post about 350 financial comptroller and 350 treasury offices at
the local level, or at least open branches as close as possible to local governments. The Government
should take the necessary measures to ensure that all comptes de gestion are produced timely.

57.     The Audit Court should undertake the audit o f local budgets, in order to present a
consolidated execution report of total public spending. This would require increasing significantly
the resources (technical and personnel) for the Court.

                           Annex 6: Accelerated and Shared Growth
Overview


I. BurkinaFasoisasmall, landlocked, resource-scarcecountrysurroundedbyeconomically
weak neighbors which nevertheless was able to achieve robust growth and poverty reduction in
recent years. The economy grew on average by 6 percent since 1994, among the highest in Sub-
Saharan Africa. This growth was driven by agriculture, particularly cotton. However, economic
performance can be volatile due to its dependence on agricultural output which i s Sensitive to rainfall
patterns and other exogenous factors. Recent growth performance attests to this volatility. Relatively
highgrowth rate of 8.0 percent in2003 was followed bybelow average growth in2004, which then
reboundedto approximately 7.5 percent in 2005.

2.      The analysis of the Bank's Poverty Assessment (PA) indicates that economic growth has
resulted in the poverty headcount decreasing from 54.6 percent in 1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003.
Recent growth was mainly driven by the agricultural sector, which explains the large decrease inthe
poverty rate given that most o f the population live inrural areas and thus depend on agnculture. The
poverty rate will remain sensitive to the sectoral composition o f growth as long as the poor are
significantly asymmetrically distributed among the sectors. The P A also concludes that the target
poverty rate reduction to 30 percent 2015 can be achieved if the country maintains a long term real
GDP growth rate of approximately 5 percent. This target seems within reach given the country's
recent track record.

3.      The authorities' PRSP focuses on maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment,
diversifying the economy and increasing productivity. It targets an average real GDP growth rate o f
6.5 percent and reducing the poverty rate from 46 percent in 2003 to 30 percent by 2015. These
objectives seem reasonably achievable. The target average annual growth rate i s in line with the
average annual growth of 6 percent achieved since 1994, among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.

4.      However, there remain significant risks to sustaining the growth pace given the challenging
environment. The vast majority o f the poor in the rural sector depend on agnculture which i s
characterized by low mechanization and sensitive to rainfall variation, There are risks to sustaining
the recent growth o f the cotton subsector given that it mainly resulted from expansion o f cultivated
areas as opposed to higher ylelds. In addition to lack o f rainfalls in the Sahel zone, the country i s
exposed to international price shocks in cotton due to the lack o f diversification, political instability
inneighboring countries, and exchange rate shocks as its currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the
Euro. By their very nature, the country i s limited in how it can directly influence the occurrence of
such exogenous shocks.

Economic Structure

5.      Comparison over time indicates that the structure o f the economy has not changed over the
years (see figure 1). The largest sector of the economy i s the tertiary sector which includes trade,
transport and government services. The next largest is the primary sector, dominated by agriculture
and livestock. The secondary sector i s the smallest and its share o f GDP decreased over the years.
The sector includes mining, manufacturing, energy and constructions. The lack o f structural change
indicates an economy less than dynamic. Inthe case o f South Korea, agriculture as a share o f GDP
decreased from 39.9 percent in 1960 to 3.8 percent in 2005 while the share o f industries rose from

18.6 percent to 41.4 percent in the same period. The decrease of the share o f the secondary sector in
Burkina Faso indicates a failure to industrialize.

6.       Measured in terms of GDP at factor costs, the economy grew by a compound annual rate o f
6.3 percent over the last decade, a relatively strong performance. The three major sectors grew at
approximately similar rates. The electricity, gas and water subsector grew annually by 16.8 percent,
significantly faster than any other subsectors. Livestock, banking and insurance, and the transport
and telecommunication subsectors also grew faster than the average. By contrast, the mining
subsector shrank by 12.9 percent, and forestry and fishing, commerce, and non-market services
(government) grew slower than the average.

7.       The growth of the primary sector has largely keptpace with overall economic growth, but its
growth fluctuates significantly from year to year. Economic growth in 2005 was mainly due to
growth o f agnculture as the other major sectors performed poorly. Record cereal and cotton harvests
resulted from expansion o f cultivated areas. Although the tertiary sector i s the largest in the
economy, the country remains largely agrarian as more than 80 percent o f the population live inrural
areas and depend on agriculture and livestock. The relatively small size of the primary sector despite
the largely agrarian population indicates the low level o f productivity o f the sector. The agncultural
sector i s constrained bypoor infrastructure and low levels o fmechanization and irrigation.

8.       Industries account for 70 percent o f the secondary sector. The fledgling mining sector has
significantly declined in the past decade, while public utilities nearly quintupled. Major industrial
subsectors such as food, tobacco and textile are characterized by a few dominant firms inthe formal
sector and large informal activities. The relatively small share o f the secondary sector reflects the
weakness of the manufacturing and infiastructural base o f the economy.

9.       The tertiary sector grew more slowly than the economy, reflecting the slow expansion o f
trade and government services. However, growth rates o f government services have increased in
more recent years as official capital inflow significantly increased up to approximately 10percent of
GDP. Trade and other tertiary subsectorshave large shares o finformal activities.

10.     The informal sector accounts for two-thirds ofthe modernsector, and 38 percent ofthe entire
economy.29Typically, some of the possible reasons for the presence o f a large informal sector are: (i)
high tax rates, particularly corporate tax; (ii)            ineffective and discretionary application o f the tax
system; (iii)high social security contributions; (iv) lack of property rights; and (v) burdensome
regulations, including for the labor market, trade bamers, and labor restrictions for foreigners. Firms
inthe informal sector tend to be smaller insize, investandexport less than counterparts inthe formal
sector, offer lower wages, and contribute less to tax revenues. Averaging 12.4 percent o f GDP in
recent years, low domestic revenue inBurkina Faso constrains public investments.

Determinantsof Growth

12.       The cross-country empirical research indicates that an economy will grow faster if it is
characterized by: (i)an open market system with minimal distortions; (ii) stable macroeconomic      a
environment; (iii)rule o f law and protection of private property; (iv) high investment rates,
particularly for equipment; (v) high education levels; and (vi) low share o f primary products in
exports.31

13.       With respect to the cross-country determinants o f growth, Burkina Faso's relatively stable
macroeconomic environment, open external tariff policies and an economic organization which i s
not overly dominated by the state are some of the favorable conditions for growth. By contrast, a
poor business climate, low education levels and a high share o f primary commodities in exports




31An interestingfindingof the empirical literature is the significant negative coefficient on the dummyvariable for Sub-Saharan
Africa. Ingeneral, African countries are predictedto grow slowly because they score low on most variables good for growth and
high on most variables harmfulfor growth. However, a significant negative coefficient on the African dummy implies that
African countries grow even less than would be predictedby these other variables.

14.       Table three compares the diagnostics o f the determinants o f growth conductedjointly by the
authorities and the World Bank, and the policies areas emphasized in the PRSC-6. In 2001, the
authorities and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive study o f competitiveness and long term
sources o f growth inBurkina F a ~ oFour               . ~ ~major constraints to growth were identified: (i) levels                                                                       low
o f domestic and external liberalization; (ii)                                high factor costs and weak price competitiveness; (iii)
low technological progress; and (iv) low human development indicators. These constraints are still
broadly relevant and largely consistent with the policy focus o f the PRSC.

15.       Although the PRSC i s broadly consistent with earlier analysis, it differs in three significant.
First, it focuses on reducing administrative barriers to businesses, an emphasis resulting from recent
surveys which indicate overly burdensome government regulations. Second, there i s a heavy
emphasis on decentralization, again largely absent in earlier growth analyses on the country. Third,
the economic diversification strategy focuses on expanding into other primary commodities.
Analyses o f growth in Burkina Faso have tended to focus other primary goods, but the broader
literature and typical experience of high growth developing countries indicate that expansion into

higher value added non-primary goods will eventually be critical for growth. And finally fourth,
PRSC policies do not directly deal with regional issues such as regional integration and exchange
rate policies which were emphasized in the competitiveness study. A regional approach as opposed
to a country specific instrument such as the PRSC i s probably more appropriate to address such
issues.

iMacroeconomic Stability

16.      The authorities have been able to maintain a relatively stable macroeconomic environment in
recent years despite a volatile external environment (see table 4). Economic growth has remained
relatively robust, averaging a growth rate o f 6.5 percent since 2001, as cereal and cotton production
achieved recordharvests inrecent years. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies have maintained a l o w
level o f inflation, anchored by the fixed exchange rate peg represented by the CFA franc. As a
member o f the West A h c a n Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Burkina Faso devolves its
monetary policies to the Central Bank o f West African States (BCEAO). The stable macroeconomic
environment has provided a conducive environment for growth inthe past decade.

17.      In general, the authorities have been pursuing prudent fiscal policies consistent with
available resources, but the current levels o f spending depend heavily on foreign aid. Overall fiscal
deficits are fairly large mainly due to low domestic revenues but the financing gap has mostly been
covered by concessional foreign financing, resulting in little crowding out o f domestic investment.
The Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) are together expected to provide additional resources o f approximately 1 to 2
percent o f GDP for the near fbture. Public debt service averaged a relatively low 3.2 percent o f total
expenditures inrecent years. Basic primary balance has averaged a deficit inrecent years, indicating
that discretionary spending has been exceeding domestic revenue, but the deficit has been hlly
coveredby external grants.

 18.     The devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994 resulted in an improvement o f the country's
competitiveness, and the gains from the devaluation have been only partially eroded through
subsequent adjustment (see figure 2). However, the real effective exchange rate has been gradually
appreciating since the devaluation, particularly in recent years when it appreciated by 12.6 percent
since 2001. The appreciation o f the euro and the region's low inflations reflecting tight monetary
policies contributed to the exchange rate appreciation. The continued appreciation o f the euro
combined with the sharp deterioration in the terms o f trade could have resulted in 2005 in an
overvaluationo fthe exchange rate with respect to the equilibrium rate.

19.       The potential overvaluation o f the exchange rate is a concern given that most fast growing
developing countries tend to have undervalued real exchange rates.34 Although the fixed exchange
rate supports l o w levels of inflation, it limits public policy instruments, and fiscal policies bear the
burden of maintaining aggregate demand consistent with the relatively low inflation inthe Eurozone,
thus potentially adversely impacting growth. The current fixed exchange rate can constrain adequate
responses to changes in international prices if appropriate periodic adjustments are not implemented.
The recent decline o f the terms of trade could lead to an overvalued exchange rate. In turn, an
overvalued exchange rate would undermine exports by reducing their international competitiveness.
The deterioration o f the terms o f trade and loss o f external competitiveness contributes to worsening
in government savings through reduced revenues. In response, governments typically lower public
investment, and there is also a corresponding decrease in private investment. These responses would
accentuate the detrimental impact of the overvalued exchange on the economy.

20.        In summary, Burkina Faso has benefited in recent years from a stable macroeconomic
environment reflecting prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Given the current exchange rate regime,
low levels o f inflation were critical to maintaining the peg with the euro. However, enhancing the
flexibility of the exchange rate regime could be considered in view o f the potential adverse impacts
of recent appreciations on export promotion and international competitiveness.

Productivityand Competition

21.        Preliminary growth accounting analysis indicates that economic growth in the last four
decades was mainly due to the accumulation o f physical capital, while the contributions o f human
capital and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) were negligible. The analysis indicates that the rate o f
return o fphysical capital accumulation has been comparable to other Sub-Saharan African countries.
The insignificant impact o f human capital accumulation likely reflects the extremely l o w educational



34Haussmannand Rodrick (2005) looked at the relationship between real exchange rate deviation and growth for a 15 year
period, from 1988 to 2003, and found that: (a) most fast growing developing economies had very undervalued real exchange
rates; (b) the only exceptions are countries which rely on natural resources, such as Belize, Botswana, Uganda, or aid dependent
countries, such as Mali, Mozambique, Sudan; and (c) a proxy estimate of such relationship reveals that a 30 percent deviation o f
the real exchange rate accelerates growth by about 0.5 percent.

and health indicators of the population which are low even in comparison with other Sub-Saharan
Afncan countries. The major policy implication i s that sustaining economic growth will depend on
improving factor productivity, includingby buildinghuman resource capacity..

22.      Improving total factor productivity i s critical to accelerating economic growth. Factor
productivity is a major determinant o f cross-country differences in income and growth rates. The
post-1995 growth recovery among SSA countries has been fueled by a significant increase in TFP
growth. The fastest growers o f 1990s registered TFP growth o f 2.3 percent in the second half o f the
decade, in contrast to the negligible TFP growth for Burkina Faso. The low productivity growth in
Burkina Faso i s consistent with an environment characterized by low skill levels and competition
constrained by the prominence o f monopolies and the informal sector. A more competitive
environment would induce economic agents to improve their productivity, and it would shift
resources from less to more productive agents. Inaddition, greater productivity growth would induce
increased growth of inputs given that the decision to invest in physical and human capital i s itself
dependent on productivity of the inputs.Hence, the low productivity growth rate in the country has a
detrimental impact on economic growth beyond simply the low rate o f TFP growth.

23.       The key to improving the level and productivity o f investment i s to create an environment
that encourages competition and use of productive technology. Hence, the ongoing economic
restructuring program should continue to focus on removing structural impediments to greater
market competition, based on the principles o f (i)          market liberalization and privatization; (ii)
exports expansion to benefit from economies o f scale; (iii)        liberalization o f markets for inputs such
as transport, telecommunication, water, energy, and labor services in order to reduce the cost and
improve access and quality. The reduction o f structural impediments would contribute towards
diversifylng economic activities and therefore reducing the country's overdependence on a single
commodity, cotton. Liberalizing markets and increasing investments in infrastructure are particularly
important given that Burkina Faso consistently has one o f the highest cost structures in the region,
even comparedto other landlocked countries (see table 5).

24.       The country's labor regulations on hiringand firing are overly rigid and complex. According
to the World Bank's "Doing Business" surveys, Burkina Faso i s rated the worst country inthe world
with respect to the difficulties employers face inhiringand firing workers. These difficulties include
ratio o f minimum wages to value-added per worker, rigidity in working time and mandated annual
leaves with pay, workers' legal protection against dismissals, cost o f hiring including all social
security payments and payroll taxes, and cost o f firing including severance payments and penalties
due. These costly labor regulations are reflected in non-competitive hourly labor costs (see table 6).
The hourly labor costs of Burkina Faso are higher than neighboring countries and larger international
competitors such as China and India. However, comparison o f unit labor costs should be adjusted for

                                                    - 132 -

differences in the value o f output or value-added. Assuming that countries such as China probably
enjoy a higher level o f productivity in at least some o f the low value added industries, the relatively
high labor costs of Burkina Faso presents a challenge to its efforts to diversify beyond primary
commodities.

25.     Although further market liberalization provides the basis for greater competition and productivity
gains, past experience indicate that in certain cases market liberalization seemed to have benefited from
an adjustment period during which the new market players are provided an opportunity to build their
capacity. An illustrative example i s the cotton sector inBurkina Faso. The cotton sector was developed in
the past under a monopolistic market structure (see box 1). By contrast, the production and exports o f
fruits and vegetables declined after the withdrawal o f the government from the subsector.




                                                      - 133 -

  I                                            Box 1: CottonSector
   Market liberalization and privatization can proceed inmany different ways, depending on country specific
   circumstances. The cotton sector in Burkina Faso has played a major role inpromoting growth and reducing
   poverty. Cotton production increased by an annual average o f 17 percent in the last decade, and cotton
   producers increased from less than 50,000 in the 1960s to approximately 250,000 today. However, such
    successes were achieved through a vertically integrated market structure dominated by a single company,
    SOFITEX. SOFITEX has evolved over the years, mostly significantly in 1999 when producers bought 30
   percent o f the shares, but its dominance o f the domestic market was partially relinquishedonly in2004 with
   the entry o f two new regional operators. Hence, the country's successes in cotton were mostly achieved in
   the absence o f domestic competition. Instead, the export orientation of the sector seemed to have allowed
    international competition to compensate for the lack o f domestic competition ininstilling market discipline
    through competition.

   A vertically integrated monopoly was a satisfactory structural arrangement in the past given the lack of
    contracting capacity and the small volume o f production. Small producers were supported through a
    guaranteed market and a floor price, effectively transferring the risks onto the cotton company, inreturn for
    a guaranteed monopsony position. Capacity o f the producers was increased through substantial support
    from the donors. However, increased production was achieved mainly through expansion o f cultivated
    areas, while productivity remainedlargely stagnant. At the same time, internationalmarket prices for cotton
    continued to decline, reflecting competition from more productive and in some cases more subsidized
    producers.

    Inorder to adapt to the changes inthe international market, Burkina Faso will have to address the relative
    lack o f competitiveness through domestic reforms. The main thrust o f the reforms should be to further
    liberalize and privatize the cotton sector in order to create a business climate more favorable to the
    development, distribution and adaptation o f new technologies, particularly for seed variety, soil fertility and
    irrigation.

   Trade Integration Study," mimeo, February2006.


26.      The strategy of improving productivity through market liberalization inherently has limits in
a country such as Burkina Faso where the public sector plays a significant role in the economy.
Given that the public sector is shielded from market forces, policy makers have to rely on other
instruments to improve the productivity of public investments. Hence, public sector capacity
buildingand structural reform initiatives are inextricably an important part of the growth agenda of
the country. Diagnostics tools such as Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), Country Financial
Accountability Assessments (CFAAs), Country Procurement Assessment Reports (CPARs) and
HIPC AAPs are used to identify the critical shortcomings o f the country's public financial
management system. The country's decentralization programhas been identifiedas a key component
to effective public sector management.

27.      Inaddition to improving the productivity o fpublic sector investments, the authorities should
continue to reduce the scope o f public investments through their divestiture and utility reform
programs. Government involvement should focus on core public goods and services which provide
the most contribution to public welfare, while allowingthe private sector to supply private goods and
services which naturally belong in the market domain. The public sector still includes 53 enterprises,
with many of the largest in the utility sector. These public enterprises are constrained in their
investment choices due to the limited fiscal capacity of the government. Furthermore, management
o fpublic enterprises lacks incentivesto compete effectively, resulting inbelow optimal performance.
Partly as a result, Burkina Faso has the highestunit costs o f infiastructural services inthe WAEMU

zone. High factor costs discourage investment and the expansion o f the private sector. Low coverage
o fpublic services inthe country, particularly in rural areas, undermines shared growth.

28.      Although TFP growth can explain differences in economic growth across countries, this does
not mean that factor accumulation i s unimportant, particularly at certain stages o f development.
Factor accumulations in the form o f large increases o f participation rates, educational levels and
investment rates explain a large part of their rapid growth o f East Asian countries.35In addition,
there was a large intersectoral transfer of labor into manufacturing which enjoyedhigher value added
per worker, thus further increasing economic growth. Hence, sectoral composition o f factor
accumulation can have an important impact on growth. Removing structural impediments to
intersectoral flow of resources, such as overly restrictive labor legislations, could facilitate resource
transfer to sectors with higher per capita output and thus result in increased growth.

Savings and Investment

29.      Investment rates in Burkina Faso appear to be comparable to the average o f SSA countries.
However, investment rates in SSA are the lowest among all the regions in the world. In particular,
the investment rate inEast Asia i s significantly higher than the other regions and nearly twice as high
as in SSA. Although it would be unrealistic at present to target investment rates similar to those in
East Asian countries given the difference in investment opportunities and economic structure, the
rates inEast Asia illustrate investmentlevels that could be expected ina highgrowth environment.

30.      Although investment rates are comparable in the region, the savings rate i s l o w even
compared to other countries inthe region. Excludingthe year 2004 when the country experiencedan
exceptional agricultural season, gross domestic saving has been in the range of 3 to 4 percent of
GDP, comparing poorly with the average o f 6 percent in SSA and 36 percent in high performing
Asian economies.

31.     Private saving i s low partly because o f low per capita income and high household
dependency ratio.36These factors normally change only gradually. The low savings rate also reflects
the lack of financial depth in the economy, with few savings products and a lack of bank branches
which are mostly concentrated in Ouagadougou. The low savings rate and the lack o f financial depth
could result in lower productivity of investmentsif they reflect a financial sector which does not
efficiently carry out its financial intermediary role, particularly for mobilizing and channeling
savings into more productive sectors. In addition, financial institutions have lamented the lack o f
appropriate lending opportunities despite the fact that level o f investment appears to be far greater
than the level o f domestic financial resource mobilization.

32.      Foreign aid appears to cover most o f the gap between gross domestic savings and gross
investment (see table 7). Official transfers and loans, including current and capital transfers, have
averaged 80.3 percent o f the savings-investment gap in recent years. Private external flows, mostly
composed o f private remittances and private capital, have average 17.6 percent o f the gap in recent
years. Hence, the country heavily relies on official inflows, and it appears that this situation will not
change in the near hture given that private remittances have decreased in recent years. In the long
term, domestic savings rate will have to be increased in order to decrease dependence on foreign aid
given its unpredictability. Note that the comparisonbetweenthe savings-investment gap and external
inflows i s only a rough analysis as some o f the inflows, particularly current transfers, could have
been usedfor consumption.

33.     Low levels of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) contribute to the relatively small private
external inflows (see figure 4). Burkina Faso's FDIaveraged 0.4 percent o f GDP from 1994 to 2003
compared to the average of 2.3 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, the country's cumulative
capital flight from 1970 to 1996 was fourteen times greater than FDI inflow, indicating that
Burkinabes agree with foreigners that the country i s not a promising location for investment.37A
small domestic market and relatively high factor costs are some of the challenges to attracting FDI.
Such disadvantages can be partially compensated by export promotion policies, regional integration
and a stable investment climate. Measures to attract foreign investment should be accompanied by a
full examination of the extent of the associated externalities. Inparticular, FDIin extractive mining
industriesinAfrica have tendedto result inenclaves with limitedlocal linkages.

Investment Climate

34.     The strategy of improving productivity through market competition depends on an
investment climate supportive ofprivate investments.A country's quality o f governance is the most
basic foundation o f the investment climate. In general, cross-country governance assessments
indicate that Burkina Faso i s a low performer, but its relative ratings have improved over the last
decade. In terms o f percentiles, the country now ranks in the second quartile on all governance
indicators according to a World Bank re~earch.~'            The indicators consist o f accountability, political
stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule o f law and corruption. The same research
also indicates that governance has a significant impact on standards o f living andpoverty alleviation.

35.     The International Country Risk Guide (ISRG) rates a country's governance ratings more
specifically targeting concerns o f the business community. The rating measures country risks with
respect to contract viability, payment delays and profit repatriation. Burkina Faso rates 9.0 on a scale

from 0 to 12, where 12 i s the lowest risk. This rating compares favorable with the Sub-Saharan
A h c a n average o f 7.5, and the average o f 6.4 in the mid-1980s for sustained growth countries.39

36.      By contrast to the relatively favorable investment risk ratings o f ISRG, ease o f doing
business in the country in terms o f business regulations and their enforcement i s extremely poor.
According to the "Doing Business" survey o f the World Bank, the country ranks 154 out o f 155
countries in terms o f the overall ease o f conducting business, measured by business regulations and
their enforcement. Some o fthe most significant challenges to conductingbusiness inthe country are
as follows: (i)   licensing and permit requirements are burdensome with 46 steps which cost 5,003
percent o f per capita income; (ii)     labor regulations on hiring and firing are overly rigid and complex;
(iii)enforcingcontractsthroughlegalandadministrativeprocedurescosts95.4percentofthedebt,
or nearly all o f the value o f the debt; and (iv) bankruptcy procedures take 4.0 years and result in the
claimants recovering only 6.3 percent from the insolvent firm. Burkina Faso perfoms poorly for all
o f these indicators even compared to the region.

37.      Building the capacity o f the legal system will be critical to improving the business climate.
The insufficient number o f courts andjudges result in low coverage o f the judiciary, with most o f the
courts concentrated inthe two largest cities. There i s a perception that the level o f accountability and
impartiality o f judges are low. Court decisions suffer long delays, and decisions frequently are not
executed.

External Trade

38.      Burkina has a small domestic market, and therefore much can be gained from pursuing an
export oriented growth strategy. The country's total exports and imports o f goods and services are
relatively low, averaging 9.3 percent and 22.2 percent o f GDP respectively since 2001. By contrast,
Sub-Saharan African countries which grew the fastest in the 1990s were generally more open to
trade, with ratios o f exports plus imports to GDP between 90 and 100 percent. Hence, there are
significant margins for improving trade performance. There i s relatively strong evidence that
participation in export markets i s a source o f improved firm prod~ctivity.~'There could be a
combination o f factors which explains this relationship, including the impact o f market discipline
provided by international competition, and technology transfer carried out through contact with
overseas firms and customers.

39.     Total exports have roughly kept pace with the growth o f GDP in recent years mainly due to
increased cotton exports, while exports o f other goods stagnated (see figure 5). This situation i s not
sustainable. Exports o f non-cotton goods will eventually have to contribute to export growth. The
cotton sector accounted for 63.3 percent of merchandise exports since 2001 and employs a fifth o f
the population.

40.     The dependence on cotton i s reflected in a relatively high Herfindahl-Hirschmann index for
exports, a measure o f product diversification (see table 7). The index ranges from zero to one, with
one indicating no diversification. The dependence on cotton leaves the country critically exposed to
changes in its international prices. Although export diversification has been a key policy objective
for many years, the extent o f diversification has actually deteriorated over the years as indicated by
increase in the country's Herfindahl-Hirschmann index from 0.439 in 1986 to 0.593 in2003.

41.     In general, trade policy o f the country is fairly liberalized. With the adaptation o f the
WAEMU's Common External Tariff (CET) in 2000, the average tariff fell to 12 percent.

                                                    - 139-

Nevertheless, agricultural products such as sugar and refined vegetable oils are subject to an
additional degressive protection tax which reduces the purchasingpower o f households. The country
waives import duties on goods originating in the WAEMU, and this preferential treatment has been
extended to ECOWAS countries since 2004. There are no non-tariff import restrictions except for a
quantity-based restriction on sugar imports which has not been enforced since the middle o f 2002,
and a national conformity certificate for certain products. The country's openness to trade is
consistent with the policies pursuedby successful Asian economies. All o f the East Asian economies
have low or zero black market premiums, all but Thailand have low tariffs, and all but Taiwan have
low coverage o f import q ~ o t a s .However, some o f these countries also utilized discretionary market
                                          ~ '
interventions (see box 2).

42.       Accelerating regional trade liberalization and integration can promote export diversification.
It is particularly critical for landlocked countries such as Burkina Faso to work closely with
neighboring countries on regional economic policies, become a haven for businesses in the region,
and secure access to coastal ports in addition to air transportation and the internet.42Trade reforms
have been pursued within the context o f the WAEMU, including the adoption o f a Common External
Tariff (CET). As a result, intraregional trade within WAEMU as a share o f total trade has been
increasing in the past years. Burkina Faso's share o f intraregional exports, at 28 percent, i s the
highest among all the WAEMUcountries. Other WAEMU countries are the principal markets for the
country's non-cotton exports, mostly livestock and food crops. Intraregional trade liberalization
should be accompanied by reduction o f external trade barriers o f the region in order for the country
to avoid becoming a captive market for more industrialized and richer neighbors within the region.

                       Box 2: Export Promotion and Growth in the Republic of Korea
    Despite open trade policies, it should be noted that many Asian economies also pursued discretionary
     interventionist policies. In the early 1960s, South Korea abandoned an import substitution strategy and
     instead adapted a growth strategy based on export-oriented industrialization and close cooperationbetween
    business and government. The authorities allowed the local currency to depreciate, reduced administrative
    barriers for businesses, and allowed duty-free imports and tax exemptions for exporters. In addition, the
     authorities utilized targeted discretionary policies such as sponsorship o f specific industries through
    rationed and directed credits, low interest rates through banks that they owned or controlled, import
     restrictions, selective price and wage controls, and restrictions o f labor unionactivities.
     Exports in the early 1960s were dominated by primary commodities such as silk, tungsten, and fish
    products. As industrialization proceeded, manufactured goods emerged as the dominant exports and the
    proportion o f primary commodities in exports fell from 80.1 percent in 1960 to 3.8 percent in 1994. The
     structure o f the economy reflectedthe changes inthe composition of exports. Agriculture as a share o f GDP
     decreased from 39.9 percent in 1960 to 3.8 percent in 2005, while the share of industnes rose from 18.6
    percent to 41.4 percent inthe same period.
     The effectiveness of the discretionary polices are still debated, and these policies were gradually phased out
     over time in favor of free market initiatives. The Asian financial crisis o f 1997 to 1998 exposed the long
     standingweaknesses inthe country's development model, and spurred the restructuringo fthe corporate and
     financial sectors. By contrast to the discretionary policies, the non-discretionary polices are less
     controversial and more adaptable to Burkina Faso.

Human Development

43.      The level of schooling, education attainment and literacy in Burkina Faso remain low. The
primary school enrollment rate at 44 percent and secondary school enrollment at 16 percent are low
by international standards. Just 30 percent o fmale adults and 13 percent o f female adults know how
to read and write. Progress has been made on some key health indicators, reversing the trend o f the
mid-1990s. Infant mortality declined to 83 per 1000 live births, below the SSA average. Infant
mortality and under-5 mortality also declined. Health infrastructure increased in recent years, but
accessibility to health services i s still an issue as 35 percent of the population still have to walk more
than an hour to reach to nearest health center.

44.       Health influences growth by improving the productivity o f labor.43 First, high rates o f
morbidity undermine productivity. Second, a longer and healthy life alters decisions about
consumption and savings. Planning for retirement becomes more critical when the likelihood o f
surviving to retirement age i s high. This results in higher savings which in turn promotes higher
investment. Highmorbidity and endemic diseases deter foreign as well as domestic investors. Better
health and nutrition also improve school attendance and cognitive development, which in turn raise
knowledge capital and productivity.

45.       Increased life expectancy may have played a significant role in promoting growth in East
Asian countries. Life expectancy increased from 39 years in 1967 to 67 years in 1990, resulting in an
increase in the ratio o f working-age to dependents population from about 1.3 to over 2. Life
expectancy inBurkina Faso i s 44 years. Inconjunction with decreased dependency ratio, the increase
inthe life expectancy also contributedtowards greater savings giventhat individual savings normally
peak between ages 40 to 65. The high saving rate allowed for the high investment levels. Cross-
country growth regressions suggest that one extra year o f life expectancy raises steady-state per
capita GDP by about 4 percent

46.       The positive influence o f education on income growth i s also well documented. Educational
attainment has a positive impact on skills in the labor force, productivity and earnings. Education
could also enhance health outcomes, thus maximizing the benefits described above. Modem growth
theories emphasize the importance o fknowledge and R&Don long-term growth.

Inequality and Shared Growth

47.       Country experience indicates that growth i s the main driver o f poverty reduction but changes
in inequality can also have a sizable impact on reducing poverty. Relatively to other countries,
Burkina Faso experienced a high degree o f pro-poor growth in terms o f falling inequality
contributing to a sizable decrease inpoverty (see figure 7).45Infact, the contribution from decreasing
inequality to poverty reduction Burkina Faso exceeded the contribution from growth over the period
1994 to 2003. By contrast, Ghana and Zambia showed very small inequality effects, and Uganda
experienced a large increase inpoverty due to the inequality effect.

48.       Differences in sectoral growth performance are a significant factor in explaining the impact
o f inequality on growth. In Burkina Faso, the agriculture sector producing traded goods was a major

source of growth which benefited from the 1994 devaluation, with the main employment response
occurring inthe informal sector. Declines inpoverty coincided with a decline in subsistence farming
and an expansion of commercial cereal and cotton production.

49.     Decentralization o f the public sector i s a major initiative in the country which aims to
provide a more equitable growth by improving public service delivery. The principle i s that local
governments are more accountable and responsive to local needs in education, health and
infrastructure. However, empirical research i s so far inconclusive regarding causal relationships
between decentralization and growth, reflecting the difficulty o f measuring the decentralization
variable and indicating the importance o f individual country circumstances, includingnon-economic
factors, indetermining causality.46A country's growth response to decentralization is sensitive to the
degree to which local governments control their revenues and expenditures, the composition o f
expenditures, and the degree to which local citizens elect local officials. Given the gradual pace o f
decentralization in Burkina Faso, it i s likely that the impact on growth will not be noticeable
significant inthe near future.

Policy Implications

50.     The PRSP targets an average growth rate o f 6 to 7 percent in the medium term in order to
significantly reduce poverty. Such levels o f growth inthe medium term will depend on implementing
a development strategy which strengthens the country's competitiveness, diversifies its economic
base, and expands market penetration. The key i s to raise productivity and investment rates, where
improved opportunities will induce greater investments. Higher productivity inthe agriculture sector
could result from improved irrigation, research and extension, fertilizer usage, and mechanization, as
opposed to continued expansion o f cultivation area which i s not sustainable. Promotion o fthe private
sector will be crucial given the limits o f further increasing the already large presence o f the public
sector inthe economy.

51.     Policies to promote economic growth require a comprehensive and balanced approach given
the varieties o f factors that influences the nature and quality o f development. Much o f the analysis

outlined previously needs to be further developed. In some instances, the underlying problems have
been identified   but the policy implications were not articulated. In particular, the previous analysis
focused on the problems associated with low returns to economic activities, while the cost and
availability o f financing were not addressed. The key i s to determine whether credit is a binding
constraint.

52.     Despite the shortcomings o fthe analysis, some broad policy implications can be identified:

    (i)Maintainmacroeconomicstability.Maintainingmacroeconomic stabilityisaprerequisite
    to all other policies. Sound macroeconomic policies over an extend period reduces uncertainties
    which undermine domestic and international investment. Within a stable macroeconomic
    environment, some o f the more pressing issues are to improve domestic revenue, and to carefully
    monitor and adjust for overvaluation o f the exchange rate. Credible exchange rate policies are o f
    course critical to export promotion.
    (ii)Initiateacoordinatedpushforanexportdiversificationstrategyofhighervaluedadded
    industries. Given the relatively small domestic market and poor natural resource endowment,
    the country's prospects for sustained growth depend on diversifylng exports beyond primary
    commodities. Further contraction o f the secondary sector o f the economy has to be reversed. The
    authorities should initiate a coordinated strategy to address shortcomings identified in the
    infrastructure, investment climate, finance, and customs and trade facilitation. The ongoing
    Diagnostic Trade Integration Study provides another opportunity to assess the situation in a
    comprehensive manner. In addition to a country-wide assessment, in-depth diagnostics o f
    specific subsector should be conducted inorder to identify detailed analysis of competitiveness at
    the industryand firm levels. Subsectors in the secondary sector should be priority candidates for
    such assessments.
    (iii)Improvetheinvestmentclimatebyreducingfactorcostsandadministrativebarriers.
    Costs associated with electricity, transportation, labor, contract enforcement and administrative
    bureaucratic practices are high even compared to other countries in the region. Poor investment
    climate results in high transaction costs, and impacts in particular the manufacturers which are
    intensive users o f investment climate services. Market liberalization combined with greater
    regional coordination on infiastructural management, such as the importing o f electricity from
    neighboring countries, contribute towards the lowering o f these costs.

    (iv) Improve public sector management. Improvingpublic services is critical given the large
     size o f the public sector. Diagnostic instruments such as CFAAs and PERs could be used to
    analyze in detail the management o f development projects inthe public sector as opposed to their
    typical focus on public financial management in general. The ongoing decentralization program
     should address regional development needs aligned with the coordinated push for export
    diversification proposedabove.

     (v) Strengthen human resource capacity. The extremely low human development indicators

1.       The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the fifth
review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement for Burkina Faso
(see Press Release No. 0.9207). The completion o f the review, which was undertaken on a lapse o f
time basis', enables the release o f a further SDR 3.44 million (about US$4.9 million) under the
arrangement. This will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR 20.6 million
(about US$29.6 million).

2.       The PRGF i s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process
involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. This i s intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and
reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10
years with a 5%-year grace period on principal payments.

                                 Burkina Faso: Debt Sustainability Analysis

This appendix assesses the sustainability of Burkina Faso's external public debt using the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) templatefor low-income countries. TheDSA was conductedjointly by
Fund and Bank staff and included a loan-by-loan reconciliation of the multilateral debt data. The
macroeconomic scenario underlying this DSA is summarized in Box 2 of the appendix. Based on the
analysis of the baseline scenario and several alternative scenarios, the Stags have come to the view
that the countryfaces a moderate risk of debt distress.

                                   Burkina Faso'sDebt Situationat end-2004

1.       The focus of the DSA is on Burkina Faso's external debt situation. While significant in the
past, domestic debt has declined rapidly in recent years inpart because o f requirements by the West
African Economic and Monetary Union                       -   to which Burkina Faso belongs-to                     phase out
indebtedness to the common central bank. In2005, domestic debt represents only 5 percent o f GDP,
and it i s projected to decline further over the mediumterm.

2.       Burkina Faso's external debt stock net of HIPC debt relief stood at USD 1.75 billion at end-
200448.72.6 percent o f this debt i s owed to multilateral creditors, such as IDA (49.2 percent), the
Afncan Development Bank (18.1 percent) and the IMF (5.3 percent). Most o f the bilateral debt i s
heldby non-Paris Club members, some of whom have not yet started providing their share of debt
relief.

3.       In April 2002, Burkina Faso reached the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative. At the time, it was judged that exogenous factors outside of the government's control
(such as falling cotton prices) had contributed to a significant deterioration o f Burkina Faso's debt
outlook and the country became the first HIPC to obtain an additional topping-up of the Enhanced
HIPC assistance. As o f end-2004, Burkina Faso's debt situation looks more optimistic than hadbeen
projected at the Completion Point (Box 1). Despite adverse exchange rate movements and higher
than anticipated new borrowing, at end-2004, the country had a NPV of debt-to-exports ratio that
was below the one projected at the Completion Point (183.1 percent and 192.5 percent respectively).




48Thedebt stock net o f obtained HIPC debt service relief is used to measure the existing debt burden of the country. The actual
debt outstanding reported by the country and the creditors was USD2.1 billion at end-2004. The two numbers differ because
HIPC debt relief is provided only in part as a reduction of the debt stock. Most creditors provide relief in the form of grants to
helpcover debt service obligationsfor a limited period or inthe form ofadebt rescheduling.

4.       The latest World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ranks Burkina
Faso as a `strong performer' in terms o f its policies and institutions. Indicative debt-burden
thresholds for countries in this category are a N P V o f debt-to-exports o f 200 percent, to GDP o f 50
percent and to revenues of 300 percent, and debt service ratios to exports and to revenues o f 25 and
35 percent respectively.

5.       To assess the risk for future debt distress, the Staffs have developed a baseline scenario and
several stress tests that are compared against the indicative thresholds. The debt service numbers
underlying the analysis reflect any debt relief still to be delivered after 2004. Sections B and C
discuss the underlyng assumptions and present the results o f the analysis, and Section Dconcludes.

                                                          The Baseline Scenario

6.       The baseline scenario i s developed for 2005--2025. The medium-term assumptions for 2005-
-08 are covered inthe Staff Report. The main assumptions for the subsequent years are summarized
inBox 2.

7.        Under the baseline scenario, all but one o f the external debt indicators maintain a stable path
for the entire projection period and remain well below their respective thresholds (Table la). Only
the N P V of debt-to-exports ratio breaches its indicative threshold over the medium term, but
improves again over longer horizons. Between 2005 and 2013, the ratio averages 218 percent before
falling below 200 percent in 2014. The medium-term deterioration in the NPV o f debt-to-exports
ratio i s due to several factors, including the medium-term run-upin expenditures (from 21.4 percent
o f GDP in2004 to 24.6 percent in2006).

                                          Box 2. Baseline Assumptions.
            The baseline scenario is developed for 2005-2025. The medium-termassumptions for 2005-2008
            are covered inthe staff report. For the subsequent years, the mainassumptions are the following:
                Annual real GDP growth is 6 percent. This is inline with the average growth rate over the
                past 15 years and also reflects gains !?om sustained efforts to improve private sector
                development and reduce government involvement inthe economy;
                Average inflation as measuredby the implicit deflator o f GDP is 2.1 percent, owing to the
                peg o f the currency to the euro
                The revenue to GDP ratio is projectedto rise gradually from 13.9 percent in2005 to 18
                percent by 2016 and stays constant afterwards, reflecting the gradual convergence o f the
                revenue ratio to the 17 percent WAEMU norm owing to rising incomes and improvedtax
                collection (including from ongoing efforts such as the establishment o f the large taxpayer
                unit, the completion o f a taxpayer Census and the introduction o f a unique Tax Identification
                Number)
                The expenditure to GDP ratio reaches 24 percent o fGDP by 2008 from 21.4 percent in
                2005, reflecting efforts o fthe authorities to make progress towards meeting the Millennium
                Development Goals (MDGs), and afterwards remains constant as a share o f GDP
                Cotton exports, which in2004 were almost 70 percent o f total exports, are projected to grow
                at 10 percent annually inreal terms during2009-2015       and at 5 percent thereafter. These
                growthrates are more conservative than the five and ten year historical averages, which were
                 13 and 17 percent respectively. Growthwill come from increasing the cotton growing areas
                and from productivity gains, notably from usingbetter crop varieties and increasingthe use
                o f fertilizers
                Non-cotton exports are assumed to grow at 5 percent inreal terms annually during 2009-
                2015 and at 7.5 percent thereafter. The authorities have identified non-cotton exports as a
                key sector for increasing economic diversification, and recent reforms inthe mining sector
                and ongoing efforts such as building a fruit and vegetables terminal support this strategy
                The export projections and the assumption that imports grow on average 7.4 percent annually
                over 2008-2025     (slightlyless than nominalGDP growth) lead to a gradual improvement o f
                the current account deficit excluding grants relative to GDP, from 11.7 percent in2008 to 4.9
                percent by 2025
                Finally, the baseline scenario assumes that the grant share o fthe total external financing need
                i s 57 percent and 54 percent for 2005 and 2006 respectively, calculated fiom information
                provided by the authorities. From2007 onwards, the grant component is
                projected to remain at 55 percent, which i s more conservative than the ten year historic
                average.


8.       The deterioration in the ratio is compounded by the relatively weak export growth in the
short term, which in dollar terms i s projected to grow by 5.6 percent on average in 2005-06
compared to an average growth o f 25.0 percent in2002-04. Other debt burden indicators such as the
debt service ratios and the NPV o f debt-to-GDP and revenue ratios remain stable over the projection
period. Until 2025, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to average 23 percent, and Burkina
Faso would spendon average 9 percent o f its export proceeds or 7 percent o f its total revenues on the
payment o f debt service.

                                               Sensitivity Analysis

9.       The sensitivity analysis shows that, again with the exception of the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio, the indicators remain below their respective indicative thresholds, even under stress (Table 1b).
The projections for the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio and the debt service ratios are most vulnerable
to the following three standard scenarios: (i)        should export projections remain subdued and grow at
one standard deviation below historical levels, (ii)           in the event of a combined shock or (iii) the    if

                                                         - 147 -

terms o f financing available to the country worsen (bound tests B 2 and B5 and scenario A2 in Table
lb respectively). The Staffs performed an additional scenario that assumes that the authorities
achieve only half of the projected increase in the revenue-to-GDP target 2015 (Table IC).Under this
scenario, should the authorities not be able to compensate the lower revenues with expenditure cuts
or a higher grant share o f their financing, the various debt ratios would not improve over the long
run, and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 200 percent over the entire projection
period. Finally, under the standard historical scenario (scenario Al, Table lb), all indicators exhibit a
sharp upward trend in the outer years o f the projection period. The main reason for the worsening o f
the indicators compared to the baseline i s that the historical scenario assumes that the non-interest
current account remains at 8.9 percent o f GDP leadingto a stark increase innew borrowing.49

                                                      Staff Assessment

10.      The findings from Debt Sustainability Analysis lead the Staffs to conclude that while
Burkina Faso's debt dynamics are sustainable, the country faces a moderate risk o f debt distress. The
debt situation i s sustainable because, with the exception o f the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio, all debt
indicators remain well below the policy-contingent indicative thresholds, both under the baseline and
under the alternative scenarios. The NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio breaches the indicative threshold
for some years under the baseline before improving gradually in the outer years o f the projection
period. Taken as a whole, the Staffs do not view the temporary breach o f that threshold as indicative
o f a fimdamental debt problem.

 11.     However, the results from the alternative scenarios underscore the need for the authorities to
continue to implement their program o f sound macroeconomic policies and reforms, including
towards achieving higher export growth and other growth-enhancing measures. The alternative
revenue scenario highlights the importance o f maintaining efforts to improve revenue collection.
Those factors, combined with unwavering resolve to attract financing at favorable terms-preferably
through grants-would            help Burkina Faso in achieving progress towards the MDGs (as reflected in
the ambitious medium-term expenditure program) while containing the risks to maintaining external
debt sustainability.




 49The historical scenario also does not take into account the fonvard-looking export price projections from the latest WEO.

46.      Inasmuchas the CGAB-PRSP agreement was concluded in2005, no performance matrix was
prepared or approved in 2004 by the Government and the partners for evaluation in 2005. The
annual performance matrix review session will take place three weeks after submission o f the
memorandum from the partners by the lead manger to the Government, and five weeks following the
annual PRSP review, at the latest.

47.      The 2005 partners' memorandum will consist o f a joint overall evaluation o f PRSP and
PRGB implementation in 2004.

48.      The partners who have established specific disbursement criteria that require review based
on commitments made prior to signing the rules o f procedure will conduct this exercise individually
but inline with the overall evaluation, andwith as much inputas possiblefrom the other partners.

49.      The usual cycle for drafting, approval, and review, as provided for inpoints 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3
above will begin in 2005. Therefore, the annual 2005 review session will result in the preparationo f
a 2005-2007 performance matrix decided upon by consensus, implementation o f which will be
assessedduringthe second halfo f 2006.

50.      For practical reasons, the mandate o f the chief liaison official appointed by the partners will
cover the remainder o f 2005, at a minimum.

    6.2      Amendment to the rulesof procedure

51.      The rules o f procedure may be amended by consensus at CGAB-PRSP sessions and, as
necessary, on the basis o f a detailed report prepared by the technical ad hoc group.

    6.3      Entryinto effect and applicationof the rulesof procedure

52.      These rules o f procedure will enter into effect when they are adopted at a CGAB-PRSP
