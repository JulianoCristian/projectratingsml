1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background - Burkina Faso - a poor landlocked country of about 12 million inhabitants with a
very narrow resource base ­ had built a solid track record of reforms on the economic and
structural fronts and achieved substantial economic growth by early 2004 when the Bank began
the preparation of the second series of PRSCs (PRSC-4 to 6). However, progress in improving
living conditions had been slow and fragile. Burkina's low administrative capacity and
vulnerability to exogenous shocks such as climatic conditions and changes in world market
prices for cotton (Burkina's main export) were important obstacles to translating growth into
developmental gains. It was clear that continued Bank support for PRSP implementation,
building on the reform agenda supported by the first PRSC series, was needed to support
government reforms to further encourage growth and employment creation, develop human
resources and improve governance. The second PRSP and its priority action plan, adopted by
the government in November 2004, provided the policy and results framework for this second
PRSC series.

On the macroeconomic front, Burkina had implemented a wide range of economic reforms under
a series of stabilization and structural reform programs supported by the Bank, the IMF and other
donors since 1991. It had maintained a stable macroeconomic environment as evidenced by the
approval in June 2003 (following four successive IMF supported programs) of a new three-year
PRGF arrangement and the successful completion of its first review in March 2004. The PRGF
supported the implementation of the government's program in 2003-06. Real GDP growth
averaged 5.8 percent annually between 2000 and 2004, among the highest growth rates in sub-
Saharan Africa. Growth was mainly driven by the agricultural sector, and in particular by the
expansion of cotton production, which doubled from 2000 to 2004. Real per capita income
increased by 28 percent during 2000-04 and stood at US$350 in 2004. Inflation, as measured by
the consumer price index, averaged 1.7 percent on an annual basis between 2000 and 2004 and
remained low compared to other countries in the WAEMU and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Burkina Faso reached the completion points under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiatives in
June 2000 and April 2002, respectively. Granted debt relief totaled more than US$550 million in
net-present value terms, including a topping-up at completion point. As a result of the debt relief
and prudent macroeconomic policies, Burkina decreased its debt service in terms of exports from
28.5 percent in 2000 to 5.8 percent in 2004. The primary fiscal deficit widened from 2.8 to 3.6
percent of GDP during 2000-04, largely due to WAEMU-wide custom reforms lowering custom
revenues and increased social spending following debt relief since 2000. The deficit was covered
by an increase in grants received and debt relief granted.

On the structural front, Burkina Faso had made headway in implementing key reforms under the
PRSP's strategic pillars, notably on public sector reform and governance, and sectoral policies
for the poor. The first included reforms to strengthen the budgetary process, improve auditing
functions, revise procurement regulations, decentralize the budget and reform the civil service.
The second incorporated measures to improve service delivery in education and health and
strengthen income-generating agricultural activities. Expenditure policies were increasingly
aligned with the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted in June 2000. The

PRSP priorities and debt relief allowed for an increasing share of poverty reducing expenditures
from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2000 to 5.3 percent in 2004. The increase benefited mainly the
health and education sectors (75 percent) as well as social welfare expenditures. The rise in
poverty reducing expenditures facilitated increased investment across all priority sectors to 1.9
percent of GDP in 2004, albeit from a very low level of 0.5 percent in 2000.

With broad-based growth in agriculture, poverty was substantially reduced, from an estimated 54
percent in 1998 to 46 percent in 2003. However, the country's social indicators continued to
rank below Sub-Saharan averages: in 2003 the adult literacy rates was 32 percent and life
expectancy at birth was 43 years compared to 35 percent and 46 years for Sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2004, Burkina Faso ranked 174 out of 177 countries in the UNDP Human Development
Index.

The successful implementation of the first PRSC series (PRSC-1 to 3) laid the ground for further
reforms in economic growth and employment creation, human resource development and good
governance. The second PRSC series was designed to deepen and broaden these reforms. This
PRSC series was in line with donor efforts to gradually harmonize their support. Several donors
offering budget support including the Bank agreed with the government in January 2005 on a
revised framework for collaboration. The framework gave the government's second PRSP a
central role in measuring progress and defining disbursement criteria.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

1. Development Objectives

The series of three annual programmatic operations (PRSC-4, PRSC-5 and PRSC-6) was
designed to support the implementation of Burkina Faso's poverty reduction strategy as set out in
the June 2000 and November 2004 PRSPs. The PRSCs supported the PRSP objectives of: (i)
increasing economic growth and employment creation in a stable macroeconomic environment;
(ii) increasing access to and quality of basic social services; and (iii) improving governance with
a particular emphasis on public sector management.

Over the period 2004-06, it was expected that the reform program under the series of the three
PRSCs would help the government to achieve a 5 percentage point reduction of poverty
incidence, and increase private sector participation in the cotton, telecommunication and energy
sectors, thus accelerating growth through higher investment and improved competitiveness. It
would also help the government make progress toward reaching the MDGs, namely, increase
school enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal mortality, increase access to safe
water, and strengthen the sustainability of development efforts.

The key indicators for such development objectives are stated in Annex Table 1 (PRSC-4 to 6
Policy Matrix). Objectives, policy reforms and indicators for the PRSC-4 to 6 series were based
on and aligned with the PRSP II, respectively the Priority Action Program (PAP, a policy
document, which updates the PRSP on an annual basis), and the CGAB joint performance matrix.
Consistent with the 2003 CAS Progress Report and the 2005 CAS, PRSC-4 to 6 were one-
tranche programmatic development policy operations each in the amount of US$60 million
equivalent.    PRSC-4 and 6 were IDA credits, while PRSC-5 provided US$13.9 million


                                                - 2 -

equivalent as a grant and US$46.1 million equivalent as a credit. Since 2004, development
policy lending to Burkina Faso rose from around 30 percent of IDA commitments to around 45
percent.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The objectives of providing support to the implementation of Burkina Faso's PRSP remained the
same throughout the three annual PRSCs.

Throughout the PRSC series, about 20 indicators were revised to align them better with the
evolving government's monitoring framework for its PRSP in the form of the Priority Action
Program (PAP). Four indicators covering the area of social protection, public sector reform and
decentralization were revised to provide more specificity. One indicator relating to the energy
policy area was eliminated to better reflect the expected short to medium-term outcomes of this
PRSC series, instead of long-term electricity production costs. Similarly, an indicator for private
sector development was changed to focus on parameters directly under the control of the
government. Regarding the water and sanitation sector, in 2005 the baseline data for the given
indicators were revised in the context of formulating an action plan towards meeting the MDGs
in this sector (see also Annex 1 with the earlier data in brackets).         With regard to the
decentralization policy area, a training indicator was replaced with another indicator which was
more relevant to the unfolding of the decentralization reform program.            In the area of
environment, one of the four original indicators was eliminated because the indicator turned out
to be unrealistic and exceeded existing capacity. Finally, some indicators were added or detailed
out in 2005 to cover evolving policies concerning the diversification of agro-production, the
privatization program in telecommunication and the energy sector more closely. These revisions
reflect efforts by the government and donors to gradually improve the link between policy
actions and the PRSP monitoring and evaluation framework by increasing the specificity,
relevance and realism of the outcome and impact indicators. PRSCs drew on these efforts by
incorporating these revisions throughout the series.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The policy areas supported by PRSC-4 to 6 are detailed as follows:

1.    Economic Growth and Employment Creation: under this objective PRSC-4 to 6 supported
policy reforms in the following areas:

(i)   improving the competitiveness of the cotton sector by assisting the government to finalize
      the liberalization of the cotton growing and ginning industry in Burkina Faso through the
      creation of three exclusive zones for cotton growing, and the establishment of self-
      governing bodies for the industry;

(ii) developing action plans to diversify agricultural production, and taking steps to facilitate
      export of oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, poultry and other meat;

(iii) enhancing private sector participation in the telecommunications, electricity and petroleum
      distribution sectors; and




                                                - 3 -

(iv) supporting private sector development by improving labor market regulations, supporting
     trade institutions, enhancing the capacity of the justice system, and reducing the costs of
     establishing a business.

2.   Human Resource Development: under this objective PRSC-4 to 6 supported policy reforms
in the following areas:

(i)  improving access to basic education services, especially in rural areas, by increasing the
     resources available for the sector and managing the same more effectively, including
     through development of a sector MTEF;

(ii) enhancing access to public health services, especially in rural areas, and ensuring a more
     efficient use of public resources for the sector by elaborating a MTEF for the health sector,
      improving the health expenditure monitoring system, increasing health center staffing in
      general but in particular in the underserved regions through decentralization, ensuring free
      vaccination, as well as reducing treatment costs for popular illnesses and for disadvantaged
      districts, and improving the nutrition status of children;

(iii) developing a strategy to improve social protection of vulnerable groups (especially
      children); and

(iv) increasing access to water services by providing an enhanced public framework for private
      investment, especially in under provided provinces.

3.   On Good Governance, the PRSC-4 to 6 supported the following policy reform areas:

(i)  improving budget formulation through the development of sector MTEFs (education and
     health) and consolidating budget classification (also in line with regionally agreed
      standards), enhancing budget execution by empowering the deconcentrated level and by
      improving the integration of external aid flows in the budget execution process, and
      improving public sector human resource management and decentralization;

(ii) strengthening the oversight institutions (Supreme Audit Courts, State Inspection and
      Finance Inspection) and the verification of state property (inventory), and improving
      adherence to prescribed reporting duties on closed public accounts;

(iii) improving the transparency and efficiency of the public procurement system by simplifying
      its governing rules and aligning it with international practices;

(iv) enhancing decentralization of public service delivery by creating the legal framework and
      introducing related administrative decrees, and empowering the sub-national level through
      the transfer of functions, assets and resources; and

(v)   enhancing the government's capacity to assess the environmental impact of its policies and
      activities.




                                                 - 4 -

In the areas mentioned above, each PRSC built on the achievements of the previous one, thus
supporting a continuum of reform actions and activities.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

The policy area Public Sector Reform and Decentralization was revised to allow for the evolving
discussion in Burkina on how best to decentralize resources and authority in the context of
preparing specific application decrees and administrative procedures after the adoption of the
decentralization law of 2004. In this regard, the development of rural ministries was dismissed
in favor of focusing on the decentralization reform. The development of rural ministries was
covered by an investment project in the agricultural sector.


1.6 Other Significant Changes

There were no changes in financing or implementation arrangements.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

While PRSC-4 to 6 supported a large number of measures covering the areas detailed in annex 1
of this Implementation Completion and Results Report, each PRSC included as tranche release
conditions a sub-set of these measures (detailed in table 1 below) selected on the basis of their
importance and government's expected implementation capacity.

All but three of the 11 triggers for PRSC-4 were fully met at the time of Board presentation in
May 2004. Bringing the assets of SOFITEX (the cotton monopoly) to the point of sale in the
central and eastern zones was slowed by delays in validating the pre-qualification outcome but
assets were transferred to private investors in two zones in August 2004. Also, the adoption of
the electricity and petroleum sector strategies took more time than expected due to delays in the
work of consultants and in the adoption of changes to the legal and regulatory framework (these
eventually served as a trigger for PRSC-5). Implementation of the region as a deconcentrated
entity and adoption of the application texts for the TODs were met in substantial part but not in
full .1

All but 2 of the 10 triggers for PRSC-5 were fulfilled at the time of Board presentation in May
2005. All but 3 of the 9 triggers for PRSC-6 were fulfilled at the time of Board presentation in
June 2006. In both cases, delays were encountered in improving the monitoring of externally
financed investment spending and operationalizing an accounting system for government
property. Actions for the treatment and monitoring of externally financed investment spending


1Several actions were taken to meet this trigger, including adoption of texts for the regions in March-April 2003 defining the role
and resources of governors, adoption of the decentralization law in August 2003 by the National Assembly and preparation of a
variety of application texts to regulate resources and personnel transfers and define the role of different entities; however, the
nomination of governors for the 13 regions was delayed due to the intense inter-ministerial discussions on the financial and human
resource implications of decentralization.




                                                              - 5 -

were mostly implemented, although the full installation of the required computerized information
system took longer than expected due to difficulties in procuring a project manager. The
physical verification of government property was completed in 43 of the 45 provinces and in the
commune of Ouagadougou prior to PRSC-6 while the operationalization of the accounting
system for government property was delayed, although the government had hired a private firm
to finalize such system before PRSC-6.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation


Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

The implementation of the program supported by this PRSC series was adversely affected by a
series of severe external shocks, notably deteriorating terms of trade and the protracted crisis in
Cote d'Ivoire. International cotton prices declined in 2004-05 and oil prices shot up in 2004-06,
with an appreciating franc CFA further undermining export earnings. This resulted in a decline
of the export price for 1 kg of ginned cotton from Franc CFA781 in 2004 to Franc CFA637 in
2006, which deteriorated the financial situation of the cotton ginning companies. In addition,
international oil prices increased from about 30 dollars at the end of 2003 to 60 dollars per barrel
at the end of 2006, a price increase which was barely offset by the appreciating franc CFA, and
resulted in unexpected expenditures, including for higher electricity subsidies.         Also, the
protracted crisis in Cote d'Ivoire (historically the main transit route for Burkina Faso to global
markets and a source for remittances from migrants) contributed to high transport costs for the
country's trade and reduced worker remittances, undermining competitiveness and adding to the
pressures on the balance of payments. Finally, the extension of country-of-origin rules from
WAEMU to ECOWAS negatively affected revenue levels.                 Despite these developments,
economic growth proved resilient, inflation declined and the fiscal stance was broadly as
targeted.

Factors generally subject to government control:

The government was generally in control of the speed of implementation of reforms, notably in
the cotton sector, health, education, and public finance management. Although delays in
completing studies or technical assistance work slowed implementation at times, they often
reflected weak capacity and/or the fact that government agencies were overloaded with a
multitude of donor programs. In the electricity and telecoms sectors and in implementing
decentralization, delays in implementing reforms reflected the need for a longer time to build
consensus within the government. In these cases, PRSCs were generally flexible enough to
adjust to government's implementation and consensus-building capacity.

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

Several ministries and government agencies were responsible for implementing the reform
program under the PRSCs. The Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Programs
and Policies (SP-PPF) at the Ministry of Finance and Budget coordinated the contributions of all
ministries and public agencies. SP-PPF generally did very well in mobilizing those contributions,
although a deeper and earlier exchange with line ministries would have helped avoid delays in
coordinating sectoral activities under the PRSCs.

The design and implementation of this series of PRSCs were increasingly coordinated with the
budget support provided by other donors. This coordination took place through the Cadre
Général d'Organisation des Appuis Budgétaires (General Framework for Budget Support,
CGAB) established in 2005, which succeeded a less formalized coordination approach. CGAB
annual progress reports on PRSP implementation and the joint performance matrix provided a


                                                - 9 -

framework to harmonize the efforts of Burkina Faso's development partners with government's
strategy by: (i) supporting implementation of the second PRSP through the budget; (ii)
developing a common framework to assess progress; (iii) reducing transaction costs to
government of negotiating and reporting to multiple donors by promoting programmatic
approaches; (iv) improving the predictability of budget support for Burkina Faso; and (v)
conducting joint progress reviews acceptable to the government and its development partners
(DPs).2 This provided an effective framework against which to align this PRSC series. The
close coordination between the government and CGAB members allowed for early entry points
in the policy dialogue and identification of corrective measures or solutions to implementation
bottlenecks. Examples would be the privatization process for ONATEL and for the energy
sector but also the complex decentralization reforms.                        Furthermore, close and continuous
dialogue with the government allowed CGAB members to better understand the constraints on
the reform process (e.g., for cotton reform) and build government ownership on the reform
program. However, the formalization of the CGAB process over time does present potential for
emerging rigidities and may limit flexibility and partners' ability to adjust rapidly to an evolving
reform environment. The on-going evaluation of the CGAB process presents a good opportunity
to analyze this issue.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation framework for the PRSC-4 to 6 series was based on the PRSP
three year forward looking Priority Action Program (PAP) and the annual assessment reports on
PRSP implementation (Annual Progress Reports, APR), issued by the SP-PPF. The SP-PPF
relies for such monitoring primarily on the Ministerial Steering and Monitoring Committee
(CMOS) which draws on the services of sector and thematic commissions (CSTs) to establish
adequate and up-to-date information on policy implementation and related statistical data. The
CSTs in turn draw on decentralized agencies at the regional Consultative Council (CCRD). The
objectives and measures of the PRSC series were also increasingly aligned with the CGAB
performance matrix. Discrepancies between the two matrices indicate inconsistencies between
the preparation calendar of the PRSCs and the multi-donor review process (see lessons learned),
a problem which is being addressed.

The PRSP and PRSC monitoring and evaluation framework drew on work undertaken and
reports issued by the National Institute for Statistics and Demography (INSD). While the most
recent household survey is from 2003, information is updated through annually conducted
surveys on Core Welfare Indicators (CWIQ). Other sectoral data on agriculture, education,
health, water and other areas are either produced as part of a regular schedule by the government
or in conjunction with analytical sector work, as recently carried out in education. Concerning
health, the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dates from 2005 and is to be
updated in 2008.



2Evaluation of PRSP implementation is permanent but three mandatory sessions are reserved per annum for a joint assessment
by CAB members and the government on reform measures and their status. One formal session is held at the time of the annual
review of the PRSP progress report in late April. A second session is held during late September/early October to allow for a
mid-term review and another review session is held in early February, prior to finalizing the government's own annual PRSP
review report.




                                                          - 10 -

The M&E framework improved each year under the PRSC-4 to 6 with respect to coverage and
quality. The formation of the CGAB and the government's ownership in the PRSP process
greatly contributed to improve the M&E framework. APRs have been completed for each year
during PRSC implementation and their quality has improved over time. Also, the alignment of
the PRSCs' outcome indicators with the government's monitoring process, in the form of the
annual PRSP review/PAP within the CGAB framework, facilitated monitoring of the
series'implementation for all participants and strengthened government ownership of the reforms
supported by the PRSC series.

Other improvements in M&E implementation include: (i) better dissemination of the APRs,
including to Parliamentarians, regional planning and operation officers, and rural communities,
including through the use of radio programs and video presentations; (ii) better usage of the
APRs to inform the budget process (beginning with the 2005 budget); and (iii) the introduction
of participatory M&E which started on a pilot basis in late 2004 to obtain feedback from citizens
about the extent to which enhanced access to basic services was being achieved at the
community level, and also included the development of citizens report cards to assess
satisfaction with the delivery of basic services (water, education, and health). In addition, the
government has strengthened its policy planning unit at the MFB over the last few years to be
able to review and improve PRSP indicators and targets as measures for progress in policy
implementation.

Going forward, further improving the M&E framework will require strengthening the capacity of
the CSTs. The commission members rely on work done by research and planning units in
ministries or other relevant government units. The quality of the work in these units is diverse,
with some data not being provided on a timely basis. The government has recognized this
weakness and taken action in 2006 to improve CST operations.             In addition, the M&E
framework for the next series of PRSCs could gradually increase its focus on qualitative
improvements (such as efficiency for basic services and agricultural production) as well as
further streamline the indicators coverage.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

Building on the PRSC-1 to 3 series, the PRSC-4 to 6 progressively focused on challenging
growth objectives, notably diversification, competitiveness and efficiency. The series is being
followed by a third series of three annual one tranche PRSCs (PRSC 7 to 9) covering the period
2007-2009. The new series continues to be closely aligned with the PRSP and aims at pursuing
and deepening the reforms introduced in this series: reducing factor costs (electricity and
transport), helping improve the competitiveness of the cotton sector, and supporting government
efforts to enhance the business climate and diversify exports. This series will also further
improve access to social services through greater decentralization and institutional strengthening
and enhance the efficiency and accountability of public financial management.            The first
operation in the series, PRSC-7 (US$90 million equivalent), was approved by the Board in July
2007. The design of the new series was coordinated with other DPs that participate in the CGAB
framework. This third PRSC series incorporated key lessons from the second PRSC series,
including the need to adjust the government strategy in the cotton sector to increase the sector's
competitiveness.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PRSC-4 to 6 objectives, design and implementation are consistent with the country's current
development priorities as detailed in the second PRSP and the CAS. Specifically, the PRSC-4 to
6 objectives supported 3 out of 4 objectives of the CAS and were closely aligned with PRSP
objectives: (1) accelerating broad-based growth; (2) improving access to basic social services for
the poor; (3) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and
(4) promoting good governance. Particularly notable in this respect was the series' support for
implementing the national action plans in education and health sectors, as well as the
government's Program to Strengthen Budget Management. Preparation of PRSC-4 to 6 was
increasingly aligned with the budget cycle and the support provided by other donors through the
General Framework for Budget Support in Burkina Faso (CGAB). The CGAB coordination
framework allowed for regular monitoring and assessment of the PRSC series' objectives and
outcomes, thus ensuring continuous relevance of PRSC objectives and measures supporting such
objectives. The relevance of PRSC-4 to 6 objectives and measures was enhanced by the
substantial analytical work carried out during its implementation (see below).

Under the PRSCs, disbursements took place at effectiveness based on the government's
satisfactory implementation of prior actions identified as critical for the implementation of the
overall reform program. This ensured that key reforms needed to support the objectives of the
three PRSCs would be taken up-front, giving a clear overall time line for the most important
reforms and predictability of external support for the budget. As seen in Table 1 above, the prior
actions show a consistent unfolding of the reform program designed to support the
implementation of the PRSP, and ensuring a high level of continuity from operation to operation.
In the cases where originally set targets were partly missed, such as in the cotton and the energy
sectors, the government either achieved the set targets shortly afterwards (cotton sector), or made
credible efforts to achieve them (energy sector - where the complexity of issues took time to be
resolved). The channeling of a large share of resources through the budget, instead of through
projects, strengthened decision-making by the Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with sector
Ministries, Cabinet, and Parliament, and enhanced sound financial management and
accountability. Ownership was further supported by the high quality of the policy dialogue and
the policy content, which was sensitive to country constraints. An indicator for the high degree
of ownership and the appropriately chosen design for the series was, among others, that program
implementation continued broadly as expected despite of presidential election of 2005.

The PRSC series was complemented by a number of investment and technical assistance projects
to support program implementation in the areas of health, education, agriculture, energy, water,
private sector development and public administration. Projects supporting the PRSC reform
agenda are: (i) the Administration Capacity Building project (US$7 million, FY05) which aims
to build capacity in public administration for policy formulation and implementation,
streamlining public administration, modernizing personnel management, and enhancing the
poverty focus of expenditure; (ii) the Statistical Capacity Building project (US$10 million,
FY04) which addresses shortcomings in the M&E system by strengthening data collection and
reporting; (iii) the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (US$31 million, FY03),
aiming, among others, at privatization of the state owned energy and telecommunication assets;


                                               - 12 -

(iv) the Power Sector Development Project (US$64 million, FY04) financing a regional
electricity interconnection with Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana to lower energy costs; (v) the
Agricultural Diversification and Market Development Project (US$66 million, FY06) to increase
productivity in the cotton sector, expand irrigation and support measures to diversify farm
outputs; (vi) the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (FY02) and the Health Sector Support and
AIDS Project (FY06), together for a total of US$75 million, and the Basic Education Sector
Loan (US$33 million, FY02) and a Post Primary Education Loan (US$23 million, FY06). In
addition, the decentralization objectives and related financial management reforms supported by
this series are being pursued by the recently approved Decentralized Urban Capacity Building
project (US$10 million, FY07) which aims to support decentralization in urban areas
(municipalities) by strengthening urban management capacity, financial resource mobilization
and financial management of municipalities.

The cotton sector's reform objectives of the series were highly relevant to enhance Burkina's
growth and competitiveness. PRSC-4 aimed at increased efficiency in the cotton sector through
the introduction of two additional private ginners, who would operate in the west and central
areas of the country, with SOFITEX, the former monopoly covering the remainder. PRSC-5 and
6 aimed at enhancing competitiveness by liberalizing input markets and improving transparency
and information flows among sector stakeholders through the strengthening of professional
stakeholder associations and the creation of an inter-professional association to take on sectoral
management responsibilities. The overall strategy was one of progressive reform in light of (i)
the difficulties in rapidly modifying the industrial structure of the sector without threatening its
survival and (ii) the risk of imposing abrupt social adjustments as 2.5 million persons depend on
the sector.

Policy actions succeeded in creating transparency and introducing the need to treat all ginners on
even footing, thereby reducing the privileged relationship between SOFITEX and the
government. In addition, the creation of the inter-professional association allowed producers to
have a voice in sector organization and management as well as better information on the
financial structure of the industry. However, the policy action aimed at liberalization and
commercial behavior on the part of cotton ginners did not bring about fully the expected results.
With the former stabilization fund defunct from 2004, a pricing mechanism influenced by
political considerations and the deterioration of international market conditions (the decline of
international cotton prices in 2004-05 and an appreciation of the franc CFA against the dollar),
the ginning companies accumulated losses. The cotton reforms implemented aimed at shifting
the risk from government to ginners and generate incentives sufficient for companies to adjust to
market conditions (for example by calling for lower producer prices early on). However, such
behavior did not materialize in 2006-07. A better reading of the political economy of reform in
the sector would likely have shown that companies felt relatively confident that government
could eventually be pushed to cover the financial gap, in the face of a significant risk of sector
collapse.   Prices were adjusted downward between 2005 and 2006, but insufficiently to
compensate for the fall of export prices. The reduction of producer prices was also offset by a
substantial increase in production volumes, leading to further losses for the companies.

The youth of the inter-professional association (AICB) and its weak capacity made it difficult for
the organization to play its full role in translating market developments into adequate



                                               - 13 -

commercial decisions. Such decisions did not come early enough to avoid significant financial
risks. The AICB took decisive action to reform the pricing mechanism and to adjust prices to
market conditions (November 2006 and May 2007) only after the need for the recapitalization of
the ginning companies surfaced as the only solution to keep the sector afloat. The government
bailout of SOFITEX could not be avoided and its cost (franc CFA35 billion or 1 percent of GDP)
was affected by the decision of DAGRIS (the private shareholder in SOFITEX) not to
recapitalize its shares. In line with these developments and on the basis of lessons learned,
PRSC-7 and its successor operations concentrated on ensuring the soundness of the pricing
mechanism, enhancing competitiveness of the sector through efficiency gains, and improving the
operation of SOFITEX, including through the sale to private investors of the shares held by
government in SOFITEX. In parallel, another Bank operation helps build AICB's capacity and
supports productivity enhancements for cotton and other crops.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

PRSC-4 to 6 achieved most of their development objectives as evidenced by government
performance in targeted qualitative and quantitative outcome indicators. Outcomes under the
PRSCs, including poverty trends, are discussed below and detailed in Annex 1.

       Macroeconomic Stability, Growth and Employment Creation

Macroeconomic performance. Against a background of unfavorable natural conditions and
exogenous shocks, Burkina Faso maintained a stable macroeconomic environment during 2004-
07 aided by fiscal discipline, sound policy implementation and significant inflows of external
support of about 9 percent of GDP. During the same period, real GDP growth averaged a
commendable 6 percent (above the targeted average rate of 5 percent and compared to a
WAEMU average of 4 percent), implying per capita growth of 3.3 percent. Real GDP growth is
estimated at 4.2 percent in 2007. Poverty reduction continued, from 46 percent in 2003 to an
estimated 41 percent in 2006, broadly in line with the targeted outcome (see Annex 1). Growth
was mainly driven by the agricultural sector, which explains its impact on poverty reduction
given that most of the population depends on agriculture.                     3Average inflation during 2004-06
stood at 2.8 percent and was below the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
convergence target of 3 percent, even though the terms of trade deteriorated by 9 percent
between 2004 and 2006. Despite continuing high oil and low cotton prices, the current account
deficit improved, mainly because of booming cotton exports, encouraged by high domestic
producer prices for cotton.

The authorities pursued prudent fiscal policies with the fiscal deficit largely covered by foreign
assistance. However, the level of fiscal revenues has improved marginally over the years and
requires strengthening.           During the PRSC-4 to 6 period (2004-06), Burkina Faso passed
successfully the reviews of the then applicable PRGF arrangement and concluded it in
September 2006. A fifth PRGF arrangement was approved by the IMF Board in April 2007 and
is currently being implemented satisfactorily. Debt has become considerably more sustainable
during the period as a result of substantial debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor

3A more explicit analysis of the links between growth and poverty reduction will be part of the upcoming Country Economic
Memorandum. However, a thorough poverty impact analysis of this PRS series will only be possible once the 2007 census data,
which includes poverty data, become available; estimated to be in early 2009.

Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), with the latter
granted in March 2006, which further freed fiscal space for priority expenditures and
strengthened debt sustainability.

The cotton sector. Under PRSC-4 to 6 the cotton sector liberalization was advanced with (i) the
abolition in 2004 of the exclusive rights (monopoly) for the former monopoly company
SOFITEX to service the sector, thus allowing the entry of two new private operators (SOCOMA
and FASO COTON which now hold 15 percent of the market) in the central and eastern cotton
growing zone; and (ii) the creation in 2005 of an institutional set-up for self-governance of the
sector by its stakeholders (producers and ginning companies) without participation of the state,
and subsequent discussion on a reform of the producer price mechanism, which was finalized in
May 2007. At the end of 2006, the role of the state in the cotton sector was reduced to a
minority shareholding in SOFITEX, compared to the period prior to 1999 when SOFITEX was a
state owned monopoly.

The performance of the cotton sector is characterized by a remarkable increase in cotton
production and high value added during the PRSC-4 to 6 period, followed by a set back in 2006-
07 when the ginning companies faced a severe financial crisis. Over the past decade, cotton
production increased by an average of 17 per cent per annum making Burkina the largest
producer of cotton in sub-Saharan Africa. This was largely driven by the input credit system and
high national producer prices. Over the period of this PRSC series, cotton production increased
from 480,000 tons in 2003/04 to 713,123 tons of seed cotton in 2005/06 and decreased to
656,750 in 2006/07. Except for 2005, fiber exports were above the PRSC targeted outcomes (see
Annex 1). However, a significant output fall (by a third, to about 437,000 tons) is expected for
the current 2007/08 season, primarily due to adverse climate conditions (late and geographically
uneven rainfalls, causing flooding in certain regions and drought in others) and to a 12 percent
decline of the producer floor price reflecting international price trends (franc CFA145). A delay
in payments to farmers for the last campaign and the late announcement of the producer floor
price may also have contributed to the output decline. It needs to be noted, however, that the
decline in cotton production is not unique to Burkina Faso. Mali and Cote d'Ivoire have
experienced the same trend in cotton production since the 2004/2005 season, with Burkina Faso
remaining the largest producer in the region. Despite the fall in production the cotton sector in
Burkina Faso is expected to return to profitability in 2008, supported by the 2007 producer price
adjustment and favorable international cotton price developments.

The decline of the export price for cotton and the franc CFA appreciation vis­à-vis the US
dollar, together with the absence of an adequate price setting mechanism to more closely align
the producer price with the declining world price, caused substantial financial difficulties for the
cotton companies and put the sector under financial stress, further compounded by the absence of
a functioning and market-based producer price stabilization fund.4 As a result, the three ginning
companies accumulated deficits over 2004 to 2006, amounting to about US$93 million. During

4The producer price set in 2004, at the onset of the sector's opening to new private investors, was expected to be applicable for 3
years and the understanding of the sector's private stakeholders was, that a stabilization fund would support such prices. The
stabilization fund materialized only during late 2007 and its financing is being assured. The operating mechanism of this
stabilization fund aims to support financial sustainability by adhering strictly to market mechanism, without any government
involvement.

2006-07 three sets of actions were implemented by sector operators in Burkina Faso to restore
the financial viability of the sector: (1) SOFITEX and Faso Coton recapitalized in 2007;
SOCOMA, the third cotton ginning company, envisages to do so during the first quarter of 2008;
(2) the domestic producer price setting mechanism was reformed to more closely align the
producer price with the international cotton price, and to broker a better commercial risk sharing
between producers and cotton companies; and (3) efforts continued to improve the productivity
of cotton production in Burkina Faso aiming at using new technology in the production of cotton
(genetically manipulated seed), reducing the transaction costs of companies (building of rural
roads) and improving the efficiency of business operation. To allow the sector to work out its
financing needs and recapitalization negotiations in 2007, the government decided to provide a
guarantee of US$100 million to the commercial banks to facilitate adequate financing of the
2007 season. 5 It is estimated that, with the new sector parameters and current positive
international cotton price developments, the cotton companies will generate a financial surplus
from the 2007/08 season.

The largest cotton company, the ex-parastatal SOFITEX, launched its recapitalization effort in
late 2006. In early 2007, its largest private investor, DAGRIS decided not to participate in the
recapitalization, the main reason being that DAGRIS, a company then held by the French State,
was in the process of being privatized and could therefore not commit to avoid prejudicing its
potential buyer. The government agreed to refinance SOFITEX by covering its shares (35
percent) and an additional 26 percent to make up for the non-subscription of DAGRIS, to meet
the 75 percent minimum capital subscription mandated by the OHADA rules, which are law in
Burkina Faso. The direct costs to the government amounted to franc CFA 35 billion to date (or 1
percent of GDP). After the recapitalization, the government share in SOFITEX was kept at 35
percent. The shares of the capital subscription forgone by the private investor DAGRIS were
temporarily taken over by the state-owned Fond Burkinabé de Développement to make the future
re-entry of a private investor easier. The government of Burkina Faso continues to pursue
private sector participation in the sector as the best way to enhance the sector's long term growth
potential and competitiveness. Thus, the government has confirmed its commitment to sell its
shares held in SOFITEX to a private investor. It is currently actively exploring foreign investor
interests with the aim to conclude the sale by end 2008.6 This position is underlined by its stance
on commercial financing mechanisms for the cotton price stabilization fund meant to
complement the reform of the cotton producer price mechanism.

Lessons from the cotton sector reform experience show that these reforms can not be limited to
discrete measures. Rather, they entail transition processes that are long and complex and require
adapted strategies and instruments and the need to continue to invest to improve productivity,
strengthen capacities and regulatory frameworks, and adopt policies aimed at agricultural
diversification. Also, this experience highlights the strengths of the reform model pursued by


5 Moral hazard from the contingent liability thus incurred by the state is limited since SOFITEX's production stocks and sales
contracts are collaterized at the request of the banking pool and fully dedicated to reimburse the campaign's credit within a year
of its disbursement. Moreover, the banking pool is granted preferential creditor status, with SOFITEX's legal obligation to repay
its loan before any other financial obligation; and by contractual obligation, SOFITEX's budget is provisioned each year for the
principal and interests due to the banking pool.

Burkina Faso (built on a highly integrated approach to cotton supply chain development,
common to the Central and West African cotton producers) as well as remaining challenges.
First, the model has generated strong returns to a very large number of farmers and has made a
substantial contribution to poverty reduction. The model's ability to provide input credit and
extension and generate high value added per capita has been particularly relevant, given the input
and credit market failures of rural Burkina Faso. The crop has also played a major role in rural
development, facilitating input supply for other crops in cotton zones and helping farmers invest
in animal traction and other equipment that improved overall farm productivity and incomes.
However, poor cost efficiency, notably in the ginning companies, has undermined this sector's
competitiveness, while rigidities in pricing systems, which have only recently been addressed,
have undermined financial sustainability. This highlighted the importance of a flexible pricing
mechanism,      building  up   the    operational   capacity    of  farmer    organizations   and
efficiency/productivity improvements at the farm and ginning companies' levels.

Economic diversification. Measures were also implemented to diversify agricultural production
and facilitate agricultural exports.     Specifically, the government (i) formulated a rural
development strategy focused on the diversification of crop production; (ii) prepared a text
consolidating and harmonizing the principles and rules of the execution of missions transferred
or delegated to regional agricultural chambers, producer professional organizations, the inter-
professions and the private sector; (iii) adopted standards and labels for oilseed products and
enacted a law on seeds to facilitate trade and transfer of technology; and (iv) adopted a
restructuring plan for the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Fisheries, in line with the
implementation of an institutional audit. Also, progress was made in the preparation of an action
plan for the promotion of poultry and meat exports (including the definition of standards, label,
conditioning, and training of professional exporters). Next, the government enhanced land
tenure security and access to land, thereby improving production conditions for small holders.
Other measures included the support of private competition in extension services and supplies to
farmers through the establishment of self governing institution for stakeholders, similar to the
cotton sector, and the building of 95 rural roads to facilitate, among others, the raising of and
trade in cattle. With respect to agricultural products, the production of sorghum, millet, corn,
and cowpea (niébé) increased by between 30 and 60 percent since 2004.

Despite sustained growth and poverty reduction achieved over the last decade, the principal
challenge for Burkina in the agriculture sector remains the improvement of productivity. The
vast majority of the rural poor continue to depend on agricultural production characterized by
low mechanization and vulnerability to rainfall variation, and most of the increased production,
notably for cotton, has taken place due to the extension of the cultivation area.         Indeed,
productivity in the cotton sector declined slightly over the three years from an average of 1,124
kg/ha to 991 kg/ha, but largely in line with the trend observed by other producers in the region.
The government's focus in agriculture has been mainly on efficiency enhancing measures, but it
has recently started efforts to identify ways and adequate technologies to boost productivity,
including though genetically changed seed for cotton. Results of these efforts will show only
gradually over the medium term.

Telecommunications. The telecommunication sector was liberalized and cell phone companies
were allowed to enter the market in 2000 which greatly helped to reduce consumer costs and



                                              - 17 -

widen services. Cellular phone subscribers increased from 239,600 in 2003 to one million in
2006 (above the targeted outcome; see Annex Table 1). The costs for communicating between
fixed and cellular lines have decreased by more than 30 percent from 2004 to 2006, remaining
slightly above the targeted cost level (Annex Table 1).        The telecommunication sector is
regulated by an independent regulatory agency ensuring interconnection with the state-owned
fixed lines under fair conditions. The reform of the sector has led to the creation of the Ministry
for Postal Services, Information Technology, and of Communication (MPTIC), which assumes
also a regulatory function. The rural telephone service was liberalized at end-2005 and the
government has requested expression of interests for private participation in this segment.

The privatization process of ONATEL, the state-owned telecommunications company, was
initially delayed because of unfavorable terms offered for the initial privatization, which
included privatization of only up to 40 percent of the capital. No bid was received at the
deadline of the bidding period. As a consequence, the government repeated the sale of ONATEL
shares. For the second tender, an outright majority (51 percent) of the shares was offered to the
new private investor. While this delayed privatization by about two years, the privatization
process was concluded successfully in late 2006 with 51 percent being sold to a foreign buyer for
CFAF 139 billion (4.0 percent of GDP)--much more than expected. The government plans to
sell in 2008 a further 20 percent of the shares in a second bidding process, and 6 percent of the
shares to ONATEL employees.

Energy. Burkina's industrial development potential is still constrained by high factor costs,
particularly for energy.   The measures supported under PRSC-4 (development of a privatization
strategy) and PRSC-5 (improving the framework for the electricity regulatory authority) aimed at
promoting private sector participation in the electricity and petroleum sectors to improve
management, increase supply and reduce production costs. In 2004, the government prepared a
reform strategy for the electricity and petroleum sectors and in 2005 it adopted a legal and
regulatory framework to introduce private participation in the energy sector and bring additional
production capacity into the power sector. It was expected that the government would issue
tender for the selection of a private operator for the management of SONABEL (the national
electric power company), as well for private participation in the capital of SONABHY (the
national petroleum product distribution company). Progress was limited to the launching of
accounting and financial audits of these two companies which are required for the privatization
bidding documents. While audits for some years are completed, other audits are still on-going,
in part due to difficulties in obtaining external funding for them. A completed set of audits is
required for the actual privatization to move ahead, which is now expected for late 2008/2009.
In addition, improvements in the regulatory framework were needed before advancing with
privatization. While the Council of Ministers adopted a draft law on the regulatory framework in
late 2004, the National Assembly did not adopt it. In early 2007 the government decided to opt
for a holding company structure for SONABEL and to seek private shareholding participation
for SONABHY. A revised law on the regulatory framework was approved by the National
Assembly in November 2007. It is expected that the regulatory authority will be established in
2009.

The government is preparing, with advice from the World Bank, a transparent electricity tariff
mechanism to ensure price adjustments in line with costs. This mechanism will draw on a tariff



                                               - 18 -

policy assessment expected to be finalized by June 2008. Since 1994 tariffs have been adjusted
only twice, in both cases during the PRSC-4 to 6 implementation period (in 2004 by 10 percent,
and in 2006 by 12.5 percent). Nonetheless, regional electricity tariffs are highest in Burkina Faso
(Table 2). Given the high petroleum import prices and at current electricity tariff levels,
SONABEL requires subsidies of about 0.7 percent of GDP that increase with electricity
consumption and are not targeted. However, in 2006 the fuel subsidy mechanism was reformed
to (i) cap the total annual subsidy to about franc CFA21 billion a year, and, (ii) create an
incentive for SONABEL to search for the most effective thermal power generation.

Contrary to other countries in the sub-region (including Ghana, Senegal, Togo, Benin, and to
some extent Mali), Burkina Faso has been able to maintain the financial viability of its power
utility, SONABEL. This is partly due to its operational performance, which is the best of the sub-
region for the key parameters: transmission and distribution losses, and revenue collection. Also,
SONABEL has maintained a disciplined approach to investment planning allowing it to expand
access aggressively without causing power shortages. Significant progress in reducing generation
costs are expected with the completion of the ongoing project to link Burkina Faso's electricity
grid to the grid in Côte d'Ivoire (scheduled for end 2008). The related cost savings will
gradually eliminate the need for subsidies.

Investment climate and labor market reform. Under PRSC-4 to 6 the government supported
private sector development by improving labor market regulations, reducing the costs and delay
for establishing a business, obtaining a building license and transferring property, and enhancing
the capacity of the justice system. Specifically, the authorities took steps, assisted by FIAS, to
improve the indicators monitored by the Doing Business reports by: (i) creating in mid 2005 the
CEFORE (Centre de Formalité des Enterprises-the Business Registration Center), a one stop
shop, in Ouagadougou and another one in the second largest city in Bobo-Dioulasso; (ii)
reducing formalities needed to register a business; (iii) strengthening the real estate
administration in urban areas to secure titles; (iv) reforming the urban code in 2006; and (v)
improving the legal framework for urban construction work.                        In the justice sector, the
government also continued to implement the National Action Plan for the Reform of Justice.
The IDA-financed PACDE has provided assistance on judicial institutional reforms (e.g.,


                                                       - 19 -

improving the operations of the commercial registry, strengthening the judicial inspection
function and setting up an arbitration court). As a result of the above measures, the cost and
delay in starting a business have been significantly reduced as evidenced by the Doing Business
relevant indicators. Future PRSC operations are expected to support further improvements.
                        7



The government also supported the strengthening of trade and business facilitation institutions,
including the Trade Point (trade information exchange) and FASANORM (advice on standards
and norms), which were both selected for best practices by the CEDEAO concerning the
development of electronic trade. It also made operational the Burkina Faso Entrepreneurs'
Center that provides business development services and established a Competitiveness
Committee, composed of public and private sector representatives, to make recommendations
and monitor progress in this area.

A new labor law was adopted in 2004 but delays were encountered in the preparation of
application decrees because of resistance from unions. PRSC-4 supported the preparation of a
comparative study on labor market laws and regulations (completed in 2006) as an input for
tripartite discussions on reform options among the employers, unions and the government. The
discussion on the application decrees was concluded in early 2007 with the adoption of 3 decrees
regulating overtime work, modalities on the implementation of the 40 hours week in non
agricultural enterprises, and the conditions for dismissals. The government wishes to further
revise the labor law by end of 2008 in order to further reduce labor market rigidities.

       Human Resource Development

Progress on human resource development was satisfactory. A rapid growth in basic education
and an improvement in health indicators were observed. However, because of the very low
initial conditions and weak administrative capacity, Burkina Faso still faces challenges for
increasing access to basic services.

In the education sector, PRSC-4 supported the implementation of the ten year basic education
development program (PDDEB) by ensuring sufficient budgetary allocations for the sector,
finalizing the transfer of responsibilities for the recruitment and assignment of teachers to the
regions, initiation of the system of sub-cycles and preparation of a draft MTEF for education.
PRSC-5 pursued these reforms, including through the finalization of a MTEF for the basic
education sector and the completion of a PER for the secondary education sector, preparation of
a study on effective teaching hours with the objective to increase them and thus improve the
quality and efficiency of education, as well as evaluating the execution of expenditure and the
availability of school material. Finally, PRSC-6 supported the finalization of a sectoral METF
for primary and lower secondary education which brought resources more in line with the
medium term sector strategy (the PDDEB) and its objectives as well as the education MDGs. It



7The number of procedures for starting a business declined from 15 in 2003 to 8 in 2006 and 6 in 2007. The number of days was
reduced from 136 in 2003 to 34 in 2006 and 18 in 2007 (see Doing Business 2004, 2007 and 2008). The improvements qualify
Burkina Faso to rank among the 5 best reformers in Africa in 2007 as assessed by the IFC.




                                                             - 20 -

also supported the updating of the ten-year education sector program (PDDEB, for 2006-10), and
the introduction of the delegation of credits to lower secondary education which enhanced
budgetary transparency and efficiency of the supply of educational services. Furthermore, under
PRSC-5 and 6 the increase in the resource envelope for education allowed the government to
continue the subsidization of schooling in the 20 provinces with the lowest school enrollment
rates. Throughout the period, the government also expanded teacher training by ending the
automatic hiring of graduates of teacher training colleges into the civil service and expanded the
number of schools equipped with running water and sanitation facilities.

Gross primary enrollment rates increased from 52.3 percent in 2003 to 66.5 percent in 2006, as
compared to the 60.2 percent targeted outcome. Access to secondary and higher education has
also increased. At the same time, gender and regional disparities have decreased. For girls, the
gross primary enrollment rate increased from 46 percent in 2003 to 61.2 in 2006, as compared to
the targeted 51.9 percent. Also, the school enrollment rate in the most disadvantaged provinces
increased substantially from 37.6 percent in 2003 to 52.4 percent in 2006, above the target of
49.1 percent. While increasing student enrollment has been successful, the quality of education
lags behind. The completion rate improved in primary education from 31.3 percent in 2003 to
36.4 percent in 2006, above the targeted 33.8 percent. The ratios impacting the quality of
education (books/pupil and pupils/teacher ratios) remained largely stagnant since 2004 but given
the rapid and significant expansion of the system maintaining the ratio can be considered a
temporary success.

Education expenditures increased as a share of the government budget from 12.1 percent of total
expenditure in 2004 to 12.4 percent in 2006, but are estimated to have declined to 10.8 percent in
2007. As a share of GDP, education expenditures increased from 2.6 percent in 2004 to 2.9
percent in 2007. Nonetheless, given the overall solid economic growth in Burkina Faso,
expenditures per capita increased by 22 percent in real terms. Weak administrative capacity in
combination with the problem to attract and retain teaching personnel for rural areas contributed
to the slowing in sectoral investment. The initiated decentralization strategy is expected to create
a framework to gradually address this constraint.

In the health sector, PRSC-4 supported measures to strengthen the linkages between health
sector objectives, budgets and monitoring of results, by taking first steps towards a sector MTEF,
establishing a framework for annual monitoring and evaluation of the national health plan
(PNDS), and by enhancing the resources available at the deconcentrated level, including health
personnel. PRSC-5 continued the emphasis on increasing the efficiency of public resource use
through the completion of the sectoral MTEF for 2005-07 which brought resources more in line
with the medium term sector strategy objectives and the MDGs.                                      It also supported the
implementation of a monitoring system for the cash advance accounts, the drafting of texts for
local committees managing the revolving drug funds to enhance community participation in
decision making, the approval of new statutes for public hospitals and the development of
performance indicators, adoption of an action plan to attract more health personnel to
underserved areas, and the launch of a study on child/youth malnutrition. Under PRSC-6, a
national social protection strategy was finalized providing a consolidated and comprehensive
framework for social risk management.

Increased resources to the health sector allowed the government to continue distribution of free
vitamin A supplements (PRSC-4), subsidization of vaccination and obstetrical emergencies
(PRSC-5 and PRSC-6) and lowering the cost of childbirth through the adoption of a decree
regulating the subsidies for obstetrical emergency care and delivery (PRSC-6). Under PRSC-5
and 6 the government rendered all preventive services at the primary health care level free of


                                                              - 22 -

charge while also offering a significant extension of public health services (health centers). The
government introduced the delegation of credits to district managers.                                         Applying a
decentralization strategy similar to the education sector empowered district managers, improved
the availability of health funding at the district level and strengthened service delivery. Under
PRSC-5 a study was conducted to review the established fee structure and service contract
system for hospitals. The revised fee structure and service contracts helped to widen access to
essential health services at acceptable costs.                   PRSC-5 also supported strengthening local
participation in the management of health centers by supporting the forming of local health
management committees, with a vote over services provided and fees charged. However,
government efforts to apply an incentive based system to enhance the mobility and geographical
range of health sector employees have not had an impact yet (similar to the education sector).
The reform required for a more adequate human resource management system and incentive
structure. This is part of the new PRSC series 7 to 9, to be implemented in the context of the
ongoing decentralization reform.

The vaccination rates for BCG remained on a high level of 110 percent coverage in 2004 to 103
percent in 2006; from 77 percent in 2003 to 91 percent in 2006 for DTCP3; from 71.6 in 2003 to
88 percent in 2006 for measles, and from 71.3 to 88 percent for yellow fever. Prices of essential
generic drugs were reduced through a cut in the profit margins of the National Drug Procurement
and Distribution Company (CAMEG) in 2002. Tracking surveys conducted as part of the PRSP
process indicate that the measure resulted in a 15-30 percent decline in the costs of standard
medical interventions. Efforts against the spread of HIV/AIDS resulted in a relatively low
prevalence rate of 2 percent in 2006, against 1.8 percent in 2004. Treatment of people living
with HIV/AIDS has exceeded government and CAS targets. The percent of health centers
satisfying minimum (personal) standards remained fairly constant with 75.2 percent in 2006.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has increased allocations to regions and health districts by 10
percent annually. Under the PRSC-4 to 6, the maternal mortality rate was targeted to increase
from 484 to 313. Similarly, the child mortality rate was targeted to be reduced from 184 to
162.7. It should be noted that information on the two indicators is obtained through the national
demographic and health survey, which is conducted every 4 to 5 years. The survey is scheduled
to be undertaken this year in Burkina Faso and will provide an update of key health indicators,
notably maternal and child mortality.

Public health expenditures increased from 7.4 in 2004 to 9.4 percent as a share of overall budget
expenditures (Table 3).8 A decline in investment occurred in 2005 by about 14 percent, followed
by a strong recovery in 2006 and 2007. As for the education sector, weak capacity and the
difficulty to attract and retain personnel explains a large part of this relative decline. It is
expected that capacity building in the regions through deepened decentralization will improve
outcomes.

With regards to the water and sanitation sector, PRSC-4 supported the preparation of a roadmap
for reaching the MDGs in the water supply and sanitation sector and a related action plan
(Programme National d'Alimentation en Eau Potable et d'Assainissement ­ PN-AEPA). The roadmap

                                                           - 23 -

required collecting comprehensive new baseline data (e.g., water users, location and amount of
rural drillings), which led to a revision of the original PRSC policy performance indicators (see
also section 1.3 and Annex 1). PRSC-5 accompanied the design of a new water management
framework to advance public-private partnerships for operating and maintaining water systems,
especially in urban and semi urban areas. The government also completed sanitation strategy
plans for four secondary cities, while the completion of the remaining six plans was delayed by
weak capacity and inadequate funding. The water sector action plan was updated in 2006 to
reflect the advances made on private sector participation in the sector and allow for adequate
forms of participation (leasing of operations ­ affirmage, and performance contracts ­ contrat
plan). DPs and the government agreed in early 2007 to support the revised water sector action
plan through a program approach based on a sector MTEF. Achievements of the targeted
indicators have been mixed, with urban areas so far benefiting more than rural areas (see Annex
1). However, the PRSC series has been instrumental in preparing for detailed measures to
improve safe water delivery in rural areas in the medium term, especially through a stock taking
exercise for rural water infrastructure and the introduced changes in the legal framework to
enhance private sector participation in water delivery.

As a result of adopting the PRSC supported roadmap toward the water and sanitation MDGs in
combination with large-scale investments in urban and rural areas and increased emphasis on
village water management and social water connection programs, access to potable water has
risen from 54 percent in 2004 to 74 percent in 2006 urban areas (as per the revised baseline
resulting from a new definition of "access to water"; Annex 1). Progress in rural areas has been
less visible during the period of this second PRSC series. Access to potable water in rural areas
increased from 60 percent in 2005 (revised baseline) to 62 percent in 2006. However, the water
sector policy reforms implemented under this series helped to lay the ground for a reasonable
outlook meeting the respective MDGs. The number of provinces reaching a coverage in safe
drinking water of at least 75 percent of households increased to 24 in 2005 (more recent data are
not available), missing the benchmark and indicating the persistent problem of widening service
coverage in rural areas. Nonetheless, Burkina is estimated to be in the position to meet the
Millennium Development Goal in this sector.

Of the three priority sectors supported by this PRSC series the water and sanitation sector
benefited most in relative terms from an increase in budget resources. The share of the sector
expenditure in total expenditures tripled from 2004 to 2006 (Table 3). However, most of the
resources available were financed by development partners. Budget execution was affected by
weak absorption and administrative capacity.

      Good Governance

The third objective of the PRSC series focused on improvements in public financial
management, public sector reform and building capacity in environmental assessment.

Budget management system.         Burkina Faso made significant progress in implementing an
ambitious reform agenda since its adoption in 2002 of a consolidated action plan to improve the
budget management system, directly supported by PRSC-4 to 6. Achievements to date include:
(i) improved alignment of budget allocation with PRSP priorities with the introduction of a



                                               - 24 -

global medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) based on program budgeting (PRSC-4); (ii)
the broadening of the MTEF to key sector ministries such as health and education (PRSC-4 to
6); (iii) enhanced budget execution with the introduction of a computerized expenditure
management system (CID) capturing all domestically financed expenditures, with functional and
social classification of expenditures in accordance with national regulation (WAEMU standards)
(PRSC-4 to 6), a revenue management system (CIR) (PRSC-4) and an accounting system
(PRSC-5; CIE, and CICL for the regions); (iv) software for combining the payroll management
(MFB) with the personnel management was first introduced in 1999 but then extended to line
ministries (PRSC-4) and to regions (PRSC-6); (v) the preparation of an inventory of government
assets (PRSC-4 and 5) as prerequisite to improved property accounting; (vi) the establishment of
a computerized system (SYGADE) to monitor external aid flows and to integrate such flows in
the budget information system (PRSC-5 and 6), with coverage progressively extended to 70
percent of total external flows; (vii) improved budget reporting and auditing through the
preparation of timely reports on budget execution and strengthening of the control mechanism
and capacity at the Audit Court (Cour des comptes); and (viii) capacity building in public
financial administration supported by various DPs, including the Bank.

These reforms have led to more transparency and accountability as budget data are now more
comprehensive, and consolidated data become available in a timely fashion (45 days after end of
the period). Since 2005, the National Assembly approves the law of the executed budget (loi de
règlement) two years after its execution (WAEMU standard), adding to transparency and
discipline of budget management through legislative oversight. The global and sector MTEFs
have improved alignment of budget allocation with PRSP priorities. About 40 percent of the
budget is now covered by program budgets according to more (health and education) or less
(justice, security, rural development) developed sector MTEFs. The government plans to further
strengthen its oversight bodies by setting up a new institution, the Higher Authority for State
Control (Autorité Supérieure de Contrôle d'Etat) integrating and coordinating the oversight
functions with a higher degree of independence. However, the lack of qualified accountants
(IGF, DCCF) and of financial resources (Cour des comptes) still constrains these institutions'
ability to fulfill their respective mandates.

Decentralization. The PRSC series also supported measures to enhance decentralization of
public service delivery by creating the legal framework and introducing related administrative
decrees, and by empowering the sub-national level through the transfer of functions, assets and
resources. In fact, decentralization emerged as an important element of this PRSC series. In
2004, the decentralization law was adopted. Under PRSC-4 texts were completed for the
application of the decentralization law, notably to define the relationship of different institutions
(elected regions and municipalities, appointed heads of deconcentrated administration, village
councils), their revenue bases and their spending authority. Under PRSC-6, the framework for
the transfer of resources and competencies to communes was finalized, notably through the
adoption of a draft law defining the resources and expenses for sub-national governments, the
definition of the accounting and financial regime for sub-national governments, the adoption of
the draft devolution decrees for effective transfers of functions and assets to urban communes,
and of a priority action plan to assist regional councils and rural communes.

Progress also included the deconcentration of the payment authority to some deconcentrated
offices at the regional level, the progressive establishment of regional civil service offices, and


                                                 - 25 -

the extension to sector ministries of the computerized civil service administration information
system (SIGASPE, PRSC-4). The targeted transfer of responsibilities and resources to local
government to finance operation expenses in health and education has been supported by the
entire PRSC series.

The adoption of the Decentralization Code in 2004 and the organization of the first full local
elections in April 2006 have sent strong signals that the government is committed to
implementing decentralization. The challenges for the government now are: (i) to ensure a
successful transition in the transfer of responsibilities and resources to the elected local bodies,
and (ii) to realign its central and deconcentrated government to accompany, not duplicate or
constrain, decentralization implementation. The adoption of a strategy for accelerating
decentralization includes four objectives: (i) improving ownership of decentralization
implementation by actors; (ii) transferring responsibilities and resources to local government;
(iii) developing capacities of local governments; and (iv) improving coordination of the process.
The most urgent measure to take would be to transfer the assets corresponding to the six areas of
responsibilities transferred at the local level, by adopting the remaining texts related to individual
asset transfers to municipalities.     The new PRSC series (PRSC-7 to 9) will support the
government in continuing to implement the decentralization strategy. Already in 2007, the
government allocated resources to regions and communities, established an Investment Fund for
local governments, and adopted a legal framework for the transfer of human resources.

Procurement reform began under the first PRSC series. PRSC-4 to 6 continued to support the
government to: (i) finalize the administrative measures to build fully on the new procurement
law of 2003 (PRSC-4); (ii) the nomination of a procurement reform committee with public sector
and civil society representatives to enhance transparency and scrutiny, the adoption of a decree
regulating concessions and leasing in line with best international practice, the development of a
computer application for the monitoring of procurement processes, and the adoption of a
regulatory text for the issuance and withdrawal of accreditation of public works (PRSC-5); and
(iii) the adoption of a procurement reform action plan based on the 2005 CPAR
recommendations (PRSC-6) with implementation expected to be supported by the third series of
PRSCs. In addition, procurement contracts have been audited regularly by the Inspection
Général des Finances (IGF) with a view to greater transparency and accountability.

Responding to rising perception of corruption, in 2005 the government adopted a national policy
and action plan for good governance, established a High Authority to Combat Corruption,
reorganized and expanded the judiciary, and, in May 2006, adopted a national policy to fight
corruption. A good governance plan was prepared and disseminated to all provincial authorities.
Most recently, the government agreed to review the institutional framework for the supreme
audit institutions and other oversight bodies to ensure sufficient independence and authority.
Recent developments are encouraging; for instance, the 2005 annual report of the Supreme Audit
Court, which denounced the mayor of Ouagadougou for serious governance weaknesses while
also highlighting weaknesses in the national procurement system, based on 2000-2001 data, was
finally issued in 2007. As a result, the case about the mayor was transferred to the judiciary, as
would be expected from a system where public accountability is well enforced.

Despite these efforts, corruption in Burkina Faso is perceived to be on the rise, which has led to a
9-point decline in the country's ranking on the Transparency International's Corruption


                                                 - 26 -

Perception Index between 2005 and 2006. Ranked 105th out of 179 countries in 2007, Burkina
Faso, nonetheless, remains among the better-ranked countries in Africa. Problems remain as
evidenced by the IDA-funded investment climate assessment, which shows bribes and informal
payments to be very high, while rules governing civil service ethics are weakly enforced and the
judicial system is considered broadly inefficient.

The significant progress made in public financial management led the government to adopt in
2007 a new Strategy to Strengthen Public Finances, broader in scope than its 2002 national
Program to Strengthen Budget Management. This new strategy helps articulate and harmonize
donor assistance around a second generation of PFM reforms, supported in particular by the third
PRSC series (7 to 9).      It aims to address remaining weaknesses identified by the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) report, including: (i) the
credibility of domestic revenue projections; (ii) access to budget information; (iii) domestic
revenue collection and budget controls; and (v) the predictability of resources and the use of
country systems by donors. In addition, the new Prime Minister has asked for Bank assistance to
tackle aggressively governance issues and a Governance and Corruption study has been launched
while the new PRSC series (7 to 9) has increased emphasis on these issues.

Concerning the environment, PRSC-4 and 5 supported increasing resources for environmental
assessments and improving guidelines and capacity to assess environmental impact of
government activities.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

PRSC-4: Satisfactory
PRSC-5: Satisfactory
PRSC-6: Satisfactory

All three of these operations are rated satisfactory. The operations' development objectives were
broadly achieved and the sustainability of the reforms implemented is likely over the medium-
term. Objectives, design, implementation and outcomes were relevant to country circumstances
and development priorities and to the Bank strategy.             The government has continued
implementation of the reforms in the context of the third series of PRSCs, with PRSC-7 having
already advanced government reforms in the relevant areas.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)  Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The measures supported by PRSC-4 to 6 had a significant positive impact on poverty reduction.
Specifically, the improvement in the investment climate contributed to sustained economic
growth. The reforms in public service provision through decentralization and institutional
strengthening broadly improved access of the poor to health, education, water and sanitation
services supporting progress towards the MDGs.            The strengthening of public financial
management enhanced efficiency, transparency and accountability in public resource use and the
country's absorption capacity for external resources. As discussed above, a number of measures
under the PRSCs focused on more effective targeting of the poor by removing financial barriers
to health and education. These included: (i) subsidization of government-controlled school fees
for primary school pupils in deprived areas (PRSC-4 to 6), (ii) reforming the exemption system


                                                - 27 -

to provide health system subsidies for the poorest (PRSC-4 to 6); and (iii) funding of maternal
delivery exemptions (PRSC-4 to 6).

In addition, there were a number of broader measures to address non-income dimensions of
poverty, also in accordance with achieving the MDGs. These include: (i) increasing resources
for education going to disadvantaged districts (PRSC-4 to 6); (ii) implementing community-
based health centers (PRSC-4 to 6); (iii) implementing a high impact rapid delivery program for
improving the under-five child mortality and maternal mortality rates (PRSC-4 to 6); (iv)
implementing a teacher retention scheme and improving the respective training (PRSC-4 to 6).
Drawing from the findings of the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Report,9 PRSC-5 supported
the introduction of social protection measures (OVC). All of these measures were especially
targeted at the most disadvantaged regions in order to address regional disparities in poverty.
The positive outcomes are detailed above in section 3.2.

The findings of the Poverty Assessment with regard to the trade-off between growth, poverty and
inequality provided additional rationale for the PRSC-5 and 6 to focus on a growth path driven
by improved productivity in the rural and cotton sector, and broader private sector participation
in the secondary and tertiary sectors, including in the utilities sector. Indeed, the assessment
shows that growth has a significant impact on poverty (with a one percent growth resulting in a 2
percent decline in the poverty gap) and that the growth-inequality trade-off is fairly small in
Burkina Faso (a 1 percent increase in inequality would need to be compensated by about 1.4-1.5
percent more growth, and by about 0.8-1.1 percent in rural areas). The assessment also shows
that the MDG target of halving poverty by 2015 could be achieved under a growth scenario of
about 5 percent.        Variations to the baseline scenario show the importance of cotton and
agricultural production for accelerating poverty reduction. A 20 percent increase in the level of
cotton production would give rise to a 4 percentage point decline in the poverty headcount. A 20
percent increase in the level of non-tradable agricultural production would reduce the poverty
headcount by about 9 percentage points by 2015 and reduce inequality as additional income
would have been created for a larger share of the population. Finally, a growth scenario with the
same overall growth rates but a different composition--a larger contribution from the primary
sector--reaffirms the previous findings, namely that participation of the rural population in
growth is crucial for accelerating poverty reduction and reducing inequality.

With inputs from a Bank supported work on gender-responsive budget outreach, seeking a
dialogue with civil society and other partners, a gender-responsive budget actions plan has been
prepared. An important topic of this plan is the strengthening of the real estate law (droit
foncier) in rural areas with a view to ascertain the rights and titles/deeds of women within
families in support of their economic activities.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of the reform measures implemented under this PRSC
series was substantial. Several of these measures represented important institutional innovations
(e.g., cotton sector reform, decentralization and trade and agricultural institutions).       Many

measures also contained elements of capacity building and systems strengthening. For instance,
the global and sector MTEFs greatly contributed to improved alignment of budget allocation
with PRSP priorities; also, the PRSC series supported the reform of budget information systems,
deconcentration of budgetary processes and public procurement reform.                           These efforts are
complemented by support provided for capacity and institution building by the IDA-funded
Public Administration Capacity Building project. The PRSC, as part of the CGAB process, has
also strengthened the ability of the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) to champion and
coordinate the design and implementation of critical reforms, as well as the national budget
management reforms and key reforms touching the private sector. The role of the MFB in the
reform process was furthermore supported by the enhanced predictability of budget support,
reaching 99 percent according to a recent OECD report.10

(c)  Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not known at this stage.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N.A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

PRSC-4: moderate
PRSC-5: moderate
PRSC-6: moderate

Several considerations weigh positively on the assessment of risk to the development outcomes
of PRSC-4, 5 and 6. First, the government's sustained track record of sound macroeconomic
performance, even against severe external shocks, represents a critical element for continued
economic growth and poverty reduction. Also, donor commitment remains strong, which augurs
well for sustained inflows of external assistance. In addition, the institutional strengthening
occurred under the PRSCs series is expected to contribute to the sustainability of the
development outcomes. The increasing involvement of civil society in the PRSP process, the
growing use of participatory M&E, and the increased harmonization and alignment of donors
around the PRSP priorities make sustainability of the development outcomes achieved more
likely. Implementation of successor operations (PRSC-7 to 9), and continuation of the CGAB
framework will help sustain and advance the development outcomes achieved under PRSC 4-6.

Notwithstanding these favorable elements, several factors remain that could jeopardize the
sustainability of development outcomes. First, Burkina Faso remains vulnerable to commodity
price (cotton, gold and oil) and real exchange rate fluctuations.                           High oil prices drain
international reserves and increase petrochemical, electricity and transportation costs with
adverse impact on the overall economy. Lower cotton prices on international markets hurt the
country's economic and fiscal performance, and negatively affect about two and a half million
persons in rural areas, where most of the poor live. The continued appreciation of the franc CFA

against the dollar would put additional pressure on the country's competitiveness, notably for
cotton exports.    The government is implementing a three-pronged approach to address its
vulnerability to external shocks, including: (i) lowering energy costs by connecting with lower-
cost regional producers and opening the electricity and petroleum sectors to private management
and investment; (ii) revising the cotton producer price-setting mechanism to ensure adequate
pass-through of world price trends and better risk sharing between producers and ginning
companies, as well as enhancing productivity and competitiveness of the cotton sector; and (iii)
supporting economic diversification through reform of the investment climate and promotion of
mining and irrigated agriculture. The government is accompanied in these reform efforts by the
third series of PRSCs, other IDA operations, the recently approved IMF PRGF and support from
a range of other development partners.

Second, lack of private sector interest could undermine ongoing reforms to restore the financial
viability and improve the competitiveness of the cotton sector. The government considers its
current increased involvement in the sector as transitory and necessary in the face of the severe
exogenous shock, and is committed to maintain a majority private participation in the sector to
enhance its growth potential and competitiveness. The various measures already implemented
(the recapitalization of the cotton companies and the revision of the cotton price mechanism) as
well as the planned independent financial and operational audit of SOFITEX for 2004-07, the
reduction in SOFITEX' operating costs and other ongoing and planned measures to enhance the
productivity and competitiveness of cotton producers and companies, will improve the sector's
growth potential and its attractiveness for private investment. The newly established fond de
lissage could enhance private interests in the sector as the fond potentially mitigates market risks.
However, to ensure sustainability of the fond and to provide for only market conducive
incentives in its operations, the fond's use needs to be strictly limited to the smoothing of price
volatility. Such is likely to require application of strict commercial conditions and transparent
governance for its operations. In addition, the reformed cotton producer price-setting mechanism
and the fond's operating mechanism would need to be closely coordinated to ensure
compatibility without distorting the desired market-conducive incentives embedded in this
overall institutional set-up for the sector.

Third, the implementation of the decentralization strategy poses significant challenges. Officials
working at the center may resist the transfer of responsibilities to local governments, while local
governments may not have sufficient resources and capacity to carry out their new
responsibilities. To address these challenges, the government has adopted a participatory and
gradual decentralization approach that should ensure stakeholder consensus on major issues and
fiscal sustainability over time. Several donors support decentralization in Burkina, including
IDA through several operations, most notably the Public Administration Capacity Building
Project, the Community-based Rural Development Project, and the planned Decentralized Urban
Capacity Building Project.

Fourth, risks stemming from regional political instability remain. Since 1999, the political and
security context in neighboring Côte d'Ivoire has negatively affected trade and transport routes,
worker remittances, and government revenues in Burkina Faso. However, the economy has
adjusted to this shock by opening new trade routes to Benin, Togo and Ghana. Also, Burkina




                                               - 30 -

Faso's mediating role in the conflict contributed to the recent peace agreement among opposing
parties in Côte d'Ivoire.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

PRSC-4: satisfactory
PRSC-5: satisfactory
PRSC-6: satisfactory

The identification and design of the PRSCs built on the overall program outlined in Burkina
Faso's poverty reduction strategy as well as the CAS. The reform program underpinning the
PRSCs is based on a solid body of Bank analytical work and related work by government and
other aid agencies.11 Lessons learned from previous PRSCs were factored in the design of
subsequent PRSCs.

As indicated above, the Bank team worked closely with the government and with other donors
(notably those in the CGAB), as documented in the program documents, during preparation and
appraisal of the operations. This allowed the Bank to increasingly harmonize and coordinate its
support with the assistance provided by other donors in the areas covered by this PRSC series.
Specifically, during preparation of PRSC-5, development partners formed the CGAB, an
important step in deepening the harmonization of donor practices through the alignment of
policy advice and support for reforms, mission schedules and timing of future assessment
reviews. In addition, the appraisal mission for PRSC-6 was carried out during the joint 2006
CGAB supervisory missions in February 2006, ensuring close coordination with the Burkina's
development partners. This joint work further deepened the cooperation among donors, thereby
ensuring a strong alignment of reform programs for 2006. Also, the Bank exchanged regularly
with the IMF team, including through joint mission work. PRSC-6 appropriately included a
specification of future program measures and indicators (PRSC-7 triggers) to lay out future Bank
collaboration under PRSCs but did not specify a new three-year program to align the new series
fully with the revised PRSP and give sufficient space for donor harmonization.

Appraisals appropriately assessed and confirmed the implementation of key reform measures and
recognized the most likely risks. The changes in PRSCs leadership were adequately addressed
and did not disrupt team continuity. Several members of the team remained the same throughout
this series and into the next one, assuring continuity and consistency in the dialogue with the

FIAS (FY04) and an Investment Climate Assessment (FY06), a labor market study (FY06), a Gender Assessment (FY04), and a
study on pro-poor growth, jointly conducted with several other DPs. In late 2005, the Bank also carried out technical missions to
support the design of the decentralization reform and a social protection strategy. A PER (FY04), a CPAR (FY05) and an
Accountability Assessment and Action Plan (AAP, FY05) on the tracking of poverty expenditure under the HIPC Initiative
assisted the government in designing and implementing its 2002 Program to Strengthen Budget Management.

Ouagadougou, including a locally based economist who played an active role in the three
operations and then became the team leader for PRSC-7.

The Bank and the Borrower worked closely to review the Borrower readiness for addressing
potential environmental impacts of the PRSCs programs, and devise ways to strengthen the
Borrower's capacity to address environmental safeguard issues. PRSC-6 was classified as a
structural adjustment credit and, accordingly, the appraisal mission reviewed Burkina Faso's
environmental policies and practices to confirm that there were no negative linkages between the
reforms proposed under PRSC-6 and environmental outcomes as well as identifying priority
measures that can be supported by future PRSCs.

PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 were classified as sectoral adjustment credits (SECACs) at the concept
stage by the Bank-wide PRSC Working Group, based on their sectoral coverage. In accordance
with OP 4.01 "Environmental Assessment", the operations were classified as Category B and
built on PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 environmental analyses conducted for health, education and rural
development. Environmental analyses consistent with the requirements of OD 8.60 and OP 4.01
were undertaken and annexed to the Program Documents. In accordance with the Bank's revised
disclosure policy, the environmental analyses were disclosed through the World Bank InfoShop,
and in Burkina Faso prior to the appraisal of the credit.

(b) Bank Supervision

PRSC-4: satisfactory
PRSC-5: satisfactory
PRSC-6: satisfactory

Bank supervision performance is rated satisfactory. Supervision of progress under each PRSC
took place jointly with the preparation of the follow-on operation, and the monitoring of PRSP
implementation in general. Supervision missions included an appropriate mix of staff relevant to
the policy areas of each PRSCs. The supervision of the PRSCs drew on the M&E mechanisms
put in place by the authorities for the broader PRSP, including annual progress report on the
implementation of the PRSP (PRSP-PR) and related IMF-Bank Joint Staff Assessment/Advisory
Notes (JSANs). During supervision activities, Bank staff coordinated closely with IMF missions
and other donors. Following the set up of the CGAB, supervision of PRSC-5 and PRSC-6 took
place increasingly through joint CGAB missions.          In this respect, monitoring of program
implementation benefited from the evolving standardized reports produced under the reporting
requirements of the CGAB framework. In addition, the Bank joined the IMF in carrying out
regular reviews of the macroeconomic framework. The preparation of selected analytical work,
including a Public Expenditure Review (completed in June 2004) and a Poverty Assessment
(completed in July 2004), was also an integral part of measuring progress in the implementation
of the PRSP and the effectiveness of PRSC support.

As Bank performance for both quality at entry and supervision was rated satisfactory, overall
Bank performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the ICRR harmonized evaluation
criteria guidelines.


5.2 Borrower Performance

PRSC-4: satisfactory
PRSC-5: satisfactory
PRSC-6: satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. Government contribution to the preparation
of the PRSCs starts with the finalization of the June 2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and the November 2004 second PRSP. Reviewing these PRSPs (IDA Report No.
31749-BF), IMF and Bank staffs concluded that they presented clear objectives, which are set
within a coherent program of poverty reduction, and are grounded in a sound assessment of
poverty characteristics and trends in Burkina Faso. The preparation of these PRSPs involved
numerous participatory events and processes. Stakeholders such as Ministers, civil servants,
parliamentarians, civil society groups, representatives of the media, and donors had opportunities
to contribute to the analytical building blocks of the PRSP, including discussions and decisions
on sectoral strategies, the study of growth and competitiveness and public expenditure reviews.
The strategy set out in these PRSPs is consistent with Burkina Faso's macroeconomic, structural,
and social policies. The government has also regularly monitored and updated its poverty
strategy, as evidenced by the annual preparation of PRSP progress reports. The high quality of
these PRSPs provided a solid basis for the preparation of PRSC-4 to 6.

The government was fully committed to the PRSC-supported program measures, as evidenced
by its track record of policy implementation. The government response to the worsening
external economic conditions was notable. Despite significant terms of trade shocks and the
severe disruptions of trade due to the continued crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, macroeconomic stability
was maintained and implementation of the program continued. In addition, the M&E framework
and government capacity improved throughout the series and the government increasingly
incorporated M&E data and outcomes into its own decision-making process, especially in the
context of its work on the PAP and its alignment with budget programming. Government's
strong ownership of the development program supported by the PRSCs has also been recognized
in the mid-term review of the 2005 CAS.

Government officials have indicated that the greater ownership fostered by the PRSP framework
and its implementation, including the support provided by this PRSC series, has sharpened their
focus on setting priorities and strengthening intra-government coordination.           Similarly,
government officials have noted that the need to identify policy targets and monitor outcomes
has increased their commitment to reform design and implementation. Government relations
with the CGAB and PRSP partners continue to be excellent, setting the stage for subsequent
operations.

The Secretary of the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Programs and
Policies (SP-PPF) at the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) coordinated all relevant
government agencies and departments in the definition of the time-bound action plan to


                                              - 33 -

implement the PRSCs' prior actions. The SP-PPF has developed into an effective agency for
coordinating and monitoring PRSP implementation, leading the dialogue with the CGAB
members and the donor community, and coordinating PRSCs implementation progress.
Implementing agencies in different ministries were generally effective. As indicated in section 2,
a deeper and earlier exchange of line ministries with the SP-PPF would have helped at times to
avoid delays in coordinating sectoral activities under this PRSC series.


6. Lessons Learned

Key lessons drawn from the implementation of PRSC-4 to 6 are detailed below. These lessons
have been reflected in the design of the third PRSC series.

Country ownership. The use of the PRSC instrument to support implementation of the poverty
reduction strategy has contributed to strengthen country ownership. Specifically, this PRSC
series greatly reinforced the importance of the budget and the country's own capacity for the
success of government policies. PRSC-4 to 6 continued to strengthen the focus on the budget as
the main instrument for PRSP implementation and contributed to clarifying the government's
own role in defining a programmatic agenda to achieve its objectives. The importance of the
MTEF in formulating the government's budget grew substantially. Moreover, expenditure
systems and controls were reinforced. In the social sectors, the PRSCs continued the process of
reorientation to program budgets started under the first PRSC series as tools to translate priorities
expressed in long-term sectoral programs into budgetary allocations.           However, a further
reinforcement of capacity is necessary to underpin this process and ensure that program budgets
are closely aligned with the executed administrative budget and fully integrated in the evaluation
and monitoring mechanism of each ministry's planning department.

Harmonization of budget support among donors. The creation of the CGAB and its unified
framework for budget support and joint performance matrix provided an effective framework to
harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Burkina Faso's development partners, including this PRSC
series, with the government's own strategy. In particular, it allowed for early entry points in the
policy dialogue with the government and the identification of corrective measures or solution to
implementation bottlenecks. It also allowed for all actors to make good use of analytical work.
Furthermore, close and continuous dialogue with the government allowed CGAB members to
better understand the constraints on the reform process and build government ownership. This
was particularly relevant for some complex reform areas, like cotton, decentralization,
privatization and the reduction of factor costs. To further improve donor harmonization, the
government and IDA plan to further align the calendar of PRSCs preparation with the budget
cycle and CGAB annual reviews. This would result in PRSC-8 being presented to the Board in
less than 12 months from PRSC-7 approval.

Primacy of the cotton sector. Recent developments in the cotton sector have highlighted the
importance of the sector for the country's macroeconomic stability and growth, the need to
adjust the government strategy in the cotton sector to reflect recent exogenous shocks and the
importance of continued Bank involvement in this sector. The increased focus of the third PRSC
series on reforms in the cotton sector reflects the need to flexibly adjust the strategic orientation
and emphasis of the PRSCs. The lessons drawn from the experience with cotton sector reform



                                               - 34 -

also show the need to broaden the analysis of the risks inherent in the development of this sector.
While important sector reforms during 1999-2005 contributed to a significant increase in cotton
production and exports, these reforms took place against increasingly difficult market conditions
for cotton which caused substantial financial difficulties for the cotton companies in Burkina and
put the sector under financial stress. This required a renewed government involvement to
stabilize the sector over the short term and additional reforms to enhance productivity and
competitiveness of cotton producers and companies. As an input into the design of PRSC-8 and
9, a detailed review of the cotton sector challenges and prospects is being undertaken as part of
an ongoing Country Economic Memorandum. This review benefits from a broader comparative
study of cotton sector reforms and systems in African countries which has recently been
completed.

Reinforcing capacity.      While gradually improving, the capacity of the administration to
formulate and execute programs remains weak and points to the need for continued technical
assistance from the Bank and other donors in the PRSC areas.                The preparation and
implementation of program budgets can only advance further if the capacity of the civil service
is improved. In this respect, the Bank prepared a PER in FY04 to give advice for further
improvements in the budget process, especially with regard to integrating the budget and PRSP
processes and objectives. A new PER is planned for FY09 to take stock of recent progress and
identify further needed public financial management reforms. In addition, the IDA-financed
capacity building project is providing technical assistance for capacity assessment, streamlining
public administration, modernizing personnel management, strengthening the poverty focus of
expenditure and policy formulation.      In the statistical area, the Bank finances a statistical
capacity building credit (STATCAP). As indicated in section 3.1, the Bank continues to provide
technical assistance and analytical underpinning for the reforms supported by this and the next
PRSC series.

Improving the link between policy actions and the M&E framework. The link between
PRSC measures and the PRSP impact indicators has been gradually strengthened as a result of
government's increased efforts to improve the monitoring framework of PRSP II. In developing
this PRSP, the government more closely integrated objectives with government policies by
preparing a matrix of costed policy actions and intermediate outputs that are linked with PRSP
outcome and impact indicators. The PRSCs drew on this work. In addition, the CGAB and its
joint performance matrix further contributed to increase the focus on evidence-based policy
making and facilitated monitoring of the PRSC series implementation for the government and
the Bank. The M&E framework for the next series of PRSCs could gradually increase its focus
on qualitative improvements (such as efficiency for basic services and agricultural productivity)
as well as further streamline the coverage of outcome indicators. Furthermore, a focused policy
matrix, including priority measures central to the operation, is recommended to ensure a
manageable policy dialogue and success of implementation.

The focus of reforms. The PRSCs were an effective instrument to support a number of cross-
cutting reforms. These included the application of deconcentration policies in budget and
personnel management, which are part of the policies to improve social service delivery. In
addition, the improvement of PRSC-related sectoral dialogue has been achieved through the
development of sectoral MTEF for the health (PRSC-5) and education (PRSC-6) sectors.

       7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1. Comments on Issues Raised By the Borrower (see also annex 5)

The Borrower has evaluated its experience with the second series in a written note (see Annex 5).
While expressing satisfaction with the support provided by the series, the borrower points to the
need to continue to listen carefully to the Government in the context of defining policy actions
for triggers, so as to ensure ownership, realism and feasibility. The Bank agrees that keeping an
open dialogue with a high level of trust between parties is essential to the continuation of
successful budget support. The borrower also notes that the implementation of projects
supporting actions underpinning the second PRSC series could have been more timely. In
particular, the Administrative Capacity Building project (PRCA) and the Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development project (PACDE) are referred to under which demanding and complex
administrative procedures affected the sequencing of the reform processes and led to
implementation delays. Also, greater efforts by the Bank to coordinate with other partners within
the given framework for budget support (CGAB) were seen as critical.

The Bank agrees that the implementation of the PRCA was not as timely as expected. PRCA
relies on the various supported ministries and institutions to define their capacity building and
other needs for implementing the medium term public finance reform program (SRFP), as laid
out in their respective annual reform implementation plans. This approach, which favors the
internal decision making process of each involved institution proved time consuming. However,
it was chosen to ensure maximum ownership on the part of participants. Activities under PACDE
included a number of privatizations and analytical work underpinning sector reforms, such as in
electricity for example. Key elements of the project required complex domestic discussions to
consolidate ownership of the reform process. In the case of utility privatization, the pace of
reform was also affected by unsuccessful privatization attempts in neighboring countries. The
Bank recognizes the need to better ensure that supporting activities managed in the context of
projects are implemented at a speed and rhythm consistent with the calendar set for reforms.

Government enjoins the Bank to enhance coordination with the CGAB further. The Bank has
made considerable efforts since PRSC 5 to harmonize its preparation calendar with the CGAB
calendar (see also box 2, page 26, of the PRSC 7 project document, Report-no. 380008-BF).
Concerning the definition of policy actions against which PRSCs are disbursed, the Bank has
made visible efforts to reduce the quantity and complexity of PRSC triggers since PRSC 4 to
focus on key reforms only. The increasing alignment of PRSC conditionality with PRSP (PAP)
measures and the highly coordinated policy performance matrix supported by the CGAB should
help foster further harmonization.


7.2 Comments on issues raised by the development partners (CGAB; see also Annex 6)

The CGAB comments focus on ambitious budget process reforms (program budgeting), revenue
enhancing measures, and equity questions.

The CGAB comments point to the risks and costs of implementing program budgeting in parallel
with sector MTEFs, in addition to the general MTEF. The Bank agrees that due to weak



                                               - 36 -

administrative capacity the policy objective to implement program budgeting by 2011 to better
link budget resources and the PRSP remains very ambitious. Introducing small changes in the
functional budget classification would harmonize budgeting approaches across ministries, reduce
transaction cost, and constitute a first step toward the overall goal.

The general concern raised by the CGAB regarding the need to improve the fiscal revenue
outcome in Burkina Faso is shared by the Bank. While the IMF is in the lead on this question, all
development partners are called upon to support the IMF's work in this area, especially through
the provision of technical assistance and possible additional advice. Although the recent stagnant
trend in revenue performance has been largely caused by the economic problems faced by the
cotton sector, the Bank supports the call for improved revenue administration.

The contribution of the PRSC-4 to 6 series to improved equity has been largely through its
growth supporting measures, especially those supporting efficiency gains in the cotton sector and
those aiming at reducing factor costs through liberalization of (factor) markets (energy,
telecommunications). The 2005 poverty assessment shows that growth has a significant impact
on poverty and that the growth-inequality trade-off is fairly small, and even smaller in rural areas
(see page 28 and the report "Burkina Faso: Reducing Poverty Through Sustained Equitable
Growth", report-no. 29743-BUR) Once poverty outcome data of the 2007 census become
available, future evaluations of the series would be in the position to also analyze the poverty
impact of specific measures.

This ICR does not evaluate the reliability and regular updating of poverty indicators, although
the Bank agrees that strengthening government capacity in this area is a continuous concern.
Many efforts are being made to produce data that is reliable, timely, and of good quality.
Improvements in methodology of calculating poverty statistics are desirable.

     I- INTRODUCTION
    La première génération de Crédits d'appui à la stratégie de réduction de la
pauvreté (CASRP 1 à 3) de l'IDA a soutenu des réformes déterminantes dans tous
les quatre piliers du Cadre stratégique de lutte contre la pauvreté (CSLP), pour
offrir des bases solides pour la fourniture par l'Etat de services publics de qualité
aux usagers dans tous les domaines. Dans le rapport d'achèvement de cette
première série de CASRP, le gouvernement a manifesté sa satisfaction pour la
grande flexibilité de l'instrument, qui permet notamment, sur la base d'actions
« déclencheurs » un appui continu sur le long terme, une avancée des réformes à
un rythme variable selon les secteurs et la capacité du gouvernement.

    D'une manière générale, la principale force du CASRP réside dans sa recherche
permanente d'une cohérence entre les mesures soutenues avec les objectifs et plans
d'actions des politiques nationales. Cette démarche a contribué à renforcer son
appropriation progressive par les ministères sectoriels et favorisé la mise en oeuvre
des mesures. Ce résultat a pu être atteint grâce à une patience remarquable de
l'équipe macro économique de l'IDA en charge du Burkina et de la volonté des
acteurs au niveau national, notamment au sein du ministère chargé des finances,
d'oeuvre à une véritable appropriation par les acteurs de l'administration de ce
puissant outil de financement du programme de lutte contre la pauvreté.

    Cependant, le gouvernement avait relevé des facteurs limitant à l'instrument de
se développer rapidement, au nombre desquels :
       - sa faible acceptation (voire son rejet) par certains acteurs déterminants
          tant au sein du gouvernement (ministères sectoriels) que dans les services
          de la banque (sectoriels) ;
       - la faiblesse des capacités humaines et matérielles de l'administration
       - la faiblesse de l'appareil statistique national, qui rend difficile l'accès aux
          statistiques et indicateurs requis pour apprécier les résultats ;
    Dans ce contexte, il a souhaité que les prochaines séries de crédits de l'espèce
prennent en compte ces facteurs dans le design des mesures et actions afin
d'appuyer le renforcement des capacités et consolider les acquis obtenus.

    Le rapport d'achèvement de la première série ayant coïncidé également avec la
mise en place du Cadre général d'organisation des appuis budgétaires en soutien à
la mis en oeuvre du CSLP (CGAB-CSLP), il a été fortement recommandé à l'IDA
de veiller à assurer une cohérence et une coordination de ses futurs programmes
d'aide budgétaire avec les orientations du CGAB-CSLP auquel il était partie
prenante.

     II - QUELQUES RESULTATS SIGNIFICATIFS DE LA
     DEUXIEME SERIE DE CASRP


    Les CASRP 4 à 6 ont permis de consolider les progrès en matière de gestion
budgétaire et de renforcer l'obligation de rendre compte.
    Dans les domaines de la programmation et d'exécution budgétaires,             les
CASRP de la seconde série ont appuyé l'extension des CDMT à des ministères des
secteurs prioritaires que sont l'éducation et la santé, et la mise en oeuvre de la
déconcentration de l'ordonnancement au niveau régional qui a permis d'améliorer
sensiblement la mise en oeuvre du mécanisme de délégation de crédits. Engagé en
2003 avec le site pilote de Bobo Dioulasso, la déconcentration de l'exécution
budgétaire est effective actuellement dans dix régions et couvrira d'ici fin 2008
l'ensemble des treize régions du pays.

    L'obligation   de    rendre   compte    est  rentrée  dans   les  habitudes    de
l'administration financière qui respecte désormais les prescriptions de l'UEMOA
en matière de production de comptes publics et de projets de lois de règlements,
donnant ainsi à la Cour des comptes de la matière pour exercer sa mission d'audit
des finances publiques. Le rôle de cette institution supérieure de contrôle des
finances publiques s'est renforcé grâce notamment aux mesures soutenues par les
premiers CASRP avec notamment l'élaboration et la mise en oeuvre d'un plan
d'actions pour son opérationnalisation dès 2002.

    L'amélioration de la gestion budgétaire a eu un impact sur les résultats dans les
secteurs sociaux de base, domaines par où le rôle de l'Etat est essentiel pour la vie
nationale. En particulier, l'effort budgétaire en faveur de l'éducation de base et de
la santé est resté soutenu, ce qui a permis d'améliorer de manière sensible les
indicateurs dans ces deux secteurs.


III- APPRECIATION DE LA SECONDE SERIE DES CASRP
    Cette appréciation est faite en se référant aux préoccupations exprimées ci-
dessus lors le l'évaluation de la première série de CASRP, avec éventuellement une
ouverture les nouvelles préoccupations qui ont émergé en cours d'exécution.

       1- Il est heureux de relever que le CASRP est aujourd'hui mieux compris au
sein de l'administration, quand bien même l'effort doit être poursuivi pour
convaincre davantage d'acteurs qui marquent encore des préférences pour les
projets sans justification valable. Le CASRP est un appui direct au budget et
comme tel, ne s'accommode pas des lourdeurs qui caractérisent la supervision des
projets (sectoriels), quand bien même il peut s'appuyer sur des mesures de type
sectoriel. Il y a un impératif à travailler à une véritable convergence des acteurs
macro et sectoriels sur les objectifs recherchés à travers le CASRP, instrument qui
                                       - 64 -

doit conserver toute la flexibilité qui fait sa force par rapport aux autres canaux de
délivrance de l'aide. Cependant l'on note un changement progressif d'attitude sur
ce point, avec l'organisation régulière des semaines de la banque à Ouagadougou
associant l'ensemble des intervenants de l'institution dans la mise en oeuvre de la
stratégie d'assistance pays.
       2- La Banque a pris en compte le besoin de renforcement de capacités qui
constitue une forte contrainte à la mise en oeuvre des programmes, en mettant en
place le Programme d'appui au renforcement des capacités de l'administration
(PRCA) pour accompagner le gouvernement dans ce domaine crucial. Toutefois,
les modalités d'intervention de ce programme devraient à notre avis être
améliorées pour accroître son impact sur la conduite des programmes d'actions
sectoriel qu'il soutient, la mise en oeuvre de certaines actions constituant des
critères de mobilisation d'appuis budgétaires.
       3- dans le même ordre d'idées, les délais de réalisation de certaines actions
phares (stratégiques) retenues dans la matrice de performance et de décaissement
du CGAB-CSLP se sont souvent révélés difficiles à respecter parce que leur
réalisation dépendent de financements de projets de la Banque dont les procédures
requièrent souvent des avis de non objection qui ne sont pas toujours délivrés à
temps par les chargés de projet. Cela occasionne souvent des retards dans la
conduite de nombreuses réformes clé (réformes dans les secteurs des
télécommunications, de l'énergie, stratégie de promotion des exportations, etc.).
Afin de remédier à ces situations déplorables et accroître les performances du
portefeuille, une plus grande responsabilisation de la mission résidente pourrait
être envisagée si des spécialistes du secteur y sont disponibles.
       4- Un effort de renforcement du système national de statistique est en cours
avec l'appui de la Banque, mais les résultats nous paraissent trop lents au regard
des nombreuses et fortes attentes dans ce domaine. Il conviendrait de réfléchir à
des mesures à impact rapide susceptible d'améliorer la production des statistiques
essentielles telles que l'indice des prix à la consommation, l'indice de la production
industrielle, l'indice du commerce intérieur, etc. ces mesures à impact immédiat
peuvent être conduite concomitamment avec celle de plus long terme comme les
formations et l'amélioration du cadre de travail des statisticiens, qui semblent à
notre avis, privilégié dans le programme.
       5- Il faut une plus grande écoute de la part des équipes de la Banque vis-à-
vis des interlocuteurs nationaux pour augmenter le taux de réussite des
programmes ou, en d'autres termes, en accroître l'impact. En effet, les acteurs
nationaux qui sont au coeur de la mise en oeuvre sur le terrain des programmes sont
mieux à même d'anticiper les difficultés d'exécution ou l'impact prévisible des
actions envisagées. Les problèmes d'exécution et les incompréhensions quelquefois
rencontrées découlent souvent d'une non prise en compte suffisante des avis de la
partie nationale relatifs aux problèmes prévisibles de l'application de certaines
mesures. Cela peut refléter également quelquefois un problème de coordination au

                                        - 65 -

sein des équipes macro et sectorielles de l'IDA, qui induit une incohérence entre
les actions préconisées de part et d'autre.
        6- La Banque doit faire l'effort :
        - d'une part, de mieux coordonner le processus du CASRP avec le processus
CGAB-CSLP afin d'éviter les difficultés avec les autres partenaires membres du
groupe ; En effet, ces derniers perçoivent la préparation du CASRP comme un
processus parallèle alors que la Banque est partie prenante au CGAB-CSLP.;Dans
l'idéal, l'identification des mesures devrait être effectuée assez tôt pour permettre
des discussions approfondies avec les secteurs concernés dans le cadre des
réunions préparatoires de la revue annuelle du programme d'actions prioritaires du
CSLP par les commissions sectorielles et thématiques du dispositif de pilotage du
CSLP.
        - d'autre part éviter, dans le choix de ses déclencheurs, des mesures dont la
mise en oeuvre échappe à la maîtrise totale du gouvernement, quand bien même de
telles mesures peuvent être suivies parce qu'essentielles pour la réalisation des
objectifs globaux poursuivis. Le gouvernement peut travailler à encourager les
autres partenaires à mener des réformes sensibles, mais ne peut pas toujours influer
sur le rythme de la mise en oeuvre de celles-ci s'il n'en est pas le maître du jeu.
        Nonobstant ces remarques, la partie nationale est tout à fait satisfaite de
l'appui des programmes soutenus par la seconde série de CASRP qui ont permis de
consolider les acquis obtenus antérieurement (programmation et exécution du
budget, délivrance des services publics sociaux de base, etc.) et de jeter les bases
pour avancer dans d'autres domaines prioritaires comme la décentralisation, la
compétitivité, promotion du secteur privé). Les résultats obtenus sont certes
remarquables, mais des défis importants restent à relever pour l'atteinte des
objectifs du millénaire pour développement (OMD), exigeant une intensification
des efforts et, surtout, la recherche d'une meilleure efficacité dans l'utilisation des
ressources. Ces aspects sont inscrits dans les priorités des programmes d'actions
prioritaires du CSLP et de la stratégie de renforcement des finances publiques,
lesquels bénéficient d'un soutien de la troisième série de CASRP en cours.

I- INTRODUCTION

The first IDA generation of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC 1 to 3)
supported decisive reforms in all four pillars of the Strategic Framework of Poverty
Reduction (PRSP), in order to build a solid base for the supply of quality public
services to users by the government, in all areas. In the first PRSC series' completion
report, the government expressed its satisfaction for the great flexibility of the
instrument, which allows ­particularly on the basis of "triggers"- the provision of
continuous support in the long term, as well as to move forward with reforms at a
variable pace, according to sectors' and the government's capacity.

Generally, the PRSC's main strength lies in its permanent search for coherence between
the type of measures supported, and the national policies objectives and action plans.
This approach contributed to progressive ownership of the PRSC by line ministries and
facilitated the implementation of (agreed) measures. Results were reached thanks to the
remarkable patience of the IDA macroeconomic team in charge of Burkina Faso, and
(thanks) to the good will of the actors at the national level, in particular within the
Ministry of Finance, who have strived for true ownership by government administration
officials of this powerful financing tool in the fight against poverty.

However, the government has noted that some factors are preventing the instrument to
be used efficiently, such as:

-       its weak acceptance (even its rejection) by some key actors within the
        government (in line ministries) and Bank services (sectoral);

-       the administration's weakness in terms of human and material resources;

-       the national statistical service's weakness, which makes it difficult to access
        statistics and indicators, necessary to assess the results.

In this context, the government is hoping that the next series of credits will take into
account these factors, particularly in relation to the measures and actions designed to
support capacity building, and consolidate achievements.

Since the completion report of the first series also coincided with the implementation of
the General Framework for Budget Support (CGAB) for the implementation of the
PRSP, IDA was strongly advised to ensure coherence and coordination of its future
budgetary assistance with CGAB orientations.

II - SOME SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND PRSC
SERIES

The PRSC-4 to 6 made it possible to consolidate progress with regard to budget
management and the strengthening of accountability.

With regard to budget programming and execution, the second PRSC series supported
the extension of the MTEF to priority sectors ministries (education and health), and


                                           - 68 -

allowed to proceed with the deconcentration (devolution) of (budget) programming at
the regional level, which allowed for substantially improve the delegation of budget
credit. The deconcentration of budget execution, which started in 2003 in the pilot site
of Bobo Dioulasso, is currently effective in ten regions, and will cover all thirteen
regions of the country, before the end of 2008.

Accountability became rooted in the financial administration common practices, which
now complies with WAEMU rules regarding the publication of public accounts and
settlement of bills, thus giving the Court of Auditors the material (information) to exert
its public finance audit mission. The role of this institution was strengthened thanks in
particular to measures supported by the first PRSCs, in particular the development and
implementation of an action plan for its operationalization in 2002.

The improvement of budget management had an impact on results in basic social
sectors, where the role of the state is essential. In particular, budget (supported) efforts
in favor of basic education and health have been maintained, which made it possible to
noticeably improve indicators in these two sectors.

III- EVALUATION OF THE SECOND PRSC SERIES

This evaluation takes into account concerns expressed above in the evaluation of the
first PRSC series, and new ones which emerged during implementation.

1. It is good news that the PRSC is now better understood within the government
    administration, even though efforts should continue to be made to convince of the
    advantages (of this approach) actors, which maintain still a preference for projects
    without valid justification. The PRSC is a direct support to the budget and is not
    accompanied by the complex and administratively demanding processes (lourdeur),
    which characterizes the supervision of (sector) projects, but nonetheless can
    support typical sector measures. It is imperative that actors dealing with
    macroeconomic issues and those dealing with sector issues work toward a real
    convergence of the objectives supported by the PRSC, an instrument, which has to
    preserve all the flexibility, which constitutes its strength in relation to other
    channels of aid delivery. However, one notes a progressive change of behavior in
    this regard, with the organization of Bank meetings in Ouagadougou on a regular
    basis, including all the members of the institution involved in the implementation
    of the Country Assistance Strategy.

2. The Bank took into account the need for capacity building for effective program
    implementation by setting up the Administration Capacity Building Project
    (PRCA) to support the government in this key area. However, the implementation
    modalities of this program, in our view, would need to be improved in order to
    enhance its impact on the implementation of the sectoral action plans that it is
    supposed to support, and of which implementation of some of the actions
    constitutes triggers for the mobilization of some budget..

3. In the same way, meeting the deadlines of certain key actions (strategic) included
    in the CGAB performance and disbursement matrix, has often been difficult,


                                            - 69 -

  because their implementation depended on Bank project financing that often
   requires no-objection notices that are not always issued in time by the project
   manager. This caused often delays in the implementation of many key reforms (in
   the telecommunication, and energy sectors, as well as in relation to the reform of
   the export promotion strategy, etc.). In order to address this deplorable situation
   and enhance the portfolio performance, a larger role of the resident mission could
   be envisaged, if the sector specialists are available.

4. Efforts to strengthen the national statistical system are being developed with Bank
   support, but results are too slow considering high expectations in this area. It would
   be advisable to consider measures with quick impact that are likely to improve the
   production of essential statistics, such as the consumer price index, the industrial
   production index, the domestic trade index, etc. These actions with immediate
   impact may be considered along with other long term measures, like statisticians
   training and working conditions improvement, which, in our opinion, are given
   priority in the program.

5. It would be advisable that Bank teams pay more attention to their national
   counterparts in order to augment the degree of success of the programs, or, by the
   same token, to enhance the (program's) impact. Indeed, the national counterparts
   who are at the center of the implementation process on the ground, are more capable
   to anticipate implementation difficulties, or the likely impact of the actions
   considered.      Implementation   problems     and    misunderstandings    sometimes
   encountered originate often of not taking into account the views expressed by
   national counterparts in relation to the anticipated application problems of certain
  measures. Sometimes such problems can also reflect coordination problems among
  the IDA macro and sector teams, resulting in inconsistencies with regard to the
  actions recommended on both sides.

6. The Bank should make efforts to:

   - on the one hand, better coordinate the PRSC process with the CGAB process, in
     order to avoid difficulties with the other partner members of the group. Indeed,
     these partners perceive the PRSC preparation as a parallel process, although the
     Bank is partner of the CGAB. Under ideal circumstances, the identification of
     measures would need to be advanced sufficiently early in order to allow for a
     profound discussion with the concerned sectors in the context of the preparatory
     meetings for the annual review of the priority action program (PAP) of the CSLP
     (Cadre stratégique de lutte contre la pauvreté) conducted by the sector and
     thematic commissions of the CSLP steering committee.

   - on the other hand, to avoid by the choice of triggers, choosing measures whose
     implementation is beyond the government's control and ability, even through such
     measures should be followed on because they are essential for achieving the
     overall pursed objectives. The government can encourage the other partners to
     carry out significant reforms, but cannot always influence their implementation
     pace, if it is not in charge.



                                           - 70 -

Notwithstanding these remarks, the government is entirely satisfied with the support
provided for the second PRSC series, which made it possible to consolidate
achievements (budget programming and execution, delivery of basic social services,
etc.) and to provide the foundations for other priority areas like decentralization,
competitiveness, promotion of the private sector). The results obtained are certainly
remarkable, but important challenges remain in order to meet the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) that require intensified efforts and, especially, improved
effectiveness in the use of resources. These aspects are included in the PRSP priority
action plans, and the strategy for strengthening the public finances, which are supported
by the ongoing PRSC's third series.

Les CARP mettent en pôle position l'axe 1 « accélérer la croissance et création
d'emplois ». s'il est vrai que le taux de croissance est publié annuellement par le
FMI, les questions d'emplois sont relativement moins documentées. Il est difficile
d'apprécier de nos jours l'impact des politiques sur la création d'emplois.

créés.

Le cadre général d'organisation des appuis budgétaires a été établi en 2005 pour
permettre une meilleure harmonisation et coordination des interventions des
différents bailleurs faisant de l'ABG. Si la Banque perçoit des rigidités comme
affirmé à la page 12 « Cependant, la formalisation croissante du processus de
CGAB a présenté un risque de rigidités naissantes, qui peuvent limiter la
flexibilité réalisée et l'empêcher à terme de satisfaire les besoins. » , il est
impérieux que ces rigidités soient clairement identifiées et traitées. L'évaluation
indépendante est en cours et c'est l'occasion d'en faire mention.

En ce qui concerne les instruments budgétaires, le Burkina Faso a été un des pays
pilote pour le budget programme et le CDMT. Ces deux instruments sont très
utiles, mais leur cohabitation au sein des ministères pourrait être source de
confusion et de perte de ressources. En effet, ces instruments visent les mêmes
buts. Le gouvernement ne devrait-il pas faire le choix d'un instrument et achever
son application ?

Les performances économiques sont appréciables, avec un taux de croissance
moyen supérieur à celui de la sous région et à la prévision du programme (5%).
Cependant, des questions importantes demeurent:

    -  la fiscalité est qualifiée de « disciplinée » (page 17 dernier paragraphe),
       mais la pression fiscale est l'une des plus faible de l'UEMOA et les
       réalisations demeurent en déça des potentialités réelles. Nonobstant
       l'impact négatif des difficultés de la filière coton sur les recouvrements des
       ressources internes ces dernières années, l'informalisation de l'économie
       plombe les réalisations de recettes fiscales. Beaucoup d'entreprises sont
       déclarées sous le régime informel (CSI) alors qu'elles devaient être au RSI.


                                        - 72 -

       Les recouvrements de la TVA ont également une large marge
       d'amélioration. C'est à ce niveau que nous apprécions la collaboration
       entre la Banque, le FMI et les autres PTFs qui à terme, permettra
       d'adresser ces questions.

    -  les questions d'équité ne sont pas suffisamment abordées. Dans quelle
       mesure les CARP 4-6 ont contribué à améliorer l'équité ? La question du
       genre est abordée à la page 31 et demanderait à être considérée de façon
       plus transversale, par exemple impact de la libéralisation du secteur coton
       sur l'équité et la pauvreté ?. En effet, une des portes d'entrée pour la
       réduction de la pauvreté et l'amélioration de l'équité est le ciblage des plus
       pauvres qui au Burkina sont les femmes (52% de la population).

    -  Si l'éducation est suffisamment pris en compte, la question de l'Education
       Non Formelle qui est un volet du PDDEB et ayant un impact direct et
       immédiat sur le développement social et économique des plus pauvres,
       n'est pas abordée. Dans quelle mesure les CARP ont contribué à la
       réduction du taux d'analphabétisme ?

Quel a été l'impact écologique et économique (recul de la souveraineté
alimentaire) de la libéralisation du secteur coton surtout à l'Est ou l'on a assisté à
une déforestation importante ?

Pendant la période évaluée, le PDDEB a rencontré certaines difficultés liées à la
mise en place du système BPE. Cela n'a pas été évoqué dans le rapport.

Concernant la mesure de la pauvreté, le rapport d'évaluation de la Banque
Mondiale sur les CASRP 4 à 6, fait notamment état d'un "projet de renforcement
de la capacité statistique (10 millions USD, FY04), qui s'attaque aux
imperfections dans le dispositif de S&E en renforçant la collecte des données et la
diffusion". Il n'aborde cependant pas la question essentielle de la mesure de la
pauvreté, qui est au centre des préoccupations et reste pour l'instant non résolue.
En effet, que ce soit pour ce CASRP ou pour les autres programmes de
stabilisation et de réformes structurelles appuyés par la Banque, le FMI et
d'autres donateurs,, il importe de pouvoir en estimer l'impact par l'évaluation du
profil de pauvreté correspondant.. Depuis 1994, date à laquelle la première
enquête sur les conditions de vie des ménages a été publiée, les appréciations sur
les questions de méthodologie du calcul des indices de pauvreté ont été
divergentes. Il est cependant nécessaire de s'accorder sur la méthode de calcul
des indices de pauvreté ainsi que sur sa répartition entre les groupes socio-
économiques.

D'autre part, ces indices devraient être calculés annuellement pour qu'on puisse
constituer une série rétrospective longue. Il existe au sein du Ministère de
l'économie et des finances, un Simulateur Macro-économique pour l'Analyse de
la Pauvreté (Poverty Analysis Macro Simulator - PAMS), qui est très peu utilisé.
Pourtant pour une année donnée, lorsqu'il n'existe pas d'enquête même rapide


                                       - 73 -

sur les conditions de vie des ménages, il doit être possible d'estimer les agrégats
usuels à l'aide de ce simulateur.

Pour répondre efficacement aux interrogations des autorités et des partenaires
techniques et financiers impliqués dans la préparation et la mise en oeuvre de la
Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté au Burkina Faso, il nous apparaît
nécessaire de :

   · Mener une enquête annuelle (rapide ou complète) sur les conditions de vie
     des ménages,
   · Communiquer les résultats de cette enquête au grand public,

   · Poursuivre les travaux d'affinement des méthodes d'estimation de la
     croissance économique, y compris celle à long terme ainsi que le calcul des
     indices de pauvreté

   · Renforcer les capacités opérationnelles des cadres du Ministère de
     l'économie et des finances en matière de gestion stratégique de l'économie.

Le rapport gagnerait à traiter la question de la fiabilité et de la régularité du
calcul des indicateurs de pauvreté. Ces propositions devraient contribuer à
améliorer la qualité du suivi-évaluation du CSLP, en plus du simple calcul des
indicateurs d'impact du CSLP.

   General Framework for Budget Support for the Implementation of
                                          CSLP (CGAB ­ CSLP)

Comments and observations on the implementation completion report concerning
PRSC-4 to 6

The PRSCs place emphasis on the first axis: "Accelerating Growth and Employment
Creation." Although, it is true that the growth rate is published annually by the IMF, then
the question of employment is less relatively well documented. It is difficult today to
evaluate the impact of policies on employment creation.                              Annex 1 provides for
information on the development of the number of professional agricultural organizations
with an economic purpose but not the number of jobs created.

The general framework for budget support was established in 2005 to allow for better
harmonization and coordination of assistance provided by the different donors engaged in
budget support. If the Bank points on page 12 to rigidities: "However, the growing
formalization of the CGAB process presents a risk for emerging rigidities, which can
limit existing flexibility and hamper achieving [CGAB] objectives."16 It is mandatory,
that these rigidities are clearly identified and addressed. The independent evaluation is
underway and this is the opportunity to raise the issue.

Regarding the budget instruments, Burkina Faso has been one of the pilot-countries for
budget programming and the MTEF. These two instruments are very useful, but their
cohabitation under the auspices of the ministries could be a source of confusion and a
loss of resources. Yet, these instruments have the same aim. Should the government not
choose one instrument and complete its application?

The economic performance is significant, with a medium growth rate superior to that of
the sub-region and to program projections (5 %). However, there are still important
questions:

    -    The fiscal policy is described as "prudent" (page 17 last paragraph; now page 14)
         but the fiscal revenue ratio is one of the weakest of the WAEMU countries and
         the achievement remains below the real potential. Regardless of the negative
         impact of the cotton sector's difficulties on the collection of domestic resources
         during these past years, the informalization of the economy hinders the collection

        of tax revenues. Many firms operate under the informal regime (CSI) while they
        should have been under the RSI. VAT collection, too, has a large margin for
        improvement. It is at this level that we appreciate the collaboration of the Bank,
        the IMF and other PTFs, which, over time, will allow to address these questions.

    -   Questions on equity are not sufficiently taken up. How did PRSC­4 to 6
        contribute to improve equity? The gender question is raised on page 31 (now page
        27) and would need to be considered in a more cross-cutting way, for instance, the
        impact of the liberalization of the cotton sector on equity and poverty? In fact,
        one of the entry points for poverty reduction and equity improvement is targeting
        the poorest who in Burkina are women (52 % of the population).

    -   If education is sufficiently taken into consideration, the question of informal (non
        conventional) education, which is a part of the PDDEB, and which has a direct
        and immediate impact on the social and economic development of the poorest, is
        not taken up. How have the PRSCs contributed to the reduction of illiteracy?

What has been the environmental and economic impact (reduction in the dependency of
food imports) regarding the liberalization of the cotton sector, especially in the east where
significant deforestation has taken place?

During the evaluated period, the PDDEB encountered some difficulties linked to the
implementation of the BPE system (sector program budgeting). This was not mentioned
in the report.

As for the poverty measurement, the World Bank evaluation report about PRSC-4 to 6
refers to the "Statistical Capacity Building project ($10 million, FY04) which addresses
shortcomings in the M&E system by strengthening data collection and reporting."
However, it does not deal with the essential question of measuring poverty, which is at
the centre of concerns and remains for the moment unresolved.

In fact, whether it would be for this PRSC or for other stabilization programs and
structural reforms supported by the Bank, the IMF and other donors, it is important to be
able to estimate the impact by evaluating the corresponding poverty profile. Since 1994,
when the first survey on household living standards was published, the debate about the
methodological questions for calculating the poverty indices has been divergent.
However, it is necessary to agree on the calculation method of the poverty indices and on
the distribution of poverty among the socioeconomic groups.

On the other hand, these indices need to be calculated annually in order to establish a
historical series. In the Ministry of Economics and Finance exists a macroeconomic
simulator for analyzing poverty (Poverty Analysis Macro Simulator or PAMS), which is
hardly used. Yet, for a given year, when there exists not even a quick survey on the
household living conditions, it should be possible to estimate usual aggregates with the
help of this simulator.




                                            - 76 -

To efficiently respond to questions raised by the authorities and the technical and
financial partners supporting the preparation and the implementation of the poverty
reduction strategy in Burkina Faso, it appears necessary to:

   · conduct an annual survey (quick or complete) on household living conditions,
   · share the survey results with the wider public,
   · follow-up with a refining of the methods for estimating economic growth,
       including those for long-term growth as well as the calculation method for
       poverty indices,
   · reinforce the operational capacity of high-level staff at the Ministry of Economics
       and Finance in the area of strategic management of the economy.

The report would benefit from solving the question of reliability and regularity of
calculating the poverty indicators. These suggestions should contribute to improve the
monitoring and evaluation quality of the CSLP, as well as the simple calculation of the
CSLP impact indicators.
