Reduction Credit Project (PRSC) for Burkina Faso are\n            as follows: outcomes of the project were satisfactory,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the Borrower was also rated satisfactory.

The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format, including statistical series and other data."}, "docdt": "2009-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
