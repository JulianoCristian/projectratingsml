In the case of this\n            Request, communities previously adversely affected in\n            Rondonia by the POLONOROESTE program expected beneficial\n            effects from the implementation of PLANAFLORO according to\n            the standards and timetable promised by the Bank, but\n            expectations were not met. The intended beneficiaries\n            represented by local non governmental organizations (NGOs)\n            requested the Panel to investigate the reasons for the\n            Bank's failure to carry out its commitment to prevent\n            further damage to their land. The Requesters'\n            fundamental complaint is that the Project-intended to be\n            beneficial to fragile communities and the natural\n            environments they depend on for their livelihood-has not\n            been adequately implemented since Board approval 3 1/2 years\n            ago. The Panel is presenting this additional review based on\n            available data at this time because: Sufficient information\n            is available to illustrate how the rights and interests of\n            groups have been adversely affected and that they have\n            suffered substantial, possibly irreversible, material\n            damage.  Damage continues and in some areas is worsening,\n            but it could be mitigated in the future if Management takes\n            steps to remedy the situation in high priority vulnerable\n            areas--quickly. If authorized, an investigation to obtain\n            specific data indicating and evidence quantifying monetary\n            and other damage that occurred between 1992 and 1995 in all\n            other relevant areas of the State of Rondonia, would take\n            about six months. A \"Work Plan\" is attached as\n            ANNEX A. It is imperative to set project priorities now to\n            accelerate implementation of feasible remedial measures for\n            this beneficial on-going project. This may involve\n            reorientation of goals and a revision of specific targets."}, "docdt": "1995-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
