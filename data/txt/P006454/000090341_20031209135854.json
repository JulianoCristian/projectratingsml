The\n            lessons learned indicate that the outcome of both projects\n            is obviously not satisfactory to the Bank, and in many ways\n            it is not satisfactory to the client governments involved\n            either. The objective of the projects was to change behavior\n            of private and public agents in the use of the natural\n            resources of tropical rain forests. The project concept did\n            not recognize the strong existing economic and political\n            forces that were (and still are) working in favor of\n            continued expansion of forest clearing - the \"political\n            economy\" of the frontier states. In the strive for\n            decentralization after POLONOROESTE, state governments\n            became the principal partners and executors of the projects.\n            At the risk of undue simplification, the Bank had a strong\n            interest in the environmental objectives of the projects, in\n            the aftermath of POLONOROESTE (Northwest Integrated\n            Development Program), but saw development - in the right\n            places - as part of an overall strategy. The state\n            governments (and their societies) were much more interested\n            in development, particularly infrastructure. In spite of\n            formally approved initial zoning laws, there was no\n            sufficiently deep commitment on the part of the states'\n            society to be bound by the provisions of (first\n            approximation) zoning. Refined (second approximation) zoning\n            came too late to change such commitment, and is not binding\n            yet in either state. The sustainability of project results\n            remains highly questionable, not only because appropriate\n            arrangements were absent, but even more importantly because\n            the thrust of the projects was, and likely still is, not in\n            line with the local mainstream. The project reformulation\n            after the mid-term review did not address the principal\n            shortcomings of the original projects. They accommodated one\n            part of society (\"organized civil society\"), but\n            not private sector interests, on the basis of a vague\n            strategy of community-driven development, largely without\n            any solid and proven natural resource management\n            technologies that would have reverted the mainstream use\n            (clearing) of rain forests.
