MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIOt AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE ROND8NIA NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Federative Republic of Brazil for US$167.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approv&l. The loan would be Lepayable in 15 years, including 5 years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would help finance a natural
resource management project in the State of Rondonia.
2.        Background.  Official efforts to integrate the Amazon Region with the
rest of Brazil during the 1960s and 1970s included ambitious agricultural
colonization schemes, road building programs and fiscal incentives for
attracting new industrial and agricultural enterprises. In addition to these
public programs, as land became increasingly scarce in Southern Brazil and
prolonged droughts struck the rural Northeast, spontaneous migration to the
Northwest accelerated, soon reaching uncontrollable proportions. By 1977, some
28,000 families had been officially settled in Rondonia, but at least 30,000
additional families had joir,ed the marginal population of newly created towns.
Others became sharecroppers on the lands of established colonists or staked out
claims on the fringes of official projects, in Indian areas and forest reserves.
By the late 1970s, the State's population had more than quadrupled, socio-
economic problems increased, deforestation was uncontrolled, and the security of
the State's indigenous inhabitants was being threatened.
3.        In 1980, in recognition of the above problems, the Government launched
a program of major investments in the Northwest agricultural frontier areas of
Rond6nia and Mato Grosso--the Integrated Development Program for Northwest
Brazil (POLONOROESTE). This program was supported by five Bank loans, including
three for agricultural development and environmental protection, one for
highways, and one for health. Environmnental considerations did influence the
design of POLONOROESTE but, given the magnitude of the task at hand, it is
perhaps not surprising that initially the program seemed to be failing in many
respects. A mid-term review in 1984 highlighted the differences between the
planning assumptions and the conditions under which POLONOROESTE was actually
being implemented: (a) the inadequacy and late disbursement of counterpart funds
because of the country's difficult fiscal situation; (b) rising migration,
driven by persistent development problems elsewhere in Brazil; (c) the virtual
disappearance of investment credit needed for perennial crops; (d) the weak
institutional base of the newly established State; and (e) the limited technical
knowledge about Rondonia's natural resource base required to support the range
of development planning decisions which had to be made. A final issue, which
had not been adequately appreciated by POLONOROESTE's planners, was that many of
the public policies introduced during the previous two decades were actually
encouraging migration and deforestation (e.g., land registration and titling
procedures which accepted forest clearing as proof of occupation; special fiscal
incentives and subsidized credit lines which encouraged unsustainable livestock
development).



4.        POLONOROESTE's well-publicized weaknesses have masked some of its
significant institutional, technical and environmental accomplishments. Key
institutions were created or strengthened, many of POLONOROESTE's physical
targets have now been met or exceeded, including some of the more difficult
activities (e.g., demarcation of 12 reserves covering about 10.3 million ha, or
an area nearly half the size of the former west Germany, benefitting a
population of about 11,000 Amerindians; and the establishment and protection of
Federal conservation units and forests covering an additional 2.1 million ha).
The program helped to foster a growing political and public commitment to
preserve the region's remaining natural resources, although the State's capacity
to enforce the borders and prevent periodic invasions of Amerindian reserves,
conservation units and public forests needs to be further strengthened. Also
important has been tho groundwork laid by POLONOROESTE for major advances in
technical knowledge. Efforts have focussed on agro-ecological zoning, a tool
which identifies areas according to potential land use, distinguishing those
capable of sustainable development from those which lack any known long-term
potential or which have special ecological (biological reserves) or social
(Amerindian lands) significance and therefore need to be protected. Pursuant to
such a plan, which ha3 already been legally adopted, RondOnia was divided into
six macro-zones, and a basic development strategy has been articulated for each
zone. Finally, recent events in Brazil suggest a growing commitment to confront
environmental issues, including a new National Constitution which incorporates
one of the world's most advanced chapters on the environment; the launching of
a special emergency program to protect the Amazon region and other endangered
ecosystems; the suspension and reform of fiscal incentive programs which had
directly promoted deforestation; the establishment of a new national institute
to coordinate environmental protection activities, and of an Environmental
Secretariat, headed by an internationally prominent environmentalist reporting
directly to the President of the Republic; and the preparation of several major
environmental investment programs, including a comprehensive pilot program to
conserve the rainforest which will be supported by the industrialized countries.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country assistance
strategy for Brazil places increasing emphasis on environmental issues /soil
erosion, depletion of renewable natural resources, biodiversity conservation,
air and water pollution from industrial waste, etc.). Despite the serious
problems of the earlier POLONOROESTE projects, the Bank is much better placed
today to assist Brazil in fostering a more rational development of the Northwest
Region, because of the gradual strengthening of essential institutions, improved
technical knowledge and the growing commitment within the country to
environmental concerns. Bank support for the proposed project would play a
crucial role in consolidating sustainable development in Rondonia and
contributing to environmental conservation. A distinguishing feature of Banik
involvement at this stage, largely missing from the earlier POLONOROESTE
operations, would be the explicit effort to implement changes in the policy and
regulatory framework which governs occupation and investment patterns in
Rond8nia, to make it more supportive of the long-term goals of sustainable
development and sound natural resource management.

6.        Project Objec':ives.  The principal objective of the proposed project
would be to implement an improved approach to natural resource management,
conservation and development in one state of the environmentally fragile Amazon
Basin. The project would assist the Government to: (a) institute a series of
changes in key policies, regulations and public investment programs in order to
provide a coherent incentive framework for sustainable development in Rondonia;
ib) conserve the rich biodiversity of the State, while creating the basis for
the sustainable utilization of its natural resources for tne direct economic
benefit of the local population; (c) protect and enforce the borders of all
conservation units, Amerindian reserves, public forests and extractive reserves,
and control illegal deforestation, wood transport and forest fires; (d) develop
intensive, integrated farming systems in areas suitable for permanent
agriculture/agro-forestry, and systems for sustainable forest management and
extraction of non-wood forest products in other areas which should remain under
natural forest cover; (e) support priority investments in socio-economic
infrastructure and services needed to implement the State's agro-ecological
zoning; and (f) consolidate the technical and operational capacity of State
institutions, particuldrly those responsible for agro-forestry development and
the environment.
7,        Project Description.  Project activities would include:
(a) environmental conservation, management and protection, including land
zoning, mapping and regularization, establishment and management of conservation
units and Amerindian reserves, sustainable forest management, extractive
reserves, environmental protection and training, studies and technical
assistance (28% of total costs); (b) sustainable agro-forestry development,
including agro-forestry research, rural extension, rural credit and input supply
(36%); (c) socio-economic infrastructure and services essential to implement the
agro-ecological zoning, in the health, education, water supply, and road and
river transport sectors (31%); and (d) project administration, monitoring and
evaluation, and technical assistance (5%). The project strategy, content and
the institutional arrangements for implementation, are based on a careful review
of the lessons learned under the earlier POLONOROESTE operations.
8.        As part of project preparation, the Government has already undertaken
a number of important policy and regulatory reforms, centered on implementation
of Rond6nials new agro-ecological zoning: the zoning itself has been
institutionalized through a 1988 S'ate Decree Law and a 1991 State Law;
deforestation has been elirtnated as a criterion for obtaining land titles; a
State land institute has buen created to administer land policy in accordance
with the agro-ecological zoning; and economic and financial incentives which had
previously encouraged unsustainable private investment and environmental
degradation have been phased out.  The Government has also prepared a plan for
improved protection and services to Amerindian areas in Rondonia; and it has
begun to disseminate public media materials elsewhere in Brazil, explaining the
agro-ecological zoning and the State's policies on land occupation and related
enforcement plans. The medium-term State and Federal investment programs for
Rondonia have been revised to reflect land use capabilities and other ecological
considerations, in accordance with the agro-ecological zoning. Finally,
consultations regarding the project have taken place with local NGOs who would
also be involved in review of annual operating plans and project implementation.

9.        Project institutional arrangements would provide for:
(a) decentralization of responsibility and accountability for execution from the
Federal to the State level; (b) primary reliance on contracting out of project
works versus direct execution by public agencies; (c) reliance on existing
Government structures rather than creation of special project entities; (d)
institutional strengthening, technical support and consultancies, particularly
for management and monitoring activities and in fields requiring greater
innovation or in which a major impact is necessary over a short period; and (e)
improved personnel policies to enable executing agencies to recruit and retain
qualified staff. The project would be coordinated at the federal level by the
Secretariat of Regional Development of the Borrower's Presidency (SDR-PR).
Physical and financial monitoring and impact assessment would be carried out
routinely by each project agency, by SEPLAN-RO's Project coordination Unit (PCU)
and by SDR-PR. An Independent Evaluation Committee, including relevant local
Brazilian NGOs, would meet annually to review the project. Finally, a forest
cover monitoring unit to be established in SEPLAN-RO would be specially equipped
to use satellite imagery to monitor deforestation/encroachment of protected
areas.
10.       The total project cost is estimated at US$228.9 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$48.4 million, or about 21% of the total
cost. The project, to be carried out over five years, would fund civil works,
equipment and furniture, technical assistance, training, studies and contractual
services, investment credit and, on a declining basis, incremental operating
costs. The Bank loan would finance 75% of the total project cost net of taxes,
with counterpart funds provided by the State and Federal Governments. The share
of Bank financing is justified by the strong environmental focus of this
operation. Significant policy actions have already been undertaken as part of
preparation for the project, to which commitment iq high at both Federal and
State levels. However, the fiscal situation in Brazil makes it difficult at this
point in time to carry out these kinds of environmental initiatives because most
of the benefits, although substantial in economic terms, would materialize only
in the long-term, and then largely in the form of foregone losses. The proposed
share of Bank financing would also reduce implementation risks caused by
in&dequate or untimely counterpart funding. Retroactive financing of up to
US$15.0 million would cover eligible expenditures incurred before loan signing,
but after July 1, 1991, when the project was post-appraised. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and the disbursement echedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank group operations in
Brazil are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8073-BR, dated February 27, 1992, are also attached.
11.       Aoreements reached.  During negotiations, the State of
Rond8nia and the Borrower agreed on the following actions: (a) as conditions of
loan effectiveness: the signing of satisfactory operating agreementL between the
State Government and SDR-PR, and between the PC71 and each executing agency;
signing of a satisfactory agreement between the State Government and INCRA
concerning land regularization policies and practices to be observed in
Rond8nia; establishment of a satisfactory State project Coordination Unit; and
evidence of adequate counterpart funding in the 1992 Federal and State budgets;
(b) as conditions of disbursement: (i) for the credit category of the loan,



- 5 -
presentation of a satisfactory FUNDAGRO operating manual; (ii) for river
transport, preparation by the State Government of a water transport development
plan for the Madeira/Machado and Mamor6/Guapor6 river systems; and (c) as other
covenants: (i) completion of suitable agro- ecological, climatological, soil and
topographic maps of Rondonia no later than December 31, 1993; (ii) satisfactory
implementation of the FUNDAGRO operating manual and annual joint evaluation of
performance by the PCU, FUNDAGRO Credit Group, SDR and MEFP; (iii) maintenance
of the PCU with staffing, structure and functions agreed with the Bank; (iv) the
annual contracting of an Independent Evaluation Committee, with relevant local
Brazsilian NGO representatives, to monitor project implementation and the
compatibility of annual Federal and State investment programs in Rondonia with
the agro-ecological zoning, with the Committee's findings made available to the
Bank by June 30 of each year, starting in 1992; (v) completion of the
registration, with DPU, of the Pacaas Novas, Roosevelt, Tubar&o Latunde and Uru-
eu-wau-wau Amerindian areas by May 31, 1992 and the taking of all necessary
Steps to register such reserves with the appropriate local land registries in
Rondonia; (vi) satisfactory revision and simplification of all project
performance indicators and operating procedures of the PCU/M&E Unit by June 30,
1992; (vii) completion of a baseline study of socio-ec-nomic and environmental
indicators of at least three municipalities representative of the project area,
by December 31, 1992, and of a mid-term review by of the project December 31,
1994; (viii) presentation for Bank review and comments of the draft budget
proposal by August 15 and the draft project annual operating plans by November
15 of each year: (ix) presentation of progress reports within three months of
the close of each semester during the fiscal year; (x) presentation for Bank
review and comments of the annual media program to discourage migration to
Rondonia by November 15 of each year; (xi) presentation of draft decrees
creating the remaining conservation units and reserves by June 30, 1993, and
their establishment by September 30, 1993, and continued maintenance
thereafter; (xii) assignment or allocation of health staff to provide
Amerindians all necessary health care by June 30, 1992; and (xiii) continued
implementation of agreed environmental policy reforms, and consistency of
Federal and State investment programs for Rondonia with land use capability,
ecological and agro-ecological zoning considerations.
12.       Benefits.  The main impact of the project would be a significant
reduction in the rate of destruction of Rondenia's remaining natural rain
forest. Techniques for accounting of environmental benefits are still very
rudimentary, and this project does not lend itself to conventional rate of
return analysis. However, some indicative estimates have been made of the value
of the rain forest which, as a result of thie project, would not be lost. It is
conservatively estimated that the present economic value of the foregone losces
would be about US$420 million over a ten-year period. Enrichment of secondary
growth/forest fallow with timber species in an aggregate area of about 90,000 ha
would also yield significant benefits to participating farmers. Other important
project benefits include poverty alleviation and improvement of the health and
well-being of rural beneficiaries, protection of Amerindian lands, prevention of
soil depletion and erosion, and preservation of biodiversity. Some 5,000 to
6,000 Amerindians, 2,400 families of rubber tappers and other forest dwellers
and 900 families of fishermen and riverine inhabitants in Rondonia would bene'it
directly from the environmental conservation, management and protection
component. A further 52,000 low-income farm families would benefit directly



from the agro-forestry component in the areas suitable for sustainable
development. Much of the rural 3mmunity in those same areas would also benefit
from improved socio-economic in,_-astructure and services. Finally, both present
and future generations would benefit from actions taken now to arrest
degradation of the State's natural resource base and biogenetic diversity.
13.       Risks.  Establishment of conservation units and reserves is important,
but these actions alone would not prevent illegal encroachment and
deforestation. The various environmental policy reforms already undertaken
should help to improve the economic and financial incentives/disincentives
framework, and project activities designed to intensify land use in suitable
araas and develop sustainable extractive production elsewhere would reduce
pressure on the forests by small, shifting cultivators. Also, the project would
strengthen the capacity of kel agencies to enforce environmental policies and
legislation and to protect the borders of conservation units and reserves.
However, given the extensive areas to he protected, there is a risk that even
these measures may not be adequate to eliminate all illegal deforestation during
the project period.  Second1y, Lhe.:e is always a risk that unforeseen factors
(e.g., weather or economic problems in other parts of Brazil which might prompt
additional migration to Rondonia), or delays in the implementation of crucial
decisions and activities, could undermine the project strategy. For that reason,
intensive M&E efforts (para. 9) would be put in piace from the start of the
project to identify problems as they arise and recommend corrective actions as
necessary. Einally, although the project includes considerable technical
*assistance and training to support Rond8nia's relatively young institutions, the
current fiscal difficulties in Brazil could undermine the future development of
these entities. DurIng negotiations, the Government presented satisfactory
plans for dealing with restrictions on staff recruitment and salary levels, and
implementation of the agre2ments reached would be monitored closely.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
