                       THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
      THIRD ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE GRANT (ERGG-3)

                         GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Recipient:          Republic of Togo.

Implementing        The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) coordinates the
Agency:             implementation in close association with several line ministries.

Financing Data:     IDA Grant
                    Amount: SDR 10.7 million (US$16.3 million equivalent).
Operation Type:     Stand-alone, single tranche development policy grants to be available upon
                    effectiveness.
Main Policy Areas: The proposed grant focuses on two main policy areas: (i) public finance
                   management; and (ii) governance and transparency in the key sectors of
                   the economy (cotton, phosphates and energy).

Key Outcome         By December 2010: (i) Three quarterly budget reports published; (ii) three
Indicators:         sectors with MTEFs; (iii) execution rate of priority spending (health,
                    education, agriculture and infrastructure) reaches 85 percent; (iv) ten
                    internal audits concluded; (v) 80 percent of the contracts processed in the
                    last quarter of 2010 in five key ministries, seven major public companies,
                    and the Lomé municipal office have been subject to prior review by the
                    General Procurement Department; (vi) processing costs, including
                    overheads, of NSCT have been reduced by 10 percent; (vii) four criteria to
                    become an EITI candidate country have been met; (viii) the stock of public
                    sector arrears and obligations to CEET has been reduced to zero.

Program             The proposed grant supports government-owned reforms to improve
Development         governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial management as
Objective(s) and    well as advance structural reforms aimed at strengthening governance and
Contribution to     transparency in key sectors of the economy (phosphates, cotton and
Interim Strategy    energy).
Note (ISN):
                    The operation is an integral part of the ISN. It directly supports the first
                    ISN pillar and provides financing for budgeted fiscal needs during 2010.
                    The reforms supported by the operation are critical to the Government's
                    ability to use public resources efficiently and effectively to support the
                    country's economic and social recovery. The grant is closely coordinated
                    with assistance provided to the Government's reform program through the
                    LICUS TF Grant for Economic Recovery and International Reengagement,
                    the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, the AfDB budget support and the IMF ECF
                    program.



                                             v
Risks and risk   In the current environment of a country emerging from a socio-political
Mitigation:      crisis, the proposed operation presents significant country and fiduciary
                 risks.

                 Political risk. The socio-political outlook and hence the broad acceptance
                 of reforms will be contingent to a great extent upon the degree to which
                 elections in 2010 will be perceived as fair and inclusive and will lead to a
                 Government supported by a majority of the population. More transparent
                 and accountable practices in the phosphates, energy and cotton sectors will
                 enhance governance and reduce the scope for vested interests to undermine
                 reform effort in these critical sectors. In addition, the proposed prior
                 actions focus on areas in which the Government has already demonstrated
                 its commitment and ownership in the previous ERGG operations. The
                 PRSP process presented an additional opportunity to foster national
                 consensus across the Togolese society and among Government
                 representatives on a medium-term reform agenda. Close coordination with
                 the IMF, AfDB and bilateral donors and intensified sector dialogue will
                 help ensure that the Government continues to give top priority to the
                 reform of these sectors.

                 Macroeconomic risks. Risks to the economic recovery could stem from
                 the vulnerability of the Togolese economy to exogenous shocks (mostly
                 climate and commodity shocks), or from a slower than expected recovery
                 from the global financial and economic crisis. The global slowdown
                 depressed export growth, FDI, as well as the volume of transit trade
                 through the Lomé Port, and at this point forecasts do not predict a rapid
                 recovery of the international economy in 2010. The extent to which the
                 restructuring of the Togolese banking sector will lead to increased lending
                 to the economy remains uncertain. Delays in rebuilding the transport
                 infrastructure destroyed by the recent flooding could also hinder the
                 economic recovery. Furthermore, given Togo's role as a hub for regional
                 trade, shocks in neighboring countries could hurt Togo's economic
                 prospects. Some of these shocks or a combination of them could result in a
                 risk of falling back into arrears or exacerbating the already precarious
                 financial situation of several banks. To mitigate the macroeconomic risks,
                 the IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic
                 performance. In addition, Togo's main creditors have offered financing
                 and agreed to debt relief arrangements that maximize overall positive
                 resource flows to Togo.

                 Fiduciary risks. Despite recent reforms fiduciary risks remain from
                 possible corruption or Government's failure to make effective and efficient
                 use of public resources. The major risk during the ERGG-3 period is from
                 implementation problems of the new procurement code, stemming from
                 inadequate dissemination and familiarization by users. These risks will be
                 mitigated by the establishment of the General Procurement Department,



                                          vi
               which would disseminate the new procurement code and promote its
               application for public procurement. The recent PEMFAR and technical
               assistance provided by IDA, the IMF and other donors are expected to
               facilitate the further improvement of fiduciary standards.

               Implementation capacity. Risks arise from the lack of sufficient
               professional staff and weak institutional capacity and coordination in the
               wake of the long recent history of socio-political instability and suspended
               foreign assistance. These risks are mitigated during the ISN period through
               the provision of technical assistance under IDA projects and TF grants.
               This includes the Financial Sector and Governance TA project supporting
               financial sector reform and the ongoing LICUS grant for Economic
               Recovery and International Reengagement that provides support to
               reforms in public procurement, cotton, coffee, cocoa, energy and port
               sectors. The IMF provides assistance in public financial management and
               to key financial administrations like the Customs and Tax Departments
               through its AFRITAC based in Bamako. Other donors (AfDB, EC and
               France) are supporting, or plan to, support capacity building efforts in
               various sectors.

                           REPUBLIC OF TOGO
            THIRD ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE GRANT

                                    1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     This program document proposes a Third Economic Recovery and Governance
Grant (ERGG-3) to the Republic of Togo in the amount of SDR 10.7 million (US$16.3
million equivalent). This stand-alone, one-tranche development policy grant supports the
Government's efforts to pursue the implementation of governance reforms initiated under the
ERGG and ERGG-2 approved by the Board in May 2008 and April 2009, respectively.
Specifically, the ERGG-3 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms to improve public
financial management (PFM) and governance of key sectors of the economy.

1.2    The reform policies supported by this grant are aligned with Togo's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) covering the period 2009-2011. The PRSP was adopted by
the Government in June 20, 2009 and presented to the IMF and IDA Boards in November and
December 2009, respectively. The proposed grant is also an integral part of the Bank's Interim
Strategy Note for Togo for the period FY08-10 presented to the IDA Board on May 29, 2008 and
complements the assistance provided through the 3-year IMF ECF program (2008-2010), the
AfDB budget support operation, the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the IDA financed Financial

1.3     As Togo embarks on the first year of its PRSP implementation, the country is at an
unusually challenging juncture. Togo has emerged from a prolonged socio-political crisis
which had a very negative impact on the country's economic performance. Following the
installation and subsequent election of Faure Gnassingbé in 2005, upon the death of President
Gnassingbé Eyadéma, a comprehensive political agreement (Accord Politique Global) was
reached among the main parties which eventually led to fair and transparent legislative elections
held on October 14, 2007. The inclusive cabinet resulting from these elections has implemented
political and economic reforms to consolidate the reconciliation of the society and launch the
recovery of the economy. As the country has tried to emerge from a long socio-political crisis, its
economy has been severely affected by the succession since 2008 of severe external and internal
shocks culminating with the negative impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's economic
growth and public finances. These have taken a heavy toll on Togo's fairly open economy and
reduced the potential gains from the incipient economic reforms launched by the Government.
The presidential elections took place without major incident on March 4. According to the
regional election observers, the organization of the presidential elections was transparent and the
voting took place in a calm, peaceful atmosphere. However, some irregularities in the process of
final vote counting did occur. On March 18, rejecting the opposition's requests for a review of
the results, the Constitutional Court confirmed the final results which show incumbent President
Faure Gnassingbé reelected with 61 percent of the votes.

1.4   It is in this challenging context that the pr oposed gr ant aims to assist the Togolese
Government in continuing the implementation of its reform agenda to support the
country's economic and social recovery and lay the foundation for sustained pro-poor
growth. The recent shocks have exposed the fragility of Togo's institutions of economic and



                                                1
financial management but also the resolve of policy makers to sustain their reform program. The
grant would continue to support government-owned reforms to improve governance,
transparency and efficiency in public financial management as well as further advance structural
reforms aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in key sectors of the economy
(phosphates, cotton, and energy) launched under the ERGG and ERGG-2. These reforms would
achieve strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance and enhanced
transparency of State institutions and processes--critical elements for the country's economic
and social recovery.

1.5     The operation would provide financial support to the Government in the
challenging context of an exceptionally unfavorable global economic environment and Togo's
annual debt service to IDA expected to remain considerable until attainment of the HIPC
completion point anticipated in end 2010. The amount of this grant has been increased from
SDR 7.9 million (US$12 million equivalent) to SDR 10.7 million (US$16.3 million equivalent)
through the addition of SDR 2.8 million (US$4.3 million equivalent) from the Crisis Response
Window to help offset the impact of the global economic slowdown. Since Togo is at high risk
of debt distress, IDA resources are provided on grant terms, per the stipulations of the grant
allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 15 period (FY09-FY11).

             2. TOGO'S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS

                                                  A. BACKGROUND

2.1     Togo is a small-sized country in West Africa with a population of 6.5 million as of
2009, whose main economic potentials are mining, agriculture and re-exporting. Togo's
highest export earning sector is clinker/cement, produced from two limestone companies. Togo's
next important exports are phosphate and cotton, processed and marketed by public enterprises.
Togo produces other cash crops, mainly coffee and cocoa, and has a considerable agricultural
potential due to favorable climatic conditions in large parts of the country. As a small country,
Togo's successful development lies also in its ability to capitalize on greater integration with its
neighbors, notably by further developing its deep water port (the only one in the region) as a
shipping hub, through private investments. Furthermore, Togo is a member of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS).

2.2     The prolonged period of political instability, economic and financial
mismanagement and the related withdrawal of donor support before 2008 have had a
negative impact on the country's economic performance and have dramatically reduced
living standards for large segments of the population. Togo has been among the countries in
sub-Saharan Africa with the weakest growth performance and has had per capita income
declining by an average of 1 percent annually since the early 1980s. 1 Income per capita
(US$400 in 2008 as per the Bank's Atlas methodology) is low compared to Sub-Saharan Africa




1
    Its population is growing at 2.5 percent annually.


                                                         2
(US$1,082) and Low Income Countries (US$524) averages. 2 As a result, poverty has deepened
in rural areas and pockets of extreme poverty exist in urban areas, including the capital.

2.3     Weak public financial management and excessive public debt have led to large
accumulation of arrears. To support the Government's financing needs, arrears were
accumulated and the large state-owned companies were tapped to provide advances to the
Treasury. The situation was aggravated by pervasive mismanagement, leading to large losses by
these state-owned enterprises, in particular in the cotton and phosphate sectors. The phosphate
sector's exports dropped by more than half in a few years, from FCFA 33 billion in 2001 to
FCFA 15 billion in 2007. However, phosphate exports reached FCFA 40.2 billion in 2009 due to
favorable international prices. The cotton sector's exports fell from a peak of FCFA 51.8 billion
in 2003 to FCFA 7.9 billion in 2009. As a result of the dire financial situation of the main
parastatals, several banks were burdened by an excessive share of non-performing loans, and
some were highly undercapitalized.

2.4     Weak management of key state-owned companies, whose losses have been financed
by the public treasury, eroded resources for vital public services. As a result, expenditures on
health, education and public investment have been far below regional averages. A household
survey carried out in 2006 3 found that the incidence of poverty was 62 percent nationally, with
rural areas accounting for the majority of the poor (74 percent versus 37 percent in urban areas).
While some progress has been achieved towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), notably for the goal of universal primary education and the combat of HIV/AIDS, most
of the goals are unlikely to be met by 2015. 4 Despite sustained efforts, the country is unlikely to
achieve the goals in the following areas by 2015: (i) eradicate extreme poverty, (ii) promote
gender equality, (iii) reduce child mortality, (iv) improve maternal health, and (v) ensure
environmental sustainability.

2.5    The business environment is constrained by two decades of underinvestment in
infrastructure (notably transport and energy) and poor governance. Institutional capacity
declined during the long socio-political crisis and donor disengagement. There is a significant
backlog in maintaining health facilities, schools and infrastructure in general. Furthermore,
Togo's economy has been hit by a number of internal and external shocks in 2008 and 2009 -
flooding in certain parts of the country, the impact of high food and energy world prices, the
Euro appreciation (to which the CFAF is pegged) vis-à-vis the US dollar, and most notably the
2009 global economic slowdown.

2.6     Togo began emerging from its socio-political crisis in 2005. The 2007 parliamentary
elections, 5 deemed free and transparent by the international community, marked a

  The survey was conducted by the Togolese Government's General Statistics Department, funded in part by IDA
and other donors (UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA).

  The assessment was undertaken by the Government of Togo with support of the UNDP. The report, titled "Suivi
des Objectifs du Millenaire pour le Developpement au Togo ­ Deuxieme Rapport ­ Octobre 2008" ("Monitoring of
the MDGs in Togo ­ Second Report ­ October 2008"), was validated by the Government in December 2008.
5
  After the death in 2005 of President Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who led Togo for 38 years, Togo undertook a national
reconciliation process that culminated in multiparty parliamentary elections on October 14, 2007. International
observers considered the elections free and transparent.

milestone in Togo's democratization process followed by donors' reengagement and
support. After the resumption of EU cooperation in November 2007 (following satisfactory
completion of the last EU re-engagement criterion, i.e. transparent legislative elections) and the
government's launching of economic reforms, several others donors actively re-engaged with the
country. In this context, the first Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG) formed
part of a coordinated and interlinked strategy with the IMF, the African Development Bank
(AfDB) and other donor agencies to clear Togo's arrears, resume normal relations with the
country and support the governments' program of economic reforms. In April 2008, the IMF
Board approved the three-year ECF-supported program. The clearance of arrears and the
launching of governance and transparency reforms paved the way for Togo toward debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, and strengthened the foundation for economic and social
recovery.

2.7     Significant progress has been made in strengthening governance. The Togolese
authorities have implemented a wide range of public financial management reforms in the areas
of budget preparation, budget execution, budget controls and public procurement. Timely
presentation of budgets to the Parliament takes place, a functional classification of expenditure
has been introduced and Medium-term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) have been adopted for
two key ministries (Education and Health) to ensure pro-poor spending. The Treasury has been
reorganized (with separation of core treasury functions: accounting, revenue and payment) and a
computerized management information system (SIGFIP) has been introduced. An internal audit
and inspection unit and a Court of Accounts have been created and staffed. A procurement law
and code have been adopted and a Public Procurement Office created. Following an external
audit of Togo's large domestic arrears, a strategy for clearing these arrears has been adopted and
implementation has started. Two financial audits of the state-owned cotton company, a strategic
audit of the sector, clearance of the cotton company's arrears to farmers, as well as the
introduction of internal controls and cost savings have strengthened the cotton sector
management and paved the way for broader sector reform. The authorities have prepared a
strategy to strengthen Togo's fragile state-owned banks and placed the largest bank under new
management and oversight. Furthermore, the authorities have established a Board of Directors
for the electricity utility company, adopted new statutes harmonized with WAEMU corporate
law and appointed a new general manager.

2.8     Overall, Togo has achieved considerable progress during the past three years, but
significant institutional and economic challenges remain, including: (i) poor governance
record and low administrative capacity due to the long period of socio-political conflict,
mismanagement of public resources, and lack of foreign assistance; (ii) a large stock of domestic
arrears that will have to be gradually paid down over time; (iii) a crisis in the energy sector, with
demand exceeding capacity, resulting in frequent power outages; (iv) the loss-making state-
owned enterprises; (v) a poor business environment; and (vi) deteriorated social conditions.
Having reached its HIPC decision point in November 2008, Togo is expected to attain the
completion point in end 2010, a milestone which would significantly reduce its debt burden and
free up fiscal space over time. 67 The decision point also opened the door to new multilateral and

  The HIPC process would enable Togo's external public debt to decline from 396 percent of revenues in 2007 to 65
percent after the completion point.

bilateral resources, critical to finance Togo's poverty reduction strategy. To revive the economy
and reduce poverty, the Togolese authorities are seeking to consolidate macroeconomic stability
and advance priority structural reforms, while securing stepped-up technical and financial
assistance from development partners.

2.9     Togo's economy was severely affected by the surge in global food and fuel prices as
well as heavy flooding in the summer of 2008 that affected key transport infrastructure and
damaged agricultural output. Togo has been among the most adversely affected economies by
the 2008 global price shocks, reflecting the high fuel imports of Togo's transport, industry, and
power sectors. Surging food prices created social tensions in the first half of 2008 and eroded
real incomes, particularly for urban dwellers. In addition, the flooding destroyed critical
infrastructure including Togo's main traffic artery from the Port of Lomé to the landlocked
countries in the north, paralyzing Togo's vital trade and transport sector and disrupting exports
of goods and services. Floods also reduced cotton production.

2.10 The global recession in 2009 contributed to further delay the economic recovery. In
spite of the implementation of countercyclical fiscal policies, real GDP growth is estimated at 2.5
percent in 2009, whereas earlier projections pointed to a 4 percent rate of GDP growth. The
impact of the global economic slowdown is estimated to have been particularly strong on FDI,
remittances and re-exports. The gross value of re-exports declined from the equivalent of 25
percent of GDP in 2007 to 14 percent in 2009 (also as a result of the deterioration in
infrastructure caused by flooding) while FDI fell from an average of 3 percent of GDP during the
period 2004-07 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, the decline in real GDP per capita
was stopped but not reversed, as per capita GDP growth improved from -0.8 percent in 2008 to -
0.1 percent in 2009. In spite of the difficult context, the authorities have maintained prudent
macroeconomic policies and continued the implementation of an ambitious reform agenda.

2.11 Stability was maintained in the monetary sector and the fixed exchange regime with
the Euro, both determined by Togo's membership in the regional monetary union (West
African Economic and Monetary Union ­ WAEMU). Togo's fiscal policy is consistent with
the monetary policy set by the regional monetary authority and with maintaining price stability.
In 2008, broad money growth was estimated to be 15.9 percent due to high food and fuel prices
and inflation is estimated to have increased to 8.4 percent. In 2009, broad money growth is
estimated at 13.1 percent. As a result of the slow growth and the decline in global energy and
food prices as well as an increase in domestic food production in second half of 2009, inflation is
estimated to have dropped sharply to 3.1 percent. Credit to the non-government sector has
continued to be anemic reflecting the still incomplete process of bank restructuring. It is
estimated to have increased by 0.5 percent in 2009 (it decreased by 2.4 percent in 2008).

2.12 The current account deficit worsened in 2008 and 2009 compared to 2007. It stood
at around 7.0 per cent of GDP in 2008 and 2009 compared to 3.9 percent in 2007. This is
due to sluggish exports (due to problems in the management of the cotton and phosphates sectors
and the global economic slowdown) and growing imports as the economy starts to rebound.
Exports represented approximately 27.5 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009 compared to 26.3
percent in 2007. Furthermore, transit and re-exports declined by 35 percent in 2009 compared to


                                                5
2007, largely explained by the global slowdown and the deterioration in infrastructure caused by
the flooding. On the other hand, imports increased from 40 percent of GDP in 2007 to 44.8
percent in 2008 and to 45.2 percent in 2009. The deterioration of the current account balance
combined with lower FDI (in 2009 it declined 64 percent compared to 2007 and 44 percent
compared to 2008) led to the worsening of the balance of payments. Private transfers remained
stable in 2009 and slightly above the 2007 levels. Pressures on the balance of payments were
temporarily offset by the additional IMF SDR allocation of 59.4 million. The external balance
was mostly financed by central bank net foreign assets and exceptional financing ­ ECF
financing and augmentation. Gross international reserves (months of imports) are estimated to
have increased to 4.5 months by end December 2009 compared to 4.1 months in 2008 and 3.0
months in 2007, due primarily to a one-off increase from the IMF SDR allocation.

2.13 Fiscal policy has been sound and the Togolese authorities continue demonstrating
their commitment to fiscal prudence and expenditure management. Overall fiscal deficit (on
payment order basis) as a share of GDP amounted to 1.9 percent in 2007, 0.9 percent in 2008 and
is estimated to have reached 2.4 percent in 2009. In net terms the internal balance was financed
with domestic flows (from the banking system) as net external financing was negative due to
large amortizations. Togo maintained its prudent fiscal stance in 2008 and in 2009 despite the
significant external and domestic shocks, to maintain its near-balanced primary fiscal position.
The primary fiscal balance in 2008 attained a slight surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP, falling
slightly to -0.3 percent of GDP in 2009. Revenue increase efforts have continued improving
through strengthened tax administration, improved tax collection from large taxpayers and the
fight against tax evasion, despite the impact of the global economic slowdown of the economy.

2.14     Current expenditures were higher than expected in 2009 due to the heavy front-
loading of spending for emergency needs, largely as a response to the global economic
slowdown. In June 2009, the authorities enacted a supplementary budget to support economic
recovery by enhancing pro-growth fiscal measures. Over-performance of revenues financed
investment spending and clearance of domestic arrears. As a result, public investment is
estimated to have increased sharply in 2009 to 6.8 percent of GDP compared to 3.5 percent in
2008 and 2.0 percent in 2007. Nonetheless, execution rate of public investment continues to be
low (70 percent) due to capacity constraints. The 2010 budget continues to support economic
activity in the context of the lingering effects of the global economic downturn. Initiatives for
priority sectors will increase spending modestly. The total public investment is expected to
increase to 7.1 percent of GDP. This temporary fiscal relaxation is appropriate under the current
circumstances. As a result, the overall deficit is projected to increase to 4 percent of GDP.

2.15 Nevertheless, fiscal risks remain important. One source of fiscal risks is that CEET's
(Togo's Electric Energy Company) financial sustainability is not assured, reflecting structural
deficiencies in addition to price considerations. The current electricity rates in Togo do not allow
CEET to cover its additional costs resulting from a decision to end the power outages with high
cost thermal power. These losses are eventually covered every year by the State budget. During
the past years CEET received approximately 6 billion CFA francs annually to cover fuel costs
and cover the effect of tariff freezing. In addition to the financial situation of CEET, there are
other sources of contingent liabilities in the energy sector. As a response to the sharp increase in
fuel prices in 2007 and 2008, the government decided not to implement the adjustment
mechanism for petroleum products that led to an accumulation of contingent liabilities of about


                                                 6
1-1.5 percent of GDP. 8 There is not a full provision for these (and other) subsidies in the budget
and subsidies of one year are carried forward to the next years' budget as a result of the practice
of accounting for expenditures only when payment is made. That practice understates the current
fiscal position, and thus the budget is not providing adequate support for planning and
monitoring current year spending priorities against current year resources.

2.16 A critical measure for macroeconomic stability and effective financial
intermediation is the restructuring of the ailing state-owned banks. The Government's short-
term priority is to restructure the banking sector and formulate a financial sector development
strategy. The Government initiated the process by strengthening bank monitoring and developing
a bank restructuring strategy based on the recommendations of the WAEMU Banking
Commission and technical advice provided by the IMF and World Bank. Progress has been
achieved with the restructuring of state owned banks (BTCI, UTB, BTD and BIA) in December
2008 through the securitization of non-performing loans which led to the improvement of bank's
solvency ratios. The Government intends to continue the reform in the sector including by
pursuing the privatization of state owned banks in the short-run.

2.17 The government continues to successfully implement the three-year IMF-supported
ECF arrangement and the IMF Board completed its third review in November 2009, with all
quantitative and structural performance criteria met. Preliminary results from the fourth review
mission in April 2010 indicate that the program remains on track (see IMF Assessment Letter in
Annex 7). The ECF-supported program aims to revive economic growth and improve living
conditions within a stable macroeconomic environment by (i) bringing public debt to a
sustainable level through gradual fiscal adjustment and HIPC/MDRI debt relief; (ii) facilitating
the resumption of external assistance; (iii) increasing resources for infrastructure, health, and
education; (iv) strengthening fiscal governance; (v) restructuring fragile banks; and (vi)
reforming the business environment and state-owned enterprises.

2.18 Overall, the global economic slowdown has impeded economic recovery and
contributed to the widening of the fiscal and current account deficits. As discussed above,
the global economic slowdown affected particularly exports, transportation services and FDI,
resulting in a lower-than-expected rate of growth in 2009. The near-term prospects point to the
continuation of sluggish growth. To counter that, authorities will continue implementing counter-
cyclical fiscal measures in 2010. The 2010 budget (as well as the 2009 budget) includes
increases in domestically financed investments which will lead to an increase in the fiscal deficit.
The crisis response window in the amount of US$ 4.3 million will contribute to improve Togo's
fiscal position.

                       C. M ACROECONOMIC O UTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

2.19 The medium-term macroeconomic outlook (2010-12) is based on the assumption of a
recovery after several years of political and economic crisis as donors reengage and
confidence returns, but a slow recovery from the financial crisis poses significant risks to
macroeconomic stability and growth. A modest rebound is expected in 2010-12 (see Table 1),
following several international and domestic shocks in 2008 and 2009, but it will depend
critically on resumption of donor-financed public investment offsetting the drag on growth
expected from the slow recovery from the global slowdown. A further economic revival will
require improved business confidence, growing regional trade, and a rebound in cotton and
phosphate production after the collapse of recent years. Over the medium-term, growth would be
sustained by higher foreign direct investment (e.g. in banking, telecoms and phosphate sectors,
and the port), improved financial intermediation and upgrades to public infrastructure, especially
electricity which would alleviate bottlenecks that previously stymied private sector growth.
Togo's medium-term growth potential largely relies on its comparative advantage as a transit
corridor to neighboring countries and its deep port facilities at Lomé, its past reputation as a
strong regional financial center and its potential to further develop services around these
activities.

    Baseline scenario does not assume debt relief.

2.20 Despite the recent price shocks, inflation is expected to be contained over the
medium term, anchored in the WAEMU currency union and fiscal prudence consistent
with the regional monetary policy stance. The regional monetary-exchange arrangement is
expected to ensure monetary and price stability with inflation at about 2.5 percent in the
medium-term. Nonetheless, inflation could be erratic in case of unfavorable weather conditions
(droughts or the recent heavy floods) or further volatility in world food and oil prices.

2.21 External conditions are likely to remain challenging in the medium-term. Togo's
current account deficit is projected at about 7 percent of GDP over the period 2010-12, with
imports projected to remain high at approximately 45 percent of GDP as foreign aid is absorbed.
The balance of payments will stay vulnerable to terms of trade shocks (in particular from oil
prices), further exchange rate volatility of the Euro (to which Togo's currency value is fixed) vis-
à-vis the US dollar and confidence shocks that could lower remittances and FDI. Exports are
expected to remain at approximately 28 percent of GDP in the medium term due to the weaker
global growth and demand despite the expected recovery of Togo's phosphate and cotton sectors.
Furthermore, long-term export growth will remain somewhat constrained by limited
competitiveness and Togo's poor business environment.

2.22 Togo's fiscal policy will aim to continue to be consistent with the WAEMU
monetary and exchange rate policies. The envisaged small primary fiscal deficit of 1.4, 0.4 and
0.3 percent of GDP in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively, would be a step towards a sustainable
medium-term fiscal position. Revenues are expected to remain at around 18 percent of GDP,
while expenditures and net lending are projected to stay at around 25 percent of GDP, slightly
higher than in 2007 and 2008 (20 percent of GDP) mainly due to an increase in public
investment ­ expected to be at around 7 percent of GDP in the period 2010-12 compared to 2
percent and 3.5 percent in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

2.23 The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
operation. The government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record in
maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium term. The
framework is supported by an IMF ECF program which has been on-track since the three-year
arrangement was approved in April 2008.

2.24 Togo reached its HIPC decision point on November 25, 2008 after establishing a six
month track record of reform under the ECF and reaching agreement with Bank and Fund staffs
on completion point triggers. With the reaching of the decision point, Togo was granted Cologne
terms for debt relief by the Paris Club and negotiated a rescheduling agreement with several
multilateral and non Paris Club creditors. The Government cleared its arrears to the World Bank
Group in May 2008 and its arrears to AfDB in July 2008. No new external arrears have been
accumulated since then and only concessional debts have been contracted.

2.25 Togo's domestic debt burden is comparatively large, reflecting years of weak fiscal
management and domestic arrears accumulation, as well as the need to recapitalize ailing
banks. Domestic debt has declined steadily from 28.1 percent of GDP in 2007, to 25.1 percent
in 2008 and 23.6 percent in 2009 (estimated). Based on a February 2009 audit by KPMG,
validated domestic arrears to suppliers (private and public) through December 2006 amounted to
6 percent of GDP. Small claims (below US$30,000) which correspond to 87 percent of the


                                                 9
claims were cleared in cash in 2009. The remaining larger claims will be cleared in 2010.
Furthermore, the government cleared all arrears to cotton farmers in 2007, and cleared arrears on
civil service salaries and pensions in 2008.

2.26 Despite the improvement in debt dynamics, Togo remains in debt distress. Total
public sector external debt reached 82.1 percent of GDP in end 2007, declined to 60.6 percent in
2008, and is estimated to have declined further to 58.1 percent in 2009. External public debt
service as percent of exports has been declining steadily since 2007 (7.5 percent in 2007, 5.3
percent in 2008 and 3.8 percent in 2009). Despite the improvement in debt management in 2008
and 2009 the joint Word Bank-Fund DSA conducted in October 2009, shows that Togo remains
in debt distress, despite the large debt reduction achieved through arrears clearance and by
reaching the decision point of the HIPC Initiative. Under the baseline scenario, the PV-based
indicators remain well above their indicative thresholds for most of the projection period,
emphasizing the importance for additional debt relief, which is expected upon reaching the
completion point. The completion point is expected for late 2010. The following triggers still
need to be met for the completion in end 2010: (i) submission of the Annual Progress Report on
the PRSP implementation to the IDA and IMF; (ii) submission of the draft Budget Execution
Law and draft General Treasury Balance to the Court of Accounts and Parliament for at least one
fiscal year preceding the completion point 10; (iii) the nomination of the managerial staff of the
Procurement Regulatory Authority; (iv) the publication of the implementation of regular public
reporting of payments to, and revenues received by, the government for the phosphates sector in
line with this aspect of the EITI criteria, with a recent annual report during at least the year
immediately preceding the year in which the completion point is reached; 11 and (v) publication
of an annual report providing accurate and complete data on external and domestic public debt,
within six months after the end of the year. 12 Assuming full delivery of HIPC and MDRI upon
completion it is projected that the PV Public debt to GDP ratio will decline from 75 percent in
2009 to 35 percent in 2010.

                       3. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM

3.1     In June 2009, Togo adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which
builds on the strategy laid out in the Interim Strategy for Poverty Reduction (I-PRSP). The
PRSP was presented to the Boards of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International
Development Association (IDA) in November and December, 2009, respectively. Drawing on
lessons learnt from the implementation of the I-PRSP, the full PRSP lays out the strategy for
growth and poverty reduction for the period 2009-2011. The PRSP is coupled with a Plan of
Priority Actions (PAP) which details the pluri-annual planning of actions, programs and
measures. The ultimate objective of the PRSP is to achieve effective and sustainable
improvement of people's living conditions by addressing the principal causes of poverty.




10
      Draft of the 2008 Budget Execution law and 2008 State Accounts are expected to be sent by March 2010.

      2008 Report is published on the government website (www.togoreforme.tg).

3.2     The PRSP is a comprehensive strategy covering most of the challenges and areas of
action to foster growth and reduce poverty. It is based on four strategic pillars, with the first
three common to the I-PRSP, which are supported by the ISN: 13

        (i)    the strengthening of governance, with a focus on political, institutional and
               economic governance;
        (ii)   consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth with measures to reform
               state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, improve the business
               environment, strengthen regional integration and trade, revive agricultural
               production, rehabilitate infrastructure, and improve management of natural
               resources and the environment;
        (iii) development of human capital with a focus on improving access to and the quality
              of basic education and health services; and
        (iv) reduction of regional imbalances and promotion of community development.
For these pillars, the PRSP integrates cross-cutting themes related to the environment,
HIV/AIDS, gender and human rights.

3.3     The process of preparation of the PRSP encompassed the participation of all
development actors and regions, thus ensuring that the PRSP articulates the identified
country's priorities to reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth. It involved the
private sector, religious groups, the non-government organizations, the Parliament and the
technical and financial partners. There were three main levels of expanded consultation: (i)
drafting and adoption of the road map of the process; (ii) diagnostic phase; and (iii) final drafting
of the PRSP. The development partners, including the World Bank and IMF, were consulted at
these various stages in order to facilitate implementation of the principle of alignment advocated
in the Paris Declaration.

3.4     The ERGG-3 will continue to support the implementation of the Government
reform agenda. The proposed operation would continue to engage the Bank in policy and
technical dialogue in the same two pillars as ERGG and ERGG-2: (i) the strengthening of
governance with the aim of improving budget formulation, execution and controls, and public
procurement; and (ii) consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth including
through reforms in key sectors of the economy (phosphate, cotton and energy sectors). ERGG
and ERGG-2 also supported reforms in the financial sector. Based on the principle of division of
labor with other IDA and donor projects this sector is not covered by the ERGG-3 as it is
currently supported by the IMF ECF program and the IDA financed Financial Sector and
Governance TA (FSG) project approved by the Board in March 2009. 14 The financial support
provided through the ERGG-3 will further narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key
elements of the PRSP and resources available from the Government's own domestic revenues
and other donor support. The next sections highlight the salient features of the current situation
in these areas of reform as well as the Government's main areas of policy efforts and specific

promoting economic recovery and sustainable development; and (iii) addressing urgent social needs.

Current issues

3.5      The Government has taken critical steps to strengthen public expenditure
management. Nonetheless, important challenges remain. Togo has established a track record
on fiscal management and accounting reforms since mid-2006 under the IMF Staff Monitored
Program, the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and the IDA-financed ERGG and
ERGG-2. Recent analytical work - the 2009 Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR) - notes that the budget performance has improved since the
2006 PEMFAR, being mainly driven by reforms of tax and customs administration and better
expenditure management. Nevertheless, it also indicates that there are outstanding public
expenditure management challenges that should be addressed. These challenges include the need
to: (i) enhance the quality of the budget and its preparation, in particular improve consultation
with spending ministries and full compliance with the statutory budget calendar to ensure
sufficient review of the budget by the Parliament; (ii) ensure a better monitoring of the public
entities other than the state; (iii) better align the composition of expenditures with the initially
approved budgets and with the priorities of the country's poverty reduction strategy; (iv) increase
the share of spending of priority sectors; (v) improve the budget information management system
through computerization; (vi) disseminate information on the budget and its execution, as well as
improve the quality and coverage of such information; (vii) reduce the level of transfers and
subsidies to internationally comparable norms, in order to expand the fiscal space available for
priority expenditures; (viii) provide training, equipment and materials to the Court of Accounts;
and (ix) strengthen the internal audit and inspection unit.

3.6    In the area of public procurement, the major weaknesses identified by the 2009
PEMFAR are as follows: (i) the legal and regulatory framework in force does not permit strict
observance of the fundamental principles of transparency, equity of treatment, and economy
applicable to public procurement, and more specifically encourages the use of non-competitive
and sole source methods; (ii) the current institutional framework is ineffective and the national
tender board (CNM) has too broad a role, combining the regulatory and control functions, and
inadequate capacity; and (iii) the audits, internal and external controls, and anti-corruption
measures are non-existent or ineffective, and none of the procurement related information is
disseminated.

The Government's reform program

3.7     On the basis of the PEMFAR, the Ministry has prepared a detailed action plan to
strengthen the country's public finance management and improve the efficiency of public
resources use. The draft of this plan has been discussed with development partners during a
workshop in June 2009. The proposed program of reforms is comprehensive and covers most of
the weaknesses identified in the PEMFAR. The next steps are to improve the sequencing of the
short and medium term actions for PFM reform, taking into account capacity constraints.




                                                12
3.8       The following actions illustrate the scope of recent actions taken by the authorities:

      ·   submission of the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budgets to the Parliament before the end of the
          fiscal year;
      ·   introduction of a monthly dashboard for monitoring budget execution;
      ·   introduction since 2008 budget of a line item to cover force majeure expenditures
          (national catastrophe, etc.) to enhance transparency of public expenditures;
      ·   elimination of the use of exceptional payment authorizations without ex-ante budget line
          identification (ordres de paiement sans télégramme lettre), except for the servicing of
          external debt;
      ·   implementation of a mechanism to track public expenditures for poverty reduction on the
          basis of a functional expenditure classification, starting with the 2009 budget, and
          publication of reports on these expenditures;
      ·   introduction in 2008 and 2009 of the set of WAEMU Directives (Budget framework,
          Public accounting, classification, chart of account) in its internal law;
      ·   preparation of two medium term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) in priority ministries
          (Education and Health) that accompany the 2010 budget so as to ensure that priorities in
          the PRSP in these sectors are adequately reflected in the budget;
      ·   implementation in September 2009 of a new computerized payroll system based on a
          single database to manage the wage and salaries bill. This new tool that replaces an
          obsolete system has interface with the SIGFIP;
      ·   extension of the integrated budget execution information system (SIGFIP) to the
          Treasury through the implementation of the accounting module, to strengthen the efficacy
          and transparency of budget execution. The extension was implemented in January 2010
          and the first report will be produced in February 2010;
      ·   render operational the Court of Accounts by adopting a legal framework (Organic law on
          attribution, organization and functioning of the Court of Account ­ adopted in March
          2009) and by appointing its judges in June 2009;
      ·   submission of the 2007 budget execution law to the Court of Accounts;
      ·   preparation and implementation of a procedures manual for the General Finance
          Inspectorate and implementation of programmed missions in its work program since
          2009; and
      ·   starting implementation of the domestic arrears clearance strategy and setting up a
          mechanism for monitoring domestic debt. This will help restore supplier confidence and
          liquidity, while stretching the budget cost over several years. The implementation of the
          strategy started in 2009 with small claimers.




                                                 13
The ongoing actions include:

      ·   continued implementation of the domestic arrears clearance strategy. Clearance of larger
          claimers will be addressed in 2010;
      ·   reinforce the internal control by providing training for internal control staff on risk-based
          financial control procedures;
      ·   preparation of the 2008 budget execution law;
      ·   move to a single treasury account at the central bank (BCEAO) by censing accounts
          opened in commercial banks; and
      ·   strengthened treasury management through the establishment of a bi-weekly ledger of
          funds in the commercial banks;

3.9     Acknowledging the need to improve the procurement system, the Government has
taken steps to address the most urgent issues in this respect, including the adoption of an
action plan for public procurement reforms based on the 2003 CPAR. In 2009, the
Government made progress in the implementation of agreed procurement reform actions. In June
and November 2009, respectively, it adopted the new procurement law and the new procurement
code, which are now in line with WAEMU Procurement Guidelines. The government has also
adopted a procurement reform action plan, based on the assessment provided in the 2009
PEMFAR using the OECD/DAC Baseline Indicators (BLI) Methodology. A decree was
published revising the national competitive bidding threshold to the equivalent of US$50,000
(down from US$200,000). The contracts awards are advertised on the Government website 15 and
in the news paper `l'Entrepreneur'.

3.10 Furthermore, the Government plans to implement additional actions to further
strengthen the public procurement system. During the preparation of the PEMFAR report, the
Government agreed to base the procurement reform on a medium and long term vision which
will contribute to improve transparency and efficiency of the system in line with the WAEMU
Procurement Guidelines and international good practices. Specific actions planned by the
Government include:

      ·   a roadmap to implement the information management system for public procurement
          (SIGMAP) and connection to the SIGFIP system;
      ·   publication of the texts on the establishment and organization of the entity (public
          procurement regulatory authority) for the regulation and oversight of public procurement,
          appointment of its key officials, and approval of its operating budget;
      ·   publication of the texts on the establishment and organization of the entity (public
          procurement directorate) for controlling procurement transactions handled by the
          contracting authorities, appointment of its key officials, and approval of its operating
          budget;
      ·   continue regular dissemination of information about public procurement contracts;

   ·   develop a legal framework for Public and Private Partnership.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-3

3.11 The proposed ERGG-3 would support policy actions critical to deepening PFM
reforms, including reforms to improve public procurement. The prior actions are the
following:

       (i)    Publish the 2009 quarterly budget execution reports; and (ii) Submit to the
              Parliament the draft 2010 budget law with a medium term expenditure framework
              (MTEF) for two priority ministries (Education and Health);
       (ii)   Make available at least 80 percent of the allocations for poverty reduction activities,
              upon authorization of expenditures for the priority ministries by end February, and
              the final 20 percent by end October;
       (iii) Install and make operational the SIGFIP information system in the Treasury
             department;
       (iv) Prepare and implement a procedures manual for the General Finance Inspectorate;
       (v)    Establish and make operational the Court of Accounts as evidenced by (a) the
              issuance of the implementation decree of the Organic Law that creates the Court of
              Accounts; (b) the adoption of the law that defines the statute of the Court of
              Accounts; (c) the provision of adequate budget;
       (vi) Establish and make operational the General Procurement Department; and create
            commissions to conduct ex-ante procurement control (Service de contrôle des
            marchés publics - SCMP) in at least five priority ministries and the Lomé municipal
            office.

3.12 Other critical PFM actions have been identified as HIPC completion triggers, aimed
at further enhancing transparency in budget formulation and budget controls, including on
poverty-reducing expenditures. Specifically, these are: (i) adoption of a mechanism to track
public expenditures for poverty reduction on the basis of a functional expenditure classification
and publication of at least two quarterly reports on these expenditures covering a period of at
least two consecutive quarters preceding the completion point; (ii) appointment of judges for the
Court of Accounts, provided with work space, equipment and materials, and submission of the
draft Budget Execution law and draft General Treasury Balance to the Court of Accounts and
Parliament for at least one fiscal year preceding the completion point; (iii) adoption of a decree
creating the Procurement Regulatory Authority in conformity with the WAEMU Procurement
Directives, nomination of its managerial staff, and providing them with an adequate budget; and
monthly publication in a public procurement gazette or on a government website of a summary
of all signed contracts, including sole source contracts and concessions, for at least six months
immediately preceding the completion point; (iv) consolidation of external and domestic debt
data under a single unit charged with all public debt; and (v) publication of an annual report
providing accurate and complete data on external and domestic public debt, within six months




                                                 15

Current issues

3.13 The cotton sector's share in the economy has fallen in recent years due to weak
sector governance and performance. Cotton is the country's main cash crop: its share in
exports accounted for 19.3 percent of total exports in 2003, but declined to 2.6 percent in 2009
(estimated). Nevertheless, cotton is potentially an important source of income, as 300,000
farmers (half of the rural labor force) used to cultivate cotton in the early 2000s, and many of
them would return to cotton if the sector organization improves. As most of these farmers are in
the poorer Northern and Central parts of the country, the impact on poverty could be substantial.
The decline in cotton production was the result of weak management and governance in the
sector, in addition to lower international cotton prices and reduced producer prices which were
also affected by the appreciation of the Euro (to which the CFAF is pegged) to the US dollar.
The weak management and governance of SOTOCO's (Société Togolaise de Coton), the state-
owned cotton and marketing company, resulted in accumulated arrears due to producers and
growing internal debts within producers groups, which discouraged production. Weak
procurement procedures and governance problems contributed to major losses for SOTOCO.
Moreover, the cotton parastatal's financial losses were a drain on the public treasury, and its non-
performing loans with local banks undermined the banking sector's overall capacity to finance
the economy. From 2003 to 2009, SOTOCO was the sole buyer in the market. 16

3.14 To restore the confidence of farmers and creditors in the cotton sector, the major
challenge of the Government is to increase the efficiency of its cotton ginning and
marketing company. This restructuring process of the cotton sector entails measures to improve
its management and governance structure through privatization and other measures, and to
ensure that farmers participate in the decision making process. Cotton production could be a
major source of growth in the short to medium-term, as well as an important activity for poverty
reduction given its prominence in the poorest regions of the country. The challenge therefore is
for the Government to have a program that would considerably reduce seed cotton processing
costs, ensure farmers a timely payment and increase the farmers' share of the world market price.
A system of full farmer and private sector participation in the sector's management would help
to achieve these objectives. To address the challenge, the Government liquidated SOTOCO in
early 2009, and created la Nouvelle Société Cotonnière du Togo (NSCT), with farmer
participation in the capital (40 percent) and on the Board. The Government also declared its
intention to open up the capital of NSCT to a private operator in the near future.

3.15 The transition towards the privatization of the NSCT faces several challenges that
need to be addressed. The NSCT is oversized, which entails fixed costs that are higher than the
ones assumed by the price model. The production for the 2009-2010 campaign only reached
25,000 tons (well below the 80,000 tons capacity). Poor performance is explained by several
16
  There were two private companies involved in the sector in a minor way- the Swiss-Malian Société Industrielle
du Coton (SICOT) and the French-American Société de Production Industrielle du Coton (SOPIC) - but both went
bankrupt due to the lack of seed cotton.


                                                      16
factors: (i) late transition between SOTOCO and NSCT (the recruitment of NSCT staff was
finalized at the end of the production campaign); (ii) lack of workers' motivation during the
liquidation phase of SOTOCO; (iii) lack of information at producer level which has not
encouraged restoring producers' confidence; (iv) lack of input and credit management which has
aggravated debt accumulation by a number of farmers using the cotton fertilizers on other crops
to the detriment of cotton producers; (v) the Fédération Nationale des GPC has not been able to
fully exert its shareholder attributions in the NSCT. Restoring the cotton company's
performance and strengthening the role of cotton producers are thus critical first steps towards
future participation in the sector of a private operator.

The Government's reform program

3.16 The Government completed two financial audits of SOTOCO and a strategic audit.
The findings of the financial audits highlighted pervasive commercial and financial
mismanagement across all layers of the company, and notably in procurement, which led to
large financial losses and mounting debts, including arrears to cotton farmers. The authorities
have initiated efforts to strengthen financial controls following the replacement of SOTOCO's
senior management in 2005, and to define and implement a medium-term cotton sector reform
program based on the results of the audits. This includes efforts to attract new strategic
investors. Actions recently taken or ongoing include:

   ·   adoption in January 2009 of a new cotton purchase price mechanism linked to world
       cotton fiber prices to ensure that the price the cotton company pays for seed cotton is fair
       for producers and enables it to be efficient and profitable in view of conditions in the
       international market in which the company's cotton fiber output is sold;
   ·   implementation of a mechanism to ensure adequate financing of inputs for the 2009-2010
       crop season as soon as the new cotton company was established; and
   ·   development of a regulatory framework for the cotton sector that specifies the roles,
       responsibilities and obligations of sector stakeholders.

   ·   development and application of a reliable management information and cost accounting
       system to reinforce the financial management; this system is expected to be in place by
       mid 2010.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-3

3.17 The proposed ERGG-3 would support two policy actions judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the cotton sector, namely:

       (i)    Prepare an assessment report on NSCT's management information and cost
              accounting system that proposes the design for the new accounting system software;
              and
       (ii)   Main stakeholders adopt the regulatory framework for the cotton sector that
              specifies the roles, responsibilities and obligations of sector stakeholders and the
              mechanisms to make effective the representation of the producers at the Board of
              the NSCT.

Current issues

3.18 The weaknesses of the phosphate sector - weak sector governance resulting in
reduction in operating capacity, weak sector performance, and high production costs - did
not allow Togo to take full advantage of the recently high world phosphate prices. Togo
was among the five largest producers of phosphates in Africa in the 1990s exporting more than 3
million tons. Due to a dramatic decrease in production, Togo is currently below the 14th largest
producers. Production was at its highest at 2.7 million metric tons in 1996. In 2009 production is
estimated at 700,000 tons. Production is currently below one quarter of capacity. The decline in
output reflects the failure to properly maintain and modernize equipment, electricity shortages as
well as major governance problems. In particular, the lack of financing for adequate modern
equipment and of diversification of its downstream activities (production of phosphoric acid) did
not allow the state-owned Société Nouvelle des Phosphates du Togo (SNPT) 17 to take advantage
of a short-lived surge in world phosphate prices (from about US$40 for most of the decade to an
average of US$350/ton in 2008 and around US$90/ton in mid-2009). The mineral port in Kpémé,
whose location is adjacent to the plant, is also aging.

3.19 The sector's weaknesses have led to a drop in the sector's share of total exports,
from 16 percent in 2001 to 6 percent in 2007. As a result of these inefficiencies, Togo's
phosphates are ranked in the high quartile of the global cost curve for the current level of
production, with total revenues barely covering total costs at the US$70 to US$80 price range.
While prices are expected to remain in the US$90 to US$100 range, reform is essential in order
to bring average costs down so as to generate the profits necessary for urgently needed re-
investment, as well as producing substantial taxes and dividends for the benefit of the national
budget. Togo's phosphates are of relatively high quality and easily accessible and should be very
competitive if properly managed.

3.20 Attempts at private sector partnership to revive the sector have not been successful.
The private-public partnership in phosphate mining dates back to 1957 when Compagnie
Togolaise des Mines du Benin (CTMB) was established with majority private ownership. In
1974, responding to a wave of nationalism, the State increased its shareholding from 35 percent
to 51 percent and eventually decided to take full ownership. Six years later, CTMB changed its
name to Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP) with full state control of production and
marketing. Poor governance and mismanagement eroded productivity and drove OTP to near
bankruptcy, with losses to the banking system estimated at US$35 million. In 2001, the
government initiated a rehabilitation program emphasizing private participation and management
for a quick turn-around of the sector performance. Thus the International Fertiliser Group-Togo
(IFG-Togo) was formed as a 50/50 joint venture between the Togolese state and Brifco, a private
French-Tunisian operator. IFG-Togo signed a 40-month management agreement with a mission
to restore production to 3 million tons, reduce production costs, service OTP's debt, and prepare
the sector for further injection of private capital into a phosphoric acid plant project. However,
17
  There are two phosphate deposits under current exploitation by the single phosphate mining company, the SNPT.
SNTP was created in May 2007 following the demise of the International Fertilizer Group Togo (IFG-TG). Once
mined, the mineral is transported by train on a 46km railway system owned by SNPT to the ore treatment plant
located in Kpémé.


                                                      18
the private investor was not chosen in a competitive and transparent manner and political
interference and governance problems continued to plague the sector. In 2003, following a
dispute with the investor, the government broke the management contract. By 2007, output has
fallen to about 25 percent of its peak levels. Faced with mounting losses, the government opted
to resolve the dispute with Brifco, liquidate IFG-Togo, and create a new fully owned state
enterprise called Societe Nouvelle des Phosphates du Togo (SNPT). This negative experience
with privatization has left the authorities reluctant to immediately launch a second attempt, but
there is the recognition that eventually a new strategic partner will be required.

3.21 During the past two years, the government has focused on defining a strategic vision
for increased private participation in the rehabilitation of the phosphate sector. However,
to attract private participation a deepening of institutional changes is required in order to
strengthen the sector's management and development prospects. Among urgent institutional
issues to be addressed are (i) obsolete legal regulatory framework for mining (mining code and
lack of implementing regulations); (ii) inadequate internal controls in SNPT with respect to
financial management, procurement of spare parts and inventory control; (iii) weak sector and
corporate governance; (iv) inefficient organizational structure in SNPT; and (v) need for
strengthened safeguards to address the social and environmental concerns of affected
populations.

3.22 Significant capital investments are needed to develop the existing potential. The
Government has commissioned a strategic and financial audit of the phosphate sector to examine
various options for further development. Based on the results of the audit, an estimated US$430
to US$480 million of new investment will be needed to revive the sector and develop its
potential. The strategic options considered included partial privatization, restructuring, and
spinning off non-core operations. The audit recommended partial to full privatization as the
optimal strategy given the size of the investment and the severity of the structural and
operational problems plaguing SNPT. The recovery of production would be achieved in three
phases. The first phase would focus on rehabilitating the production system with a view to
restoring the nominal capacity of 3 million tones of phosphate rock. The second phase would
shift production from the declining reserves of siliceous rock toward the extensive resources of
carbonated phosphate ore with a view to doubling output. The third phase would establish the
basis for an integrated system with a target of 10 million metric tons of treated phosphate rock
and one million tons of phosphoric acid. Critical to the implementation of this strategy is the
government's ability to attract a strategic partner in the medium term. Government efforts will
thus be directed at identifying and targeting potential partners who could facilitate the
modernization and expansion of the phosphate sector.

The Government's reform program

3.23 Togo's existing phosphate sector potential could play a major role in the country's
short and medium-term economic recovery provided that the sector is modernized and
transformation activities are developed. While current reserves are nearing exhaustion, new,
untapped, carbonated reserves, could last for 100 years. SNPT's medium term program is to
increase production levels to 3 million metric tons a year (tpa), a level on par with experience in
the late 1980s. However, a shift to the exploitation of carbonated reserves would require
significant improvements in managerial and technological capability, as well as funding. It


                                                19
would also require that the Government place greater emphasis on strengthening social and
human resources as well as environmental management skills to be able to compete effectively in
an international market in which major actors are few and technology is concentrated in the
hands of big producers. In the short to medium term, a procedures manual is planned for SNPT's
operations along with an internal control system, based on recently completed organizational
audits. The Government also aims to modernize the sector's operational equipment. 18

3.24 Over the medium to long-term, further development of the phosphate sector is
required for it to renew its potential as a growth pole for Togo. At Togo's target annual
production levels of 3 million metric tons, depletion of the siliceous rock deposits would occur in
the next 7 years. Several studies have identified significant reserves of carbonate deposits that
could last for another 100 years at the currently envisaged extraction rate. As with other major
African producers, Togo desires to add value to its phosphate production by moving into
downstream production activities. Indeed, the Government has made economic diversification a
key objective of its mid-term economic recovery program. The production of phosphoric acid, a
major intermediate input for agricultural fertilizer, would be beneficial to Togo, if tackled
efficiently. International prices for these derived products are much higher, and the sale of such
products could generate substantive revenues for Togo. It would also offer an opportunity for
large-scale private investment in the sector.

3.25 Restoration of good governance and development of a strategic vision will be
important for meeting the Government's sector objectives. To this end, the Government
commissioned a strategic and financial audit of operations in the phosphate sector. Its results
were presented during a workshop on November 12-13, 2009. 19 The Government is finalizing a
phosphate sector strategy based on the recommendations of the strategic and financial audit. The
main objectives of the strategy, as expressed during the workshop, are to (i) increase production
to adequate levels in order to ensure sustainable profitability; (ii) improve SNPT governance, and
(iii) attract a serious strategic investor. As completion of this strategy is already a structural
reform requirement on the IMF ECF program, this operation will focus on transparency
measures, while IDA continues to work closely with the authorities on the broader reform
agenda through ESW and TA support.

3.26 To enhance sector transparency and governance, the government has officially
announced its intent to join EITI and has achieved significant progress in meeting the
criteria to become a Candidate Country. Togo's candidacy is expected to be submitted and
approved in 2010. The audit exercise, that commenced with the publication of 2007 payments
and revenues in early 2009, is continuing on an annual basis covering data from successive
18
   With the objective of modernizing the sector, the Government first opted for a Euro 45 million in funding from
the Islamic Development bank (IsDB) for the purchase of equipment for SNPT. The IsDB-funded project would
have been implemented with the technical assistance of an experienced strategic partner who was also expected to
provide additional financing for the sector. However, the IsDB project has recently been dropped since the loan
terms were non-concessional. The Government is continuing discussions with IsDB to negotiate the terms to
concessional levels.
19
   The audit, financed by the LICUS TF grant to Togo for Economic Recovery and International Reengagement,
examined the strategic aspects of the phosphate sector in the context of the broader mining sector framework, the
organization of the company, the organization of work and the state of the facilities. The audit also examined the
economic, technical, financial, social and environmental aspects of the phosphate industry in Togo and provided
recommendations for a clear long-term strategy to promote sustainable development of the sector.


                                                       20
years. This serves as an introduction to the EITI program, with the difference that approval of
the reports did not require the involvement of civil society representatives. Multi-stakeholder
participation is expected for the report covering 2009 as the government has completed most
initial steps for membership in the EITI. It made a public announcement in June 2009 and held a
public workshop in December 2009 during which it provided key stakeholders with information
on the necessary steps for Togo to be granted Candidate Status in a near future. The Government
is also exploring partnership linkages with other West African countries on a harmonized mining
sector reform strategy. Adoption by Togo of EITI principles is timely since several prospectors
have recently expressed interest, and exploration permit acquisition is increasing. Adoption of
the EITI is deemed necessary to enable a well managed increase in private sector activity in
Togo's mining sector.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-3

3.27 The proposed ERGG-3 would support two policy actions judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the phosphate sector, namely:

   (i) Adopt the legal and institutional framework with the objective of becoming an EITI
       candidate as evidenced by the issuance of (a) a decree creating one or more committees
       including participants from the civil society, government and extractive industry; (b) a
       decree nominating a national coordinator; and
   (ii) Publish the reconciliation results of the 2008 revenues generated from phosphate sales
        with revenues received by the public Treasury that year.
3.28 HIPC completion point triggers include an action in the phosphate sector aiming at
ensuring transparency on financial flows in the sector: implementation of regular public
reporting of payments to, and revenues received by, the government for the phosphates sector in
line with this aspect of the EITI criteria, with a recent annual report during at least the year
immediately preceding the year in which the completion point is reached. The status of the
implementation of the HIPC triggers is detailed in Annex 5.

                                  D. T HE E NERGY SECTOR

Current issues
3.29 Due to its high dependence on imported fuel and electricity, Togo's energy supply
remains vulnerable to international oil price fluctuations and periodic regional energy
sector crises as a result of low hydrology. Togo imports 100 percent of its petroleum needs
(much of which used to generate electricity). Imported electricity is provided by Communauté
Electrique du Benin (CEB), a joint venture between Benin and Togo. CEB, Togo's supplier, is
currently negotiating a new contract for the purchase of electricity with the Volta River
Authority (VRA) of Ghana, for larger amounts than in the past and at a somewhat higher price,
given that those additional amounts would be generated from thermal energy and not
hydropower. The production cost of the electricity for Togo will be mitigated somewhat by the




                                              21
expected arrival of natural gas in Lomé in 2010 under contract with the West African Gas
Pipeline Company, 20 to power CEB's two 25 MW gas-fired plants in Benin and Togo.

3.30 CEET's management problems contributed to the existing power outages, with
negative effects on the production capacity of the economy. CEET has been in charge of retail
distribution and sale of electricity in Togo since the early 1970s. CEET provides electricity to
about 13 percent of Togo's population, corresponding to about 124,000 customers. This is
significantly lower than the Sub-Saharan African average of 25 percent, and reflects the fact that
extension of electricity access in the past ten years has lagged behind demand. The average
electricity tariff was 85 FCFA/kwh (or about US cents 17) until 1 July 2009. Since then, a tariff
increase to 92 FCFA/kwh (or about US cents 18.4) has been adopted, but has only been passed
on to industrial consumers. 21 Following a period in which CEET was under private management
from 2000-2006, the old public utility structure was reestablished. A management committee
was set up for a transitional period of 6 months, which was subsequently extended several times.
In March 2008, permanent structures were established, comprising a Board of Directors,
appointment of a General Manager, and adoption of regulations for CEET consistent with those
of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). However, the
position of General Manager is vacant again since February 2009 following a negative
assessment by the Supervisory Board of the state of progress made with implementing the Action
Plan and reducing energy losses. The Deputy General Manager fills the position.

3.31 While slightly improved since 2007, CEET remains in a difficult financial situation,
a reflection of broader structural deficiencies in addition to price considerations. Between
2007 and 2008 CEET operating income improved, reducing the deficit from 3 billion CFA in
2007 to 20 million CFA francs in 2008. This improvement was achieved due to Government
subsidies in 2008 in the amount of 6 billion CFA to cover additional fuel costs and the effect of
tariff freezing. 22 Among the key challenges is that the current electricity tariffs in Togo do not
allow CEET to cover its additional costs resulting from a decision to end the power outages with
high cost thermal power. While in 2009 CEB was able to increase its electricity prices through a
bi-statal decision of both Benin and Togo and therefore stabilize its financial situation, electricity
prices for CEET were not augmented, except for industrial customers. Nevertheless, CEET's
financial situation has improved since 2007. However, improvements will not be long-lived as a
Purchasing Power Agreement signed in 2008 by CEET for a 100 MW thermal power plant will
take effect in 2010, which leaves open the question as to whether and when CEET will be able to
return to financial viability. Other issues that affect the sector's financial sustainability must also
be addressed, such as the lower-than-desired bill recovery ratio, the low recovery of government

20
   The company is a consortium comprising the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (25 percent), Chevron
Nigeria Ltd (37 percent), Shell Nigeria (18 percent), Société beninoise de gas (2 percent), Société togolaise de gas (2
percent), and the Volta River Authority of Ghana (16 percent).
21
   This is among the mid-range of tariffs in West Africa. Liberia at UScents 43/kWh and Sierra Leone at UScents
35/kWh have significantly higher tariffs. It is higher, but not outside the range of international retail tariffs. For
example, average US retail tariffs for electricity for all end-user sectors in 2009 were UScents 10, with variations
across states from a maximum of UScents 20.81 in Hawaii and a minimum of UScents 6.07 in Wyoming (US
Energy Information Administration, January 15 2010).
22
   On December 31, 2008, the CEET capital amounted to 38.4 billion CFA, consisting of net assets of 35.8 billion
francs CFA and financial reserves for contingencies and charges made by former private Togo Electricité of an
amount of 2.6 billion CFA. This capital injection enabled the CEET to comply with articles 664 and 665 of the
commercial companies law (OHADA) on changes in equity.


                                                         22
payment to the utility for delivery of electricity services, and the very old age of some of the
equipment (dating to the 50s and 60s) which renders the electricity system inefficient and
unreliable. A comprehensive approach is required to adequately pursue the supply, managerial
efficiency and financial sustainability objectives.

3.32 Attracting strategic private partners to help remedy CEET's technical, financial
and structural problems is unlikely to be realized in the short to medium run. Part of the
reason for this is the past recent experience of a private partner in Togo. Following the adoption
of a law liberalizing the electricity sector in Togo in 2000, CEET was put under the concession
of Elyo Hydro-Quebec International. Due to a lack of investments on the part of the private
partner, the concession contract was terminated by the Government in February 2006. 23 Since
then, the distribution function for electricity has been reassigned to CEET. The dispute that arose
from the termination of the concession contract was brought before the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and has not yet been resolved.

The Government's reform program

3.33 In the short term, the Government aims to increase supply while strengthening
efficiency in the sector. Recent actions taken or ongoing include:

     ·   co-sponsoring, as a member of the West African Power Pool (WAPP), 24 the ongoing
         development of a 330kV transmission backbone to enhance power trade across countries
         in the sub-region;
     ·   development of domestic power resources to enhance energy sector resilience--recent
         plans include the construction of a 100 MW thermal power plant and a hydropower plant
         at Adjarala;
     ·   adoption in February 2009 of a performance contract for the period of 2009-2013 for
         CEET in order to improve management and efficiency in the utility; and
     ·   commissioning a sector strategic review financed by the LICUS TF grant for Economic
         Recovery and International Reengagement. The review will lay the foundation for the
         preparation of the electricity sector strategy.

3.34 Over the medium term, the Government plans to implement actions to: (i) strengthen
private participation in the development of energy generation capacity; (ii) intensify regional
cooperation in the production, purchase, sale and transport of energy; (iii) create a rural
electrification fund; (iv) establish a financing mechanism for the sector including participation of
external donors and the domestic financial system; and (v) undertake an awareness campaign for
the efficient use of all forms of energy. While the Government's policy is generally pro-active in
the energy sector, decisions should be guided more by criteria of least-cost expansion than by
supply augmentation at any costs. The decision to fast-track a 100 MW thermal power plant in
Togo, to secure energy supply, poses risks for the long-term financial viability of Togo's

23
   Part of these investment were to be financed through an IDA credit. However, due to the suspension of the World
Bank's program with the Government of Togo, this credit fell through.
24
   The WAPP falls within the framework of the ECOWAS Energy Protocol which establishes third-party access, and
the WAPP Master Plan which defines regional priority projects.

electricity sector. The signing of the IPP deal of 100MW for the thermal power plant will
require Government subsidies for electricity that cannot be phased-out in the near future.

Prior actions under the proposed ERGG-3

3.35 The proposed ERGG-3 would support one policy action judged to be critical to
advance reforms in the energy sector, namely the preparation of a time-bound plan for the
settlement of the public and para-public arrears to CEET and identification of measures to
prevent accumulation of arrears in the future, and (ii) clearance of State arrears and obligations to
CEET through securitization.

     4. BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                             A. L INK TO THE I NTERIM STRATEGY NOTE

4.1    The Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board on May 29, 2008, sets out
the Bank Group's support to the Government's reform program for the period FY08-
FY10. The ISN is closely aligned with the Government's poverty reduction strategy and has the
following three main pillars:

       (i)    improve governance and transparency, through a focus on public finance
              management and key sectors of the economy (phosphates, energy, cotton and
              financial sectors);

       (ii)   promote economic recovery and sustainable development by helping the
              Government rehabilitate critical infrastructure and restore productive capacity in the
              phosphate and cotton sectors. The Bank will also support the Government in
              addressing the challenges and obstacles to, and potential entry points for, private
              sector investment as a catalyst for growth in Togo; and
       (iii) address urgent social needs, through expanding the community-driven
             development approach implemented through LICUS TF grants since 2004 (a
             second series of three LICUS TF Grants for Economic Recovery and International
             Reengagement was approved in FY08), to provide quality public services and
             income-generating opportunities to the residents of poorest communities in Togo,
             especially in rural areas.

4.2     The proposed ERGG-3 is an integral part of the ISN and its expected outcome
indicators. It directly supports the first ISN pillar and provides financial support to the
Government in the challenging context of an exceptional unfavorable global economic
environment and Togo's annual debt service to IDA expected to remain considerable until
attainment of the HIPC completion point. The focus of the ERGG-3 is specifically on continuing
and deepening the reform of public financial management as well as further advancing structural
reforms aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in the key sectors of the economy
(phosphates, cotton, and energy sectors). The proposed reforms are essential to the
Government's ability to use the public resources freed up by debt reduction efficiently and
effectively to support the country's economic and social recovery.

4.3     The proposed ERGG-3 is closely coordinated with and complements several Bank's
ongoing or planned operations and advisory services in the areas of its focus. The
Government's program of reforms in the procurement, phosphate, cotton and energy sectors is
supported by IDA under a LICUS grant (US$1.6 million approved in FY08) which lays the
ground for economic recovery. The Financial Sector and Governance TA Project (US$12
million) approved in March 2009 will support the restructuring of the banking sector, the
strengthening of the microfinance sector, the reform of the pension sector, and other financial
and private sector reforms. Activities being piloted under a LICUS-funded Lomé Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (US$1.5 million, approved in FY08) are being scaled up
under the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Energy project approved in June 2009
(US$25 million) and complemented by the GEF Efficient Lighting Program ($1.82 million).
This project supports access to improved infrastructure services in Lomé, focusing on urban
roads rehabilitation, drainage, urban water supply, energy equipment rehabilitation and provision
of energy-efficient light bulbs, as well as institutional strengthening. A regional Abidjan-Lagos
Transport and Trade Facilitation Project (FY10) is expected to facilitate movement of goods and
people along the coastal corridor through road infrastructure and transit facilitation components.
An Agriculture Sector Support Project (FY11, US$9 million) is also under preparation which
would focus, in partnership with other donors, on supporting the first three years of the
Government's national agriculture investment program with the aim of improving agricultural
productivity and diversification.

4.4     Other complementary support is provided by IDA through various non lending
instruments. The ongoing Country Economic Memorandum / Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study will provide in-depth analysis of economic sectors, including transport, re-exports, the
export processing zone, and will produce an action plan to be validated at a workshop. It will
also include a "Sources of Growth" chapter to review the potential drivers of growth in the
medium-term. An Investment Climate Assessment (FY10) will provide a crucial diagnostic of
the business environment to the Togolese Government and provide inputs to the CEM and a
future private sector investment project. A PEMFAR completed in mid 2009 has provided input
to developing the Government's public finance management reform program. In the energy
sector, the ERGG-3 complements the ongoing dialogue and advisory assistance provided by the
Bank to the authorities in the context of support to the West Africa Regional Power Pool. Five
LICUS Trust Fund grants are providing financial and technical assistance to extend community-
driven development activities through the Emergency Program for Poverty Reduction (EPPR) in
all 5 regions of Togo, for a total amount of US$4,424,600. 25 A Community Development Project
of US$17.2 million approved in June 2008 enables the scale up of the LICUS TF-funded EPPR
to address urgent social needs, particularly in the rural areas. In October 2008, IDA approved an
additional US$7 million grant under the Global Food Crisis Response Program to complement
the Community Development Project, and in order to respond to the negative impact of the
global economic slowdown, an additional financing to the PDC of approximately US$8.7 million


25
  Savanes and Maritime regions launched the first phase of LICUS, now closed, in 2005. A second phase is
currently underway (for a total amount of US$1,235,000 in Savanes and 2,235,000 in Maritime). Additional LICUS
TFs were signed with the three remaining regions in 2008 for a total amount of US$318,200 each region.

is currently being prepared. 26 The World Bank is processing a grant under the Education for All/
Fast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) Catalytic Fund, focused explicitly on increasing coverage and
improving the quality of primary education. The grant will contribute to the attainment of the
education Millennium Development Goal as well as to the achievement of the PRSP pillar on
developing human capital.

             C. C OMPLEMENTARITY WITH O THER DEVELOPMENT P ARTNER P ROGRAMS

4.5     The proposed ERGG-3 complements or leverages the support of other development
partners. The specific areas of IDA support have been identified in close collaboration with the
IMF and in consultation with other development partners, in aiming for synergy with their
respective interventions and building on IDA's comparative advantage in these areas. It is
expected that these institutions will continue to collaborate closely during implementation of the
program supported by the proposed ERGG-3, especially through joint dialogue with the
authorities, and joint missions and analytical work. Ongoing donor assistance includes a 3-year
IMF ECF, an AfDB budget support project and EU assistance on roads.

4.6      IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely in the respective institutions' areas of
focus and are working together on the HIPC process. IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated
closely their advice on governance and other economic issues and reforms, and worked on the
HIPC process culminating in a joint HIPC decision point document presented to the two Boards
in November 2008. Responsibility for public financial management is shared between the two
institutions, with sharing of analytical work and coordinated provision of technical assistance to
the country. The two institutions work closely together on the restructuring of the banking sector,
with the Bank taking the lead on the technical discussions. The two institutions endeavor to
avoid duplication of policy measures where feasible. Both institutions have also supported the
preparation of the full PRSP which was discussed by the respective Boards in November and
December 2009 on the basis of a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN). In addition, the IMF is
providing technical assistance in helping the authorities set up a mechanism for monitoring
budget execution, and implementing a functional budget classification that also, with World
Bank assistance, will enable tracking of poverty reducing expenditures, while IDA provides
advice on crucial sector issues (phosphates, cotton, and energy).

4.7    The AfDB, EU and IDA staffs are coordinating closely on supporting the
Government's public financial management reform program, including procurement.
Specifically, the three institutions have jointly prepared the recently completed PEMFAR, which
also draws on the ratings of an EC-financed Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA). The AfDB is providing assistance for strengthening of Government capacity in the area
of governance and public management reforms. Furthermore, the IDA and AfDB staffs have
collaborated closely in their dialogue with the Government on governance reforms.



26
  The objective will be to further develop the nascent safety nets system in Togo, and in particular: i) Expand the
scope and impact of the PDC by creating temporary employment opportunities to 25,000 poor, and young people in
particular; and ii) Expand the current School Feeding Emergency Operation from the current 92 schools to 200
schools and run the program for two additional school years (2010-2011 and 2011-2012) benefitting some 80,000
children.

4.8     Bilateral donors are supporting various elements of the authorities' efforts towards
economic recovery. The EU and France are supporting the governance and transparency agenda.
The EU is also supporting the cotton sector reform program (about US$1.8 million equivalent)
by financing the capital share (40 percent) of the National Federation of Cotton Producer Groups
in the new cotton company created on January 23, 2009. Other support includes US$6.6 million
equivalent for the rehabilitation of the cotton-coffee-cocoa roads and US$3.2 million for village
hydraulic. In addition, France is supporting the preparation of the Fast Track Program in
Education in close collaboration with the IDA staffs.

                                 D. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.9    The design of the ERGG-3 has benefited from recent or ongoing analytical Bank
reports, as well as close policy dialogue on the key sectors covered by the operation. These
include a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) prepared at end-2003 and a recently
completed PEMFAR conducted in close cooperation with the Government and other
development partners including the EU and AfDB, French Cooperation and the UNDP. The
PEMFAR provides (i) a diagnostic analysis of the current strengths and weaknesses in the
country's public financial management system and practices; (ii) input for the design and
preparation of the PFM reform strategy, including a time-bound sequenced action plan of priority
reforms; and (iii) benchmarks enabling the assessment of future progress of PFM reforms. It also
provides specific input into the identification of further key reforms to be supported by the
proposed grant, beyond those already implemented under the ERGG, ERGG-2 and the proposed
operation.

4.10 In addition, Bank's recent analysis and dialogue with the authorities on the
phosphates, cotton, and energy sectors as part of recent missions have further advanced the
structural policy dialogue in these sectors and laid the basis for the proposed grant, as well as
restarted regular reporting of key sector data to the Bank. In May 2009, a Bank mission reviewed
the findings of the strategic audit of the phosphate sector (financed under the LICUS Trust Fund)
and made recommendations. Furthermore, the Bank also reviewed the cotton and financial sector
strategies and contributed to updates. The country's macroeconomic performance and planned
policies have been assessed in the context of joint Bank-IMF missions in September 2008,
March 2009 (reconciliation of Togo's external debt data), November 2009 and April 2010.
Specifically, the recent LIC-DSA (October 2009) analyzed the country's debt situation and
concluded that Togo is in debt distress and its situation can only be resolved by a combination of
improved fiscal and structural policies, debt relief and additional concessional financing.
Underlying this exercise is a shared Bank and IMF understanding of the country's recent
economic performance and growth prospects.

4.11 The Bank has also assisted the Government in updating its knowledge of the status
of growth, poverty and the social sectors in the country as input for the preparation of the
poverty reduction strategy. In 2006, the Bank assisted the Government to conduct and analyze
a household survey as input to Togo's Interim PRSP and subsequent full PRSP. A Bank mission
reviewed with the Government the situation of health, education and welfare, on the basis of the
documentation produced during preparation of the I-PRSP and the sectoral strategy papers
prepared by the Government. In September 2008, the Bank, jointly with the UNDP, conducted a



                                               27
preliminary background study on the sources of growth as input for the preparation of the full
PRSP.

4.12 The ongoing Country Economic Memorandum/Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
provides in-depth analysis of several economic sectors, including transport, re-exports, the
export processing zone, and of the labor market and vocational training. It includes a "sources of
growth" analysis to identify the potential drivers of growth of the Togolese economy. In this
context, the Bank has also provided advice on the reform of the investment code and the free
zone law. An enterprise survey was conducted in 2009. Findings will be incorporated into an
Investment Climate Policy Note (ICPN) to be published in 2010.

                                     E. L ESSONS L EARNED

4.13 The design of this operation has benefited from the guidance provided by OPCS,
lessons from other development policy operations as well as the specific lessons from the
previous Economic Recovery and Governance Grants. These lessons are discussed in detail
below:

   ·   In the first and second ERGG, the policy reforms including the prior actions were
       embedded in the government's own reform agenda articulated in the Interim Poverty
       Reduction Strategy, leading to strong ownership of the reforms. This proposed operation
       has adopted a similar approach, with the added benefit of a full PRSP for the period
       2009-2011. The PRSP is coupled with a Plan of Priority Actions (PAP) which details the
       pluri-annual planning of programs, reform measures and activities. Given the
       government's good track record of reforms to date, this will help to ensure the
       implementation of the reforms supported by this operation.
   ·   Given the generally limited capacity within the public sector in fragile countries such as
       Togo, it is important to be selective in the choice of policy and institutional reforms.
       Operations that are simple in design and have fewer actions that have significant positive
       leverage effect are likely to be more effective than operations that attempt overly broad
       coverage. As the previous operations, the design of the ERGG-3 DPG reflects this lesson;
       it deepens the reforms in public financial management and in the country's critical
       sectors (phosphates, cotton, electricity sectors) that are deemed essential for the overall
       governance reform program and lay the foundation for medium term growth and poverty
       reduction.
   ·   It is important to carefully choose prior actions that are likely to open the door for other
       important policy and institutional reforms. For example, the adoption of a sound
       legislative framework, like the procurement law and associated code, is a critical step to
       begin the procurement reform program that in turn is a key component of the
       government's public finance management and governance reform program.
   ·   An important lesson for this operation drawn from the implementation of other
       development policy operations is the need to assess the key risks faced by individual
       policy and institutional reform measures and to be proactive in the application of
       mitigating measures. This is particularly important in fragile countries where capacity
       and political economy risks are significant. This operation has not only benefited from an



                                               28
       upfront assessment of the key risks but has also identified mitigating measures that are
       being, or need to be, applied to address these risks.
   ·   The effectiveness of Bank-supported development policy operations can be enhanced by
       its complementarities with other Bank-financed operation and the efforts of other active
       donors in the reform areas. The design of this proposed operation reflects this lesson in
       the choice of prior actions, which are closely coordinated with policy reforms supported
       by other donors (IMF ECF, AfDB, HIPC completion point triggers) and through the
       Bank's own lending and non-lending portfolio.

               5. THE PROPOSED THIRD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
                         AND GOVERNANCE GRANT

                              A. DESCRIPTION OF THE O PERATION

5.1    The Government's broad economic recovery program is outlined above in Section 3.
This program constitutes the reference framework behind the Government's policy matrix
(Annex 3). The Government has requested that IDA continue supporting, through the proposed
ERGG-3, critical reforms outlined in its strategy, primarily in the economic governance and
transparency area.

5.2     The main objective of the ERGG-3 is to support government-owned reforms to
improve public financial management and restore performance in key sectors of the
economy. Specifically, the ERGG-3 focuses on continuing and deepening policy reforms
initiated by the Government under the ERGG and ERGG-2 to strengthen budget preparation,
execution, controls and public procurement. It would also contribute to creating the conditions
for increased private sector confidence through measures to improve governance and
transparency in the phosphate, cotton, and energy sectors. The inclusion of actions to improve
management in selected public enterprises is highly relevant to the operation, as this is likely to
provide quick wins in terms of additional fiscal space and investments in those sectors. This
would lead over time to strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved economic governance and
growth, and enhanced transparency of State institutions and processes. The resources made
available by this grant will provide financial support to the Government to implement activities
that would otherwise be beyond its fiscal capabilities, including financing the provision of basic
public services.

                          B. P RIOR ACTIONS FOR THE P ROPOSED G RANT

5.3     The proposed grant would support selected reforms in the Government's program
described in Section 3 that are deemed essential for its successful implementation. Table 5.1
below details these prior actions and their implementation status. The rationale for their selection
has been discussed in the Section 3, namely their importance to the program and expressed
government commitment and feasibility. The prior actions for ERGG-3 are derived from
indicative policy measures that were identified during preparation of the ERGG-2. There have
been some adjustments to take into account exogenous factors not fully under the control of the
Government (See table 5.1). Annex 3 details a fuller set of measures under the Government's
reform program in the area of governance, including the prior actions in the table below.

5.4     In addition to the actions taken prior to provision of the proposed grant, further
policy measures will be considered, and the results evaluated, for possible future budget
support from IDA. These measures, which would further strengthen governance and
transparency in public financial management as well as in the key sectors of the economy
(cotton, energy and phosphates sectors), include those presented in Table 5.2. These policy
measures continue the process of strengthening the foundation for robust economic performance
over the medium term by further improving public financial management and addressing
weaknesses in key productive sectors.

                        Box 5.1: Good Pr actice Pr inciples on Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 The ERGG-3 is fully aligned with the government's reform program focusing on improving public expenditure
 management and strengthening governance and transparency in the phosphates, cotton and energy sectors. This
 broad program of reforms reflected in the PRSP underlies the policy dialogue with the Bank, the IMF, and the
 AfDB, which closely coordinate their programs of support to Togo. The unit responsible for the ERGG-3 program
 within the Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which has championed these reforms over the
 past years, including through the ERGG and ERGG-2. In order to reinforce ownership at the sectoral level, the
 Ministry of Economy and Finance has coordinated the dialogue with working groups and task teams including
 other government agencies and relevant organizations (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Mines and
 Energy, BCEAO).

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 The Government's reform program supported by the ERGG-3 is summarized in the policy matrix in Annex 3. The
 core of the program was developed during intensive policy dialogue with the authorities during 2009 and builds on
 the findings of the PEMFAR, CPAR, LICUS grants and the IMF ECF. The program has been closely coordinated
 with and supported by other development partners such as the IMF, AfDB, and the EU (especially in the areas on
 which these organizations have focused, notably public financial management) and bilateral donors. The expected
 results of the program supported by the proposed grant are detailed in paragraph 5.5.

 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 The policy matrix is customized to the country circumstances. Elements of its reform program are included in the
 Government's PRSP. The focus is on governance in the public and private sectors, through a series of actions
 aimed at improving public financial management, and transparency and efficiency in critical sectors for the
 economy (namely, phosphates, cotton and energy).

 Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 The policy matrix uses a limited set of eleven prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the
 proposed ERGG-3. The chosen policy measures were identified jointly with the Government and in close
 consultation with other development partners. Conditionality is focused only on key actions which are critical to
 the strengthening of public financial management and reform in key economic sectors. The conditionality of the
 ERGG-3 is also coordinated with and is complementary to the Government reform program supported by the IMF
 ECF.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
 In preparing and monitoring the ERGG and ERGG-2, the Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF,
 AfDB, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the Government's reform program. Under this operation, the Bank
 will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions to support and monitor program implementation to
 contribute to predictable and performance based financial support in the future.



                               D. ANTICIPATED R ESULTS OF THE PROGRAM

5.5    The program supported by the ERGG-3 targets the underlying structure for long-
term reforms. Within this structure, there are specific results that are expected by the grant
closing date of December 31, 2010. These include:

                                  A. COUNTRY O WNERSHIP

6.1    The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities. The specific
reforms are critical elements of the Government's strategy to re-launch and consolidate growth
and enhance governance and transparency in public resource management. These reforms were
designed with the close involvement of the Government's relevant ministries and agencies under
the championship of the Minister of Economy and Finance. The I-PRSP and full PRSP
processes have provided an opportunity to foster national consensus across the Togolese society
and among Government representatives on this reform agenda.

                                   B. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

6.2     Although the Government has made encouraging progress under the ERGG and
ERGG-2 in implementing measures to strengthen public financial management and
transparency, the improvement in fiduciary standards remains a central objective of the
proposed operation. Among reform measures already implemented are: the full reinstatement
and application of normal budget preparation and execution procedures (timely budget
preparation and submission to the Parliament, publication of budget execution reports);
organization of the Treasury in line with WAEMU Directive and creation of an internal audit and
inspection unit. The proposed operation will build on these earlier measures to deepen reforms
and improve the country's fiduciary management system.

6.3     In 2005, the IMF staff carried out an on-site safeguards assessment of the Central
Bank of the West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), which includes Togo. The assessment found that
progress has been made in strengthening the BCEAO's safeguards framework since 2002 when
the last safeguard assessment was undertaken. The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited
financial statements and improvements have been made to move financial reporting closer to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has
been put in place, and mechanisms for improving risk management and risk prevention have
been established and follow-up on internal and external audit recommendations has been
strengthened. The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help
solidify the progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external
audit process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of the
effectiveness of the internal audit function. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the central bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress
was achieved.

6.4    Durable gains in transparency, effectiveness of the financial management systems,
and accountability will require sustained and coordinated engagement of Togo's
international partners in support of the Government's reform process. The IMF, through the


                                               37
West Africa AFRITAC, is providing technical assistance in public financial management and tax
administration to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The recent PEMFAR has identified
areas in particular need of remedial action, and a comprehensive Action Plan to address those has
been prepared by the Government. A baseline of current procurement practices using the
OECD/DAC guidelines, established as part of the PEMFAR, is also enabling evidence-based
monitoring of improvements in the near future. As a result of the PEMFAR, priority technical
assistance to strengthen public financial management is being identified for additional
coordinated donor support. IDA is providing strong support to this process through a LICUS
Trust Fund grant and the Financial Sector and Governance TA Project approved in March 2009.
Donor assistance will help the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are
applied to provide reasonable assurance that government resources are used for the intended
purposes. An important objective is to achieve compliance with international standards of
financial management, such as those agreed in the context of the OECD/DAC guidance on
quality and performance of national procurement systems.

                 C. GRANT ADMINISTRATION, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

6.5     Grant amount and tranching. The recipient is the Republic of Togo, represented by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The grant will be released in one tranche of SDR 10.7 million
(US$16.3 million equivalent) following its approval and notification by the Association of
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement.

6.6     Disbursement and accounting. The proposed operation will follow IDA's disbursement
procedures for development policy grants. Upon approval of the grant and effectiveness of the
Financing Agreement, the proceeds of the grant would be disbursed by IDA into a dedicated
account of the Government for budget support. The proceeds of the grant would not be used to
finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. The recipient shall ensure that upon the
deposit of the Grant into said account an equivalent amount is credited in the recipient's budget
management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will report to IDA on the
amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget
management system. Assuming that the withdrawal request is in Euro, the equivalent amount in
CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be based on the market rate at the date of the
transfer. The Recipient will promptly notify the Bank by fax or email that such transfer has taken
place, and that proceeds have been credited in a manner satisfactory to IDA.

6.7     Auditing. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of the dedicated deposit account, on
terms of reference acceptable to IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of
the Grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b)
refund the amount directly to IDA.

6.8    Closing date: The expected closing date of the Grant is December 31, 2010.

                                D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

6.9   The reforms supported by the proposed development policy grant are part of a
broader program of actions to promote the recovery of key sectors, notably cotton,


                                               38
phosphates and energy, in addition to strengthening public financial management systems.
These reforms, dealing mainly with economic governance and institutional issues, are not likely
to have significant negative impacts on the country's environment and natural resources. This
applies also with respect to the actions in the three real sectors as no direct or indirect effects are
expected and thus on the environment:

       (i)    first, as regards the cotton sector, the new cost accounting system and the regulatory
              framework for the cotton sector that specifies the roles, responsibilities and
              obligations of sector stakeholders merely enhances transparency in the accounting
              system and promotes the representation of the producers at the Board of the new
              company;
       (ii)    second, the phosphate sector measures to publish information on the sector's
              financial contribution to the economy and the adoption of a legal and institutional
              framework with the objective of Togo becoming an EITI candidate have the
              objective of enhancing governance by improving transparency and accountability;
              and
       (iii) third, as regards the energy sector, the clearance of public and para-public arrears
             aims at improving the financial situation of the sector.

6.10 However, the ultimate goal of these reforms is to increase the investments and
output in each of the targeted sectors. Whether this goal will be achieved with minimal,
moderate or significant adverse environmental and social impacts will depend on the baseline
conditions of the environment and natural resources, the capacity of the country's environmental
management institutions, and the capabilities and rights of various categories of resources users.

6.11 In order to facilitate the integration of environmental considerations into the
implementation of development policies, the Bank helped the Government to prepare a
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The CEA identifies the main environmental
challenges that will need to be addressed in order to maximize the welfare impact of the poverty
reduction strategy. In particular, the CEA addresses the potential adverse environmental and
social impacts that could be associated with increased investment and production in the cotton,
mining and energy sectors, and recommends measures that will help to eliminate or mitigate
these impacts.

Summary of environmental impacts and mitigation measures

Impacts

6.12 Cotton production faces two main environmental problems. The first one is land
degradation due to soil fertility depletion and soil erosion. Although this problem is common to
the whole agricultural sector, cotton production areas are inherently prone to rapid land
degradation. There is evidence that the depletion of soil fertility and the associated decline in
cotton yields have led some farmers to encroach protected areas and national forest reserves.
The second source of environmental concern is the uncontrolled imports and misuse of
pesticides. Occupational health hazards for farmers and for the broader communities, as well as



                                                  39
environmental degradation due to the pollution of land and (surface and ground) water resources
are among the main problems uncovered in the production areas.

6.13 Phosphate mining is associated with three main environmental problems. First and
foremost is the involuntary resettlement of the affected populations without proper compensation
in many cases. Second, mining operations caused noticeable land degradation and permanent
soil loss in many areas due to uncontrolled soil movement on-site and offsite, and inadequate
land reclamation and restoration operations after the mines ceased operations. Finally, phosphate
mining operations contribute to the degradation of water resources through soil erosion and the
sedimentation of water bodies caused by uncontrolled earth-moving operations, and the disposal
of effluents into the coastal waters.

6.14 The main environmental and social effects associated with the increased production
and diversification of electricity are related to the acquisition of land and the resettlement of
populations for the right-of-way for transmission lines and the construction of infrastructure,
especially the hydropower dam.

Mitigation opportunities

6.15 The reforms supported by the proposed operation are an opportunity to integrate
environmental and social considerations into the recovery of the cotton, phosphate and
energy sectors. Towards this objective, the CEA proposes management tools and capacity
development measures in the productive sectors that will help the government minimize negative
impacts and optimize positive ones.

6.16 The newly created cotton company would aim to promote a more efficient use of
modern inputs, including fertilizers and pesticides by producers. In addition to integrated
pest management, the content of the agricultural advisory services should include other measures
aimed to reduce pesticide-induced health hazards, and the contamination of soil and water
resources. Agricultural advisory services should also promote a more integrated approach to soil
fertility management that emphasizes sustainable land management. This approach will help to
increase and to sustain yields, thereby reducing the need to expand production into marginal
lands and protected areas.

6.17 Much of the current impacts of phosphate extraction and processing activities on
land, water, and air, as well as their effects on the livelihood of local communities are due
to the obsolete technology, limited capital, and lack of awareness of the potential public
health and environmental hazards associated with these impacts. The new phosphate
company would aim to modernize the mining equipment to adopt technological innovation that
will not only increase the technical efficiency of operations, but also reduce the adverse
environmental and social costs of these operations. Finally, the Government would draw from
the lessons learned from the construction of the Nangbeto hydropower dam to ensure a better
planning and management of the environmental and social impacts of the planned Adjarala dam,
a key element of the country's modern energy production plan.

Capacity assessment for effective environmental mainstreaming

6.18 The Government took aggressive measures aimed to strengthen its environmental
management system and institutions in recent years, including the adoption of a new
environmental law in 2008. Although some changes in the institutional arrangements may be
justified in order to provide a better fit with the new environmental law, one can say that the
overall regulatory and institutional framework for environmental management is somewhat
adequate. However, the implementation of environmental policies and regulations faces
enormous challenges. These challenges include (i) the lack of appropriate mechanisms to
support the effective integration of environmental considerations into sectoral policy formulation
and implementation, (ii) the weak enforcement and compliance with key environmental
regulations (e.g., environmental impact assessment, involuntary resettlement of populations,
etc.), and (iii) the lack of adequate technical capacity in the public and private sectors to ensure
effective environment and natural resource management.

6.19 The lack of technical and operational capacity is particularly acute within the
ministry of environment and forest resources where 80 percent of the staff consists of forestry
engineers and technicians with little or no training in environmental management, especially
environmental assessment. The technical unit dedicated to environmental impact assessment and
environmental audit has 6 staff (only one has a graduate degree). The ministry has very limited
resources (the average yearly investment budget between 2001 and 2009 is lower than
US$200,000). The World Bank projects in the mining and energy sectors contribute to enhance
capacity. Specifically, CEB has benefitted from capacity building on environmental and social
safeguards under the ongoing Benin Energy Services Delivery Project (ESDP) as its highly
qualified environmental and social safeguards staff are well versed in the World Bank safeguard
requirements. In addition, the Togo Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Energy Project
includes the Environmental and Social Monitoring Framework (ESMF). With regard to the
mining sector, as part of the effort to update its legal and regulatory framework, the government
will review the environmental and social provisions of the Mining Code and address any
regulatory gaps with the aim of bringing Togo closer to international best practices with respect
to social, community, and environmental standards.

Recommended capacity building activities

6.20 Remedying the current and future adverse environmental and social impacts
associated with the activities of the targeted sectors, and effectively integrating
environmental considerations into the implementation of the reforms will require active
collaboration between the government, the private sector and civil society groups. This
collaboration should focus on filling the technical capacity and information/awareness gaps that
prevent effective collective action to control the adverse effects of sectoral investments on the
environment, natural resources, and the livelihood of affected communities. The capacity
building activities should consist of short term measures aimed to restore environmental
stewardship in the on-going activities of the three sectors, and medium term measures focusing
on building durable capabilities in government for mainstreaming environment into development
policies and programs. The findings and recommendations of the CEA will underpin further

possible capacity building support in the environmental sector that would be identified in the
context of the new CAS.

                                         E. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.21 Togo remains one of the world's poorest countries, ranking 159 out of 182 countries
in the 2009 UNDP Human Development Report. An estimated 62 percent of Togo's
population lived below the poverty line in 2006, with the rural areas accounting for the majority
of the poor (74 percent versus 37 percent in urban areas), and Togo's social indicators are weak.
This is based on the poverty diagnostic conducted with data from the QUIBB (2006) 28 survey,
thus not reflecting the shocks that affected the country in 2008 and 2009, in particular the rise in
food and oil prices, as well as the flooding and the global economic slowdown. It is expected that
the upcoming Poverty Assessment would provide more accurate information on recent poverty
developments, especially regarding regional poverty and inequality. Furthermore, a critical
measure for successfully monitoring the linkages between the policy actions identified in the
PRSP and poverty outcomes has been implemented with the introduction of the functional
classification of budget expenditures in the budget.

6.22 The measures supported by the proposed ERGG-3 are expected to have significant
positive distributional effects with a positive impact on poverty reduction. Specifically,
expected benefits include:

           (i)    strengthening of public expenditure management, which would enhance efficiency,
                  transparency and accountability in public resources use;
           (ii)   improving governance in the cotton sector through measures to improve the
                  accounting system and the representation of producers in the Board of the company;
           (iii) enhancing governance in the phosphate sector by improving transparency and
                 accountability of the sector's financial contribution to the economy and public
                 finances; and
           (iv) contributing to improve the financial situation of CEET and thus reducing the drain
                on the state budget thus freeing up resources that can be directed to poverty
                reduction expenditures.

6.23 While the ERGG-3 does not have a special focus on rural poverty, it supports
measures that will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor. For example, the
improvement in governance in the cotton sector is expected to further increase confidence of
farmers in the sector and thereby facilitate a rebound in cotton production and improve the
livelihood of a large sector of the population (about 300,000) which relies on this cash crop as a
dominant source of earnings. Furthermore, the ERGG-3 would also help fund the provision of
basic public services during 2010 with a high beneficial impact on the poor, in complement to
implementation of the Togo Community Development Project (approved in FY08), and the
additional financing approved in FY09 under the Global Food Crisis Response Program and in
FY10 through Pilot Crisis Response Window resources.

6.24 Given the overall thrust of the ERGG-3, no negative impacts on vulnerable groups
are envisaged. To the contrary, all the measures considered will result in improved overall well-
being because of better governance and more efficient and equitable government services. The
Government has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that its actions are the true expression of
the collective will, and has consistently and actively involved specific stakeholders and citizens
at large throughout the process leading to and accompanying the previous ERGGs and the
ERGG-3. The electricity tariff increase proposed as a possible future measure to be considered
for the next operation will be preceded by a poverty and social impact assessment.

                            F. MONITORING AND EVALUATION

6.25 The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed ERGG-3. Day-to-day monitoring of the program will be the
responsibility of the Comité de Suivi des Programmes et Réformes, an existing high-level team
within the Ministry, headed by the Secretary General. This arrangement is justified by the
strength and continuity of this team within the Ministry of Economy and Finance and their
involvement in the ongoing policy reform dialogue, including with other development partners.
The main technical responsibility for implementation of the public financial management
reforms will stay with the Budget and Treasury Departments, whose representatives are part of
the Public Finance Steering Committee (Comité de pilotage des finances publiques) created in
2005. The sector reforms will be implemented by the respective technical departments in the
sector ministries, under the oversight of the ministers in charge of agriculture (cotton sector),
mining (phosphates) and infrastructure (electricity), and the overall coordination of the Ministry
of Economy and Finance.

6.26 The MEF economic team will also be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the
results of the program. The Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA on
implementation progress measured against the established timetables and the agreed performance
indicators. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination
with regular Bank supervision to ensure continued implementation of the program within an
adequate macroeconomic policy framework.

                             G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

6.27 In the current environment of a country emerging from a socio-political crisis, the
proposed operation presents significant country and fiduciary risks.

       (i)   Political risk. Reform efforts aimed at improving governance of the public sector,
             public enterprises and banks could falter if faced with resistance to reforms, or in
             the event of possible political tensions that slow the reform momentum. In Togo's
             case, the socio-political outlook and hence the broad acceptance of reforms will be
             contingent to a great extent upon the degree to which the presidential elections in
             2010 will be perceived as fair and inclusive and will lead to a Government
             supported by a majority of the population. More transparent and accountable
             practices in the phosphates, energy and cotton sectors will enhance governance and
             reduce the scope for vested interests undermining reform effort in these critical
             sectors. In addition, the proposed prior actions focus on areas in which the


                                               43
       Government has already demonstrated its commitment and ownership in the
       previous ERGGs. The PRSP process presented an additional opportunity to foster
       national consensus across the Togolese society and among Government
       representatives on a medium-term reform agenda. Close coordination with the IMF,
       AfDB and bilateral donors and intensified sector dialogue will help ensure that the
       Government continues to give top priority to the reform of these sectors.
(ii)   Macroeconomic risks to the economic recovery could stem from the vulnerability
       of the Togolese economy to exogenous shocks (mostly climate and commodity
       shocks such as the recent increases in international food and oil prices, or the severe
       domestic floods), or from a slower than expected recovery from the global financial
       crisis. There are signs that the global slowdown depressed FDI, and at this point
       forecasts do not predict a rapid recovery of the international economy in 2010.
       Furthermore, the extent to which the restructuring of the Togolese banking sector
       will lead to increased lending to the economy remains uncertain. Togo is also
       exposed to the impact of the euro appreciation on its major international exports,
       phosphates and cotton. Delays in rebuilding the transport infrastructure destroyed
       by the recent flooding could also hinder the economic recovery. Some of these
       shocks or a combination of them could result in a risk of falling back into arrears or
       exacerbating the already precarious financial situation of several banks.
       Furthermore, given Togo's role as a hub for regional trade, shocks in neighboring
       countries could hurt Togo's economic prospects. To mitigate the macroeconomic
       risks, the IMF and IDA will continue to closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic
       performance, including providing ongoing assistance to the financial sector reform
       program through the IDA-financed Financial Reform and Governance TA Project.
       Furthermore, Togo's main creditors have offered financing and agreed to debt relief
       arrangements that maximize overall positive resource flows to Togo, as reflected in
       the fiscal framework supported under the ECF. This includes: IDA budget support
       to Togo through annual development policy operations to support ongoing reforms;
       the Paris Club agreement on a moratorium period with no debt service payments
       between 1st April 2008 and 31 March 2011 (provided that Togo continues to
       satisfactorily implement the ECF-supported program); and expected similar
       treatment from other bilateral creditors. Strong, predictable and timely donor
       support will also be critical to mitigate possible external risks, and the Government
       is committed to a rapid attainment of the HIPC completion point.
(iii) Fiduciary risk. Despite recent reforms, fiduciary risk remains from possible
      corruption or Government's failure to make effective and efficient use of the fiscal
      space made available by arrears clearance, budget support and debt relief. After
      improvements through measures taken under the ERGG and ERGG-2, the
      improvement in fiduciary standards remains a central objective of the proposed
      operation through further actions to strengthen public financial management,
      including the foundations of a robust procurement system. As regards procurement,
      the major risk during the ERGG-3 period is from implementation problems of the
      new procurement code, stemming from inadequate dissemination and
      familiarization by users. These risks will be mitigated by (i) the establishment of the
      General Procurement Department, which would disseminate the new procurement
      code and promote its application for public procurement and (ii) the creation of


                                          44
                commissions for ex-post audits. 29 The recent PEMFAR and technical assistance
                provided by IDA, the IMF and other donors are expected to facilitate the further
                improvement of fiduciary standards.
          (iv) Implementation capacity risk arises from the lack of sufficient professional staff
               and weak institutional capacity and coordination in the wake of the long recent
               history of socio-political instability and suspended foreign assistance. As noted in
               the ISN, this risk is mitigated during the ISN period through the provision of
               technical assistance under IDA projects and TF grants. This includes the Financial
               Sector and Governance TA Project supporting financial sector reform and the
               ongoing LICUS grant for Economic Recovery and International Reengagement that
               provides support to reforms in public procurement, cotton, coffee, cocoa, energy
               and port sectors. The IMF provides assistance in public financial management and
               to key financial administrations like the Customs and Tax Departments through its
               West AFRITAC based in Bamako. Other donors (AfDB, EC and France) are
               supporting, or plan to support, capacity building efforts in various sectors.

6.28 In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

No. 1092   /MEF/SP-PRPF                                             Lomé, March 23, 2010


The Minister of Economy and Finance

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President, World Bank
1818 H Street NW
Washington, DC 20433
United States of America


Mr. President,

1.      This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) reports on the progress made and describes the
current socioeconomic situation as well as prospects for the 2010-2012 period. It describes the
development goals and policies set by the authorities to continue their budget support program
started in 2008, which seeks to strengthen economic growth and reduce poverty. With a view to
improving the expected outcomes, the authorities continue to seek the support of the
international community, in particular the support of the World Bank, through the Third
Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG­3).

I.     Political and Socioeconomic Context

2.     Togo has benefitted greatly from the political détente existing in the country since the
conclusion of the Comprehensive Political Agreement (Accord Politique Global APG) in August
2006, which paved the way for a multiparty National Assembly in 2007. Moreover, the
improved political situation set the stage for peaceful presidential elections on March 4, 2010, in
which all the main political parties participated.

3.    Since that time, cooperation with technical and financial partners has been fully resumed
and major democratic and economic institutions have been established.



                                                47
4.      The Government intends to take advantage of this political stability to achieve Togo's
economic recovery. To this end, the Permanent Framework for Dialogue and Consultation
[Cadre Permanent de Dialogue et de Concertation CPDC], a grouping of the political parties
with representation in the National Assembly, has been expanded to include extraparliamentary
political parties as well as civil society. In addition, the Government has established the Truth,
Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, which is tasked with shedding light on the political
violence that occurred in Togo from the time of its independence. It plans to continue social
dialogue with a view to strengthening the gains of the APG.

5.     The economic recovery and poverty reduction program is aimed at reestablishing
macroeconomic stability, improving public finances, and restoring economic growth, with a view
to improving the population's standard of living. This program is set forth in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which the Government approved on June 20, 2009, after
lengthy national consultations. PRSP implementation has started with the Priority Action
Program (PAP).

6.      The three-year program (2008-2010), supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) concluded with International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been satisfactorily
executed thus far, despite the difficult economic situation arising from the global financial crisis.
Moreover, as a result of sustained efforts to adopt a strict and transparent approach to public
finance management, the financial outlook has brightened, with total revenue rising from CFAF
220.67 billion in 2008 to approximately CFAF 254 billion in 2009. The Government adopted a
plan to settle domestic arrears, whose implementation began in FY 2009, and has avoided the
accumulation of new arrears. Sector reform was continued, particularly in the banking, cotton,
energy, and phosphate sectors. Noteworthy progress was made with the implementation of the
measures related to triggers and we hope to reach the completion point by end-2010.

7.      Positive growth was recorded as a result of the Government's efforts to revive the
economy. However, this growth falls short relative to poverty reduction needs. Based on
preliminary information, the 2009 growth rate is projected at 2.5 percent, a figure higher than the
2008 rate (1.8 percent). Moreover, the inflation rate continued to fall in 2009 as a result of the
twin effects of the decline in oil prices and food prices owing, in the case of the latter, to a bumper
year for agricultural production. Year-on-year inflation fell to 3.1 percent in 2009, compared to
8.4 percent in 2008.

8.      The end of the recession in most industrialized countries is having an impact on the
recent economic situation. That said, global economic recovery prospects do not point to robust
growth in 2010.

9.     Signs of economic recovery are emerging in Togo and, based on growth prospects for
2010, the estimated growth rate is 2.6 percent. This modest recovery is attributable to the
various reforms implemented by the Government in all sectors of the economy.




                                                  48
II. The 2010-2011 Program

General Objectives

10.     During the 2010-2011 period, the Government intends to strengthen its economic
recovery program by forging ahead with the economic reforms started in previous years. These
reforms seek to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework conducive to sustainable economic
growth, thus improving the living conditions of the people. The 2010 goal is to: (i) continue the
economic reform program focused on improving transparency in public finances; (ii) continue to
improve public finance management; (iii) adhere closely to the financial orthodoxy in budget
execution; (iv) honor the commitments made to international financial institutions and bilateral
donors with a view to strengthening relations; and (v) continue to strengthen the audit system.
The measures planned to boost agricultural productivity, settle domestic debt, and increase
absorptive capacity as well as the level of public investment expenditure will pave the way for
achieving a real GDP growth rate of over 2.6 percent in 2010 and for increasing the growth rate in
the years ahead. Special emphasis will be placed on the promising economic growth sectors, in
particular the agricultural and phosphate sectors. To this end, a donor round table on agriculture
has been organized and the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Program
[Programme National d'Investissement Agricole et la Sécurité Alimentaire PNIA-SA] has been
adopted, with the aim of giving renewed impetus to the agricultural sector. In addition, the
development strategy for the phosphate sector is being finalized.

11.     The Government's development goals are set forth in Togo's Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper, which is accompanied by a reform program currently being finalized. These reforms
essentially target: (i) strengthening public finance management; (ii) improving the investment
climate so as to foster private sector growth; (iii) expanding access to health and education; (iv)
building and repairing road infrastructure and the energy sector; and (v) continuing the financial
sector restructuring process.

Governance and Structural Reforms

12.     The Government is firm in its resolve to continue to improve public finance management
in the context of economic and financial governance. It undertakes to continue efforts to combat
corruption and fraud and to create an economic and regulatory climate conducive to economic
activity. The Government has continued to strengthen public finance management through the
establishment and operationalization of budget audit institutions, namely the General Finance
Inspectorate [Inspection Générale des Finances IGF] and the Audit Office, among others. In
addition, all end-June performance criteria, quantitative indicators, and structural benchmarks
agreed upon with the IMF under the PRGF have been met. A strict, transparent, and efficient
approach was adopted to execution of the 2009 budget, with no accumulation of domestic or
foreign arrears or use of unorthodox procedures. Revenue and expenditure procedures reflect
implementation of the reforms started by the Government. With respect to customs, measures
have been taken to improve the import validation system by reducing underbilling for second-
hand vehicles and combating contraband activity involving petroleum products. From a tax
standpoint, the reduction in tax rates has made it possible to expand the tax base, to extend this
effort to the informal sector, and to stimulate household consumption. The 2009 budget was
executed using the Integrated System for Budget Execution Information [Système Intégré de


                                                49
Gestion de Finances Publiques SIGFiP]. The 2010 draft budget was adopted by the Council of
Ministers and approved by the National Assembly within the allotted timeframe on December 18,
2009. This budget, like the previous one, accords top priority to poverty reduction, with special
emphasis on agricultural sector expenditure, for which the Government managed to honor its
commitment made in Maputo by allocating 10 percent of its budget, as well as education, health,
infrastructure rehabilitation, energy, water and sanitation, and domestic debt settlement.

13.      In 2010, the Government will step up efforts to complete achievement of the
performance triggers with a view to quickly reaching the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative by taking the following actions, in particular: (i) implementing the full PRSP over a
one-year period; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic stability through the satisfactory execution of
the PRGF program; (iii) adopting and implementing a public expenditure tracking mechanism
for poverty reduction based on a functional classification and the publication of quarterly
expenditure reports; (iv) submitting to the Audit Office and to Parliament a draft budget review
law and an estimated general balance of treasury accounts; (v) operationalizing the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority in accordance with WAEMU Directives and continuing
publication of public procurement contracts; (vi) strengthening transparency in the management
of key public enterprises, among them the new phosphate company of Togo (SNPT) and the new
cotton company of Togo (SOTOCO); (vii) continuing publication of foreign and domestic debt
information; (viii) implementing the National Health Development Plan in the medium term,
including the human resources management component; and (ix) continuing implementation of
the National Education Sector Plan.

14.      In addition to these measures, the Government undertakes to: (i) continue implementation
of the strategy to settle domestic debt; (ii) preserve the viability of public debt by focusing more
on grants or loans on highly concessional terms; (iii) continue the reform process of the public
procurement system; and (iv) continue public enterprise reforms, with World Bank assistance. In
the case of the new cotton company, this entails establishing a reliable information management
system and cost accounting; in the case of the new phosphate company, this involves adopting
and implementing the sector strategy; and in the case of the national electricity company, this
entails implementing the strategy to settle the debt owed to its main debtors. The Government
has continued with the implementation of measures in the areas of public finance, the financial
sector, the phosphate sector, the cotton sector, the energy sector, the transport sector, and the
social sectors. This LDP goes on to describe the key actions that we have taken in each of the
foregoing sectors as well as the actions planned for 2010-2011.

Reestablishment of the Financial Orthodoxy

15.     Public expenditure management has improved considerably owing to: (i) the elimination
of extra budgetary execution procedures; (ii) the effective implementation of a cash flow plan
based on a monthly budget execution scorecard; and (iii) the strengthening of internal budget
execution audits. The Government will continue to strengthen cash flow management and
procurement procedures and will publish budget execution reports periodically. The activities
listed below attest to the Government's reform efforts in the area of public finance:




                                                50
·   Eighty percent of budget allocations for current and investment expenditures for all the
    priority ministries were authorized since the beginning of the year, and 100 percent by
    October 2009.
·   The draft budget for 2010, accompanied for the first time by the MTEF of the Ministries
    of Education and Health, was submitted to the National Assembly in November 2009,
    which approved it on December 18, 2009;
·   A public finance status report is produced on a quarterly basis and transmitted to the
    World Bank and IMF within two months of the period under review. This information is
    also available on the website of the Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform and
    Financial Program Monitoring (www.togoreforrne.tg);
·   The scorecard for the monthly tracking of budget execution was introduced and continues
    to be prepared and transmitted each month to the development partners. This scorecard
    serves as a true decision-making tool of the Treasury Planning Committee. It is also
    published on the Permanent Secretariat's website;
·   The Government is proceeding with the operationalization and strengthening of treasury
    services, pursuant to WAEMU Directives;
·   The Government has continued with implementation of the strategy to settle domestic
    debt arrears with a view to restoring the confidence of suppliers. The strategy applies to
    all domestic debt arrears covered by the audit conducted by the firm KPMG in 2007 and
    validated by the Government.
·   The Government is proceeding with the establishment of a National Directorate for
    Public Procurement Oversight [Direction Nationale du Contrôle des Marchés Publics
    DNCMP], the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority [Autorité de Régulation des
    Marchés Publics ARMP], and the Public Procurement Oversight Offices [Services de
    Contrôle des Marchés Publics SCMP] in the five priority ministries and the municipality
    of Lomé, pursuant to the recommendations made in the 2003 CPAR;
·   The Integrated System for Budget Execution Information (SIGFiP) has been used for
    execution of the 2009 budget in order to enhance budget execution efficiency and
    transparency;
·   The 2009 work program of the General Finance Inspectorate approved by the Ministry of
    Economy and Finance has been fully executed;
·   The IGF Manual of Procedures has been prepared with assistance from West AFRITAC;
·   Pursuant to organic law No. 98-014 of July 10, 1998 organizing and establishing the
    structure of the Audit Office, judges have been appointed by a Decree of June 24, 2009;
·   The draft budget review law for FY 2007 has been prepared and submitted to the Audit
    Office; and
·   The status of all approved contracts, including sole source contracts, is published
    periodically on the Government's website (www.togoreforme.tg) and in the newspaper of
    Togo's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, "l'Entrepreneur."




                                           51
16.      During the 2010-2011 period, the Togolese authorities intend to take further action to
strengthen public finance management. The Government will continue to improve PEFA scores.
To that end, a matrix of public finance reforms has been prepared on the basis of PEFA
recommendations and is now being finalized. The Government will continue to address public
expenditure management challenges, which have been underscored in the recent Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) report. This
includes: (i) improving budget programming; (ii) observing the budget schedule; (iii) aligning, in
a more effective manner, expenditures on the line items initially approved while maintaining the
priorities identified in Togo's poverty reduction strategy; (iv) increasing the share of
expenditures on the priority sectors; (v) applying and expanding use of all SIGFiP modules; (vi)
continuing publication of budget-related information; (vii) preparing an Audit Office Manual of
Procedures, continuing the training of Audit Office judges, and providing them with tools and
materials needed for their work; and (viii) strengthening the internal audit and inspection unit
(General Finance Inspectorate).

To that end, the Government intends to:

   ·   Submit the 2011 draft budget along with the MTEFs for the Ministries of Education,
       Health, and Agriculture to the National Assembly by the constitutional deadlines. The
       Government also intends to proceed, at a satisfactory pace, with the sound execution of the
       2010 budget and to disseminate quarterly budget execution reports;
   ·   Ensure the effective operationalization of the Integrated System for Budget Execution
       Information, in particular the accounting module;
   ·   Implement the work program of the General Finance Inspectorate for 2010;
   ·   Continue with reforms of financial authorities by instituting a double-entry computerized
       accounting system at all levels of the tax administration; and
   ·   Continue the analysis of public debt viability.

Financial Sector Reforms

17.    Significant progress has been made with the restructuring of the banking system so that it
can perform its financial intermediation function and contribute to sustainable growth:

   ·   Following the restructuring of the public banks (BTCI, UTB, BTD, and BIA-TOGO) in
       2008 by securitization of their compromised debt, the latter's solvency ratio improved.
       In the short term, the Government intends to continue or even quicken the pace of their
       privatization. To that end, a consortium of privatization consulting firms has been hired
       and an information notice has been published. The Government will make every effort to
       issue a prequalification notice in the weeks ahead;
   ·   With a view to managing the non-performing loans that were exchanged for government
       securities in October 2008, a recovery mechanism will be instituted by end-2010. This
       mechanism will allow the Government to recoup part of the cost associated with the
       recapitalization of State-owned banks. The Government's bank restructuring process is
       intended to avoid a recurrence of the problems that led to the difficulties encountered.


                                                52
18.     The Government has decided to actively seek serious partners with a solid capital base
and know-how in order to proceed with the privatization process. The proceeds derived from the
transfer of State shares in banks and the recovery of compromised debt will be put toward
domestic debt settlement. In the event that residual funds are available after the settlement of
commercial and financial debt, this residue will be used for the advance repurchase of securities
issued as part of the bank restructuring process. Such a transaction will be particularly helpful in
supporting the recovery of the private and financial sectors.

19.    In the medium term, the objective of these reforms is to have healthy banks that
contribute once again to financing the economy.

20.    The microfinance sector plays an important role in poverty reduction in Togo and the
Government plans to continue its work in this sector with a view to its development, by stepping
up surveillance of the sector and ensuring that savings are protected. With this in mind, a draft
law has been prepared by the Government pursuant to WAEMU Directives and submitted to the
National Assembly for passage. The Government also intends to elevate the status of the
microfinance unit to the level of a department.

21.    The liquidity problems with the pension systems are a source of grave concern for the
Government. Consequently, a number of important studies are planned in the context of the
Financial Sector and Governance Project, with a view to the reorganization of Togo's Pension
Fund [Caisse de Retraite du Togo CRT] and Social Security Administration [Caisse Nationale
de Sécurité Sociale CNSS] in 2010.

22.     The Government intends to achieve equilibrium of the financial system during 2010-2011
period, using a specific strategy for each component, namely, the banking sector, the pension
system, and the microfinance sector.

Phosphate Sector Reforms

23.     The phosphate sector remains a key growth sector of Togo's economy; however, the
SNPT continues to experience production problems. As part of our efforts to restructure the
sector, a strategic audit was conducted. Based on the results of the strategic audit and the SNPT's
business plan, a sector strategy is currently being finalized.

24.     Strengthening good governance underpinned by a sound strategic vision for developing the
sector is the Government's key objective. The strategic audit, which was launched in January
2009 with financial support from the World Bank, focused on the strategic areas of the SNPT,
namely company structure, production, and the condition of machinery and equipment. The audit
also took the economic, financial, social, and environmental aspects of Togo's phosphate industry
into account. This strategic audit helped clarify the sector's comprehensive restructuring process
and facilitate the search for a strategic partner. The Government intends to implement the
recommendations of this audit.

25.      The Government intends to complete the country's process of accession to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the conditions of which are: (i) the establishment of an
institutional and legal framework to facilitate the effective implementation of the EITI with a view


                                                53
to achieving Candidate Country Status, which includes: (a) the constitution, at the national level, of
one or several committees composed of a balanced cross-section of representatives from the
Extractive Industry, civil society, and the Government; and (b) the designation of a national
coordinator; and (ii) the adoption and publication of a detailed and budgeted action plan for the
activities to be implemented under EITI-Togo.

26.     Moreover, we are committed to ensuring transparency in the sector's financial flows,
particularly through the reconciliation and posting of revenue from phosphate sales and from
royalties and fees paid to the State, in accordance with EITI criteria.

Cotton Sector Reforms

27.     In the cotton sector, pursuant to the recommendations made in the strategic audit,
SOTOCO was liquidated, and a new cotton company was established and reorganized to ensure
its financial viability. The general director and deputy director were hired on a competitive basis,
a departure from the previous practice of appointments by decree. This attests to the
Government's desire to ensure the effective management of the new entity. Furthermore, the
implementation of the recommendations for the introduction of a cotton producer pricing
mechanism linked to international prices was validated by sector operators and is functional.
However, problems pertaining to the financing of inputs persist. In addition, the Government
intends to maximize the agricultural production potential by continuing to provide support and
gradually liberalizing the operating structure.

28.    A series of reforms is underway with World Bank support. They relate to (i) the
introduction of cost accounting; and (ii) the establishment of a reliable information management
system and clear procedures for sales, debt, revenue, and purchasing channels.

29.       The other programs being executed in the cotton sector pertain to:

      ·   Decision making aimed at reducing production costs at all levels;
      ·   Financing of agricultural research and continued rehabilitation of roads in cotton growing
          areas, cotton warehouses, and ginning mills;
      ·   The continued implementation of the cotton sector strategy based on the strategic audit;
      ·   The strengthening of producer groups and of unions of producer groups and their umbrella
          organizations; and
      ·   The conduct of an external audit at the end of each financial year.

30.     The ultimate goal is to establish, as quickly as possible, a sector comprising a private
cotton company in which the State and producers hold a minority stake.

Energy Sector Reforms

31.    Production in the electricity sector increased in 2009 relative to previous years. Togo's
heavy reliance on foreign countries to meet energy needs coupled with the energy crisis in
supplier countries led to adjustments in electricity rates. In July 2009, the Togo Electric Power


                                                  54
Company [Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo CEET] increased industrial rates. The general
application of this rate adjustment to households is planned for 2010.

32.      Pursuant to the measures adopted by the Government with respect to strengthening
corporate governance, the contract concluded with the CEET in 2009 remains in effect. The
Government will ensure settlement of the debt owed by public sector entities to the CEET. To that
end, a strategy for settling the debt was developed and validated by the CEET and the debtor
entities. This strategy provides for securitization of CEET's debt in order to provide it with the
resources necessary to honor its commitments under the performance contract. The implementation
of this strategy will help avoid accumulation of new arrears in the future. In the 2010 budget, the
Government adopted a realistic approach to the allocation of funding for electricity consumption
by public entities. In addition, it commissioned, with financial support from the World Bank, a
study that is currently underway and is aimed at conducting a review of the financial status and
defining the sector's future development strategy. With a view to strengthening energy capacity, a
contract was concluded with the Contour Global company for the production of 100 MW of
thermal energy. Production at this level will commence during the second quarter of 2010, thereby
easing energy supply constraints. To obviate the need for State subsidies, the CEET, in close
collaboration with the Benin Electric Company [Compagnie Electrique du Bénin CEB], is
committed to negotiating export contracts to ensure adequate demand for its production.
However, new investments will be necessary to improve quality and expand the current
distribution grid. In addition, a plan to construct a hydro-electric power plant in Adjarala is
currently under consideration. The Government has also equipped the CEET with another 20
MGW thermal power plant. Along with Benin and Ghana, Togo is also a member of the West
African Power Pool (WAPP), which is working to construct the 330 kV line aimed at significantly
increasing the electricity supply in the countries in the subregion.

33.     The Government will carry out actions focusing primarily on: (i) strengthening private
sector participation in the development of energy production; (ii) increasing subregional
cooperation in the production, purchase, sale, and transport of energy; (iii) promoting and
publicizing the use of domestic gas (LPG); (iv) establishing a fund for rural electrification; (v)
introducing a financing mechanism for the sector with the participation of external donors and the
domestic financial system; (vi) building awareness of the efficient use of all forms of energy;
(vii) ensuring the sector's financial sustainability by improving collection rates, replacing certain
equipment, and systematically paying public consumption costs; and (viii) developing, in the
longer term, a sector plan designed to provide low-cost electricity to consumers.

Transport Sector Reforms

34.     The Government's objectives in the area of land transport are to: (i) improve the
competitiveness of Togo's products in domestic and international markets by reducing transport
costs and providing better quality services; (ii) facilitate the movement of goods and persons; and
(iii) contribute to poverty reduction in urban and rural areas by making remote areas more
accessible, providing access to basic services, providing services to production areas, and creating
jobs (direct and indirect). With a view to allowing the road transport sector to fully play its role in
the country's development, the authorities developed a transport sector strategy that is currently
being implemented. In 2005, the Government undertook to revitalize road maintenance programs,
notably through the Road Maintenance Fund [Fonds d'Entretien Routier FER]. Unfortunately,


                                                  55
this entity did not meet the Government's expectations. The FER was therefore dissolved in 2008
and replaced by the Road Fund [Fonds Routier FR], the Autonomous Toll and Road Maintenance
Company [Compagnie Autonome de Péage et d'Entretien Routier CAPER], and the National
Road Council [Conseil National des Routes CNR]. The Government intends to (i) build,
rehabilitate, and maintain rural and agricultural roads, urban roads, bridges, and national and
inter-State roads; (ii) expand or divide sections on the major access roads to the capital; (iii)
improve the layout of the road network; (iv) support the private organization of mass transport;
and (v) resume the implementation of common policies and regional projects within ECOWAS
and UEMOA in order to improve the circulation of goods and persons. In the wake of the floods
of 2008, the Government undertook a large-scale emergency program to rehabilitate urban,
national, and inter-State roads and rebuild destroyed bridges.

35.     With respect to maritime transport, a preliminary impact assessment of the reforms
pertaining to private concessions and the computerization of customs services (ASYCUDA++)
will be conducted in the short term. A strategic study to identify a long-term vision for the
development and positioning of the Autonomous Port of Lomé [Port Autonome de Lomé PAL]
will be conducted. In the medium term, additional efforts will be made to improve the
competitiveness of PAL. In that regard, the Port, which seeks to provide quality services to its
customers, prepared a port development program that includes, inter alia, the construction of a
third dock and a harbor basin to transform the Lomé port into a hub for the subregion through
increased port capacity, the development of several parking areas, the construction of an inland
dry port, and the introduction, in the near future, of a one-stop shop, whose primary objective is
to facilitate and expedite the various formalities and the implementation of a transit monitoring
program.

Social Sector Reforms

36.     With respect to the health sector, the Government intends to implement the national health
development plan in the medium term (2008-2012), including a medium-term human resource
development component. It bears noting that a health code was instituted in this sector in May
2009. The Government also intends to conduct an institutional audit of the Ministry of Health. In
addition to these measures, the Government will carry out other actions, including: (i) the
continued strengthening of infrastructure and equipment, and of human resources, and the
preparation of a health map to accord greater priority to areas poorly covered by the health
system; (ii) the promotion of child and maternal health through access to preventive and curative
services, the implementation of an Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), the prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases and the implementation of primary health care for newborns, infants,
and children; (iii) the continued prevention and treatment of malaria through the provision and
distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), the reduction of the price of anti-malaria
medication, and the implementation of a malaria treatment policy; (iv) the ongoing strengthening
of tuberculosis screening and treatment through increased capacity to detect new cases of
pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB+), and improvements in the quality of therapeutic care; and (v) the
prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS through awareness building among young people and sex
workers, condom distribution, STI prevention, blood safety, counseling for voluntary and
anonymous testing, and capacity building for patient care.




                                               56
37.     In the education sector, as part of the implementation of the National Education Sector
Plan, the Government is committed to continuing efforts to provide initial training to a minimum
of 500 newly recruited teachers and ongoing training to at least 4,000 current teachers. It intends
to continue efforts to: (i) construct and rehabilitate educational infrastructure; (ii) train trainers
and educators; (iii) improve teaching conditions in technical training and professional training;
(iv) promote the education of young women by reducing school expenses; (v) improve the quality
of higher education and promote gender equality in this sphere; (vi) strengthen facilities to
accommodate the increasingly large number of students enrolled in the country's universities;
and (vii) take into account the additional actions included in the Fast Track Initiative-Education for
All.

38.     The water and sanitation sector remains a priority for the Government, which intends to
continue its efforts to improve access to drinking water and sanitation infrastructure. To that end,
it plans to continue emergency rainwater purification works for Lomé and the development of
sanitation master plans for all other towns. The Government will continue to build awareness
among households regarding the use of sanitary facilities and wastewater disposal, and among
waste disposal companies regarding the use of appropriate sites for the disposal of sewage and
wastewater.

39.     Support for community development: with a view to improving the living conditions of
the poorest populations, the Government, with World Bank support through the emergency
project for community development, is committed to moving forward with its community
development policy to ensure that these poor population segments have better access to quality
public services and economic opportunities.

III. Other Activities

The PRSP Process and HIPC
40.    The Government adopted its poverty reduction strategy (PRSP) in June 2009. It intends to
implement the measures set forth in the complete PRSP with a view to achieving the completion
point in 2010. Against this backdrop, the Priority Action Program (PAP) was validated in
November 2009, thus reflecting the implementation of the PRSP. It bears noting that provision was
made for the PAP in the 2010 budget.

Monitoring and Evaluation

41.     The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for the overall implementation of the
program supported by the Third Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-3). The
Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform and Financial Program Monitoring (PS-PRPF) is tasked
with the day-to-day monitoring and evaluation of the program. This entity coordinates the
implementation of the Government's program within the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)
and is assisted by a Program and Reform Monitoring Committee. As in the case of the previous
grants, the Government will provide quarterly reports to the World Bank on the program's
implementation progress, which is measured against the timetable and agreed performance
indicators.




                                                 57
42.     It is the Government's hope that these political, economic, and social reforms will help
strengthen financial cooperation with the World Bank and all other bilateral and multilateral
partners in order to mobilize the resources needed to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals.

Request for Financing

43.     The Government is determined to strengthen gains in political stability and continue the
structural reforms initiated in 2006. To that end, the Togolese authorities are committed to
implementing the program presented above and detailed in the matrix in the attached annex. The
Government is therefore requesting technical and financial assistance from the World Bank to
execute its program through the Third Economic Recovery and Governance Grant (ERGG-3).

44.     Togo's financial sector performance declined sharply since the 1990s as governance
and economic performance deteriorated. Difficulties were most severe in three banks under
state control--Union Togolaise de Banque (UTB), Banque Togolaise pour le Commerce et
l'Industrie (BTCI), and Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique (BIA). 31 These three banks,
accounting for 46 percent of the Togolese banking market in 2008, had large negative equity,
failed to comply with the prudential standards, and had high non-performing loans. These banks
required restructuring, including recapitalization in addition to comprehensive internal reforms
(notably to improve corporate governance, lower operating costs, strengthen loan procedures and
internal controls and develop management information systems).

45.     Weak governance of the banking sector in addition to the sector's high exposure to
the public sector, including to the cotton and phosphate companies, constituted an
unhealthy concentration of risks that crowded out financing for the private sector. The
large stock of domestic arrears of the Government to the local private sector was severely
constraining the ability of private enterprises to service their debts to the banking system. In
addition to the three banks mentioned above, the Caisse d'Epargne du Togo (CET), which was
recapitalized by a public offering and which has received a commercial bank license (under the
name Banque Populaire pour l'Epargne et le Crédit), also required an operational restructuring
which is under way.

46.     The Government's program comprises restructuring of the ailing state-owned
banks, a critical measure for macroeconomic stability and effective financial
intermediation. Given the existing situation, the Government's short-term priority is to
restructure the banking sector and formulate a financial sector development strategy. The
Government initiated the process by strengthening bank monitoring and developing a bank
restructuring strategy based on the recommendations of the WAEMU Banking Commission and
technical advice provided by the IMF and World Bank.

47.     The Government has committed to proceed with a complete financial as well as
internal restructuring of the commercial banks. Progress has been achieved with the
restructuring of the three banks (BTCI, UTB and BIA) with negative net worth. The financial
restructuring comprises two components: absorption of past losses, followed by a recapitalization
to prudential norms. 32 33 In December 2008, the Government issued bonds of about of CFAF
88.1 billion in order to restore the solvency rate of the 3 banks being restructured above 8
percent.


31
   BIA became a state owned bank with the withdrawal of Belgolaise in June 2008.
32
   To absorb past losses: (i) all non performing loans would be completely provisioned, resulting in negative net
worth; and (ii) the negative net worth would be brought back to a level yielding a solvency ratio of 8 percent in
conformity with the BCEAO's prudential norm, by substituting Government bonds against fully provisioned non-
performing assets. Cotton and phosphate non performing debt in a private bank would also be securitized.
33
    Two other options that were considered at length--the closing of the banks or moving the NPLs into to-be-
created "bad banks"--were both rejected in view of their likely strong adverse effect on depositors and on Togo's
economy.


                                                       65
48.     The Government bonds issued bear a market rate of 6 percent so they could be
resold easily. Following a request presented to the BCEAO, the Council of Ministers of the
BCEAO has accepted that the bonds be used as collateral for central bank refinancing. In
addition, it was proposed that a very lean structure organize and maintain a secondary market in
these bonds and a lean loan recovery agency be set up to proceed with the recovery of non-
performing assets (this agency could be the structure in charge of developing the secondary
market for the Government bonds). The IDA-financed Financial Sector and Governance (FSG)
TA Project approved on March 31, 2009 will fund the establishment of the loan recovery and
secondary market structure. In addition, the Government has accepted that proceeds from loan
recoveries and privatization of banks be used to settle domestic debt or to buy back the bonds
issued during the securitization by anticipation.

49.    With respect to internal restructuring and improvement in governance, the
government has initiated the process to cede the Government's shares in the banks to
private strategic partners. With the assistance of the Financial Sector and Governance (FSG)
TA project, privatization advisers were recruited in November 2009. The Government has
included the Banque Togolaise de Développement (BTD), a public bank in satisfactory financial
condition, among the banks to be privatized. Several banks, from West Africa, Nigeria and
Morocco have expressed interest in investing in Togolese banks. On December 30, 2009, the
Government issued an Information Notice announcing the privatization of the four state-owned
banks (BTCI, BIA, UTB and BTD).

This note provides the IMF staff assessment of recent macroeconomic developments in Togo
and progress under the three-year program supported by the Fund's Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) starting from April 2008, based on information through end-March 2010. 1 Following
Togo's prolonged domestic crisis, its economic program aims to restore the health of public
finances and lay the foundations for the resumption of strong, sustained growth. In light of
the persistent impact of the global recession on aggregate demand, the ECF -supported
program has also involved temporary increases in the fiscal and current account deficits in
2009 and 2010, related to counter-cyclical fiscal policies.

Performance under the ECF-supported program

Performance through end-December 2009 generally met program goals, although there
were modest deviations from program targets. The main deviation was a slippage in late
2009 relative to the program's fiscal framework, for the first time under the program. Overall
revenue performance fell short by an amount equivalent to 0.2 percent ofGDP, as
disappointing nontax revenue collection was only partially offset by tax revenue
overperformance. However, the level of expenditures in 2009, which was intended under the
program to be contingent on revenue collection, was not curtailed. As a result, the program's
performance criterion for the domestic primary fiscal balance for end-December was
narrowly missed. Combined with extra domestic arrears clearance and unexpected debt
servicing, this led in turn to missing the net domestic financing performance criterion by
0.7 percent ofGDP. 2 As discussed below, the authorities are taking corrective actions. This
performance comes against the backdrop of the persistent impact ofthe global recession on
Togo's exports, remittances, and investment inflows.

Progress on structural benchmarks was generally satisfactory. Of the four structural
benchmarks for end-December 2009 and end-March 2010, the authorities achieved one on
launching preparations for bank privatization on time; achieved the actions for the phosphate
sector with a delay; advanced significantly on domestic arrears clearance with prospects for
completing this measure with a minor delay; and remained on schedule with the revised
timetable for establishing an NPL recovery mechanism. The authorities also contracted
external debt payable over 3Yz years to modernize Togo's TV broadcasting infrastructure
without assessing the implications of the transaction for compliance with the continuous

arrangement.

2The higher-than-programmed debt service largely reflects weaknesses in the debt tracking system, in
particular for domestic debt.

performance criterion that limits new nonconcessional external debt. Based on currently
available information, staffhas concluded that the borrowing is inconsistent with the
performance criterion under the ECF arrangement, and the authorities have agreed to attempt
to re-negotiate the contract as a corrective measure.

    Outlook and policies for 2010

The program's loosened fiscal stance in 2010 remains warranted for counter-cyclical
purposes, as well as post-crisis reasons. The temporarily high fiscal deficit3 results primarily                    <




from increased domestically-financed public investment spending (targeted especially on rural
infrastructure) and the clearance in cash of domestic arrears to private suppliers. The persistent
effects of the global crisis continue to hold back growth, and these fiscal policies will support
activity without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability or fiscal sustainability. With these
measures, growth in 2010 is projected at 3.3 percent, still below potential. Balance of
payments needs over the program period have also grown. The global recession is depressing
exports and remittances, while counter-cyclical fiscal policy is supporting import demand; as
a result, the current account deficit has grown to around 7 percent ofGDP in 2009 and 2010.
Inflation is expected to remain stable at around 2 percent.

Although financing needs for the second half of2010 are significant, the authorities and
their partners are committed to ensuring the budget is fully financed. The mission
worked with the authorities to identify ways of meeting all financing needs for the rest of
2010. The authorities have committed to raising additional revenue and are seeking
additional exceptional financing (on grant or concessional terms) from the IMF and key
donors, mainly the ED. If the additional financing is not available, the authorities are
committed to reducing planned spending, although the mission agreed that this was not a
desirable outcome from a social and countercyclical point of view. The authoritjes have also
decided on corrective actions to address deviations from program targets, including
strengthened public financial management measures.

The risks to macroeconomic stability and program implementation, while moderate,
merit continued action and vigilance. Externally, Togo remains vulnerable to a
terms-of-trade shock or a downturn in remittances. Domestically, local elections planned for
late 2010/early 2011 may pose some risks of political uncertainty, although the peaceful
staging of presidential elections in March lessened any risks of political instability. Togo is
currently in debt distress; however, with the completion point for HIPC/MDRI debt relief
expected as early as the end of this year, indicators for external and public debt sustainability
are projected to improve progressively based on the following policy mix: a fiscal policy


3The 2010 overall fiscal deficit on a payment order basis is projected at 3.0 percent ofGDP (5.4 percent
excluding grants). On a cash basis including arrears clearance, the fiscal balance is projected at 7.8 percent of
GDP (10.2 percent excluding grants).
                                            3


anchor of a primary budget balance of zero or higher over the medium term; a high degree of
concessionality of external financing (at least 35 percent); and a sustained growth of about
4 percent annually, supported by ongoing structural reforms.

Growth-enhancing structural reforms

The main economic challenges are pursuing sustainable pro-growth fiscal policies and
maintaining the momentum of structural reforms to enhance growth potential. The
priorities for structural reforms are the rapid restructuring of state-owned banks and
enterprises and improving the overall business environment, consistent with the country's
Poverty Reduction Strategy. Moreover, several structural reform measures in public financial
management are required to fulfill the conditions for the HIPC completion point triggers, and
the authorities are on track to complete these measures by the end of201O.

We therefore believe that the authorities' implementation of the ECF-supported
program is providing a stable and sustainable macroeconomic framework. Staff will
continue to monitor implementation of the program, including with two forthcoming
biannual missions. The last review ofthe current ECF-supported program is expected to be
concluded in the second quarter 0[2011.
