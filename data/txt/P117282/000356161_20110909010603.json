          outcome was moderate; the Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the fact that\n            policy reforms in the prior actions were embedded in the\n            Government's own reform agenda and closely aligned with\n            two major pillars of the full Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Paper (PRSP), led to strong ownership of the reforms. Given\n            the generally limited capacity within the public sector in\n            fragile countries such as Togo, it was important to be\n            selective in the choice of policy and institutional reforms.\n            It is important to carefully choose prior actions that are\n            likely to open the door for other important policy and\n            institutional reforms. The effectiveness of Bank-supported\n            development policy operations can be enhanced by its\n            complementarities with other Bank-financed operation and the\n            efforts of other active donors in the reform areas."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
