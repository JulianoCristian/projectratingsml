Recovery and\n            Governance Grant (ERGG-3) to the Republic of Togo, is\n            stand-alone, one-tranche development policy grant supports\n            the Government's efforts to pursue the implementation\n            of governance reforms initiated under the ERGG and ERGG-2\n            approved by the Board in May 2008 and April 2009,\n            respectively. Specifically, the ERGG-3 focuses on continuing\n            and deepening policy reforms to improve public financial\n            management (PFM) and governance of key sectors of the\n            economy. It is in this challenging context that the grant\n            aims to assist the Togolese Government in continuing the\n            implementation of its reform agenda to support the\n            country's economic and social recovery and lay the\n            foundation for sustained pro-poor growth. The recent shocks\n            have exposed the fragility of Togo's institutions of\n            economic and financial management but also the resolve of\n            policy makers to sustain their reform program. The grant\n            will continue to support government-owned reforms to improve\n            governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial\n            management as well as further advance structural reforms\n            aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in key\n            sectors of the economy (phosphates, cotton, and energy)\n            launched under the ERGG and ERGG-2. These reforms will\n            achieve strengthened fiscal sustainability, improved\n            economic governance and enhanced transparency of State\n            institutions and processes critical elements for the\n            country's economic and social recovery."}, "docdt": "2010-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
