1.    Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

Background. At project appraisal in early 2010, Togo was (and still is) a fragile country. At the end
of 2007, the country had just emerged from an extended period of political instability since the early
90s. The 2007 parliamentary elections, deemed free and transparent marked a milestone in Togo’s
democratization process and paved the way for donors’ reengagement. The inclusive cabinet resulting
from the 2006 political agreement and the 2007 parliamentary elections had started implementing
political and economic reforms to consolidate the reconciliation of the society and launch the
recovery of the economy. In November 2007, the EU was the first major donor to restore full
cooperation with Togo, after a 14 year suspension. The Bank supported these efforts through the two
previous Economic Recovery and Governance Grants (ERGGs,1) approved respectively in May 2008
and April 2009.

Togo’s poor economic growth performance at the time of program appraisal was a direct
consequence of the prolonged period of political instability, in parallel with economic and financial
mismanagement, and the related withdrawal of donor support before 2008. The socio-political crisis
had a very negative impact on the country’s economic performance and dramatically reduced living
standards. Togo is among the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with income per capita at
US$440 in 2009, according to the Bank’s Atlas methodology.

While economic reforms undertaken during the IMF’s 2008-20112 Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
and the ERGGs started showing some results, Togo’s economy had been hit by a number of internal
and external shocks in 2008 and 2009: a severe national energy crisis, flooding in certain parts of the
country, high food and energy world prices, and eventually the international financial crisis and
ensuing global recession.

Rationale for Bank assistance. Despite the daunting legacy of the crisis and the severe internal and
external shocks during the first two years of recovery (2008 and 2009), the new Government was able
to implement a wide range reforms, including: (i) adoption of a comprehensive arrears clearance
strategy contributed to restore private sector confidence; (ii) financial and strategic audits of the
cotton parastatal and clearance of its arrears to farmers; and (iii) a strategic audit of the phosphate
company. Overall, Togo had achieved considerable progress during the two years (2008-2009)
preceding appraisal of the ERGG-3. Moreover, the country was benefitting from an IMF ECF (2008-
2011). The achievement of the HIPC decision point end of 2008 with the prospect of attaining the
HIPC completion point two years later was another positive factor. A full PRSP had been adopted in
July 2009. The preconditions for a successful program were thus in place.

But significant institutional and economic challenges remained, including: (i) significant weaknesses
in the public financial management system, as evidenced by the 2009 PEMFAR; (ii) low

  The ERGG formed part of a coordinated strategy with the IMF, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and other donor
agencies to clear Togo’s arrears and resume normal relations with the country, and the ERGG-2 supported consolidation
of the recovery.

  The IMF ECF program will end no later than August 2011.

administrative capacity due to the long period of socio-political conflict and lack of foreign
assistance; and (iv) the drain of the loss-making state-owned enterprises on the economy. On the
political front, the presidential elections scheduled for March 2010, shortly after program appraisal,
represented both a risk and an opportunity (cf. background section above). The Bank’s decision to
assist the authorities in addressing the above weaknesses was based on their good track record and
their strong commitment to reviving the economy and reducing poverty, through consolidating
macro-economic stability and further improving public financial systems and advancing priority
sector reforms.

1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The key development objective of the ERGG-3 was to support government-owned reforms to
improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public financial management and improve
performance in key sectors of the economy. Specifically, the ERGG-3 focused on continuing and
deepening policy reforms initiated by the Government under the ERGG and ERGG-2 to strengthen
budget preparation, execution, controls and public procurement, and improve governance and
transparency in the phosphate, cotton, and energy sectors.

Outcomes and Indicators:

Outcome I: Improved public financial management, as measured by:
 Budget formulation: Improvement in budget planning and the transparency in public accounts
   (budget execution reports published for first three quarters of 2010) and preparation of three
   sectoral MTEFs (education, health and agriculture).
 Budget execution: Support poverty reduction. The execution rate of priority spending (health,
   education, agriculture, and infrastructure) reaches 85% in 2010.
 Budget controls and audits: Internal control procedures are more efficient and effective by
   increasing the number of internal audits by 25 percent (8 internal audits conducted in 2009).
 Public procurement: Procurement controls are enhanced (at least 80 percent of contracts in five
   key ministries, seven major public companies (Togo-Telecom, NSCT, LONATO, CEET, TdE,
   SALT and PAL) and the Lomé Municipal Office processed during the last quarter of 2010 have
   been subject to prior review by the General Procurement Department).

Outcome 2: Strengthened governance and efficiency in key sectors, as measured by:
 Cotton sector: Improved management of the new cotton company NSCT (10% reduction in the
   processing costs, including overhead, during the 2010/2011 cotton season).
 Phosphate sector: Governance strengthened by improving transparency and accountability (four
   criteria met towards becoming an EITI candidate country).
 Energy sector: Financial situation of electricity company (CEET) improved (State3 arrears to
   CEET eliminated).

1.3     Revised PDO

PDOs and result indicators remained unchanged during program implementation.

1.4     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The prior actions retained under the ERGG-3 reflected the priorities of the Government’s reform
program (full PRSP adopted in July 2009) and of the Bank’s interim strategy. As in the previous
operations, they were critical stepping stones for the implementation of a broader, medium-term
reform program. The ERGG supported reforms in the area of public finance management, and cotton,
phosphates and energy sectors (see Table 2).

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

The ERGG-3 achieved its development objectives despite a difficult international environment.
Macroeconomic and other performance indicators are detailed below as well as the progress on
policy reform areas.

Macroeconomic performance: The acceleration of growth initially envisaged in the PRSP did not
materialize due largely to a number of exogenous shocks (international financial crisis and the
ensuing global recession). Real GDP growth is estimated 3.4 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively,
recovering from 2.4 percent in 2008 when flooding and surges in international oil and food prices
depressed growth, but below the projected potential of 4 percent. The main drivers of growth were
the agricultural sector, clinker and cement in the secondary sector and construction and public works
linked to increases in public investment. Inflation stood at a low 2.2 percent in 2010. The global
recession has also increased balance of payment pressures, with a current account deficit of 7.7
percent of GDP in 2010, mainly due to a fall in foreign direct investment flows.

Togo’s fiscal performance was satisfactory in 2010. Implementation of the fiscal program remained
broadly on target over the 2009-2010 period. Togo reached the Completion Point under the HIPC
Initiative on December 14, 2010. Upon reaching the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative, Togo also qualified for additional debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI). Togo’s debt burden was substantially reduced following the HIPC completion point and as
a result the LIC DSA indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress post-HIPC completion
point.

Progress on policy reform areas

The ERGG-3 approval was subject to the implementation of eleven prior actions. All prior actions
were fully completed at Board presentation on May 20, 2010 (see Table 2, above). During the 2010
implementation period, further progress has been achieved on the reforms supported by the operation.

Public financial management: This area remained one of the Government’s key priorities during the
ERGG-3 implementation period. Notable progress was made in improving the efficiency of budget
planning, execution and control, as well as in procurement. Transparency was enhanced through the
publication of quarterly budget execution reports. Particularly relevant for achieving poverty
reduction goals was the adoption of MTEFs in priorities sectors (Health, Education in the 2010
budget, Agriculture added in the 2011 budget). The actual availability of credit lines for priority
ministries at scheduled milestones throughout the fiscal year was implemented. The SIGFIP
accounting module was made operational in the treasury department to strengthen the budget
execution and reporting. Newly established control and audit mechanisms were operationalised.
Moreover, during the implementation period of the ERGG-3, the Ministry of Finance has adopted a
multi-year reform strategy with a strong focus on public finance (Stratégie de Gestion des Finances
Publiques - SGFP), accompanied by a detailed 2010-2012 action plan (PA/SGFP). This strategy
includes the implementation of the new set of WAEMU Directives adopted in 2009 by the regional
council of ministers of finance, and rationalization and simplification of the expenditure chain by
reducing both redundant controls and the use of exceptional expenditure procedures.

In the area of public procurement, the ERGG-3 built on the reforms supported by the previous
ERGGs 4 with the establishment of the General Procurement Department and procurement
commissions in at least five major ministries and in the Lomé Municipal Office. At ICR, the new
General Procurement Department had (i) recruited additional staff through a competitive process, (ii)
conducted two training sessions for staff from contracting authorities (ministries, parastatals and
Lomé Municipal Office) as well as a separate training session for the private sector and civil society.
As of March 8, 2011, the Department had reviewed a total of 216 documents submitted, of which 103
bidding documents, 18 bid evaluation reports and 9 contracts or contract amendments. A draft text for
revising the thresholds for prior review (at present between 15 and 25 million CFAF for limited
consultation/ shortlist contracts and above 25 million CFAF for competitive bidding) is under
consideration. Moreover, procurement commissions have been established in five key ministries and
establishment of such commissions in other ministries – as required by the new procurement law and

  The 2009 PEMFAR had identified major weaknesses and the Government had started addressing the most urgent issues
under the previous ERGGs. As a first step, the government adopted a procurement reform action plan. Subsequent
reforms included the adoption of a new procurement law and a new procurement code, in line with WAEMU
Procurement Guidelines.

code - is ongoing. As a follow-up measure, a procurement newspaper and website were created in
December 2010, where all procurement notices and contract awards are published.

Cotton sector: The report on the new cotton company’s (NSCT) management information and cost
accounting system was prepared and the actual implementation of the cost accounting system was
supported by the ERGG-4 (Table 4). The regulatory framework for the cotton sector that specifies
the roles, responsibilities and obligations of sector stakeholders and the mechanisms to make the
representation of producers at the NSCT Board effective was adopted. The adoption of the cotton
sector regulatory framework has been followed by capacity building for the farmers’ representatives
at the NSCT Board (prior action for the ERGG-4). A total of 160 farmers have been trained on the
rights and duties of shareholders, under an EU financed project (Comstabex). A new IDA-financed
agricultural support project (PASA) is expected to continue the capacity building efforts for cotton
farmers. Continued commitment and efforts will be needed to consolidate the restoration of
confidence of farmers and creditors in the cotton sector, reduce costs and generate resources to
upgrade its equipment and finance the sector’s development.

Phosphate sector: Important milestones were achieved to improve transparency in this sector plagued
by poor governance: (i) the reconciliation results of the 2008 revenues from phosphate sales with
revenues received by the public Treasury that same year were published; and (ii) the government
prepared and adopted the legal and institutional framework with the objective of becoming an EITI
candidate. With the completion of the latter, 4 of the 5 required EITI criteria were met. The last EITI
criterion became a prior action for the ERGG-4 - adoption of a detailed action plan and budget for the
activities that are to be implemented under EITI-Togo. As a result of the completion of the last
criterion and successful application Togo was granted EITI candidate status in October 2010. It has
now two years to achieve EITI validation status. In spite of these important steps to enhance
transparency, the company faces productivity problems due to outdated equipment, electricity
shortages, and major governance problems in its equipment and spare parts procurement practices. As
a result, despite the significant investments during the first phase of the rehabilitation production fell
by 4 percent in 2010. To address the challenges of the sector, it is important to deepen the initiated
reforms to address the concerns of potential strategic partners.

Energy sector: Several measures were taken to improve the delicate financial situation of CEET
(i) the preparation of a time-bound plan for the clearance of public and para-public arrears to CEET
and the identification of measures to prevent accumulation of arrears in the future; (ii) the settlement
of the central administration’s arrears to CEET. All outstanding central administration arrears
towards CEET (4.2 billion CFAF or about US$8 million) were securitized in 2010. Public entities
which are not part of the central government still owed 940 million CFAF (less than US$2 million) to
CEET.

The financial situation of the company worsened in June 2009 when it was not authorized by the
Government to raise electricity tariffs (except to industrial customers) after its major supplier CEB
increased its rates by 10 percent in June 2009. Adjustment of electricity rates by CEET become an
ERGG-4 prior condition and an adjustment took effect in January 2011. Despite this improvement,
the financial situation of CEET remains fragile. The securitization of arrears (issuance of interest-
bearing debt certification with a repayment schedule) did not provide fresh cash flow to the company.
Furthermore, the supply agreement with the private operator Contour Global has a significant

turbines were expected to operate with natural gas under a contract with the West African Gas
Pipeline Company (WAGPC), but the gas supply was delayed and the company still operates (as of
March 2011) with heavy fuel entailing a production cost of CFAF 100/Kwh (including fuel costs). In
addition, many other problems persist, including low bill recovery rates, underinvestment in
equipment, and operational efficiency. It is therefore critical to thoroughly assess CEET’s financial
position and implement a plan to ensure its long-term viability. Such a plan would include efficiency
gains and the prospects of exporting surplus electricity.5

    2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Overall, the ambitious but realistic design of this budget support operations proved to be a major
factor for successful implementation, by addressing key issues for growth and poverty reduction. The
overarching theme of all three ERGGs - promoting governance, transparency and efficiency in public
financial management and key sectors of the economy - as well as the gradual deepening of the
reforms, provided consistency and critical mass.

Factors outside the control of the Government

As detailed above under the macroeconomic performance section, the economy’s 2010 growth rate
was satisfactory, but below potential, mainly due to the global economic crisis.

The reengagement of all major donors – IMF, World Bank, AfDB, EU, and France – played a crucial
role in ensuring financial sustainability and providing technical assistance to overcome capacity
constraints.

Factors generally subject to Government control

Government Ownership: The Government’s strong commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability
and advance structural reforms in key economic sectors was a positive factor and remained constant
during the ERGG-3 implementation period. The reforms were part of the Government’s own reform
agenda, articulated initially in the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy, (adopted in March 2008), and
subsequently in the full Poverty Reduction Strategy adopted in July 2009. The first PRS annual
progress report (published in October 2010) helped take stock, identify remaining weaknesses and
adapt the action plan to new developments. A reform strategy with a heavy focus on public finance
presented by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in September 2010 and subsequently adopted by
the Council of Ministers is another proof of ownership.

Political stability: The March 2010 presidential elections were generally perceived as fair and
transparent according to the regional election observers. They opened the way for a truly inclusive
Government (including cabinet members of the main opposition party UFC), and hence renewed
commitment to address the outstanding reform agenda.

  The Bank is financing a Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) study, which will include an
organizational audit and the development of a financial model for CEET. Both are expected to contribute to the
identification of measures to improve the financial situation of CEET.


                                                         9
Implementation capacity: Lack of sufficient professional staff and weak institutional capacity and
coordination in the wake of the long recent history of socio-political instability and suspended foreign
assistance had been identified as a risk for this operation. It was mitigated through the provision of
technical assistance by several donors (cf. risk mitigation section below for more details). Intensive
country dialogue and close involvement by the Bank staff, also contributed to overcome the
constraints. As a result, the capacity constraints did not affect the substantive progress of the reform
program in most areas, with two exceptions: (i) the expected outcome indicator of the procurement
reform – having 80% of contracts reviewed by the General Procurement Office during the last quarter
of 2010 – was not achieved because of the slow start of this Department; and (ii) the target of 85%
percent budget execution rate for priority sectors was not achieved due the low implementation
capacity.

Soundness of the background analysis

The design of the ERGG-3 had greatly benefited from recent or ongoing analytical work and their
recommendations fed into the formulation of the ERGG-3’s prior actions and expected results. The
2009 PEMFAR provided a diagnostic of the strengths and weaknesses of the public financial
management system. With regard to the cotton and phosphates sector, the cotton sector strategy and
the strategic audit of the phosphate sector6 greatly contributed to the deep knowledge of the sector.
The country’s macroeconomic performance and planned policies have been assessed in the context of
joint Bank-IMF missions in November 2009, and April and September 2010.

Assessment of the operation’s design

Degree of complexity: The overarching theme of governance, both in public financial management
and key economic sectors, provided a powerful thematic focus. The public financial management
component was by its nature entirely under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance which had shown strong leadership during the ERGG and ERGG-2 in its role of supervision
and coordination of the overall economic reform program. The Ministry also exercises oversight over
parastatals at the center of sector reforms (cotton, phosphates, and electricity, jointly with the sector
ministries). This reduced number of institutional counterparts greatly simplified the design of the
operation.

Realism: The operation retained a limited number of prior actions where well-grounded diagnostic
work was available, with an emphasis on continuity and deepening reforms in areas already
addressed by the two previous ERGGs. Lessons learned from these two operations were fully
integrated into the design, including the importance of focusing on strategic prior actions which drive
reform forward. Capacity constraints had been identified, but resources provided by the EU, the
LICUS trust fund and IMF financed relevant studies and technical assistance (PEMFAR, key sectoral
studies, and implementation of the SIGFIP). This successful mitigation of the capacity constraints
met expectations and proved that the design of the operation was realistic.

Relevance of the risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation measures

Despite a significant level of risks (political, macroeconomic, fiduciary) identified during the design
phase, most of those risks either did not materialize or were successfully mitigated. No unidentified
risks to project implementation emerged. Overall, risks and mitigation measures were well identified
and the assessment of the likely outcome of mitigation measures was realistic.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E design
As in previous development policy operations, the Ministry of Economy and Finance was entrusted
with the responsibility for overall implementation of the ERGG-3. Day-to-day monitoring of the
program was to be the responsibility of the Comité de Suivi des Programmes et Réformes (CSPR), an
existing high-level team within the Ministry, headed by the Secretary General. This arrangement was
justified by the strength and continuity of this team within the MEF and its involvement in the
ongoing policy reform dialogue. The main technical responsibility for implementation of the public
financial management reforms were expected to stay with the Budget and Treasury Departments,
whose representatives were also part of the Public Finance Steering Committee (Comité de pilotage
des finances publiques) created in 2005. The sector reforms would be implemented by the respective
technical departments in the sector ministries, under the oversight of the ministers in charge of
agriculture (cotton sector) and mines and energy (phosphates and electricity), and the overall
coordination of the MEF. The MEF team would also be closely involved in the monitoring of the
program and evaluation of the results. The Government was expected to provide quarterly reports to
IDA on implementation progress measured against the established timetables and the agreed
performance indicators. The overall reform effort was to be reviewed by the Government in close
coordination with regular Bank supervision to ensure continued implementation of the program
within an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.

M&E implementation and utilization
The M&E implementation proceeded relatively smoothly according to design. As the MEF, through
its CSPR, is also in charge of monitoring the PRSP and the overall economic reform program, it was
well placed to conduct the dialogue with stakeholders and development partners. Specific aspects of
PFM and procurement reform were implemented by the Budget, Treasury, Financial Controls and
Procurement Departments. The CSPR led the consultation with the key sector ministries involved,
Agriculture, Mines and Energy, and with the parastatals where governance reforms were
implemented. Bank staff reviewed overall progress of the program with the Government, the
parastatals and stakeholders in the case of the cotton company. The evaluation results were used to
inform the preparation of the subsequent ERGG 4. Two IMF missions in 2010 monitored adherence
to a sound macroeconomic framework. The Government prepared regular progress reports on the
implementation the reforms. The PRSP annual progress report (APR) published in October 2010 was
also a monitoring and evaluation instrument for measuring the achievements under the first two
PRSP pillars (i) strengthening of governance; and (ii) consolidation of the foundations of strong and
sustainable growth, as the ERGG-3 development objectives and outcome indicators were closely
aligned with these two pillars. The APR points to significant progress in the areas of political,
institutional, administrative, and economic governance, and highlights consolidation of structural
reforms in the phosphates and cotton sectors. It identifies the low execution rate of investment
expenditure in priority ministries as a major problem for poverty reduction objectives and traces it to
implementation capacity, most importantly procurement delays.

2.4   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The ERGG-3 was the third development policy operation after the reengagement strategy initiated
with the interim policy note in April 2008, and pursued consistently the objectives of governance,



                                                12
transparency and efficiency. In anticipation of a follow-up development policy operation (ERGG 4),
the ERGG-3 policy matrix identified a set of nine reform measures to be considered for possible
future budget support from IDA, upon evaluation of their results during the ERGG-3’s
implementation period. These measures were expected to consolidate the foundation for sustained
and robust economic growth by further strengthening governance and transparency in public financial
management as well as in the key sectors of the economy (cotton, phosphates and energy sectors).
They are summarized in the table below:

financial management (budget formulation, execution, control, and public procurement) and
strengthening governance and efficiency in key sectors of the economy (cotton, phosphates, and
energy). Seven out of the nine further actions identified under the ERGG-3 were integrated as prior
actions in the design of the ERGG-4 and implemented before Board presentation.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

The ERGG-3 objectives, design and implementation were fully consistent with the country’s main
priorities, i.e. restoring sound public finance management as well as improved governance and
efficiency in the key sectors of the economy to achieve sustained growth and reduce poverty. The
program’s design was appropriate to country circumstances. Actions were focused on Togo’s
persistent governance problems, despite significant progress achieved during two previous ERGGs.
The period between the inclusive legislative elections held in October 2007 and the presidential
elections in March 2010 saw the gradual re-engagement of major donors and the start of economic
recovery. Advancing structural reforms was crucial for the sustainability of economic recovery after
re-engagement. The operation was well aligned with the Bank’s 2008-2010 Interim Strategy Note
and was closely coordinated with the IMF 2008-11 ECF.

Consistency with Government priorities: The ERGG-3 was consistent with the priorities outlined in
the full PRSP and in the Letter of Development Policy. The full PRSP lays out the strategy for
growth and poverty reduction for the period 2009-2011 and is coupled with a Plan of Priority Actions
(PAP) which details the pluri-annual planning of actions, programs and measures. Among the four
pillars of the PRSP, the first two are supported by the ERGG-3: (i) strengthening of governance, with
a focus on political, institutional and economic governance, and (ii) consolidation of the bases for
strong and sustained growth with measures to reform state-owned enterprises and financial
institutions. The specific reforms supported by the ERGG-3 were critical elements in achieving the
PRSP’s objectives. A medium term reform strategy focusing on public finance (Stratégie de Gestion
des Finances Publiques - SGFP), accompanied by a detailed 2010-2012 3-year action plan
(PA/SGFP) was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 2010 and adopted by
Presidential Decree. The strategy and action plan confirmed the orientation of the Government’s
reform program.

Program design: As was the case with the two previous ERGGs, the design of the ERGG-3 was
informed by extensive and well grounded diagnostic work (2009 PEMFAR and several sector
studies). The continued focus on public financial management and preparation and implementation of
far-reaching reform in key sectors of the economy was ambitious but realistic, given the widely
shared awareness that these issues were at the root of the country’s economic demise and crucial for
economic recovery and development. The design was deliberately kept simple, focusing on those
priorities, with an emphasis on continuity and deepening of reforms.

Relation with Bank Strategy: The overarching goal of the 2008-2010 Interim Strategy Note was to
help Togo recover from the long period of instability and suspension of aid and begin laying the
foundations for sustained, shared growth over the medium term. The three pillars of the ISN are
(i) support for the normalization of relations with the World Bank through the clearance of arrears
which would set the stage for provision of regular IDA resources and pave the way towards debt
relief under the HIPC Initiative and MRDI; (ii) assistance to improve public financial management
and governance in key sector institutions; and (iii) assistance to address critical social needs. After
the first ERGG in 2008 had made arrears clearance and re-engagement possible, the ERGG-2 and



                                                15
ERGG-3 continued to focus on governance issues of the second pillar of the ISN. The poverty
reduction objective of the third pillar remained present.

Complementarities with other Bank activities: The ERGG was designed and implemented in close
cooperation with other ongoing or planned operations and advisory services in the areas of its focus.
Sector reforms and procurement reform were supported by IDA under a LICUS grant (US$1.6
million approved in FY08). The Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Energy project
approved in June 2009 (US$25 million) provides financing for physical infrastructure and thus
complements policy reforms. The private sector and agricultural sector projects expected to be
approved in March and April, 2011, respectively, also complemented this operation. Furthermore, an
EITI implementation project (US$ 0.3 million), approved in January 2011, will support Togo towards
validation status. Additional support was provided by IDA through various non lending instruments.
The Country Economic Memorandum / Diagnostic Trade Integration Study completed in 2010
provided in-depth analysis of economic sectors, including transport, re-exports, and the export
processing zone. The 2009 PEMFAR has provided valuable input to developing the Government’s
public finance management reform program. In the energy sector, the ERGG-3 complements the
ongoing dialogue and advisory assistance provided by the Bank to the authorities in the context of
support to the West Africa Power Pool.
Alignment with Good Practice Principles on Conditionality: The ERGG was aligned with the Bank’s
five Good Practice Principles on Conditionality.
(i) Reinforce Ownership: The ERGG-3 was fully aligned with the government’s reform program
    focusing on improving public expenditure management and strengthening governance and
    transparency in the phosphates, cotton and energy sectors. This broad program of reforms
    support the PRSP adopted in July 2009. The reform agenda was subsequently reinforced through
    a medium term reform strategy and action plan (2010) focusing specifically on public finance.
    The unit responsible for the ERGG-3 program within the Government is the MEF which has
    championed these reforms over the past years, including through the ERGG and ERGG-2. In
    order to reinforce ownership at the sector level, the MEF has coordinated the dialogue with
    working groups and task teams including other government agencies and relevant organizations
    (e.g., the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Mines and Energy).
(ii) Agree upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
     framework: The core of the program was developed during intensive policy dialogue with the
     authorities during 2009 and builds on the findings of key analytical work. The program has been
     closely coordinated with and supported by other multilateral development partners such as the
     IMF, AfDB, and the EU (especially in the areas on which these organizations have focused,
     notably public financial management) and with bilateral donors.
(iii) Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
      circumstances: The policy matrix was customized to the country circumstances.The focus was
      on governance, through a series of reform measures aimed at improving public financial
      management, and transparency and efficiency in critical sectors for the economy (namely, cotton,
      phosphates, and energy).
(iv) Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement: The policy
     matrix used a limited set of eleven prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the
     ERGG-3. Conditionality is focused only on key actions which are critical to the strengthening of


                                               16
      public financial management and reform in key economic sectors. The conditionality of the
      ERGG-3 is also coordinated with and is complementary to the Government reform program
      supported by the IMF ECF with a view to avoid any scope for cross-conditionality. For this
      reason, financial sector reform (a focus area in the previous ERGG) was no longer included as it
      is addressed by the ECF.
(v) Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
    financial support: The Bank carried out transparent progress reviews including through joint
    Bank-Fund missions and regular follow-up by staff conducive to predictable and performance-
    based financial support.

3.2   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The main objective of the ERGG-3 was to support government-owned reforms to improve public
financial management and restore performance in key sectors of the economy. Specifically, the
ERGG-3 focused on continuing and deepening policy reforms initiated by the Government under the
ERGG and ERGG-2 to strengthen budget preparation, execution, controls and public procurement.

 Budget Execution
 The execution rate of priority spending (health,        The execution rate for domestically-financed priority
 education, agriculture and infrastructure) reaches 85   expenditures, which is the most relevant measure of
 percent in 2010.                                        government performance, was 92.5 percent in 2010. The
                                                         execution rate for recurrent spending remained at about 100
                                                         percent in 2009 and 2010 while for investment spending it
                                                         increased from 35 percent to 72 percent. In addition, the
                                                         absolute value of the executed budget for priority sectors rose
                                                         from CFAF80 billion in 2009 to CFAF87 billion in 2010 for
                                                         operating expenses and from CFAF5 billion to CFAF27 billion
                                                         for domestically-financed investment spending (a 400 percent
                                                         increase). Foreign-financed investments also tripled (from
                                                         CFAF21 billion to CFAF64 billion), though the execution rate
                                                         remained at 48 percent due to the high (and probably
                                                         unrealistic) level of budgeted expenditures.

 Budget Controls
 10 internal control audits are conducted in 2010        IGF conducts 25 audits, significantly exceeding the target.

                                                       important to undertake such an assessment after one year of
                                                       full operations of the General Procurement Department.
 Cotton Sector
 NSCT reduces its processing costs (including the      NSCT reduced its processing costs (including overhead) by 39
 overhead) by 10 percent (CFAF 270/kg during the       percent to CFAF 181/kg during the 2010 fiscal year. This level
 2010-2011 crop season vs. 299 CFAF in 2008-2009.      of reduction may not be strictly comparable to the baseline, as
                                                       there is still an issue about ownership of assets and hence the
                                                       level of depreciation provision in the operating costs.
                                                       Moreover, the 2010 cost estimate does not include interest
                                                       payments as the debt incurred by the previous cotton company
                                                       SOTOCO was taken over by the Government. But even if
                                                       depreciation and interest payments had been taken into
                                                       account, the cost reduction would have exceeded the 10

                                                       public entities in the amount of US$ 22 million, largely
                                                       exceeding the outcome target.


3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Satisfactory.

The operation is rated satisfactory. The development objectives were highly relevant to country
circumstances and development priorities and reflect the Bank’s strategy as outlined in the ISN. The
Government continued implementation of the broader reform agenda under the ERGG-4. The
operations development objectives were substantially achieved. Four of the eight outcome targets
were largely exceeded. The only areas where results fell short of targets are procurement reform and
budget execution rates for priority ministries. In procurement reform, the Government chose to



                                                       18
recruit staff for the new General Procurement Department through a competitive process within the
civil service; which took longer than simply appointing staff from the civil service pool, but will
ultimately enhance the quality of the staffing of this department and of the procurement review
process as a whole. The budget execution for domestically-funded expenditures in priority ministries
reached 92.5 percent, surpassing the target of 85 percent. The execution rate for foreign-financed
capital expenditures remained low (47 percent), but this was due to extremely high targets for
planned expenditure which were probably unrealistic. Actual foreign-financed expenditures for
priority sectors rose from 21 billion CFAF in 2009 to 64 billion in 2010 (a 200 percent increase),
while total domestically-funded expenditures for these sectors increased from 85 billion CFAF in
2009 to 115 billion in 2010 (an increase of 35 percent).

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
to amplify discussion above):

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The grant financing provided by the operation and the improved fiscal management resulting from
the policy reforms will have a significant poverty impact by increasing the fiscal space for social
expenditures. Moreover, improving governance and transparency in the phosphate, electricity and
cotton sectors will also have an indirect poverty impact by reducing the previous drain on the budget
by these parastatals (or even generating dividends in the case of the phosphate company) and thus
increasing resources available for priority spending. Strengthened governance in the cotton sector,
will have a direct impact on the livelihoods of about 300,000 farmers in the poorest regions of Togo.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The operation greatly contributed to institutional strengthening in public finance management, and
significantly advanced the reform agenda in the phosphate, cotton, and energy sectors.

In public finance management, the measures supported by the operation led to the re-establishment of
rules and norms in public expenditure management and procurement. Staff for new agencies was
recruited (Court of Accounts and Procurement Department), other departments or agencies were
reorganized and strengthened, including through the recruitment of staff. In the key economic sectors
where reforms were supported by the operation, institutional strengthening took the form of audits,
increased oversight, better management structures, and broad stakeholder participation in the case of
the cotton company.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

There were no unintended outcomes and impacts.

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The reforms achieved under the operation are likely to be sustained over the medium term. The
positive impact on poverty reduction of some of the reforms could even help mitigate the underlying
socio-political risks which are outside the scope of this operation. The risks identified at appraisal are
outlined below, together with the mitigating measures and the actual outcome.

Political risk: The risk of stalling of reforms, due to political tensions in case the presidential
elections of March 2010 would not be considered fair and inclusive, did not materialize. The
elections went relatively smoothly and led to an inclusive Government. Later during the year 2010,
the main opposition party UFC under its historical leader joined the government of national unity.
For the first time in a long period, Togo now has a Government supported by the majority of the
population. This political constellation should increase the chances of successfully implementing the
reform agenda.

Macroeconomic risk: The possibility that the government would be unable to maintain a stable
medium-term framework was perceived as a risk, as was the vulnerability of the economy to external
shocks (commodity prices and slower than expected recovery from the global financial crisis). As a
mitigating measure, the agreed upon fiscal framework was closely monitored by the IMF and the
World Bank. As a result, the implementation of the fiscal program remained broadly on target during
2010. Budget support by several donors (IDA, AfDB and IMF ECF) provided overall positive
resource flows to Togo and helped maintain a stable medium-term framework. The IMF and the
World Bank will continue to closely monitor the Government’s macroeconomic performance.
Reaching the HIPC Completion Point in December 2010 contributed to reduce the risk of debt
distress – the DSA post-HIPC and MDRI indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress as
opposed to high risk. The impact of the global economic crisis was perceptible (growth rate below
potential), but contained. However, the country remains vulnerable to future commodity price shocks,
especially rising cereals and oil prices. The appreciation of the Euro (to which the CFAF is pegged)
against the dollar remains a concern for Togo’s phosphate and cotton exports which are quoted in
dollar terms.

The fiduciary risk stemmed from possible failure by the Government to make effective and efficient
use of fiscal space provided by budget support, and from the persistence of corruption. Fiduciary
standards, most importantly internal and external controls, were improved under the ERGG-3 and
technical assistance provided by the IMF and other donors further contributed to their strengthening.
In addition, the proceeds of the budget support were disbursed by IDA in a dedicated local currency
account, which can be audited on terms of reference acceptable to IDA The scope for corruption in
the phosphate sector was reduced through Togo’s adherence to the EITI initiative are expected to
curb mismanagement and corruption previously pervasive in this sector.

Implementation capacity risk: The lack of implementation capacity - arising from the lack of
sufficient professional staff in key ministries and from weak institutional capacity and coordination
after the 15 year of socio-political instability and suspended foreign assistance - was identified as a
risk to timely and satisfactory program implementation. As expected, the mitigation measures put in



                                                 20
place helped prevent this lack of capacity from causing major implementation delays. Funding under
the ongoing LICUS Trust Fund for Economic Recovery and International Reengagement provided
technical assistance to carry out assessments and formulate strategies in key reform areas (most
notably financial audits and strategic reviews of the phosphates, cotton, and energy sectors), whereas
the EU funded PEMFAR provided a thorough diagnostic for public financial management reforms
and benchmarks for their implementation. However, implementation capacity still remains a major
risk in Togo as evidenced by the low execution rate for externally financed investment in priority
ministries, presumably due to low procurement capacity and familiarity with donors’ procurement
processes. Bottlenecks need to be identified and efforts at improving capacity must be stepped up
significantly to reduce the implementation capacity risk for future operations.


5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1   Bank Performance

(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory.

A preparation mission took place in November 2009, allowing the team to achieve a thorough
understanding of the issues and sector specialists to identify problems and propose solutions in the
respective sectors. Project identification and appraisal was facilitated by the existence of solid
analytical ground work (PEMFAR, audits and studies in the phosphate, cotton and electricity sectors),
the alignment with priorities highlighted in the Bank’s 2008 ISN, Government’s own Poverty
Reduction Strategy and the strategic focus provided by continuity with previous budget support
operations. The Bank team worked closely with the Government teams and coordinated preparation
and appraisal of the operation with other donors (most notably the IMF and the EU). While the IMF
played a major role in assisting with the macroeconomic medium term framework and financial
sector reform, the Bank led the dialogue in the area of public financial management and governance
in the phosphate, cotton and energy sectors.

(b)   Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory.

Bank supervision performance is rated satisfactory. Supervision of progress made under this
operation took place in parallel to the preparation of the follow-up operation, the ERGG 4, during a
supervision mission in October 2010 and regular technical follow-up by Bank staff, facilitated by the
fact that many of the technical staff were based in Lomé or Cotonou. It should be mentioned however
that the multiple constraints upon the capacity of the rather thinly staffed country office did not allow
the degree of handholding which would be necessary given the low implementation capacity of
Togolese ministries.




                                                 21
(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

As Bank performance for both quality at entry and supervision is rated satisfactory, overall Bank
performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the ICRR harmonized evaluation criteria
guidelines.

5.2   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance: (see Overall Borrower Performance)

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: (see Overall Borrower Performance)

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

As shown in Section 2.1 (Program Performance) and Section 3.2 (Achievement of Program
Development Objectives), Government actions under the Program achieved the stated objectives.
Important progress was made towards improving public finance management and improving
transparency and efficiency in the key sectors (cotton, phosphates and energy) despite the difficult
circumstances in a fragile state and an unfavorable international environment. The implementation of
all prior actions demonstrated the Government’s ownership and commitment. The relationship and
coordination with the Bank and other donors were excellent and the authorities addressed
implementation issues on a timely basis. The important areas where results achieved fell below target
was the execution rate for priority spending and the slow effective start of contract review activities
by the General Procurement Department, but in other areas the targets were significantly exceeded.
Overall, the performance was satisfactory.

6.    Lessons Learned

This operation shows that significant progress can be achieved in a country emerging from a
prolonged crisis as long as the Government demonstrates strong commitment and the operation takes
a strategic approach focusing on the main problem areas. The specific lessons that can be learned
from this operation include:

     The fact that policy reforms in the prior actions were embedded in the Government’s own
      reform agenda and closely aligned with two major pillars of the full PRSP, led to strong
      ownership of the reforms. The PRSP is coupled with a Plan of Priority Actions (PAP) and
      complemented by a reform strategy presented in 2010 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
      which goes into even greater detail regarding the public finance management measures. This
      combination of clear commitment and detailed planning helped to ensure the implementation of
      the reforms supported by this operation.
     Given the generally limited capacity within the public sector in fragile countries such as Togo,
      it was important to be selective in the choice of policy and institutional reforms. Operations


                                                22
      that are simple in design and have fewer actions that have significant positive leverage effect
      are likely to be more effective than operations that attempt overly broad coverage. The ERGG-3
      followed this principle by continuing and deepening the reforms in public financial
      management and in the country’s critical sectors (phosphates, cotton, energy sectors) that were
      deemed critical for the overall governance reform program.
     Despite the stand-alone character of this operation, the strong Government commitment and the
      focus on continuity made it possible to consolidate reforms over several operations and to
      achieve sustainable results in the medium term, a feature normally found in programmatic
      approaches.
     It is important to carefully choose prior actions that are likely to open the door for other
      important policy and institutional reforms. For example, the adoption of a sound legislative
      framework, like the procurement law and associated code, was the basis for stepping up the
      effective implementation of the procurement reform under the ERGG-3.
     The effectiveness of Bank-supported development policy operations can be enhanced by its
      complementarities with other Bank-financed operation and the efforts of other active donors in
      the reform areas. ERGG-3 design and implementation design of this proposed operation reflects
      this lesson in the choice of prior actions, which are closely coordinated with policy reforms
      supported by other donors (IMF, AfDB, and EU) and through the Bank’s lending and non-
      lending portfolio.
