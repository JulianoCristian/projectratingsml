Lessons are suggested as follows. It\n            is important that the Government, the Implementing Agency\n            and the Bank share a common vision about the strategic\n            direction of the power sector. This vision was not\n            completely agreed upon at the outset, resulting in problems\n            down the road. On a related issue, it is clear that Ethiopia\n            is blessed with a low-cost, competitive hydro potential\n            which can be harnessed to benefit the country, and the\n            region as a whole. However, the scale of those projects\n            represents a substantial financial commitment, and entails\n            several types of risks (e.g. geological, market) for the\n            incumbent utility, which may end up weakening the overall\n            sustainability of the power sector. Therefore, the current\n            business model of having solely the local utility as the\n            implementing agency may not provide the necessary hydro\n            capacity to meet Ethiopia and regional needs. A second\n            lesson indicates that continuity in task supervision is a\n            very important factor in assuring a good project\n            performance. In line with this, timely completion of a\n            Mid-Term-Review could have helped facilitate the transition,\n            highlighting problematic areas and issues that needed urgent\n            management attention, both to the task team and to the\n            implementing agencies. In addition, Project Appraisal\n            Documents (PADs) should be designed to allow a more complete\n            discussion of the risk of the impact of unforeseen events,\n            which can delay project implementation, and result in cost\n            overruns that adversely affect anticipated economic and\n            financial results. Finally, the potential for introducing\n            agricultural residue-based charcoal to supplement or\n            displace the wood charcoal, presently supplied and consumed\n            in urban areas is significant, but such investment would be\n            financially viable only at large-scale operations."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
