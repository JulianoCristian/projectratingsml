Project are a) to increase the efficiency and sustainability\n            of Ethiopia's power sector, and to increase electricity\n            use for economic growth and improved quality of life; and b)\n            to improve utilization efficiency of rural renewable energy.\n            The project comprises the following components: 1)\n            decentralization of the electric power corporation's\n            (EEPCO) accounting system; 2) decentralization of part of\n            EEPCO's billing system as a pilot, which requires\n            branch office renovation, computer, software, and accessory\n            installation, as well as other training and consulting\n            services; 3) manpower development to support EEPCO's\n            restructuring to give more control to regional management;\n            4) construction of the Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric plant to\n            increase generation capacity; 5) establishment of a dam\n            safety, maintenance management system, and optimization of\n            water use; 6) strengthening rural energy capability by\n            adapting technology and training research personnel overseas\n            in various energy fields; 7) completion of the Woody Biomass\n            inventory data collection and remote sensing survey\n            indicating the extent and productivity of grazing lands and\n            undertaking a livestock carrying capacity analysis; 8)\n            studies including sector restructuring study, a generation\n            expansion study, a tariff study, and a valuation of fixed\n            assets; and 9) assistance with converting the state-owned\n            utility (EEPCO) into a commercial operation, as well as\n            other restructuring measures."}, "docdt": "1997-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
