1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the environmental assessment (EA) is to predict the negative impacts that
are likely to occur as a result of preparing, constructing and operating the Gilgel Gibe
Hydroelectric Project (GGHP). The assessment also identifies mitigative measures required to
avoid, reduce or compensate the identified negative impacts. This EA defines environment broadly
to include human social aspects as well as the biophysical effects.
Since certain construction activities have already taken place at GGHP, during the
assessment, the environmental conditions of the existing works were evaluated. The scope of the
EA also includes preparing an environmental management plan. A comprehensive resettlement plan
has been prepared as a separate document and a summary of the main points of the plan is included
in this report.
1.2 Background
Ethiopia has an abundance of rivers which provide the country with the potential for large
sustainable energy resources in the form of hydropower. Recent power planning studies have
estimated that Ethiopia's hydroelectric potential is in the order of 30,000 MW, a potential greatly
in excess of foreseeable domestic demand. Currently only about one per cent of the available total
is being harnessed for generating hydroelectric power. Preliminary investigations have indicated
that the most promising sites could be developed at lower costs than other power generation
options.
Ethiopia's 10 year perspective plan for the period 1984 to 1993 recognized the importance
of low cost energy as an incentive to industrial and economic development. At the same time, the
plan realized that export sales could provide an attractive long term development opportunity.
Neighboring countries are poorly endowed with water resources that can be converted to
inexpensive energy and they face the continuing prospect of increasing oil imports in order to meet
their own domestic demand.
The Gilgel Gibe project is one of the most attractive potential hydroelectric developments in
the country. The first studies of a hydroelectric plant on the Gilgel Gibe River were initiated in
1963 by the Yugoslav Electroproject Company. Subsequently, a Chinese technical mission and the
Electric Power Development Corporation of Japan were also involved in the project (1974). In
1981 another investigation was conducted by a team of experts from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea which proposed a 94 MW hydroelectric project on the Gilgel Gibe River at the
proposed site.
A Power Planning Study carried out by ACRES International Ltd. of Canada in 1982
reviewed the Korean scheme, and in 1984 ENEL (Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica, Italy)
prepared a feasibility report for the Gilgel Gibe project, taking into account the conclusions of the
I



ACRES study. At that time, a scheme with one single plant was foreseen, with 285 MW installed
capacity. The main structures of that particular scheme included:
* a 40 m high rockfill dam with asphalt concrete facing, creating a reservoir with a 860 million
3
* a power tunnel 9.1 km long and 6.6 m in diameter along the left bank of the river, with terminal
surge shaft and penstocks;
* a powerhouse equipped with six 50 MW Francis units; net design head of about 205 m and an
average energy production of 851 Gwh/y;
At a 1984 unit price level, the scheme was estimated to cost about $US 305 million over a
construction period of approximately six years.
Following the submission of the 1984 ENEL feasibility report, further studies were
developed, and initial activities for constructing the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project were started
in 1988 through a cooperation established between the Government of Ethiopia and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Further assistance for project implementation was
obtained from the governments of Italy and Austria.
Due to difficulties and delays experienced during the initial construction works; a lower
power demand than originally expected; and the country's financial capacity; the initial single plant
scheme was abandoned for a two plant arrangement with an upstream and a downstream plant.
The upstream plant was to have the following features:
* a 38 m high rockfill dam with asphalt concrete facing, creating a reservoir with 717 million m'
live storage (essentially equal to the original ENEL solution);
* a power tunnel 3.4 km long, developing along the left bank of the river, with a terminal surge
shaft and two outdoor penstocks;
* an outdoor powerhouse equipped with two 45 MW Francis units, with a net design head of
about 98 m and designed to yield average energy production of 402 GWH/y.
The downstream plant was to be characterized by the following works:
*  a diversion weir located about one km downstream of the powerhouse of the upstream plant
and creating a daily compensating pondage with 240,000m3 of live storage;
* power waterways developed along the right bank of the river, partially as a cut-and-cover
pressure conduit and partially in tunnel with terminal surge shaft and two outdoor penstocks;
* an outdoor powerhouse equipped with two Francis units with a net design head of about 98m,
and an average energy production of 388 GWH/y.
The cost of the upstream plant was estimated (1994 unit price level) at approximately $US
106 million. Under the initial agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, the upstream plant was expected to come on line in 1993. No definite
schedule was established for the downstream plant.
2



Due to the very limited progress achieved in construction, Ethiopia decided to interrupt the
co-operation agreement with the Koreans in 1994, and to revert to a typical western project
management and tendering practice to assure the completion of the project.
The ENEL/Elc consortium was retained as the engineering consultant for the project in June
1995 and was given the responsibility to upgrade and complete the design, based on the selected
two plants. They were also responsible for detailed design, construction supervision and the
commissioning of both plants.
Final design resulted in a design based on a single power plant without the downstream weir.
* . a 40 m rockfill dam with bituminous upstream facing with a crest elevation of 1,675m a.s.l.
* . a 8.9 km concrete lined, underground power tunnel with surge shaft
* . a single underground powerhouse
*  . Three, 67 MW vertical Francis turbines and synchronous generators
* . a 530 m tailrace tunnel.
1.3 Policy and Legal Framework
Electrical power in Ethiopia is administered by the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power
Authority (EELPA) which is an executing agency of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MIME) of
the Government of Ethiopia (GOE). EELPA is responsible for the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity throughout the country.
Concern for. environmental degradation in Ethiopia has been growing in recent years. The
Ethiopian Federal Democratic Republic Constitution provides the basic and comprehensive
principles and guidelines for environmental protection and management. The Constitution states
that everyone has the right to live in a clean and healthy environment and the Government will
make every effort to provide such an environment. The constitution holds the Government and the
people of Ethiopia responsible for the preservation of natural resources and maintenance of
ecological balances. A number of proclamations and supporting regulations reflect the principles of
the Constitution and the most relevant of these are described briefly in the following.
The penal code and civil code of 1957 and 1960, respectively, contain provisions that hold
individuals liable for various actions causing environmental damage. Further proclamations issued
in 1965 were aimed at the protection, conservation, creation, maintenance and development of
forests. This was the first concerted and directed effort towards the sustainable management of
forests and the proclamations were intended to ensure land fertility and stabilized soil conditions
for present and succeeding generations. These proclamations were subsequently succeeded by
proclamations providing for the conservation and development of forests and wildlife and to
regulate forest conservation, development and utilization. At about the same time, proclamations
were introduced to empower the Ministry of Agriculture to issue regulations and directives
concerning the tenure, distribution, utilization and administration of land. These regulations were
intended for the fair distribution and proper utilization of land to ensure its protection.
3



Throughout the 1970s and 1980s a number of proclamations were made that contain
provisions for the protection and management of the environment as this relates to water
resources.
Later in 1984 a proclamation provided the National Committee for central planning the
mandate to formulate policies and issues regarding environmental concerns. In 1987 a
proclamation created the Ethiopian Valley Development Authority and provided it with the
mandate to initiate policy and the means for planning and implementation for purposes of
environmental management.
In 1995 The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) was made responsible for the
protection of the environment and was given the mandate to prepare environmental protection
policy and laws. It is also charged with the responsibility of preparing directives and systems
necessary for the evaluation of environmental impacts of development projects. The authority is
also responsible for the preparation of standards to be used for the protection of soil, water, air and
biological systems. The authority is still in it's infancy and is building both staff and capacity in
order to carry out it's mandate.
Prior to the approval of a development loan for a project such as the Gilgel Gibe Project, the
World Bank and other potential donors require that a comprehensive environmental assessment be
conducted. World Bank outlines the EA requirements in Operational Directive 4.01, Environmental
Assessment. The Government of Ethiopia agreed to follow OD 4.01 as the EA standard for
GGHP.
2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1 Project Location
The Project is located in the Kefa province about 260 km south-west of Addis Ababa and
about 70 km north-east of Jimma (7O50N, 37020' E). The project area is shown in Fig. 1.
The area is a fairly flat plateau about 1,650 m a.s.l. and consists of a series of gentle sloping
low hills and broad plains surrounded by hills or mountains. The Gilgel Gibe (Little Gibe) River,
which flows through Kefa province from south-west to north-east, is a tributary of the Great Gibe
River (known as the Omo River further downstream) and is extremely variable in course and
gradient.
In the proposed reservoir area, the stretch of river between Asendabo and the Deneba
waterfall has a winding and relatively flat course. The right bank is more or less flat with some
small hills, while the left bank is steeper. The terrain is suitable for the construction of a reservoir
with a capacity sufficient to regulate most of the river flows and ensuring that unusable spills are
kept to a minimum. The river banks near the Deneba waterfalls become steeper and this section of
the valley is suitable for the construction of water retaining structures. A dam of limited height is
sufficient to obtain a reservoir with the required storage capacity.
4



Downstream of the 20 m high Deneba waterfall, which is immediately downstream of the
dam site, the river narrows and the gradient increases to about 1.4-1.5 per cent. The river in this
area is straight and swiftly flowing interspersed with some meandering slower flow sections. Within
a few kilometers below the waterfall, the river drops considerably in elevation, which in
conjunction with the drop at Deneba Falls, represents the sizable hydroelectric potential of the
project.
Highway #7 is located within a few kilometers of the right bank of the Gilgel Gibe River and
links Addis Ababa to Jimma. The project site can be reached from Addis Ababa via Highway #7 in
approximately five hours, a fact that should facilitate the construction program of the project.
Approximately 15 km of this road will be inundated at full service level of the reservoir and will
need to be re-routed. The road is scheduled for upgrading in the near future and the replacement
segment will be constructed at that time.
2.2 General Project Description
The final scheme selected, based on the feasibility study and the various studies carried out
in the past, includes a single power plant design. The scheme consists of a rockfill dam with asphalt
concrete facing; a power tunnel along the left bank of the river, including a terminal surge shaft and
an underground penstock; and, an underground powerhouse equipped with three power units. The
main technical and physical features are provided in Table 2.1.

Diversion Works
Almost all of the trench excavation works for the 232.5 m diversion tunnel have been
completed. The first and second phases of concrete works have been started. Along the left bank of
the Gilgel Gibe River an embankment has been constructed in order to protect the excavation
works. It is estimated that about 70,000 m3 of material have been excavated and approximately
2,000 m3 of concrete poured.
Access Roads
Most of the internal site roads required for the construction of the plant, including a 40 ton
ton capacity Bailey bridge across the Gilgel Gibe River for access to the work site and linking the
site installations and three quarry areas have already been built. These roads are unpaved but are in
good condition.
Power Waterways
The outdoor excavations for the power intake have essentially been completed. The general
outdoor excavations at the outlet portal of the power tunnel have also been completed. A general
stripping and the common excavation has been carried out along the alignment of the outdoor
7



penstocks, reaching bedrock level. Short stretches of the power tunnel at the inlet and outlet portals
have been excavated and some of the required steel supports have been put into place. An
intermediate inclined construction adit has been excavated, reaching the tunnel alignment some
1,400 m from the inlet portal.
The outdoor excavations are generally in good condition and the excavation slopes appear
to be stable. Part of the excavated material at the downstream portal has been dumped on the slope
leading down to the river and this will have to be removed.
Powerhouse
The powerhouse platform has been partially excavated down to bedrock. Some of the
excavated material has been dumped into the river and will have to be removed.
Transmission Line
A 230 kV transmission line has been constructed between the powerhouse site and Addis
Ababa but it is not operational. Some towers near the powerhouse site have been damaged and
others (#15 and #16) have fallen down. Local people have removed some of the members which has
weakened the structures. The Gilgel Gibe substation, located close to Highway #7, has been
completed and is operational. Two 15 kV lines from the substation are currently supplying power to
the construction camp. EELPA has completed a reconnaissance of this line and found illegal
encroachment of dwellings. The survey found 280 grass roofed cottages and 87 corrugated metal
roofed houses in a total of 96 spans. EELPA will relocate these squatters according to Ethiopian
Law and consistent with World Bank resettlement policies before the line can be energized.
2.4 Camps and Construction Facilities
2.4.1 Camps
A number of camp facilities are currently in place in the permanent village located 15 km
from the dam site. The main camp is situated at the dam site.The ECAFCO village is a housing
complex for contractors during construction and will be used by EELPA staff during the operation
of the plant. The village is designed to accommodate 488 people. The village contains duplex
blocks of accommodation housing, a canteen, a guest house, and houses for EELPA and
consultants. Each house is completely furnished and the complex is supplied with 15 kV service.
The temporary main construction camp near the dam site is fully furnished and is serviced
with a water supply, sewerage system, 15 kV electrical service and internal service roads. Housing
includes 155 blocks suitable for accommodating 860 workers. Three caravan guest houses are also
in place.
Offices and warehouses are also in place and these include administration, technical,
construction, geology and design offices; laboratories, workshops and a clinic; and, warehouses,
vehicle shades, fuel stations and a garage.
8



2.4.2 Construction Facilities
A basalt quarry site is situated about 3 km from the dam and can be accessed by the service
road from the power house area as well as from the dam site. A crushing and batching plant was
installed on site prior to 1990 and was in operation for a short time for the production of concrete
for the diversion tunnel. From the existing 130/15 kV substation, a 15 kV power supply system
provides power to the camps and the site installations.
2.5   Analysis of Alternatives
Aside from demand management options, the alternatives to be considered would be
fundamentally to choose to proceed with the GGHP or to abandon the works to select another
power generation option. EELPA has completed demand side management studies and have
instituted tariff increases as a result of those studies. The demand forecasts still call for a significant
increase in generation capabilities to maintain economic growth and development.
The high costs of importing fossil fuels to land-locked Ethiopia preclude thermal power
options that would depend on foreign fuels. Currently, fossil fuel resources in Ethiopia have not
been developed or proven to the extent that a thermal station would be feasible. Studies have
shown that the potential for relatively low cost hydropower is the least cost option for Ethiopia at
this time.
Nearly US$ 90 million have been invested in the GGHP thus far which would be lost if
another hydropower project were to be substituted for GGHP. In addition, any new hydropower
site would be a "greenfields" site. In terms of environmental preference, it is clearly preferable to
continue with construction at GGHP rather than substitute a new and undeveloped site. Other sites
are being evaluated, not as a substitute for GGHP, but for future power generation.
Wind and solar power generation potential is good in Ethiopia, but costs for these systems
are not competitve for contributions to the national grid.
3. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Impact Assessment Responsibility
The ENEL/ELC Consortium was charged with the responsibility of preparing the EA and to
predict the likely environmental consequences of implementing project activities. World Bank
guidelines for preparing environmental assessments were followed (Operational Directive 4.01).
The EA has also been based on the previous environmental studies including the Gilgel Gibe
Hydroelectric Scheme - Feasibility Study (January 1994) and on the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric
Project - Public and Environmental Health Implications (UNDPH/WHO, April 1986.
9



3.2 Assessment Team
A team consisting of the consulting consortium, members of EELPA, and seconded
individuals from various relevant government ministries and agencies were assembled and given the
responsibility for conducting the EA and preparing the draft and final reports. The team was
comprised of the following members.
Mr. Guido Chiesa (Civil Engineer, ENEL)
Mvr. Romeo Cironi (Biologist, ENEL)
Mr. Maurizio Perotti (Agronomist, ENEL)
Mr. Sergio D'Offizi (Geologist, ENEL)
Mr. Georgio Galeati (Hydraulic Engineer, ENEL)
Mr. Alberto Bonafe (Hydraulic Engineer, ENEL)
Mr. Guiseppe Stevanella (Civil Engineer, Elc)
Mr. Paulo Pallavicini (Civil Engineer, Studio Pietrangeli)
Mr. Abdulhakim Mohamed (Project Manager)
Mr. Teferra Reyene (Civil Engineer, EELPA)
Mr. Kidane Gizaw (Sanitation Engineer, EELPA)
Mr. Degefu Abebe (Health Officer)
Dr. Aynalen Abebe (Environmentalist)
Mr. Arefeayne Zekariau (Agronomist)
Mr. Fetene Hailu (Biologist)
Mr. Petros Germew (Lawyer)
Mr. Temesgen Gebru (Environmental Health Expert)
Mr. Feleke Afework (Civil Engineer)
The activities performed in the Gilgel Gibe area were assisted by the acting site manager,
Mr. Dagnew Zeleke. Mr. John Ambrose assisted the GGHP team in drafting and editing the draft
EA report.
3.3 Sources of Information
The team conducted a preliminary literature review in Ethiopia. The team made numerous
visits to the project area. During the visits the team relied on direct observations, interviews,
questionnaires, surveys and measurements in the project area at selected localities. They conducted
interviews with knowledgeable people, NGOs (notably the peasant associations from each kebele),
health officials and natural resources specialists working in the relevant fields. The team also
reviewed articles from international scientific journals and official data and reports.
3.4 Bounding and Scoping
The bounds of the EA follow the general project area as indicated in Figure 1. In addition,
the assessment considers the effects that the project might have further downstream as far as the
point where the Omo River enters Lake Turkana. Given the reduction in flow to the Omo River as
a result of project implementation is so small, it was not necessary to pursue consideration of the
10



Lake Turkana ecosystem which is already changing rapidly. To a lesser extent, consideration was
given to some upsteam areas, most notably, the proposed resettlement area.
Scoping has included the most important and major environmental components, in
particular, water quantity and quality of the Gilgel Gibe River, riverine vegetation and other
vegetation that might be affected by construction activities, terrestrial and aquatic fauna, aquatic
ecosystems, the people of the area, particularly those who will have to be involuntarily resettled,
and the health aspects of the project.
3.5 Baseline Information
3.5.1 Physical and Natural Environment
Climate
The study of the rainfall distribution over a year was based on data from the stations of
Abelti, Asendabo, Jimma and Sekoru using the Thiessen method, which assumes that the total
amount of rainfall in any station can be applied half-way to the next station, in any direction. At the
suggestion of the Ethiopian Mapping Authority, the monthly data was grouped into three seasons:
* .the transitional period of February-May, known as the Belg rain
3  .the rainiest period between June and September, known as the Kiremt rain period
* .the dry period of October-January
Water quality
Water sampling was conducted on the Gilgel Gibe River in May 1982 and in October 1995.
Samples were taken at a depth of about 20 cm under the surface. A selected number of chemical
and bacteriological tests were conducted on the water which will feed the reservoir. Chemical,
physical and bacteriological parameters were measured and these included temperature, pH,
conductivity, oxygen content, turbidity, faecal and total coliform bacteria. Some of the 1995
samples were sent to the ENEL Central Laboratory in Piacenza, Italy for additional tests. The 1982
the measurements and samples were taken several times on two successive days along the section
of the river between the future dam site and the Deneba Falls.
As well, samples were taken during three consecutive days at two different points along the
Gilgel Gibe River and at one point on the Chilelo River, a tributary entering the right side of the
Gilgel Gibe River approximately one kilometer below the dam site.
The pipette method (Walton 1978) was used to evaluate the grain size of the particles
suspended in the Gilgel Gibe water sample taken on two periods.
Vegetation
A phytosociological survey was conducted on the vegetation in the future reservoir site. This
survey was directed at analysis of the plant associations and communities rather than a species
11



inventory and checklists. Information gained will be useful for future restoration programs that will
occur in the proposed buffer area adjacent to the reservoir. Some plants were identified in situ. In
other cases samples were classified with the help of the Tropical Herbarium in Florence.
Silvicultural methods of calculating the number of trees per hectare (Loetsch and Haller, 1973) and
the corresponding amount of ground covered (Prodan, 1968) were applied.
Fauna
The local fish population was investigated by direct sampling on the site. Samples were
taken by trawl-net, fyke-net and dragnet near the dam site, in 1982 and by trawl net in three station
along the river in 1995. The results of this survey are shown in detail in Table. A.5 (Appendix).
Species caught were studied for quantity and total weight. Sub samples of each species were sexed
and examined for weight and length.
The qualitative census of the local terrestrial fauna was carried out through an inquiry
amongst the local population of Koticha Kesi, Inkure and Bore kebele. Species identified through
this approach are listed in Table A.6. This survey was supplemented by surveys conducted by
personnel in the Department of Wildlife in the Ministry of Agriculture which verified local reports,
but did not add further information.
3.5.2 Socioeconomic Studies
Population and general socioeconomic profile
The data collection to study the human environment within the project area, has been
conducted in 1994 by a task groups, each composed by members of the Gilgel-Gibe Project Office
and relevant Regional Government Office. The survey was carried out by assessing the composition
of the population broken down into the different kebeles (villages) in each wereda (administration
unit).
The collection of the data by each task group is based on:
* registration documents proposed by the project since 1977
* region demarcation cornerstone (bench marks) made during 1977
* 1:500.000 scale region boundary map.
Registration of affected populations, inventory of their fixed permanent properties and
collection of documents has been conducted by several task groups, each composed of
representation from the following:
* project field office
* administration office from each wereda
* Agricultural Bureau of each wereda
* Natural Resources and Coffee and Tea Bureau from each wereda
* kebele farmer associations
12



Land
During registry, data regarding land area was collected using the local unit of measure
(Fechasa) and later converted to hectares by the Ministry of Agriculture.Assistance was provided
to the farmers by the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure the recording of accurate information, and
that property values and compensation could be accurately determined.
3.6 Public Participation
Throughout the process of the assessment, meetings were held with a number of agencies,
including the area health clinics, and with members of affected households.
The people in the project area have been aware of an impending move since construction
started in 1986. Social surveys conducted at that time no longer had validity, so a new survey with
more participation was carried out. A comprehensive public participation program was carried out
during the preparation of the resettlement plan, which is a subcomponent of the EA. The people to
be resettled have been continually represented by their respective Kebele farmer associations
throughout the planning process. The farmer associations are NGOs which best represent the
affected populations. Initially, during registration of all families and properties, people were
informed that they would be required to move as a result of the project. Through a series of
meetings with each of the 18 Kebele farmer associations, local people were able to express their
opinions on a number of concerns including area to be resettled, forms of compensation, structures
and facilities required, and administration of the compensation program. Initially four unoccupied
candidate areas for resettlement were identified by a technical committee. After detailed evaluation,
the committee rejected two areas because of prior rinderpest infestations in those areas and
rejected a third area because of a greater distance from the project area. The selected area was
presented to the affected people through their farmer association representatives. The
Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) was invited to evaluate the site and one staff member
did an environmental reconnaissance.There was consensus among the affected people that the area
selected was the most suitable location for resettlement. The associations indicated a number of
concerns, including the fertility of the new site, suitability for grazing and receptivity of the host
community. The host society was given the opportunity to provide input regarding the acceptability
of the settlers to the area. The host community indicated that they would accept the newcomers
willingly. Members of the affected population, including women and young people, visited the
proposed site and held meetings with the host communities. Given the ethnic, cultural and religious
similarities of the two populations, neither group felt that there would be serious constraints to
acceptance of relocation.
3.7 Assessment
The characteristics of the foreseeable impact have been based on the following:
* the nature of the actions which are potential sources of impact and which have been taken from
the " The Feasibility Study of the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Scheme";
* basic environmental data derived from research carried out on the field;
13



* surveys and censuses carried out among the population and service structures present in the
area;
* information gathered from scientific publications available and inforrmation from similar
hydroelectric projects;
A matrix was constructed from these four elements (Figures 8,9 &10) which relates project
activities to the environmental components which these activities may affect (both positive and
negative). The activities, as well as the social-environmental components, have been divided into
actions with the aim of emphasising the mechanisms and times during which the impacts occur on
particular aspects of the different components while the project is being carried out and these are
provided in the Figures. The Figures also indicates relative values that have been determined for
each of the potential impacts.
Sources of impact - general
The sources of impact (actions) are defined as anything which directly or indirectly interacts
appreciably with the environmental context affected by the project. These include the three main
project phases of construction, preparation and operation.
Source of impact - during construction
Figures 8-10 shows the potential environmental effects corresponding to the various actions
foreseen while carrying out the construction works, together with an indication of the importance
of these effects and the measures to be taken in order to avoid, reduce or compensate them.
The building activity, which is forecast for a three year period, will initially be limited to the
project area. The main enviromental effects will be associated with excavation and earth dumping
activities, the construction of large structures and the increase in heavy traffic.
Sources of impact - preparation and filling of the reservoir
The reservoir preparation activity may be divided into three main actions: occupation of the
area, clearing of woody vegetation, and filling the reservoir.
Sources of Impact - during operation
The operating activity can be divided into two main actions: reservoir operation and
operation of the power stations which are interlinked.
Once the reservoir has been filled, the level of the reservoir will change throughout the year,
with a maximum at the end of the rainy season and minimum at the end of the dry season, owing to
the flow of water for electricity production. The difference in the normal operating reservoir level
(18 m) will create an exposed drawdown area of approximately 27 km2. The full service level is at
14



1671 m a.s.l. and the minimum operating level is 1653 m a.s.l. instead of the listed 1651 m a.s.l. for
the absolute minimum level.
4. DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Physical Environment
4.1.1 Geology
The Gilgel Gibe project area is situated on the southwestern Ethiopian plateau. The area is
characterized by a series of basic and subsilicic effusive volcanic rocks, frequently inter-layered with
reddish paleosols of Tertiary age. The rocks of the area are tentatively ordered as following,
beginning with the youngest rocks:
Trachytic tuff,
Vesicular basalt,
Aphyric augite basalt,
Welded tuff (Rhyolitic ignimbrite),
Augite basalt,
Augite trachyte,
Augite basalt.
In some locations, particularly in the area of the upper reservoir, these rocks are covered
with fluvio-lacustrine sediments.
The entire volcanic sequence is frequently blanketed by thin, residual, subtropical lateritic
soils, which have been formed on hill and ridge foot slopes. As well, they are covered with thick,
black, plastic clay deposits on the flatter areas and valley. The hills on the right side of the Gilgel
Gibe River, downstream of the waterfalls, are mostly covered to an elevation of about 1,800 m
a.s.l. by thick colluvium deposits together with deeply weathered landslide and/or rockslide
material.
The basic and sub-silicic volcanic rocks indicated above are of the Ashangi and Magdala
Volcanic Group, and are considered the same as the Omo basalt (Miocene-Oligocene Age) and
Jimma volcanites. In places these are overlain by younger rhyolite and rhyolitic tuff flows of
Pliocene Age, and are commonly known as Mt. Veca volcanites.
The volcanic layers of the project area generally dip a few degrees in a southwesterly
direction and are crossed by minor north-east to south-west and north-west to south-east fractures
and faults. The former of these are related to the main tectonic alignments of the region, the
Ethiopian Rift. They trend roughly north-east to south-west and are located south-east of the site
at a distance of about 140 km (measured from the middle of the rift system). The latter of these
fractures and faults could be related to the Bonga fault (or "Gilgel Gibe" fault).The most important
fault of the project area is the Ayno fault, and it probably runs along the Ayno stream in close
proximity to adit 1.
15



4.1.2 Seismology
Most of the epicenters of observed earthquakes in Ethiopia are related to major rift
structures. The dam site is at least 96 km from the most active seismic centers and any earthquakes
originating at these centers would be considerably attenuated at the dam site. Current seismic data
available is preliminary in nature, and as such, the value of the horizontal ground acceleration to be
considered will necessarily have to be greater than 0.1 g. Since there is a high possibility of relevant
earthquakes to be released along the nearest border to the site of the Ethiopia rift active tectonic
structure, or one of the faults to it, the adoption of a design earthquake of 0. Ig and a maximum
credible earthquake of 0.2 g has been considered in dam design.
4.1.3 Hydrology
Only five sets of annual data (1967-1971) from the Deneba hydrometric station which is
located near the dam site are available. The data are insufficient for providing an indication of long-
term average river flow. These data have been supplemented with the 26 years (1967-1992) of data
from the Asendabo station upstream of the dam site. The mean annual discharge for the period
between 1967 and 1992 is 36.8 and 50.4 m3/s for Asendabo and Deneba respectively. The
discharge at Deneba corresponds to an annual runoff of 1,578 million m3 and a total rainfall volume
over the corresponding catchment area of 6,485 million rn3. Hydrological data for Deneba station is
provided in Table 4.1.
Additional runoff reaches the river between the dam site and the powerhouse site including
the Chilelo Tributary. However, while the tributary basin of the upper dam site is 4,225 kM2, the
intermediate catchment is only approximately 130 km2 which is less than three per cent of the
upper reservoir catchment. The contribution of this intermediate catchment is, however, important
in regards to the biological impacts on this stretch of the Gilgel Gibe River.
Due to the limited historical flood series at Deneba station, an estimate of flood flows with
return periods exceeding 100-200 years would be very unreliable. Parameters of the most common
probability distributions (Gumbel, GEV, Pearson III etc.) should be determined on the basis of the
local data only. A "regional" approach to the analysis was used, based on the concept of
hydrological homogeneity of different sites in a particular geographical area. This concept assumes
that the probability distribution of hydrological events in a hydrologically homogeneous area is the
same, in spite of the scaling factor. In this case it is assumed that the Deneba and Asendabo sites are
similar since both are situated along the main course of the Gilgel Gibe River and have comparable
catchment areas (4,225 km2 and 2,929 kM2). At the proposed dam site the flows with return periods
of 100 years or more, relevant to the design of the spillway, are provided in Table 4.1.

4.1.4 Water Quality
Table 4.3 shows the results of the analyses carried out in the two periods of sampling.
Quantities are expressed in meq/l (milligram equivalent per litre) and mg/l, together with values
registered in four regional rivers, expressed in mg/l.
The low level of orthophosphates and trace metals indicate that there is little influence on
water quality by humans, either in terms of agricultural practices or industrial development. Low
total nitrogen content is typical of natural situations or those only slightly altered by low organic
inputs.
Salinity is only slightly higher than that of the Zambesi River above the Kariba dam (33.18
mg/I) (Balon and Coche 1974) and almost identical to that recorded below the dam (46.6 mg/l)
(Coche 1968). The salinity levels are lower than the salinity registered in many rivers in Ethiopia at
similar elevations.

Considering low salinity levels on the usual mnineral water scale (Gualtierotti 1978), the
Gilgel Gibe River water may be classified as earthy-brackish, alkaline, and with bicarbonate. Due
to its high concentration of suspended matter and bacteria, especially faecal coliform type, the water
comes into the EEC A2 category of surface water requiring treatment to render it potable for
human populations.
Table A. I (Appendix) gives the results of analyses carried out in 1995 at two points on the
Gilgel Gibe River and the Chilelo tributary. If the values of the parameters measured at the
beginning (close to the Deneba waterfalls) and end (at the bridge over the Gilgel Gibe near
Asendabo) of the section affected by the future reservoir are compared, then the quality of the
water in this section remains substantially the same. Statistical analysis indicates that the values
recorded are significantly the same. Evidently the tributaries of the Gilgel Gibe River between
Asendabo and the Deneba waterfall do not cause quality changes in this section due to their meagre
flow rates and similar water quality. The characteristics of the Chilelo River water are similar to
those of the Gilgel Gibe River in terms of concentrations of the major nutrients. However,
statistically significant differences occur for temperature, suspended solids, total solids and
alkalinity which are on average lower, and the dissolved oxygen and concentration of faecal
coliform which are higher in the Chilelo River than the Gilgel Gibe River. The chemical-physical
differences found can be attributed to the different flow rates of the two rivers. Whereas the Gilgel
Gibe River may be considered a slow river, the Chilelo River has typical torrent morphology. The
higher presence of faecal coliform is due to the larger number of livestock in a smaller catchment.
The dissolved inorganic content of the total suspended solids is only about 65 mg/I in 1982
and 52 mg/l in 1995. In contrast the suspended solid content revealed by filtration through a 0.2
micron Millipore filter is high but quite similar between the two sampling years: 177-255 mg/I on
1982 and 139-179 mg/I in 1995. On average it is 200 mg/A in a flow of 25 cumecs in 1982 and 155
mg/l in 1995 in a flow of 18 cumecs.
The difference in weight between the different sample years indicates a slight difference in
flow conditions at the times of sampling. The results of these laboratory test are shown in the grain
size analysis table (Table A. 2). The analysis shows the particles to be about 50% silt and clay, the
18



remaining matter consisting of soluble organic matter (humic acids or other colloidal substances) or
colloidal particles measuring less than 10 4 mm.
Table A.3 (Appendix) shows partial and cumulative per cent per particle class as well as
average sedimentation speeds of quartz spheres of equivalent average diameter in still water at
20°C (Walton 1978).
4.1.5 Soils
The soils of Kefa Province are Alfisol-type which are relatively fertile soils that have been
formed in humid areas under deciduous forest cover. Soil color varies from red and brown through
to grey and black. Textures range from clay to lime-clay or sandy clay. The pH is generally acid
(E. Westphal 1974 and R. Schnell 1971). Soils at the project site are black in the valley bottom
(about 1,650 m a.s.l.), grey brown in the hilly strip (1,660-1,760 m a.s.l.) and red at higher levels
and elevations. Chemical and physical analysis of three representative soil samples are given in
Table 4.5 (Appendix).
Table 4.5: Soil Properties
.valley bottom      5.3   sandy clay loam  8.04        0.32        39.7 meq/lOOg
.medium altitude hill
soil              5.9   sandy clay loam    4.6         0.2         30.0 meq/lOOg

The organic and total nitrogen contents of the valley bottom soils are typical of permanent
meadow land. The middle and high altitude soils are less rich in nutrient elements due to the fact
that they have been exploited by man and have been subjected to weathering and erosion. The pH
factors, organic and nitrogen contents correspond to data collected on the soils between Jimma and
Bonga and reported by Dawit Deguefu (1969) and Murphy (1959, 1968).
4.1.6 Climate
Ethiopia has a two-season tropical climate. The dry winter season occurs between October
and April and the rainy season (during the summer months) occurs between May and September.
In the project area, the average annual air temperature is 19.2 °C. Table 4.6 shows monthly mean
values of selected meteorological and climatic parameters, recorded at the Jimma station.

The annual rainfall of the Gilgel Gibe catchment area varies from a minimum of 1,300 mm
near the confluence with the Great Gibe River, to a maximum of about 1,800 mm in the Utubo and
Fego mountains. Rainfall decreases throughout the catchment with a decrease in elevation. The
average annual rainfall calculated over the whole Gilgel Gibe basin where it joins the Great Gibe
River (5,500 kM2) is 1,527 mm; over the Deneba catchment (4,225 kmi2) it is 1,535 mm; over the
partial catchment between Asendabo and Deneba (1,295 kM2) it is about 1,479 mm, and over the
partial catchment area between Deneba and the Great Gibe River (1,275 kmn2) it is 1,429 mm. It
appears that 60 per cent of the total amount of annual rainfall occurs between June and September,
30 per cent from February to May, and only 10 per cent between October to January.
The natural evapotranspiration rate is estimated by subtracting the average flow height for
unit of surface from the mean annual precipitation. This is calculated as follows:
i the mean yearly precipitation over the catchment between Asendabo and Deneba (S = 1,295
kiM2) is about 1,479 mm;
i the annual mean flow for the same basin can be estimated as the difference between the yearly
mean flow at Deneba (50.35 m3/s) and Asendabo (36.83 mi3/s), or 13.52 m3/s. This discharge
corresponds to an average flow height for unit of surface of:
13.52x31. 536x106 =329.mmyear
1.295
* the total losses due to evapotranspiration without reservoir are estimated as:
1479 - 329 = 1150 mm/year.
4.2 Natural Environment
4.2.1 Natural vegetation
Moist evergreen mountain forest is the major vegetation cover type of Kefa Province. This
cover type grows at an altitude of 1,200 to 2,300 m where annual rainfall is in the range of 1,200
to 2,000 mm. The Gilgel Gibe project area is characterized by evergreen mountain thickets and
20



shrub, a typical vegetation of slopes occurring throughout Ethiopia. Details of plant species
contained in the forest, thickets and shrubland are provided in the literature.
No formal botanical surveys have been conducted for the vegetation along the Great Gibe or
Gilgel Gibe rivers and there are no previous studies available. Published information on riparian
plant life species is only available for the main Ethiopian rivers (Omo, Abbay, Webi Shebele,
Awash and Tekkezze rivers). For the EA, a phytosociological survey was conducted on the
vegetation of the site of the future reservoir. Information gained could then be used for any future
restoration programs that will be implemented for the proposed buffer area.
A list of the species classified is provided in Table 4.7.
The phytosociological study identified the following associations:
a) In shallow water up to about 20-30 cm deep:
Hydrocotyle ranuncoloides                99%
Mariscus hemisphaericus                    1%

i) Marshy ground (approx. 1650 m)
Marsh reeds, Scirpus inclinatus and Mariscus cft. Richardii, were found in the sunlit
marshy ground about one km from the river.
23



j) Hillside farmland
The cultivated hillside farmland contains scattered Acacia abyssinica, Acacia sp. and
Adansonia digitata (Baobab) trees, as well as small clumps of planted Eucalyptus globulus L. Near
the houses there are small patches of Coffea arabica, Catha edulis, Citrus niedica, Musa sp.,
Ensete ventricosum, Rhamnus prinoides, Punica granatum, Citrus aurantifolia, Bosu+ellia
papyrifera, Psidium guajava, Gossipium spp. and Mangizfera indica have been established.
The main features revealed by the phytosociological survey and the literature review include:
*  the aquatic vegetation consists of hydrophytes rooted in the riverbed;
*  grasses are typical of those found throughout Jimma Province (Fiori 1941);
* Albizzia schimperiana, Phoenix sp. and Glancens anisata are the typical species found in the
moist evergreen mountain forest (Picchi-Sermolli 1957);
* Dombeya sp. and Calpurnia aurea are the most typical species of the evergreen mountain bush
and shrub type;
*  Acacia abyssinica, Entada abyssinica, Acacia sp. and Adansonia digitata are typical of the
savannah and lower stretches of the mountain savannah (Picchi-Sermolli 1957).
Evidence indicates that the Gilgel Gibe riverbank flora likely represents the residue of the
moist evergreen mountain forest which once was predominant in Kefa Province. This riparian
forest is several dozen meters deep in some area along the river where soil moisture is adequate
(Hydrocotyle ranuncoloides is a humidity indicator found up to 50 m from the river).
Back from the riverbank where soil moisture diminishes, typical evergreen mountain bushes
and shrub begin to appear and gradually take over on the slope of the "quolla" (600 to 1,800 m)
and on the edge of the voina dega (1,800 to 2,500 m). At this point the typical vegetation of the
tree-covered savannah is introduced. On untilled hillsides bushes and shrub grade into moist
evergreen mountain forest at higher altitudes.
Cultivated hillsides feature isolated Acacia abyssinica and Adansonia digitata (Baobab)
trees and clumps of Eucaliptus globulus planted by the local population, as well as groups of
cultivated trees for food and medicine production such as Coffea arabica, Catha edulis, Musa sp.
and Ensete ventricosum.
Figure 4 indicates the vegetation patterns inside the proposed reservoir area (on the basis of
aerial photographs 1973-74) and within the project boundary.
4.2.2 Fauna
Aquatic Fauna
A previous study of the stretch of the Gilgel Gibe River in the project area indicated that the
river is shallow, slow moving and for the most part fairly turbid and with poorly oxygenated
waters. Its banks are occupied with hydrophilic and aquatic vegetation. The river bottom is
generally muddy with the occasional rock wing above the surface.
24



The macro-benthic population consists mainly of oligochaetes, but the abundance of
Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera (caddis flies) indicates high water quality, from a biological point
of view. Table 4.8 shows the average values of the main groups of macro-invertebrates sampled at
the same three stations where fishing operations were conducted.
Table 4.8: Macro-invertebrate Presence
Oligochaeta            320
Crustacea              10
Ephemeroptera          170
Coleoptera             20
Tnchoptera             170
Diptera                70
Bivalvia               10
Due to its high suspended solids content and low oxygen content, the river is unsuitable for
fish species requiring good visibility for foraging and for those requiring high oxygen levels that are
normally found in a turbulent environment. The river is ideal for species favouring slow water,
tolerant of low oxygen levels and for species with the ability to survive on a varied diet culled from
the lower end of the food chain (plants and macro-invertebrates).
Immediately downstream of the dam site, the 20 m Deneba waterfall is an obstacle to fish
migrations from downstream to the upper stretches of the river. The dam will have little effect on
migration patterns because the falls already blocks such migrations.
Breeding grounds are found within the project area and eggs are presumably laid upstream.
Young fish are dispersed along the Gilgel Gibe River from the breeding areas both during the flood
periods and while the young fry search for food. However, the migration is probably insufficient to
maintain population levels downstream of the waterfall. The mortality rate among the fish
dispersed by the waterfall is probably high and the number of survivors negligible relative to the
numbers swimming upstream.
Species of the Gilgel Gibe River in the project area include Barbus duchesnii (fam.
Cyprinidae),
Tilapia nilotica (L) (fam. Cichlidae) and Labeo sp. (fam. Cyprinidae).
Barbus sp. is dominant, accounting for about 91 per cent of the fish population, the
remaining nine per cent being comprised of the other two species. In a general study of African
cyprinids, Matthes (1968) concluded that Barbus species are highly adaptable and that the genus
probably speciated explosively whenever the environment was suitable. Nagelkerke (1994) asserts,
in accordance to this point of view that the African species can be split into several distinct groups
based on feeding habits. Competition for food is an important factor in natural selection and thus in
the adaptive radiation of species.
25



Barbus sp. is found throughout Ethiopia. Parenzan (1939) Nagelkerke (1994) and
Dgebuadze (1994) reported its occurrence in many rivers and lakes throughout the region, ranging
from the Lake Tana-Blue Nile complex in the north to the Omo catchment and the Margherita
lakes (Abaya and Ruspoli) in the south. Barbus sp. is omnivorous and in the project area feeds
mainly on vegetable matter and organic debris found on the riverbed.
The composition of the Barbus population appears to be normal with a clear numerical
superiority of young over adult fish. The smaller fish (175 mm long, weight less than 75g) are far
more numerous than the medium size fish weighing over 500 g. (Figs. 6 and 7). Using the death
rate of fish 100-450 mm long as an index, there is approximately a 30 per cent mortality rate in the
transfer from one size class to the next. This is considered a low figure. This transfer rate indicates
that the biomass turnover within the fish population is not particularly rapid and that the incidence
of predation, parasitosis and disease, in general, is relatively low. The transfer rate suggests that the
species is permanently and successfully inserted into the local ecosystem. Further evidence is given
by the confirmed sex ratio (female:male = 70:30). This sex ratio is common where fish have access
to an ample supply of food. The regression between length and weight indicates slightly allometric
(b > 3) growth and shows that there is no substantial difference in the growth rates of the two
sexes.
It is not known when Barbus duchesmii spawns. However, many of the Barbus species in
Lake Chad lay their eggs between June and October and ascend the rivers during the flood flow
period (Blache, 1964). Since the Gilgel Gibe River is hydrologically similar to the water courses of
the Chad catchment, Barbus sp. probably follows a similar reproductive timetable, or possibly later
due to the lower average temperature.
Only two specimens of Tilapia nilotica were found and it is not common according to
reports by the local population. The species is not indigenous to the site. Tilapia is widely used for
fish farming and to replenish rivers, since it is robust and adaptable, being able to breed and survive
new environments. This species was probably introduced. Limited numbers of the species may
indicate that the introduction was not successful or, less probably, that its adaptation has not yet
been completed.
The third fish species found in the Gilgel Gibe River belongs to the genus Labeo sp. Labeo
sp. generally inhabit close to the bottom and feed on its benthic material or on plankton. The
different species generally breed in the hot season (June-September). Some species prefer a hard
river bed (rock or clay) and a fast current while others prefer a soft bottom (sand or chalk) and
slow moving water. The Gilgel Gibe River species probably belongs to the second group although
it may prefer rocky stretches. Its population size in the project area is similar to that of Tilapia
nilotica.
Aquatic Reptiles
Crocodiles have been reported by local residents above Deneba Falls and they are more
common in the lower reaches of Gilgel Gibe and the Gibe Rivers. No crocodiles were observed
during the surveys by the EA team, Department of Wildlife staff and EPA visits. The long stretch
26



of fast flowing river and the falls may present a barrier for crocodiles moving upstream to the
reservoir area. It is likely that crocodiles would find a conducive habitat in the reservoir.
Aquatic Mammals
Hippopotamus are present in the river and they would proliferate in the reservoir.
Terrestrial fauna
During the wildlife surveys, very few terrestrial mammals were observed. Human usage of
the area for agriculture and the practice of annual burning has reduced the wildlife habitat
significantly. The remaining riparian forest has been slowly degraded and has been harmed by the
exposure of fire. Most of the land within the proposed reservoir zone is being used for agriculture
or is in fallow which does not provide suitable wildlife habitat. However, Black and White Colobus
monkeys were observed in riparian areas above and immediately below the Deneba Falls where
burning has not been a factor. There is a clear distinction between the proposed reservoir zone and
the downstream section of the project area in regards to wildlife habitat. The downstream area has
steep banks and is unsuitable for agriculture. The forest cover remains relatively undisturbed and
has not been subjected to frequent burning. In the downstream portions of the project area, wildlife
is present, but difficult to survey because of steep slopes and limited access. Baboons, monkeys,
smaller felines and perhaps leopards are likely to be found.
In the remaining sections of wooded savannah, small populations of Vervet monkeys,
Spotted Hyaena, Wart Hog, Common Duiker, Bush Pig, Baboon, Abyssinian Hare, African civet,
Genet, mongoose and Silver-backed Jackals were identified by observations, signs or inquiries from
local people.
The results of the qualitative survey are indicated in Table A.6. There are three Ethiopian
endemics including T. scriptus (bushbuck), an elusive species associated with riparian forest and
brushwood; A. buselaphus lewel (hartebeest), living in open territories including the savannah; and,
F. harwoodi (Harwood's francolin), a species present in riparian forest, swamp, marsh, and bush
and shrub lands. Only the bushbuck is known to occur near the project area. at low population
densities.
A wide variety of birds, especially water fowl, both local, and migratory, are found in the
area although they have not be quantitatively surveyed. Ethiopian avifauna has not been extensively
studied and the project area is not an exception to this lack of research. During the survey, 67
species were identified in the project area and this would represent a very conservative figure of the
total number of species. The presence of a reservoir and a wooded buffer zone would result in a
major shift in the species composition from one dominated by birds associated with agriculture to
one featuring more waterfowl and raptors.
4.3 Socioeconomic Environment
4.3.1 Existing Conditions
27



Land use
The dominant land use both within the area to be occupied by the reservoir and the general
project area is agriculture and grazing. Along the Gilgel Gibe River, the small amount of remaining
riverine forest provides some habitat for wildlife and provides a source of fuelwood, building
materials and other materials used for meeting a variety of domestic requirements. The agricultural
landscape is dominated by small plots cultivated for the production of cereals, primarily maize, teff,
sorghum and flax.
The population of the project area is widely scattered and lives in tukul type dwellings.
Tukul settlements are found on the slopes, and on the vegetation-free heights. Arable fields are
small and pasture land is generally treeless. Livestock, consisting mainly of zebu cattle, have access
to plenty of water due to the presence of the Gilgel Gibe River, and to reasonable grazing areas.
Traditional farming techniques are still used with the land is worked with animal traction scratch
ploughs. Bee-keeping is commonly practiced, but at low technical inputs.
The economy of the local population is based almost entirely on agriculture and livestock.
Commercial trade takes place primarily in local markets and this local trade exceeds the volume of
trade and goods with other regions.
Population
Small scattered settlements are widespread throughout the area with groups of tukuls
distributed with varying degrees of regularity. Single tukuls are also scattered over a wide area of
land. Concentrations of individual tukuls can be defined as settlement units. The term 'kebele'
refers to an area rather than a precise village. The project includes 18 kebeles belonging to 4
different weredas. The population affected by the reservoir, buffer zone and associated
construction facilities was 15,351 people belonging to 2,476 households. This number will be
smaller in the actual resettlement since the buffer zone has been reduced by more than 1,400 ha.
The average family size in the survey was 6.2 members with little variation amongst kebeles.
The range is 5.1 to 6.8 members per family. Table 4.9 summarises the census results. The degree to
which the population will be affected by the project will vary, depending on the following:
*  .people residing and carrying out agricultural activities on land inside the proposed reservoir
area;
* .people residing outside the reservoir area (but within the project area) and conducting
agricultural activities within the proposed reservoir area.
Table 4.9 provides a breakdown of people affected by the project.

Acting on comments from an earlier draft of this report, EELPA has elected to reduce the
size of the buffer area by over 1,400 ha and a new perimeter has been established. The new
boundary is set between 500-800 m from the reservoir edge at full supply level. The new perimeter
will no longer affect dwellings along an existing block of nearly 1,400 ha at the upstream area of
the reservoir near Koticha Kesi. The boundary has been set back from the existing track that passes
by the upstream portion of the reservoir so that dwellings along the track will not have to be
removed. The change in the buffer zone area was made in July 1997 and the resettlement unit is in
the process of evaluating the changes in the number of households which will have to be
involuntarily resettled. The people who are affected by the change will have the option to
determine if they wish to be relocated or remain on their holdings.
Economy
With the exception of a few traders and tailors living in the Harena and Dimtu areas, and
four people registered in Omo-Nada wereda as workers extracting sand from the Nada-Kelo and
Nada-Guda rivers, people living within the project area gain their livelihood from farming. Privately
owned farm and grazing lands have been registered in the respective names of their owners.
Income
The economy of the area is obviously based on subsistence agriculture and livestock. The
registered average annual income considers income gained from the sale of seasonal farm crop
produce. Crops produced and local crop prices are provided in Table 4. 10.
Table 4.10: Crops and Market Values

Income derived from permanent plants, livestock, trading activities and other sources is not
included in the annual average incomes provided in Table A. 10 (Appendix) which indicates average
incomes of the families which are primarily farmers. The income analysis is provided for groups of
people depending on where they live in relation to the project. That is, i) families who reside in the
future reservoir area (RIR); ii) families which reside in the project area but outside the future
reservoir area (ROR); and, iii) families which reside outside the project area (ROB). The
statistically significant difference between the incomes of families in the different residence
conditions, which shows a clear predominance of the RIR and ROR family incomes compared to
the ROB families, is due to the fact that the ROB families also farm land outside the project area
and gain income from products which have not been considered in the annual income calculation.
The annual net income per family from land located in the area affected by the project
appears to be relatively high, particularly when compared to the results of a survey carried out in
1995 using the data reported by Gamachu (1990). This data showed that the average annual gross
income from crops for upland plain farms ranged from 330 to 640 birr. In the case of the project
area, the annual gross income is extremely variable from family to family with a minimum of 420
birr recorded for a family at Liben and 58,050 birr declared by a family living at Osobili. In 37 per
cent of all cases, the income reaches a level of between 1,000 to 5,000 birr/year, and in 34 per cent
of the cases between 5,000 and 10,000 birr/year. Table A.11 shows the incidence of families
belonging to the different income classes, by kebele. A high average income from agriculture
reflects land of high productive capacity, however, the average expanse of land devoted to
cultivation in this area is higher, ranging from 2.8 ha per family in Sekoru to 3.4 ha per family in
Omo Nada. The average agricultural land holding over the project area is 3.2 ha per family.
Gamachu (1990) showed that the average expanse of land devoted to cultivation on upland plain
farms was between 0.85 and 1.4 ha per family.
Resources - Agriculture and animal husbandry
Cereals are the most important local crop. The most common cereals sown are teff
(Eragrostis tefj), sorghum and maize (Zea mays). Tubers grown include Colocasia esculenta,
Dioscorea sp. and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). Pulses, garlic, onions, cabbage, peppers and
herbs are also grown as well as bananas (Musa ensete.) and "Enset" (Ensete ventricosum). The
latter plant provides a starchy substance which, with cereals, forms the basis of the local diet and a
valuable fibre much used by local craftsmen. On higher ground coffee (Coffea arabica) is also
grown. Table 4.11 lists cultivated trees and their uses.

Farming techniques are still primitive, with animal traction scratch ploughs being used to till
the soil. There is no standard crop rotation but some farmers questioned quoted the following
sequence:
*  Two years of teff, followed by one year of sorghum, followed by one year of Colocasia
esculenta after which the land is placed into fallow. The practice and duration of fallow is
highly variable among the area farmers, ranging from absent to several years of fallow
depending on the amount of land used by the household and the inherent fertility of the plot.
Legumes are not a part of crop rotation practice.
The fields are usually abandoned for several years when they appear to be worked out and
another piece of fallow ground is then brought back into cultivation. Crop productivity is indicated
in Table 4.12.
The productivity of the herbaceous crops turns out to be rather low due to the primitive
farming techniques, the lack of machinery, poor seed, lack of agrochemicals, and the shortage of
capital. The people of the project area normally sow cereals in spring, at the beginning of the rainy
season, and harvest them in autumn or winter. The growing conditions (high temperature, little
sunlight, high humidity) are not optimal and crop production is generally poor. Sometimes the
existing vegetation (either fallow or crop residues and weeds) is burned off before the fallow area
is ploughed.

Cattle are raised on the hillsides where Cynodon dactylon provides good fodder and the
Commelinaceae grasses provide excellent grazing. Many herds (20 to 70 head each) of zebu are
found in the valley as well as sheep, goats, some donkeys and chickens,
The grazing land, presented in Table A.9 (Appendix) excludes the free and common grazing
land. Private grazing lands have not been registered at Osobili kebele farmers association (Omo
Nada), since most of the grazing land within the project area is common.
Fuelwood
Fuelwood resources are not in short supply in the project area or in the resettlement area. In
addition to natural woodlands, there are many plantations of exotic species, such as eucalyptus.
Unlike the plateau between Jimma and Addis Ababa, woody vegetation is still relatively abundant in
the province.
Resources - wildlife
There are few data relating to hunting activity in the area, however, according to information
gathered during the 1995 survey, it seems to be little practised. Warthogs, wild pigs and birds are
occasionally captured. Very little fishing is carried out. There are no full or part time commercial
fishermen, local people fish only occasionally and fish is very rarely consumed. Fishing is only by
primitive hook and lines and consequently only the larger fish such as older specimens of the
Barbus sp. are captured. Nets are not used.
Resources - tourism and landscape
The area does not attract tourists in large numbers at the present time. The area has not been
developed, nor promoted for tourism. Jimma has begun to develop tourist facilities including new
hotels and has sites of cultural interest. However, the area immediately surrounding the project site
has little attraction for either international or national tourism. If Highway #7 is improved, it is
possible that a small increase in tourism will result.
Cultural features
In the area to be affected by the project, there are four mosques and a primary school but
there are no known features of historical or archaeological importance.
Public utilities and roads
Development of the reservoir will necessitate the flooding of approximately 15 km Highway
#7 which links Addis Ababa with Jimma, between the towns of Deneba and Asendabo. Apart from
this highway there are no other important communication routes in the area. Connections between
the various settlements consist of non-vehicular tracks which the population usually traverse on
foot. The Gilgel Gibe River is normally crossed using primitive canoes made from hollowed out
tree trunks. However, the river crossing points are numerous since the inhabitants of the left bank
32



travel to the weekly markets in Asendabo, Deneba and Sekoru for trade and commerce, and for
purposes of socializing.
About 14 km of telephone line and 237 poles along Highway #7 will be removed as a result
of the project.
Housing
Houses in the area are basically of two types: cottages (tukuls), and mud houses with
corrugated iron roofs. Table A. 12 (Appendix) indicates the number of houses in the area by kebele
and according to the position of the future reservoir. There are 361 houses in the area which will
be flooded, most of which (205) are large cottages. The number of houses in the project area
outside the future reservoir is decidedly higher: 839 large cottages, 206 medium-size cottages, 316
small cottages and 36 houses with corrugated iron roofs giving a total of 1,397 houses. These
figures are likely to be smaller with the reduction of the buffer zone as some people who will have
a choice to stay or move will elect to remain in their present location.
Wooden walled mud houses with corrugated iron roofs but without ceilings cost from 1 10
to 130 birr per square metre. The cottages have been classified into large, medium-size and small
and the cost of rebuilding or replacing these houses would be 900, 600 and 400 birr, respectively.
4.3.2 Public Health
Water supply
Apart from the towns of Deneba, Asendabo and Sekoru, and the construction camp, which
have deep wells as a source of drinking water supply, the people of the project area use untreated
stream or spring water sources nearby their locations. The physical and chemical analysis of the 22
water samples collected from different- sources in 1984 (UNDP/WHO Report 1984) revealed that
the major components of cations and anions of the water were within the normal acceptable range.
The fluoride and nitrate content of the water from the deep wells and springs was also found to be
within normal range (Table A. 13, Appendix).
Thus, all water resources in and adjacent to the project area are, from a chemical point of
view, of sufficient quality for domestic purposes, but are contaminated with bacteria from human
and livestock faecal material. At present, polluting activities such as industries, modern agricultural
operations using fertilizers and pesticides, and municipal sewage, are virtually non-existent in the
immediate vicinity of the project area. The only source of concern is the faecal contamination of
the streams and springs located near densely populated areas.
Sanitation and toilet facilities
There are no health facilities within the project area and the nearest health units to the
project are in Deneba and Sekoru towns which do not have adequate facilities and are staffed only
by health assistants. Asendabo health centre is located 14 km away from the project area and is
better staffed with a nurse, a sanitarian and a laboratory technician. It also has a laboratory for
33



routine analyses. The nearest hospital with adequate facilities for both inpatient and outpatient care
is located at Jimma, 70 km away from the project area.
The general sanitary conditions in the towns and villages located in the vicinity of the project
area are unsatisfactory. Except for a few pit latrines in the old established towns of Deneba,
Asendabo and Sokoru, there are no basic sanitary facilities for excreta and waste disposal. People
use the open space around their dwellings for defecation.
Water Related Vector-Borne Diseases
A preliminary survey undertaken by the Ethiopia Water Resources Development Authority
in 1986 revealed that malaria, onchocerciasis and helminthic infections (including bilharzia) are the
major diseases found in the project area. According to the reports of the Institute of Pathobiology
(1982) the incidence of Schistosoma mansoni, the vector for intestinal bilharzia (schistosomiasis) in
the towns of Deneba and Asendabo is I per cent and 2 per cent, respectively which is low
considering the presence of a large amount of standing water which could provide suitable snail
habitat.
In the Gilgel Gibe River, a malacological survey has shown that out of the 32 habitats
surveyed, 10 of them support B. pfeifferi, the snail intermediate host for intestinal bilharzia. Three
of these ten habitats also supported B. africanus which is considered potentially important for the
urinary form of the disease. As well, some of the snail vectors were observed shedding human
cercariae, indicating the existence of the diseases in the area, albeit in an extremely low level of
prevalence. According to the results of recent research (October 1995) carried out among four
heath institutions (Asendabo Health Centre, Deneba clinic, Sekoru clinic and Jimma Zone Health
Office), the number of schistosomiasis cases is surprisingly low throughout the region.
The Zone Office for Malaria Control at Jimma has indicated that malaria is endemic in the
project area. The main transmission season is between September and November. Plasmodium
vivax is the dominant malaria species and the major mosquito vector is Anopheles gambiae. As
indicated by earlier results of the seasonal blood surveys and subsequent classification of the area in
the 0 round spray category, malaria has been controlled effectively throughout the project area.
Nevertheless, this same research indicated that all malaria cases, Plasmodium vivax and P.
falciparum, increased significantly (refer to Tables A. 14 and A. 15, Appendix) throughout the
project and surrounding area between 1989 and 1995.
Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is widespread in south-western Ethiopia including
throughout the Kaffa Administrative Region through which the Gilgel Gibe River flows. The
microfilarial carriers and the rate of ocular onchocerciasis, with partial and total blindness in
Ethiopia, are estimated at a million cases. Oomen (1969) found 29 per cent (Deneba) and 19 per
cent (Asendabo) positive incidence for onchocerciasis among males over 15 years old. This is an
indication of a low level of endemicity. Oomen also confirmed the presence of Similium sp., the
blackfly vector for onchocerciasis in the streams adjacent to the project area. The 1986 surveys
showed an incidence of onchocerciasis of 22.2 per cent in Kele village, 15.6 per cent in Enkure
village and no cases in the other three areas surveyed. No case of blindness attributable to
onchocerciasis has been found among the population examined during the socioeconomic study.
34



One blind person in the study group was negative for Onchocerciasis volvulus. An increase in
incidence between the period 1989 and 1995 has been noted.
The project area is located within the tse-tse fly belt of the country. According to Langridge
(1976), the Greater Gibe River and its tributaries are mostly infested with Glossina fuscipes. To
date, no cases of human trypanosomiasis have been reported.
Infectious diseases
A survey amongst the principal health centres in the area for the incidence of infectious
diseases has been conducted and the results are indicated in Table A. 16 (Appendix). Asendabo
Health Center and Jimma Zone Health Office indicate that the number of TBC patients increased
93 per cent from 213 cases in 1989/90 to 412 cases in 1994/95 at the Asendabo Health Center.
Cases increased 193 per cent from 248 cases in 1989/90 to 726 cases in 1993/94 at Jimma. The
TBC incidence is increasing yearly.
The Asendabo Health Center recorded 28 cases in 1992/93 and 15 cases of infectious
hepatitis in 1994/95. In the past six years the total number of infectious hepatitis cases reported
was 116. The Jimma Zone Health Office treated only 4 cases in the 1993/94 period.
Asendabo Health Center feedback shows that the incidence of AIDS has increased from 2
cases in 1989/90 to 13 cases in 1994-95. There has been no formal survey carried out to determine
the exact number of AIDS cases. There were eight AIDS cases in 1994-95 at Jimma. Out of these,
4 cases were from Omo Nada District (including Asendabo) and 4 cases from Sekoru District .
Other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have remained relatively stable between 1989-95
around Asendabo. Typhoid Fever had remained stable until a dramatic increase in 94-95.
Meningitis and Relapsing Fever have not increased. A large number of cases of bacillary dysentery
and STDs have occurred in the Sekoru area. Jimma also reports an increase of typhoid fever.
Given the rural nature of the area and the rudimentary health services, it is likely that many
of the illnesses are not reported or are mis-diagnosed. The data can best illustrate disease potential
rather than actual situations. Water-related diseases are the most serious threats to human health,
closely followed by the STDs.
5. PROJECT BENEFITS
The main economic benefit to be realized locally is the temporary, but considerable, on-site
employment opportunities created for the local population. Approximately 1,000 temporary jobs
will be made available for unskilled and semi-skilled employment. The benefit will last only through
the construction period, producing approximately 5,000 person years of unskilled and semi-skilled
employment. Since most of the wages generated by construction will be spent locally, there will a
multiplier effect in the local economy as the money from wages is spent or invested locally.
Further, contractors will spend money to purchase food and services locally if the local
entrepreneurs can be positioned to take advantage of the potential local economic windfall.
35



During the construction phase, shops and households along Highway #7 in proximity to the
construction site will have access to a much increased market created by the large work force that
will be concentrated in the area. However, to a large extent, this potential benefit will be temporary
and will last only for the construction period. There will be permanent work force remaining in the
area, but it will be much less than the number employed during construction. However, the longer
term work force will consist of a much higher percentage of skilled and professional staff who will
enjoy higher incomes. Further, this financial contribution will be more stable and will provide a
more stable economic foundation for the project area.
Depending on the manufacturing and industrial base in the region, purchases of goods and
services will generate income, and contribute to salaries and employment during construction. At
present, most of the economic benefits will accrue to Jimma where commercial and entrepreneurial
skills are highest in the region and has relative proximity to the project area.
Economic benefits will be spread along Highway #7 owing to the increase in vehicular
traffic, especially trucks between Addis Ababa and the project site. Property values along the
highway will be inflated, especially near urban centers. To some extent, these benefits can be longer
term if the project stimulates long term economic development in Jimma.
Although studies are only at a preliminary stage, it is expected that, productivity could
increase by improving agricultural technology, including irrigation. Even modest agricultural
interventions, such as small amounts of mechanization, improved seeds, use of agrochemicals and
improved extension efforts, will greatly improve the agricultural productivity. In addition,
improved access to markets, brought about through project-induced improvements to Highway #7,
will provide incentives for increased productivity and a shift to higher value crops. The presence of
an expatriate population in the contractors village will encourage a shift towards growing higher
value fruits and vegetables as well as providing a much larger and more lucrative market for meat,
eggs and dairy products without commensurately increased transportation costs.
The Regional Government of Oromia is approaching the resettlement issue as a development
opportunity and must in that context be viewed as a potential benefit. The relocated population will
receive better health, education and social infrastructure that they presently enjoy. The opportunity
for more employment, better markets, access to agricultural extension services and availability of
credit should stimulate economic growth and options for positive changes in standards of living.
Regionally, the project's expenditures will have a positive effect on the regional economy.
Transportation companies, hotels, small factories and other outlets providing goods and services
will all benefit from business with the project because transportation costs from outside the region
are quite high. Investment costs from the realization of the project are conservatively estimated to
be in the order of $US 246.5 million (for details, reference should be made to the Design Review
Report, Jan 1996). The "boom and bust" syndrome has always been associated with large
infrastructure projects, but has not been quantified in the published literature to the point that
extrapolations can be made to the GGBP. To a large extent, much of the small entrepreneurs
without aspirations of long term economic growth, do pack up and move out after construction,
but a large portion of the commercial growth remains because they have been positioned so that
36



they can compete in other markets. The possibility of a regional economic collapse following the
completion of construction is well-known and the regional government will plan accordingly.
The construction of the dam will have an indirect positive effect on the downstream area,
including:
* the possibility of deforestation and sedimentation will be minimized because the project area
will be protected and the interference by human activity will be reduced. The resettlement
program will shift the population into a less erosion-prone area and the dam/reservoir complex
will become an effective sediment trap for the larger and more destructive materials.
* the calculated maximum flood for 10,000 years return period (3,495 m3Ns) will be controlled
and regulated against possible serious flood disaster on the downstream flood plain area of the
Gilgel Gibe and Gibe River confluence.
Nationally, the project will contribute to the national grid and assist in meeting the country's
demand for electrical energy which is an essential part of economic development. The project
relieves the country of some of the burden of spending foreign exchange on fuels and their
transport charges for thermal power which is mostly imported. Given the advanced state of
construction and site preparation, GGHP can be brought on line more quickly than another
"greenfield"hydropower sites on other rivers.
6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The following sections describe and expand on the impacts that can be expected from
implementing the project and provides an indication of mitigative actions that may be considered.
The matrix of Figure 8-10 (Appendix) presents in shorthand form these potential environmental
effects corresponding to the various actions foreseen while constructing, and operating the Gilgel
Gibe project. In addition to addressing the impacts, some sections highlight potential mitigation
measures which will be described in more detail in the environmental management plan which
provides a format for the mitigation measures. The repetition should be helpful in allowing readers
to become aware of the mitigation as the issues or impacts are defined. More detail of the measures
will be given in the section on environmental management along with some cost estimates and
schedules for implementation.
6.1 Physical Environment
6.1.1 Seismology
The dam site is 96 km from the most active seismic centres. Energy developed by any
earthquake originating in these centres would be of concern in the project area even though the
energy developed would be considerably attenuated at the site.
Reservoir induced seismicity (RIS) is always a possibility for any reservoir. The new body of
water could increase the fluid pressure in the rock mass which in tum would reduce the frictional
strength on the fault planes of the area. This would normally induce a higher number of micro-
earthquakes to be released but this in turn would reduce the probabilities of far more disruptive
37



events. The micro-earthquakes would free energy that would be accumulated and released at once
during a more relevant phenomenon. The effects of RIS is local and normally not serious unless
there is a potential for large land slippage which is not a condition at Gilgel Gibe. The RIS events
are restricted to surface events that would not threaten life or dam integrity. The effects are very
local, but raise considerable and understandable fears in local populations, but rarely cause loss of
life or serious property damage. The danger of RIS is lessened in Gilgel Gibe because people will
not be living in the buffer zone, the most likely area to experience any RIS effects.
6.1.2 Hydrology
While the main dam is under construction, temporary diversion tunnels will allow the river to
bypass the work site. The river downstream would maintain its natural flows during this phase
including the potential for heavy floods. There is an assumption in downstream populations that
once construction starts on an upstream dam that flooding is a thing of the past. During and after
construction, the potential for downstream flooding still exists although reduced in magnitude and
frequency of occurrence. Beyond the confluence with the Gibe River, the controlling effect of
Gilgel Gibe Dam is greatly reduced because the Gibe River will remain uncontrolled and it
contributes the far greater volume of river discharge.
The filling of the reservoir is designed to occur gradually. Once reservoir filling begins, the
diversion channel will still release water, which will be supplemented by the Chilelo tributary
flowing into the stretch between the dam wall and the tailrace. The amount of river flow in this 16
km stretch will be greatly reduced, but will not disappear. The amenity flow is programmed into
the filling sequence as a mitigation measure.
The reservoir will have a theoretical fluctuating level in any one year between 1651 m a.s.l.
and 1671 m a.s.l., but realistically, the reservoir will not be allowed to reach the maximum level
before spilling will occur, nor will it reach the absolute minimum before generation is curtailed. The
more normal operating range will be between 1653 and 1671 m a.s.l. The predicted drawdown for
any one year is 18 m. The reservoir will rarely reach it's full area of 60 km2 which would occur
when the spillway would be spilling water at full capacity. At normal operating schedules and
meteorology, the reservoir area would not exceed 50 km2.
6.1.3 Storage Sedimentation
During the construction phase, substantial effects on the characteristics of the sedimentation
regime in the section of the river below the dam  are not expected as the environmental
management plan will control erosion caused by construction through constant on-site surveillance.
In terms of operation, sedimentation studies and field measurements carried out to date
indicate an average annual sediment inflow in the upper reservoir in the order of 4.5 million tons.
Granulometric analyses indicated that most of the suspended sediment is represented by very fine
particles of silt and clay. Given the granulometric characteristics of the sediments and the limited
volume of the reservoir in relation to the annual runoff, the reservoir trap efficiency is expected to
be in the range of 80 to 90 per cent which corresponds to a total of 50 years deposition of
approximately 180 to 200 million tons, or 140 to 160 million m3 which is slightly more than the
38



128 million m3 of dead storage in the reservoir. The implementation of a naturally vegetated buffer
zone should reduce the amount of sediments entering the reservoir, thereby extending the useful
life of the reservoir.
Sediment content of the water inflowing to the reservoir averages 0.255 mg/I. The minimum
volume of sediment content is 2.8 million m3/year and the maximum is 3.4 million m3/yr. The finest
particles deposited in the reservoir by the river will eventually pass through the spillway or the
turbines. Given the very small size of such particles and the limited head, no special abrasion
problems are expected. Taking also into account the low level outlet incorporated into the
diversion tunnel, which, if properly operated, will assure a certain flushing effect, a dead storage of
128 million m3 is considered sufficient to ensure the proper operation of the upper plant for an
economic life period of 50 years.
The maximum drawdown area (the difference betwwen the theoretical reservoir largest
surface area and the area occupied when resevoir surface elevation is at offtake level) is estimated
to be 27 km2 at the end of an extreme dry period. The more likely drawdown area will range
between 0 at full service level and 20 km2 at minimum operating level. This area will be tempting to
use as dry season pasture but if it is used serious erosion could occur, exacerbating sediment
loading in the reservoir. As part of the mitigation plan this area will be closed to grazing and
agriculture and will be within the buffer zone.
6.1.4 Water Quality
Contamination of the future reservoir water from faecal matter and domestic wastes will not
be a serious problem since all villages and individual houses in the project area will be relocated
and no dwellings or livestock grazing will not be permitted in the protective buffer zone. However,
water quality downstream could be altered by the construction activities and workers. Erosion,
chemical pollution from construction activities, and pollution from human and domestic waste from
the camps and offices could occur. To the extent possible, pollution will be controlled by on-site
environmental management activities carried out by EELPA and the construction contractors.
The quality of the reservoir water is partially dependent on upstream conditions and
activities as well as on the retention time within the reservoir. The non-point pollution potential
from the watershed is low since agricultural practices in the watershed are relatively primitive and
do not involve the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Predicted annual drawdown levels of 18
m should ensure that riparian macrophytes will not flourish in the new impoundment. The major
contributor to adverse water quality in the reservoir will be the operating schedule of the reservoir
and the possibility of a proliferation of aquatic vegetation over time.
Floating macrophytes such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), the presence of which
is well known in all regions of Central and East Africa and is likely to be the invader to expect. It is
particularly prolific in Ethiopia and within the basin which provides water for the Awash
hydroelectric plant and has caused significant problems. The probability of reservoir colonization
by water hyacinth will be decidedly higher in the first years following the filling of the reservoir due
to the high concentrations of nutrients from decaying vegetation. The environmental management
39



plan includes an aggressive approach to monitoring and controlling water hyacinth by the on-site
environmental management unit.
The chemical and physical characteristics of the Gilgel Gibe and Zambezi rivers are similar.
It is therefore possible to calculate likely future changes in the catchment water. Salinity is
estimated to be 1.2 to 1.4 times higher following the construction of the dam. Water turbidity,
which reduces light penetration and thus limits the production of algae, the reservoir will probably
be much clearer than the water of the Gilgel Gibe River. This effect will follow the settling of
suspended fine particles. It is estimated that water will remain in the reservoir for a period of 120
to 150 days and this would result in levels of fine suspended material downstream of the
hydroelectric plant being about 40 to 50 per cent lower than current levels without a project.
Increased productivity of the reservoir system will occur as a result of nutrient richness from
the presence of large quantities of decomposing biomass in a slow-changing, low-oxygen body of
water with a low level of turbulence. These conditions could provoke the phenomena of anoxia,
and an initial increase in CO2 in the water would be followed. If anoxic conditions occur at the
bottom of the reservoir, anaerobic decomposition would produce H2S and an increase in acidity
will take place. The anaerobic conditions would have an immediate (although temporary)
repercussion on the aquatic invertebrates at the bottom of the reservoir while the increase in the
Waters' acidity could cause damage to the power station plant. However, aerobic conditions will
prevail at the intake level unless water hyacinth mats block out sunlight penetration into the
reservoir. Releases from the bottom outlet would be anoxic and would have to be mixed with
surface waters in order to prevent downstream fish kills. Since the Chilelo tributary enters the
Gilgel Gibe river one kilometer downstream of the dam, the anoxic conditions from bottom
releases would disappear quickly.
Removal of woody vegetation from the reservoir prior to flooding will partially mitigate the
adverse quality that could be expected. Reservoir clearing of woody vegetation will be a part of the
civil works contract. However, herbaceous material will remain during reservoir filling and the
decomposition of this material will produce an initial flush of nutrients for several years in the
reservoir. Algae and plankton will proliferate and fish growth will be more rapid. As the reservoir
matures, the nutrient levels will decrease as will total reservoir productivity of biomass.
Proper storage, handling and disposal of construction materials, particularly chemicals, fuels
and lubricants, and the provision of proper treatment facilities for human and domestic wastes will
reduce the threats of water pollution. Proper construction techniques will minimize erosion at the
site and downstream sedimentation. Construction contracts will require each contractor to define
an environmental management component that would be implemented during the construction
period. Runoff from blasting operations in the tunnel and at quarry sites will be properly controlled
and contained (e.g. sediment ponds) to ensure that contaminated runoff does not reach the Gilgel
Gibe River. Maintenance facilities and fuel handling areas are located well away from the river's
edge.
40



6.1.5 Climate
The area to be occupied by the reservoir will vary during the year as flows from the reservoir
are regulated according to the expected cycle of drawn-down level and flooding. As well, the
volume of losses will also vary from month to month in response to changes in the weather.
Evaporation from the surface of the reservoir will replace the present evapotranspiration
from the soil of the area to be covered by the reservoir. In certain months evapotranspiration from
the soil would exceed the evaporation from the reservoir as a result of heavy rainfall periods when
the soil becomes saturated. In addition, vegetation and topographical depressions in the soil create
a much greater contact surface with the air, allowing a greater opportunity for water release than
that provided by the surface of the reservoir. The presence of the reservoir will expand the
floodplain microclimate within the buffer zone. Microclimate changes beyond the buffer zone are
not expected to be significant or noticeable except for a slight increase in fog. The estimation of the
additional evaporation rate, induced by the presence of the reservoir, has been calculated on the
basis of meteorological data from Jimma during the periods of 1972 to 1975 and 1984 to 1993.
The area under investigation appears to be sufficiently homogenous from a morphoclimatic point of
view, such that measurements carried out at the Jimma station can be extended to the Deneba site
where the dam will be located.
The monthly total evaporation and daily mean evaporation rates are provided in Table 6.1
and 6.2. The method used in this report to evaluate the evaporation from a water surface is based
on a simplified energy balance, details of which are provided in Hydrological Report 05/1/1996.
Table 6.1: Daily Mean Evaporation Rate Ep [mm/day] for Each Month at the Dam Site
EP    5.39   5.72   6.17   5.46  15.18   3.83   3.97   4.60   4.60  15.32  15.30 50
Table 6.2: Monthly Evaporation at the Dam Site
Ep/    167   160   191   164   161   133   119    123   138   165   159   157
Month                19l
The total annual evaporation is 1,837 mm per unit of surface. The additional water losses
that will be induced by the presence of the reservoir can be estimated by comparing the evaporation
rate prior to construction, from the ground and vegetation, with the rate to be expected from the
reservoir. Since the annual mean evaporation from the reservoir will be 1,837 mm, it is possible to
deduce that the liquid surface causes an evaporation rate of:
De= 1837- 1150=687 mm/year
if S is the liquid surface area of the reservoir in kM2, then the increment of the losses, DQ, can be
estimated in m3/s with the relation:
41



DQ-   DexS
3 1.536xl06
with: S = 20 km2      DQ - 0.44 m3/s
S=30 km2        DQ = 0.66 m3/S
S = 40 km2      DQ = 0.88 m3/s
S = 50 km2      DQ = 1.10 m'/s
These values represent 0.9, 1.3, 1.7, 2.1 per cent of the long-period mean annual flow rate
respectively, and for this reason it is possible to consider the evaporation losses negligible.
The construction of a reservoir with a surface area of approximately 60 km2 can cause
hydrological, hydrogeological and microclimatic changes over an average area of 0.3 to 1.5 km
from the edge of the reservoir (Avakyan, 1975). In some cases minor climatic changes can occur
up to a distances 20 to 30 km away. At the edge of the reservoir daily temperature ranges could
fall by 2 to 4°C, relative humidity could increase by 10 to 15 per cent; wind speed could increase;
and, there could be reduced soil evapotranspiration. With protection of the buffer zone and a small
amount of management, the area of riparian forest would be greater after the reservoir fills than
under the present conditions.
6.1.6 Downstream Effects
Evaporation from the surface of the reservoir would cause a minor loss in the flow into the
Great Gibe River, and thus in the flow of the Omo River, and consequently, on the inflow of Lake
Turkana.
The reservoir area would normally fluctuate within the range of 29.12 to 49.45 km2. With an
average surface area of the reservoir being 40.11 km2, the annual reduction in flow of the Gilgel
Gibe River by evaporation due to the creation of the reservoir will be 0.87 m3/s. This flow
corresponds to an annual volume of 27.55 mnillion m3 which is considered insignificant (0.17 per
cent) as compared with the annual flow of the Omo River which contributes an average annual
flow of 16,600 million m3 to Lake Turkana.
Once the reservoir has completely filled, and operation of the plant has started, 44.65 m3/s
flow will be discharged through the turbines, I m3/s will be allowed as compensation flow and 5.28
m3/s on average will be spilled monthly over the spillway. This will provide a balanced flow for the
downstream users. Annual flooding of the Gilgel Gibe River would be reduced, but the flood
reduction might not be noticed by people living in the Gibe River floodplain except at the
confluence of the rivers.
6.1.7 Landscape
During the dry periods, the reduction of the flow of the Gilgel-Gibe will have a significant
impact on the appearance of the Deneba Falls which is an attractive landscape element. At present,
the falls are not an important touristic feature because tourists do not visit the area.
42



6.2 Natural Environment
6.2.1 Natural Vegetation
Project construction activities will entail the removal of natural vegetation and the dumping
and stockpiling of earth on areas occupied by natural vegetation. Riparian areas, transitional
vegetation between riparian forest and the woody savannah will all be affected through the loss of
natural vegetation. Hillside farmland which consists of isolated Acacia abyssinica, Acacia sp. and
Adansonia digitata (Baobab) trees as well as small clumps of Eucalyptus globulus L. will also be
affected by during the construction phase. However, the total loss of land and vegetation during
the construction phase will be limited to the areas needed for construc'tion and access. Since most
of the construction sites have already been developed and are in place, incremental losses of natural
vegetation will be minimal except for the area to be inundated.
The reservoir will be a permanent feature and will directly affect a land area of nearly 60 km2
when filled to it's maximum area. Clearing of all large forms of vegetation will occur and all
vegetation on this area of land will be lost. The proposed reservoir area includes 300 ha of partially
degraded riparian forest that provide habitat for several desirable wildlife species. The remaining
area consists of cultivated and grazing lands with remnants of the transitional zone and savannah
woodland.
The loss of riparian vegetation and its wildlife habitat will be compensated by the creation of
a buffer zone of over 2,000 ha which will encircle the reservoir and extend on both sides of the
river down to the powerhouse site. This buffer zone will have natural vegetation and will not be
used for dwellings, agriculture or grazing. Access to the reservoir for fishing will be permitted by
EELPA which is consistent with company policy at other hydroelectric sites in Ethiopia.
These changes will produce a suitable microclimate for the restoration of natural vegetation
of the reservoir edge (about 78 km long) using species listed in the phytosociological survey.
Albizzia schimperiana and Morus mesogriza which grow rapidly would be suitable replacements
for the existing riparian flora and are also ideal for the poor lateritic soil on the slopes surrounding
the proposed reservoir. The environrnental management plan includes the collection of plant
propagules prior to and during reservoir clearing that will be used to restore natural vegetation in
the buffer zone. The moister air masses created by eastern and southeastern winds (Griffliths, 1972)
would be blown onto the hills and mountains to the west and north-west. It is predicted that the
revegetation of the buffer area will in time convert the evergreen mountain shrub into woodland
and subsequently this will succeed to a moist evergreen mountain forest, providing all of the
advantages of a forest including a rich biodiversity.
The plant life that will naturally be established along the edge of the reservoir and in partially
flooded areas will include those species currently found in the area and probably, as well, other
species which inhabit the banks and water edges of the rift valley lakes and Lake Turkana (FAO,
1961). These will include those listed below.
bank vegetation - Typha sp,.Phragmites, Juncus sp. and Scirpus sp.
43



floating and emerging plants - Nymphaea sp.,Leersia and Panicum
underwater species - Potamogeton sp and Ceratophyllurn sp.
Part of the flooded pasture land will be retrievable when reservoir levels recede, particularly
in the December to April period. These areas are likely to produce the kind of grasses currently
found in the riverside meadows and could be made available for controlled grazing in the dry
season in emergency situations. Current plans do not include grazing within the buffer zone, but
manual harvest of the vegetation for fodder would be considered during periods of drought. It is
possible that EELPA may consider allowing local people to cut the drawndown vegetation for
housing materials. A determination of how buffer zone vegetation will have to wait until the
reservoir has been in operation for a few years in order to evaluate the productivity and utility of
species that will grow in the drawdown zone and the effects of limited access.
The riparian vegetation along the section of the Gilgel Gibe River between the dam and the
tailrace could be modified to an evergreen mountain vegetation type as a result of a decrease in air
and soil humidity due to the loss of river flow. Since the topography of this 16 km section of the
river is very steep, there is little floodplain vegetation so any conversion to a different vegetation
type would be slow. The most noticeable effect would be a reduction in the epiphytic plants
growing on the evergreen trees.
6.2.2 Fauna
Fish population
No significant adverse impacts on fish populations or on fish habitat in the Gilgel-Gibe River
are anticipated during the construction phase, but there should be dramatic changes following dam
closure.
The fish population in the section of the river above the proposed dam site is naturally
isolated from downstream populations by the Deneba waterfall. The population is ecologically
adapted to this position of isolation. As well, the fast current around the waterfall largely
discourages this population from swimming downstream. The presence of the dam will have little
influence on the current population and its movement in this regard. However, the change from a
river environment to a lake environment will affect fish population, its composition and dynamics.
The reservoir will provide an enriched food supply in the form of submerged plant life which
will nourish the invertebrate food chain for several years. This will likely increase biological
productivity and overall fish yield. However, once this food supply is exhausted, production will
decline and an equilibrium at a lower level will be established. This decline will be more
pronounced in deeper sections of the reservoir as these are deprived of the riparian environment
favouring the main biological functions of the ecosystem. In shallower waters production levels will
be kept fairly high because of periodically raising or lowering the water level that accelerates
oxidation and thus recycling the organic matter accumulated on the reservoir bed.
44



The morphoedaphic index (MEI) can be used to estimate the maximum sustainable yield
(MSY) in the reservoir once it has achieved a level of production stability. MSY is the surplus fish
population that can be captured without damage to the core population. This sustainable capture is
thought to be in the order of 30 to 50 per cent of the total population (Gulland, 1970).
Based on the formula developed by Ryder (1965), production, once the reservoir has
stabilised, should range between 15 and 25 kg/ha/annum, given that total dissolved solids (TDS)
are 64 parts/million (ppm), as measured in the Gilgel Gibe River, and the average depth of the
reservoir is 16 m Since the maximum surface of the reservoir will be about 60 km2, the Ryder
formula gives an absolute MSY for the entire reservoir of 75 to 125 tonnes/annum.
MSY estimates from similar surfaces of several large African lakes are higher which may be
due to the altitude of the project area which contributes to a more temperate climate. The
calculated yield per unit area of the proposed reservoir is similar to the yield of the Nasser/Nubia
reservoir (21 kg/ha/year) and is much higher than the yield for the Kariba reservoir (7.6
kg/ha/year).According to Welcome (1978), the estimated sustainable yield of the Gilgel Gibe River
is probably in the order of 40 to 60 kg/ha/year.
Species composition in the reservoir will probably reflect species currently found in the
Gilgel Gibe River since the catchment upstream of the reservoir contains the same species found in
the portion of the river to be flooded. Of the three fish species found in the Gilgel Gibe River, two
(Barbus intennedius and Tilapia nilotica) are well adapted to a lake environment. The third
species, Labeo sp., will probably be able to tolerate the lake environment. Proportions of the three
species are not expected to change. At present, Barbus sp. accounts for 90 per cent of the
population and there is little reason to believe that it will lose its dominance in the reservoir.
Tilapia nilotica, which prefers tropical water courses, may obtain some advantage from the
increased temperature of the reservoir (the hydroelectric plant will remove some of the colder
water from the lower depths) but the advantage will not likely lead to a significant increase in its
population. It is expected that Labeo sp. will maintain its marginal presence among the fish
population. The data resulting from this analysis indicate that the local fishery will be aided by the
creation of the reservoir, particularly in the early years. The introduction of improved fishing
methods and equipment such as bow-nets and fish traps would increase the importance of fish in
the local diet and contribute to the local economy if a small local commercial fishery is established.
At this time, there is no indication of interest from the local population for an expanded local
fishery.
Downstream aquatic life
The Gilgel Gibe Dam will reduce the aquatic life in that portion of the river between the dam
and the tailrace, roughly 16 km of the 70 km to the confluence with the Gibe River. The reduction
in the fish production downstream will be more or less compensated for by the net increased
production in the reservoir, as has been the case in many of the larger African (Chari, Niger,
Senegal), American (Missouri, Colorado) and European (Volga) rivers (Wellcome 1978) and their
associated reservoirs.
45



As an extreme example, even if the length of river downstream to be affected is 1 00 km (but
only 16 km between the dam and the tailrace would have significantly reduced flow) this would
represent a total water area (assuming 0.03 km average river width) of 3 kM2, and the loss of MSY
would be 16.5 t/annum. This amount would be easily compensated through the production of the
reservoir.
Other vertebrates
Habitats will be lost as a result of buildings and access roads, as well as general construction
activities, Of particular importance during the clearing of the riparian forest are the loss of habitats
for a variety of wildlife. The loss of habitat provided by the riparian forest will be partly
compensated for by the establishment of vegetation in the buffer area.
General noise levels on the construction sites will cause wildlife to temporarily move away
from the area. Most wildlife populations will become established once again in the area, once
construction has been completed.
The removal of existing natural habitat, in particular, the riparian forest, will result in wildlife
migration both upstream and downstream to other relatively undisturbed and suitable riverine
habitats. However, the assumption has to be made that ecological niches in these areas will already
be occupied and these habitats will be at the extent of their carrying capacities. In addition, many of
the wild animals are strongly territorial and will defend their territories against invaders As a result,
many of the wild mammals from the riverine habitat to be removed are likely to perish. The effects
on other vertebrates (birds, reptiles and amphibians) are likely to be less harsh as they are less
constrained by carrying capacity and territorial behavior than mammals.
Only partial mitigation will be achieved through revegetating the reservoir shoreline and the
buffer area. Riverine vegetation can not always be duplicated due to different soils, microclimate,
and moisture regimes. Newly vegetated areas will attract some wildlife but the riverine faunal
community, as it is currently structured, could be lost for a long time. It is not possible to predict to
what extent riparian forest will be established along the new reservoir and how long it would take
to reach maturity and some degree of ecological equilibrium.
Predator populations, notably crocodiles, may increase in response to diminished turbidity of
the reservoir and an increase in fish productivity. At present, there are no plans to control or
prevent predators in the reservoir. Since the buffer zone will keep most people away from the
reservoir, the expected increase in cocodiles will not pose a serious threat to humans. The EMU
would become aware of any serious threats during the course of water sampling and waterweed
control. Bird predators, waterfowl and raptors, will increase which provide a small atraction to
tourists.
46



6.3 Socioeconomic Environment
6.3.1 Dislocation of People
Three different groups of people within the project area will be directly affected by the
project and will be required to move from the area. Figure A. 1 shows the area occupied by the
reservoir together with the project area limits These groups will include:
* . Families living and cultivating in the area of the reservoir.
* . Families living outside the reservoir zone area but cultivating within the reservoir.
* . Families living and cultivating outside the reservoir area but within the project area.
An area of approximately 60 km2 will be inundated at maximum supply level and will affect
18 kebeles belonging to 4 weredes. The area includes 2,476 families representing 15,351 people
who will be obliged to move from the area. Those who live and work within the area (273 families
representing 1,715 people) of the proposed reservoir will have to abandon their homes as well as
the land they use for agriculture and grazing. In this area 1,196 ha of land is used for agriculture
and 114 ha of land is used for grazing.
The land within the area of the future reservoir that is used by families living outside the area
includes 1,545 ha for agricultural uses and 164 ha for grazing.
The third group of people, those who live and work outside reservoir area but within project
area, is the largest, with 1,946 families and 12,516 people. These families use 6,282 ha for farming
and 199 ha for grazing.
As noted previously, the figures for the latter two groups will change owing to the reduction
of the buffer zone. Some of the people who will not longer have holdings in the buffer zone due to
the change will elect to stay on their present holdings. Since, the reservoir perimeter is unchanged,
the first group will not have any options to stay as their holdings will be inundated. The new area
of the buffer zone and reservoir will be approximately 9,200 ha instead of 10, 650 ha.
The above groups of people to be affected by the reservoir will have to be relocated.
Experience with involuntary resettlement in other development projects has not been good.
Relocation can occur over a period of several years and unless resettlement is planned and
implemented carefully it can create psychological and socio-cultural stress and tension amongst
those displaced and those in the receiving areas, especially if the two areas are different culturally,
ethnically and linguistically.
Usually people are reluctant to move from familiar surroundings and be disrupted from their
socio-cultural groups. Most are particularly upset that they are forced to do so in order to produce
benefits for others i.e. hydroelectric power generated in rural areas and transmitted to urban areas).
The high stress level is generally expressed in very conservative attitudes among those
displaced, who in the first few years after relocation (at least 3 years) tend to insist on their former
production techniques and seek out social groups that are familiar to them. Experience in other
47



resettlement efforts has shown that the majority of people who are forced to relocate prefer to be
relocated to areas close by and wish to maintain the cohesiveness of their social groups as much as
possible.
The impact can be extreme and could last for a long time. Even after resettlement it is
unrealistic to expect that displaced people are able to quickly adapt to new production systems
under different climatic and soil conditions, and perhaps even being required to change
occupations.
The resettlement program required for Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project is designed to
avoid many of the risks stated above. The people have been aware of the possibility of involuntary
resettlement since the early 1980s and are more prepared psychologically to move. A Resettlement
Planning Unit has been established in the Oromia Regional Government to design and implement
the resettlement plan as a development opportunity. A resettlement site has been selected. . The
resettlement site is large enough to accommodate the entire relocation populations so that existing
communities do not have to be fragmented. The selected site is also very close to the project area
and environmental conditions are similar. Further, the receiving communities are similar ethnically,
culturally and linguistically. These advantages do not completely eliminate the potential for
psychological or economic stresses for the people to be relocated, therefore the resettlement
program will contain counselling and advisory services plus make financial credits available to the
resettlers if necessary. To the extent possible, the relocating population will be able to retain or
improve their current life style as they choose.
The new site will be provided with access roads, drainage systems, an elementary school,
health unit, offices for the Farmers Associations, Mosques, Churches, a veterinary health post, and
a flour mill. Money has been budgeted to provide agricultural extension services, vocational
training and credit for the people to be resettled. The cost for the resettlement infrastructure is
approximately US$ 750,000.
The resettlement study indicated that 38.9 per cent of the total number to be resettled prefer
to arrange their own resettlement affairs, 45.5 per cent prefer to settle in government prepared
resettlement sites and 15.6 per cent were undecided. After further discussions regarding the
modality of providing housing, the GOE has decided that the settlers would be provided with
prepared sites at the resettlement area. The settlers would be paid compensation for the dwellings
to be left behind and they would make personal arrangements for house construction. The
Resettlement Unit would provide assistance with materials and technical advice.
6.3.2 Loss of Livelihood
If the resettlement plans are implemented successfully, there should be no loss of livelihood
for the population to be relocated. The government has provided a resettlement site that is equal in
size and quality to the land that they currently use. All people will be able to continue with their
means of livelihood, mostly agriculture if they prefer. In addition, many will gain employment and
new job skills as project laborers. New means of earning a living will become available through
supplying goods and services to the construction labor force. A new temporary market at the
48



construction camp and contractor's village will be opened for the sale of their agricultural and
livestock production.
6.3.3 Loss of Agricultural Resources and Food Production
The removal of about 8,600 ha of cultivable land may result in a temporary reduction in local
agricultural production and possibly a consequent increase in pressure on the surrounding land.
Loss of production will be mitigated through the resettlement program whereby new lands will be
brought under production with improved agricultural techniques. As well, a fisheries development
and management programme for the reservoir may result in a net food production gain and
additional jobs for the area. Effective agricultural extension, planned in the resettlement program,
promoting good land husbandry practices, will minimize soil erosion and increase agricultural
production.
Preliminary calculations show a loss of about 6,138 metric tons of food and grain per annum
if the resettlement site is not ready for agricultural production in time. Paddy, wheat and maize
alone account for 5,400 metric tons or 12 per cent of the total production of the entire two districts
(45,000 metric tons). The district food balance could be disturbed, thus the successful
implementation of the resettlement plan is envisioned as critical to the local area by the
Resettlement Planning Unit..
6.3.4 Loss of Infrastructure
A total of 130 houses, 2,605 large cottages and 1,857 small cottages will be expropriated as
a result of the project. In addition, 6,31 1 barns will be expropriated.
Approximately 14 km of telephone line and 237 poles will be lost as a result of the project.
As well, four mosques and one primary school will be lost. There are no registered historical or
archaeological features within the project area.
All infrastructure losses and the services that the infrastructure represents will be replaced or
compensation will be provided.
6.3.5 Health
Dust and Noise
General construction activity, including blasting, dumping of waste (e.g. tunnel spoil),
construction and traffic, will lead to an increase in dust and noise in the general area. This will
have an effect on people's health. Dust can cause respiratory problems and noise, if sufficiently
loud and frequent, can cause hearing problems amongst both workers and local residents, and it
can cause stress.
These impacts can be mitigated through the provision and use of proper hearing equipment
for workers and warnings provided well in advance in order that local people will be prepared. The
impact on local people of heavy construction noise will be minimal since all local people within the
49



proposed project area will be relocated. Dust can be controlled through the watering of roads, the
controlled speed of road traffic, and various other control techniques to be applied during drilling
and blasting operations. The contractors will be required to address these issues in their
environmental management plan when they submit their contract proposals. In addition, the
EELPA  on-site environmental unit will monitor contractor's compliance with environmental
protection standards in the contracts.
Public Safety
Public safety will not be a significant problem since residents within and close to the
proposed project area will be relocated. Heavy vehicle movement between Addis Ababa and the
project area will provide the potential for road accidents, particularly with local residents who are
not accustomed to heavy traffic and heavy vehicles.
Project related vehicles will be required to abide by good driving conduct, obey speed limits
and generally follow the rules of safe driving. All vehicles will be equipped with properly
maintained lights and audio warning systems. Night driving will be minimal and strictly controlled.
All local residents will be made aware of the traffic increases to be expected as a result of the
project and safety lectures, probably in conjunction with public health lectures, will be provided to
community groups.
Water Borne Diseases
The reservoir will lead to an increased potential for water borne diseases. The Gilgel Gibe
reservoir will suitable for the transmission of three main types of parasitic infections: malaria,
onchocerciasis (river blindness) and bilharzia (schistosomiasis). The transmission vectors of these
to humans involve a vector or intermediate host linked to the presence of water.
The entomological and malacological studies, and the reports of the health authorities of the
area, confirm the endemic nature of malaria and the presence of bilharzia and river blindness in the
area. If suitable measures are not taken, the creation of a very large body of water with a gently
sloped perimeter covered with vegetation will provide ideal conditions for the growth of the
vectors responsible for the transmission of malaria and bilharzia. The reservoir conditions will
reduce habitat for river blindness vectors except at the spillway and tailrace. Anopheline mosquitos
(responsible for transmitting malaria) will find conditions that are particularly favourable for their
larval development in the areas of the sun exposed flat banks which contain aquatic vegetation
Such habitats are also suitable for the growth and development of Bulinus sp. and Biomphalaria
sp., snail hosts of the parasite which causes bilharzia.
A major factor for the spread of bilharzia is human population movements. During the
construction phase of the project, it is expected that over one thousand labourers, some from
different parts of the country, will be employed. As a result, it is probable that some of these will be
people from malaria and bilharzia endemic areas. They will increase the existing transmission foci
and intensify disease dissemination. It is also likely that laborers and truck drivers from bilharzia
and malaria free areas will contract the diseases while working in the project area and then take the
diseases back to their home areas. Of the sixteen employees that are currently at the project site,
50



one is cunrently infected with S. mansoni, which is the parasite that causes intestinal bilharzia,
which is more serious than urinary bilharzia.
Reservoirs generally decrease the prevalence of onchocerciasis as a result of a decrease in
the density of the vector. This is seen in areas where Simulium damnosumn is the sole vector of the
disease. In the Gilgel Gibe area it has been observed that both S. damnosum and S. ethiopense are
vectors. The breeding habitat of S. ethiopense is quite different from S. damnosum in that the
former species breed on crabs and requires a relatively slow moving river in contrast to the latter
which prefers fast well-oxygenated water, such as the spillway and tailrace. Although the
construction of the dam may adversely affect affect S. damnosum due to the creation of a slow
moving river, it is expected that this may not be so for S. ethiopense. In fact, the density of the
latter species may be enhanced and will probably become a vector of primary importance.
Possibilities for increasing the seriousness of the malaria vectors and the disease are high due
to the introduction of vectors from adjoining areas, the creation of suitable habitats and the
introduction of new strains of malaria through migrant labourers.
The uninhabited buffer zone will decrease the project-induced exposure to bilharzia and
malaria for the general population. However, the threat of contracting the diseases will remain high
in the region because of the ubiquitous presence of standing water throughout the region during
the rainy season. There will be considerably increased exposure to the diseases to the large work
force who will be working and living in conditions ideal for transmission of malaria and bilharzia.
Construction camp clinics must be well supplied with a variety of medicines to treat the diseases.
Chloroquine resistant strains of malaria can be expected and prophylaxsis must be provided for
anyone working for the project. Living and eating quarters must be protected from mosquitoes and
sleeping nets should also be provided to workers.
In addition to bilharzia and malaria, increases in other mosquito borne diseases such as
encephalitis and Rift Valley fever can occur. Clinics must be staffed by personnel experienced in the
diagnosis and treatment of these and other tropical diseases.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
Experience from other similar construction sites indicates that a large work force dominated
by single men will attract women to the area for purposes of commercial sex. This can lead to an
increase of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Of particular concern is an increase in the
incidence of HIV/AIDS. AIDS has already been reported to be increasing in the region, but at
relatively low rates. These rates will increase as laborers and truck drivers from urban areas where
AIDS prevalence is much higher come into the region as a result of the project.
The mitigation plan will take an aggressive approach to control the spread of STDs. The
plan will feature public health education programs (including sex education), control of informal
sector activities near the project site, and the distribution of condoms. Even with the most vigorous
campaign and safeguards, an increase in STDs resulting from the project is inevitable. Systematic
blood testing at the camp clinic is absolutely necessary, if the increase in AIDS is to be kept at a
51



minimum. The blood testing must be used for information purposes and not be used to dismiss
infected employees. Contractors should address employee health issues in their contract proposals.
Other Infectious Diseases
Intestinal diseases, hepatitis, respiratory diseases (including tuberculosis) and plague are
diseases that can occur in situations where a large work force is not provided with the proper
sanitary and work place facilities.
Contractor work camps will be maintained in a clean and healthy condition as proscribed by
international worker health standards. Human waste will be treated properly and disposed of by the
existing camp sewerage system which will be maintained in good working order. A clean and
protected water supply is already in use. Kitchen wastes will be burned, buried or taken off site, to
prevent a large rodent population and the breeding of disease carrying flies and other insects. Health
education will include the proper handling and storage of food stuffs, and all living quarters and
work places will be adequately ventilated to prevent respiratory diseases. Workers would be
screened for tuberculosis.
Substance Abuse
A large construction labour force comprised primarily of young men living away from
families, relatively stable wages and idle time with few recreational pursuits and no domestic
responsibilities can often lead to the overindulgence with alcohol. This can lead to abuse, fighting
and injury, particularly if women are involved. Men who live in the area but who work on the site
may abuse the use of alcohol, return home in an inebriated state and abuse and injure family
members, and generally cause a good deal of domestic upheaval.
The problems of alcohol abuse must be explained to workers as a part of the health
education program. Recreational areas are available at the camp and additional activities should be a
normal part of camp living. Severe penalties for drunkenness and disorderly behaviour must be
given out along with the provision of counselling services for substance abuse.
6.3.6 Communication Facilities
The loss of a section of Highway #7 will occur as a result of the reservoir. No other major
roadways will be affected. The creation of the reservoir will elimninate the boat routes across the
river which local people use for access to markets, family and friends.
Highway #7 will be re-routed and new pathways established to make sure that no human
populations are cut off from access to the new road. The Ethiopian Road Authority is planning to
upgrade Highway #7 and will assume all the responsibilities for the necessary construction for the
new road sections. The authority is in the process of preparing new environmental standards and
requirements for road work and these will be employed for the work on Highway #7.
52



6.3.7 Social Services
An increase of workers to the area will place additional pressure on social and cultural
facilities. Of particular concern will be the pressure placed on health and medical facilities. The
construction camp will provide health services for the work force community.
6.3.8 Economic Development
The upgrading of Highway #7 will add to the economic development of Jimma and
Asendabo. The increased movement of goods to the project site through the cities and towns along
the route will spur secondary economic development since vehicles will require service, parts and
fuel en route.
6.3.9 Gender Issues
Little information is available in the project area on specific women's issues. A number of
impacts are anticipated, based on experiences from other similar development projects in the world.
The following are some of the potential impacts, many of which relate to the resettlement
programme, but these should be evaluated specifically for the Gilgel Gibe project.
*  relocation disrupts the family unit as men often migrate to areas of large infrastructure projects
to seek employment and forcing women to assume additional domestic responsibilities at home;
*  cash compensation often does not benefit women since they have little or no control over it;
*  relocation can mean the loss of an existing job or a means of gaining an income;
*  relocation can mean the loss of certain types of food to the diet;
*  formal and informal social networks often have to be reconstructed;
.  women are often used on construction sites as unskilled labour and often without health
precautions or insurance which are available to men;
*  women are usually paid less than men for the same work;
*  stable disbursements of unaccustomed amounts of money to newly employed husbands
sometimes leads the men to prostitution and associated health problems, substance abuse which
can lead to physical harm to women and children;
*  when women join the labour force a lifestyle can be lost;
*  if women work they are vulnerable to a number of health problems as a result of overwork and
stress.
53



To mitigate some of these potential problems, program planning must take into account
consideration for women. Employment programs should promote the equal treatment of women.
Educational and skills training programmes should be made available equally to both men and
women. While the resettlement plan sets aside funds to address individual family hardships, a
similar program should be made available to women who are not part of the resettlement program
but are employed by the project or are married to a construction worker.
6.4 Institutional Environment
People being resettled originate from four weredas (Kersa, Sekoru, Omonada and Tiro
Afeta). Two weredas will be losing population and land while two will gain. The loss of people will
affect the economy of the weredas and to some degree it will probably also affect the social and
institutional network of the weredas.
7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
The purpose of the environmental management plan is to describe in the detail possible the
actions that have been taken or will be taken to ensure that the impacts which have been identified
are mitigated to the extent feasible. Where impacts cannot be mitigated, compensation programs
will be designed, as well as any environmental enhancement activities that will be required to offset,
where possible, those impacts that cannot be mitigated. This plan will also provide estimated costs
where feasible and a schedule for implementation. For the most part, responsibility for
implementing the plan will rest with EELPA or EELPA's contracted representatives unless noted
otherwise. To a considerable degree, construction contractors will be responsible for implementing
mitigation measures but the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that environmental and social
protection elements are being carried out properly rests with EELPA or their legally constituted
agents. Thus the schedule for some of the mitigation is linked to the allocation of construction
contracts. EELPA is currently taking actions to increase their capacity to implement and monitor
the environmental and social protection parts of this plan. EPA will collaborate with EELPA by
providing review, advice and policy guidance. Financing for the mitigation plan, including
resettlement, will be guaranteed by EELPA and the Govemment of Ethiopia.
Most of the impacts which occur during the construction phase can be reduced or avoided
through the application of sound construction management guidelines. Construction contracts will
require all qualified bidders to include environmental management plans as a part of their submitted
bids. The additional costs of these plans can not be predicted at this time, but they are considered
an integral part of total project costs.
Some impacts will be permanent and cannot be mitigated. Many of the impacts that will
occur as a result of the reservoir fall into this group. In some cases, these impacts will be
compensated, or enhancement activities will be put into place that will offset their effects.
Enhancement is an important part of the overall management plan as it is used to improve existing
environmental conditions, restrict any likely environmental degradation (which is not directly
related to the project) in the future, and it can form a part of compensatory measures.
54



The management plan, outlined below, takes into account the impacts identified and
described in the previous section and where some mitigation measures have been defined. There
are two key elements, one physical and the other institutional, of the management plan which cut
across many of the identified environmental and social issues. The project includes a relatively large
buffer zone to be established at the reservoir perimeter. This zone will be uninhabited and basically
free of intensive human use. This buffer zone will greatly reduce the impacts in erosion,
sedimentation, environmental health, and wildlife habitat. The buffer zone will not be fenced so that
wildlife can move freely in and out of the area. Only certain areas of the project area will be fenced
for security or to protect the public from harm. These areas would include the dam site,
powerhouse, tailrace and electrical equiment. In terms of schedule, action on the buffer zone will
be coincident with with the first movement of the people to the resettlement area. The cost for the
expropriation of dwellings, barns, crops and improvements is approximately US$ 950,000. These
costs have been programmed into the resettlement budget and have been partially disbursed.
The second major element is the creation of an environmental management unit within
EELPA which will be posted at the project site and will report to project management and to
EELPA headquarters. This unit will be staffed prior to release of bid documents and will be
charged with implementing the environmental management plan and ensuring contractor
compliance with their proposed environmental management proposals. The unit will be empowered
to advise financial sanctions for contractor non-compliance through project management. The unit
will be staffed to handle both environmental and social issues. This unit has been created in July,
1997 as a part of the GGHP project management. Capital costs to establish offices and equipment
at the construction site will be approximately US$ 50,000 and the recurrent costs of operation will
be approximately US$ 10,000 per year.
The general terms of reference for the Environmental Management Unit are as follows:
The Environmental Management Unit (EMU) will be initially staffed by three people. One
person will handle the biophysical aspects of the project. This person should have a technical
degree in environmental or natural resource sciences. Experience with hydropower construction is
desirable. Tasks for this person will include inter alia:
*  Monitor Contractor Compliance with environment protection issues with  systematic
inspections during construction;
* Monitor effectiveness of erosion control measures;
* Monitor water quality through a systematic sampling program using portable field kits;
* Monitor for presence of waterweeds, mainly water hyacinth, in a weekly program of reservoir
inspection after dam closure;
* Monitor impacts on wildlife in the buffer zone above and below the dam;
* Submit weekly reports to project management regarding environmental conditions of the
construction site and subsequently the reservoir and buffer zone area;
* Determine with EPA which threshold values in the water quality monitoring program should be
reported to EPA for further action.
55



A second EMU member will be primarily concerned with social issues relating to the project.
This person should have a degree in social sciences, preferably sociology or anthropology.
Experience in agricultural extension would be an acceptable subsitute.Tasks for this person will
include, inter aha:
*  Provide liaison with local communities near the project site;
*  Supervise or conduct environmental health education program and public safety program;
* Monitor resettlement community working with the Resettlement Planning Unit of the Oromia
Regional Government;
* Conduct periodic surveys through interviews or questionnaires of the resettled population and
the host community;
* Monitor Contractor compliance with health and safety standards at the project site;
* Work with local NGOs;
* Submit weekly reports to project management with copies to the Resettlement Planning Unit.
The third EMU staff member is not seen as a long-term member of the team, at least at this
point. This person will be concern with botanical (primarily forestry issues). It is envisioned that
this person will be seconded to the EMU from the Ministry of Agriculture or Ministry of
Environment. It is expected that this person would have a degree in forestry or botany. The tasks
for this person will include, inter alia;
- Monitor clearing of the reservoir zone by the clearing subcontractor;
*  Establish a small nursery at the construction area;
* Collect and maintain plant propagules from natural vegetation for subsequent planting;
* Evaluate natural vegetation in the downstream buffer area
- Assist the environmental person in monitoring contractor compliance and erosion control;
* Prepare weekly reports for project management during the clearing period and monthly reports
after the clearing has been completed.
The EMU has been created as a unit of EELPA and will be assigned to the Gilgel Gibe
Hydroelectric Project. At present, only the environmental scientist has been appointed and EELPA
will recruit the social scientist as soon as possible to work with the Resettlement Planning Unit.
The unit will report directly to GGHP project management and to EELPA management if
requested.
In terrns of scheduling for the mitigation plan, the buffer area has been defined and will
become active as soon as the affected population is relocated. The EMU unit has been created. The
remainder of the mnitigation measures will be controlled by the implementation schedule of the
construction contracts.
Specific components and guiding standards of the management plan are discussed below in
the same categories used for describing the likely or potential impacts. The overall estimated costs
are provided at the end of the section.
56



7.1 Physical Environment Impacts
7.1.1 Climate
Any change in climate is likely to be insignificant except at the microclimate level near the
reservoir. Most of the microclimate changes are considered to be positive. The buffer zone will
keep these microclimate changes from affecting human populations. No mitigation costs have been
assigned to this category.
7.1.2 Hydrology
The operation of the reservoir will affect natural flows downstream with the most significant
effects felt in the first 16 km of the river. Without compensation flows, the river reach downstream
would remain dry for 4-6 months each year when the dam would not be spilling water. A
compensation flow is part of the mitigation plan. This flow released from the dam will be at least
equal to the low flow of the river (0.128 m3/s). This release will be augmented by the uncontrolled
flow of the Chilelo tributary approximately one km below the dam. The effects of the reduced flow
will be evaluated by the EMU with technical assistance from EPA. Any change recommended in
the amenity flow would be subjected to a cost/benefit analysis. No human population would be
affected in this first stretch of the river as it is uninhabited and will remain that way because of the
buffer zone.
Considering the low water levels of the river during the long season, a increased release of
1.0 m3/s may be considered for maintaining the downstream ecosystem. EELPA, as operator of the
power station and dam will be responsible for the maintenance of the compensatory flow. A dry
season channel must be present, so that the released water is not immediately lost after being
discharged, but can flow freely downstream section of the river. The channel configuration will be
evaluated at the same time the ecological effects are studied.
The dam will have a pronounced effect on the appearance of Deneba Falls. A compensation
flow of I m3/s will produce a noticeable flow but the visual attraction of the falls will be severely
compromised. The river works must involve the dry season channel section near the drop as well as
the upper overflow edge. The mist from the falls provides a distinct microclimate and this is
reflected by the vegetation which grows near the falls. The evergreen trees are profusely covered
by epiphytic plants which will not grow as abundantly when the flow over the falls is reduced.
7.1.3 Geology and Geomorphology
During the construction phase, the following mitigative measures should be implemented to
minimize erosion problems that may occur at the different construction sites.
Removal of vegetation above the reservoir FSL must be kept to a minimum and any removal
should be carried out manually to prevent erosion caused by machinery and the reservoir
perimeter must be clearly marked prior to clearing to prevent any accidental removal of
vegetation;
57



* Where necessary, reservoir banks should be graded to reduce erosion and slumping potential;
*  Construction equipment used outside the reservoir zone should be of a type that will cause
minimum damage to soils with low bearing capacity;
*  Topsoils should be stripped and stockpiled for rehabilitation once the construction in an area
has been completed;
*  Removal of vegetation in areas sensitive to erosion should be carried out manually;
*  Clearing of vegetation should be limited to rights-of-way and reservoir zone;
*  Disturbed banks should be graded and stabilised and, if possible, vegetation should be restored;
*  Once a borrow area is no longer required, its slopes should be reduced and rehabilitated with
stockpiled topsoil; stabilising structures should be installed to provide effective drainage into
natural watercourses.
These requirements will be stated in the contractor's environmental management plan and
the costs of implementing these protective measures will be included in the contract costs.
7.1.4 Sedimentation
Sediments that will be generated during the construction phase will be insignificant and
normal construction practices will be sufficient to mitigate any threat of sedimentation. After dam
closure, the sediment load of the river will be greatly reduced owing to the efficiency of the
reservoir as a sediment trap. The modification of the sedimentary regime of the Gilgel Gibe River
downstream of the dam site after dam closure is an inherent part of the project that can not be
mitigated.
The sedimentation of the reservoir itself can only be mitigated through integrated watershed
management. This is difficult to achieve and impractical on a catchment area of more than 4,225
kM2. A co-ordinated plan for the protection of the Gilgel Gibe watershed should be considered as a
co-operative effort between the Ministry of Agriculture, EELPA and non-government
organisations.
7.1.5 Water Quality
During the construction phase, water quality will be effected to a small degree from
construction generated erosion and pollution.
With the objective of mitigating the effects resulting from the preparation of the area and its
subsequent flooding, appropriate interventions will have to be made with the aim of avoiding
58



negative effects on the waters of the planned reservoir due to submersion of the vegetation of the
savannah areas and the riparian formations (about 50 km2 at full service level).
A high level of nutrients will be produced in the reservoir as a result of the presence of large
quantities of decomposing vegetation in an environment that is slow to change, has a low oxygen
content and a low level of turbulence. This could provide the phenomena of anoxia near the bottom
with subsequent production of H2S, together with a significant increase in acidity. The phenomena
of anoxia in the basin would have an immediate (although temporary) effect on the invertebrates
present, while the increase in acidity could cause damage to the turbines.
It is be necessary to remove the large woody vegetation (> 3m in height) that grows below
the full supply level of the reservoir (1,671 m.a.s.l.). The cost of this mitigation would partially be
offset by the sale of the timber to be removed. Since the clearing will be part of the civil works
contract, it is not possible to predict the amount of the bid.
7.2 Natural Environment Impacts
7.2.1 Vegetation
The following measures will be implemented during construction to minimize impacts on
vegetation:
- Inform construction workers of the importance of protection of the environment including
vegetation and wildlife habitat;
-  Take all necessary precautions to prevent fires; construction contracts will include normal
provisions for fire prevention;
* EELPA will exert control to prevent encroachment into nearby forests by workers in search of
timber and fuel wood.
The riparian forest lost due to the project is approximately 300 ha. Forestry and other
extension activities (e.g. community forestry, pasture land development, on-farm fodder tree
plantation establishment) in the watershed would yield important benefits for both the project and
the region. Such a program would not only compensate for lost resources but it would also
enhance the local environrent. It would provide and protect wildlife habitats, protect watersheds,
provide a sustainable supply of forest resources for local uses, and contribute to the fight against
global warrming. Revegetation will be carried out using local varieties that develop rapidly on poor
soils, such as those present on the borders of the planned reservoir (e.g. Albizzia schimperiana and
Morus mezogrisa). At present, the Oromia Region does not experience acute fuelwood shortages
throughout the region, but such an approach could help to maintain the regions relative prosperity
in fuelwood sources.
59



7.2.2 Fish
The loss of fish habitat downstream will be partially mitigated through the provision of
compensation flows. The overall loss of fish production will be mitigated through the reservoir
fishery. Such a fishery would require a research component to determine the most suitable species
and management regime for the newly created environment. At present, there is no clear demand
from local people for management of a reservoir fishery. EELPA reservoir use policies permit
artisanal fishing on their reservoirs.
7.2.3 Wildlife (Birds and Mammals)
The creation of the reservoir will remove 60 km2 of agricultural land and terrestrial wildlife
habitat. This loss can be replaced with a vegetated buffer area around the reservoir. To facilitate
the re-establishment of fauna in the buffer area, the clearance of the vegetation from the area to be
occupied by the reservoir should be carried out gradually, and in a planned way. The deforestation
operations should begin from the banks of the river, extend towards the margins of the proposed
reservoir, and move in an upstream direction.
The EMU will be delegated to enforce measures to protect wildlife and wildlife habitat.
Construction activities such as drilling, blasting, siting and operation of batching plants, disposal of
spoils and mucks, and the construction of quarries and access roads, will be well planned and will
be monitored by the EMU to ensure protection of wildlife.
There are not known to be any rare or endangered wildlife species that will be jeopardized
by the project. Although there may be a variety of wildlife species in the small area of riverine
forest, the more open areas are relatively void of wildlife.
In order to compensate for lost wildlife habitats, the forest adjoining the proposed reservoir
will be enhanced and, if necessary, some of the existing areas of forest would be designated as
special areas for wildlife protection.
Costs for revegetating the buffer zone to enhance wildlife benefits will be part of the
recurrent operating budget of the EMU. These costs are expected to be minimal since machinery
will be available to prepare nursery areas and to transport seedlings to selected sites within the
buffer zone.
7.3 Socioeconomic Impacts
7.3.1 Resettlement
Over the years, world experience with involuntary relocation programs associated with dam
construction has produced a number of basic criteria that have been tested. The following are
satisfied by the resettlement program:
* Quality of life of the population being resettled and those who will be the hosts of the
newcomers will not be compromised;
60



* The resettlement program is being adequately financed by the Government of Ethiopia through
the Oromia Regional Government to ensure that local commitment and that the newly occupied
resettlement land will be as productive as the land being vacated;
*  Support is being provided to ensure that settlers arrive in an inhabited area that does not
provoke a negative impact on the standard of living of the host population;
*  Both those to be resettled and the host community are actively participating in detailed
resettlement planning;
*  The transition period will not be longer than necessary, and during this period adequate and
suitable economic and social support will be provided;
*  The area selected for resettlement is as close as possible to the areas being left;
*  Resettlement planning has ensured that communities and social/cultural groups are kept intact.
  The resettlement site was evaluated for environmental suitability during the site selection
process. A separate EA report for the site was not deemed necessary.
-  A schedule for resettlement has been established.
Homes and infrastructure
Homes will be reconstructed by the affected people with financing sufficient to achieve a
standard equivalent to or higher than the homes being abandoned;
Adequate infrastructure, including roads, bridges, clinics, schools and religious buildings will
be provided to ensure that the affected people have a higher level of services that are currently
available in the area to be abandoned. Infrastructure improvements to the resettlement area have
already commenced.
There was open dialogue with the affected population regarding the reconstruction of
dwellings and barns. The population is being presented with two options. One option is to have the
Resettlement Unit contract construction of homes for each household after offering the people with
several design alternatives. The second option is to compensate the people and have them arrange
for their own construction on their site. The latter option was selected by GOE.
Host area
Impacts of resettlement in the host area have been considered. Erosion and deforestation in
the host area are two of the major potential impacts that have been addressed. Construction
activities for roads and other infrastructure, and fuel gathering by the settlers, will not lead to
deforestation and further soil erosion.
61



The Resettlement Unit is preparing plans for drainage and the contract for this work will be
let soon. Financing for this work has been placed in the resettlement budget and funds have been
dispersed for preliminary work at the site.
7.3.2 Resettlement Plan - An Outline
The area to be claimed by the project is part of 18 Kebele farmers associations and these
associations are located in four wereda administrations of the Jimma Zone. The weredas affected
are Tiro Afeta, Sokoru, Omonada and Kersa. The resettlement area is within the latter two
weredas and the area is similar to the area being left.
The population represented by the households to be displaced will be resettled and
compensated under the Constitution of Ethiopia and by Civil Code.
For the population to be displaced a comprehensive inventory of economic status, social and
cultural background, and ethnicity has been carried out and is being up-dated. The immovable
property of each household has been assessed and registered. Compensation for lost property has
been determined by committee and each property for which compensation will be provided has
been valued at replacement cost. Another survey will be necessary to evaluate the changes caused
by the reduction of the buffer zone area. The number of people to be relocated will not increase as
a result of the change, but it may also not decrease as much as expected because some of the
people may still elect to be relocated.
Zone, wereda administration and peasant association members, community leaders, women
and youth have all taken part in the population and property assessment as well as in the selection
of the resettlement site.
Taking into account the needs of the people to be relocated, a group comprised of the
Jimma Zone Administration identified three suitable sites for resettlement and decided upon one
site which was subsequently accepted by the population being resettled. The site selected is within
Omonada and Kersa weredas. The other sites were rejected due to either distance of relocation or
previous occurrence of rinderpest in the areas.
The area to be resettled is 8,109 ha in size and is agriculturally and socially suitable. The
area is sufficient in size to accommodate the new population and the host community is of similar
socio-economic, ethnic (Oromo), linguistic and religious background.
The resettlement area has good access to Jimma, Asendabo, Serbo, Sorkoru and Nada.
Public services are already available in the vicinity but additional facilities such as health centres,
potable water facilities, veterinary centre, mosques and a church are budgeted for in the
resettlement plan. The host population, as well as the population being resettled, will benefit from
these additional facilities.

A separate resettlement implementation project office has been organised under the Oromia
Government and will be accountable to a supervising committee chaired by the vice president of
the Oromia Government. The project office will be responsible for carrying out the following:
* disbursement and utilisation of funds
* preparation of arrival site and construction of infrastructure
* operation and maintenance of project infrastructure
* provision of agricultural advice and assistance
* provision of counciling to resettlers
* preparation of programmes and timetable for expropriation of immovable properties
* compensation payments
* transportation of population to new area
* preparation of progress reports
The resettlement implementation office will ensure that the relocated population is properly
re-established and has attained the required level of production and living standards.
Transmission Line Resettlement
The Resettlement Planning Unit will begin preparing a resettlement plan for the people who
have encroached on the transmission line. Since the transmission line is within the Oromia Region,
it is a natural province of the planning unit. The planning unit will follow the same format as taken
for the project area affected population, beginning with a census and socioeconomic survey of the
people within the transmission line right-of-way.
Production System
An agricultural suitability analysis was conducted by the zonal committee. A soil survey of
the area will be conducted to provide the basis for determining optimum land use and best
agricultural practices, including the use of fertilizers. A vocational training programme will be
developed in association with the agricultural development program. Farmer associations will be
formed and an agricultural investment analysis will be conducted to provided a basis for sound
agricultural planning and production. Currently, through the Government of Ethiopia, a credit
facility is available for the purchase of fertilizers and seed.
Monitoring
The resettlement plan includes a unit for monitoring income restoration and the social
impacts that may occur as a result of resettlement. The work of this unit will be monitored by
EELPA's EMU.
63



Resettlement Costs
The estimated cost of the resettlement plan is $US 10,060,906.00 including costs for
relocating the road and the telephone line. . Costs for specific programs are given in Tables A20,
A21 and A22 in the appendix. A brief summary of the costs specifically for relocating people are as
follows:
Resettlement Costs (rounded in US$)
Planning                      11,000
Resettlement                  733,550
Expropriation                3,687,800
Monitoring and Counseling       8,000
Additional Mitigation          152,000
Total                         4,592,350
7.3.3 Health
Infectious Water-borne Diseases
Mitigation for increase of infectious diseases are as follows:
* Direct control of the proliferation of vectors will be carried out by the EMU;
* Sanitary control of the resident and transitory population (workforce at the site and the
population gathering around them);
*  Careful management of human waste;
* Snail populations, will be partially controlled through the removal of the macrophytic riparian
habitat by the EMU;
*  In order to limit new sources of infection, the following steps will be taken:
.Use of local workers as much as possible;
.Medical screening of the work force
.Basic camp health service to provide continuous information regarding prevention of the
main infectious diseases;
.During both the construction and operational phases, periodic surveys of the vectors
responsible for infections will be conducted by the EMU over the entire area, involving local
health services;
.Periodic screening at the health clinic will be carried out on samples of the resident
population to evaluate any cases of infection.
64



* Buffer area around the reservoir will be established.
STDs
STDs can not be totally prevented. To minimize their incidence, informal sector
development in proximity to the construction site will be regulated. Workers will be provided with
health education lectures and free condoms will be made available.
Other Infectious Diseases and Other Diseases
Sanitary conditions of the camp will be developed and maintained to international standards
for construction camps. Human waste will be managed using proper disposal and treatment
facilities that will be located in such a way as to ensure that seepage does not occur. Kitchen
wastes will be disposed of in a proper manner (incineration, burial or taken off site and disposed of
in sanitary landfill sites) to prevent the proliferation of rodents, flies and other disease carrying
insects.
Proper facilities for washing and bathing are provided for the work force. All work and
living areas will be properly ventilated to prevent respiratory diseases including tuberculosis. All
workers will be tested for tuberculosis.
Substance Abuse
Educational sessions for the workers regarding alcohol abuse will be conducted. Penalties
for over use will be set, advertised to the workers and will be enforced.
Occupational Health
Comprehensive occupational health standards established by the Government of Ethiopia
will be followed and the contractor will be held responsible for full implementation.
Public Safety
All construction sites will be well sign posted, warning both workers and the general public
of danger to their safety. All vehicles will be equipped with audio and visual safety warning
systems. Suitable speed limits will be posted and enforced and all vehicles will be in top mechanical
condition. The local communities will be given safety lectures. All construction sites, and project
sites following construction (e.g. dam, tunnel) will be protected from public access. A buffer area
around the dam will be off limits to the general public.
7.3.4 Access
The reservoir will cause the flooding of a number of sections of the road which links Addis
Ababa with Jimma. Two alternative proposals for a new road have been suggested. However, an
environmental assessment for the alignment and construction of a new road will be conducted by
65



the Ethiopian Road Authority. There appears to be little to choose, environmentally, between the
two alternatives.
The socioeconomic importance of the regional centre of Asendabo will not be compromised.
The isolation to which the town would be subjected if the road is diverted around it would have
considerable effect on the social aspects of the surrounding territory, particularly the role that
Asendabo plays as a regional market centre.
The presence of the reservoir will create a barrier for those who regularly move from the left
bank to the opposite side weekly for marketing purposes in Asendabo, Deneba and Sekoru.
Alternate means of access will be provided to the populations not relocated. The access planning
will depend on the final selection of the realignment of Highway #7.
7.3.5 Gender Issues
There are a number of potential gender issues as listed in section 6.3.9 and these will have
to be examined specifically as they relate to the project and will have to be addressed accordingly.
The awareness of the gender issues is the necessary first step in correcting the serious problems.
The Oromia Regional Government will assume responsibility of addressing gender issues. Hiring
practices of the contractor are subject to Ethiopian Law which promotes complete equality. There
is little experience in dealing proactively with gender issues, especially with large infrastructure
projects. The GOE will look to international donors for guidance in this area.
