and assesses five negative environmental\n            impacts likely to result from preparing, constructing, and\n            operating the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project. These are\n            identified on the basis of their intensity, area covered\n            and/or size of human population affected as: 1) Dislocation\n            of people -those who reside within the reservoir area and\n            those who live outside of the area to be flooded and who\n            rely on lands within and outside of the reservoir area- is\n            mitigated by a comprehensive resettlement plan. 2)\n            Intensification of diseases linked to water -malaria,\n            onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis- and of sexually\n            transmitted diseases, is mitigated by building a buffer\n            around and deepening the margins of the reservoir; and\n            providing health education; preventing shanty town\n            development near construction camps; providing separate\n            dwellings within the camp for men and women; and\n            distributing free condoms. 3) Loss of food production due to\n            the permanent loss of agricultural lands may be alleviated\n            by more intensive agriculture and improved livestock\n            management, and bringing fallow land into production. 4)\n            Loss of biodiversity, specifically, the loss of riverine\n            forest and water flows, which fauna and flora rely on as\n            their habitat, generally cannot be mitigated. However,\n            forest can be established elsewhere to replace total biomass\n            loss, and the reservoir will develop its own ecological\n            system over time. Recommended is formal protection of the\n            forested valley between the dam and the tailrace to ensure\n            that this area's riverine forest is protected. 5) The\n            loss of downstream aquatic habitat can be partially\n            mitigated by providing a compensation flow, a consideration\n            to be weighed against lost hydropower. Other potential and\n            less disruptive impacts are envisioned as humidity rise,\n            change in water quality in the reservoir and downstream,\n            shoreline dumping, reservoir sedimentation and flushing, and\n            eutrophication. Recommendations for alleviation include:\n            water management through a release program, containing\n            pollutants, stabilizing the shoreline with suitable\n            vegetative species, reducing soil erosion with watershed\n            management, and removing large plants before the reservoir\n            is filled to prevent nutrient overload."}, "docdt": "1997-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
