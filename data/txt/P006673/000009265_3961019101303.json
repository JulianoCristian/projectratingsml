The\n            project will improve external efficiency by: 1) establishing\n            a curriculum planning and evaluation unit to reformulate the\n            subject-based curriculum, for both the scientific-humanistic\n            and technical-vocational secondary schools; 2) developing\n            evaluation capacity to monitor the consistency between the\n            recommended and the learned curriculum; 3) establishing\n            alternative curricular activities for socially and\n            educationally at-risk secondary students; 4) providing\n            incentives to strengthen the linkages between targeted\n            technical-vocational schools and the private sector in\n            curriculum development, skill certification, in-service\n            teacher training, and the use of physical facilities. The\n            project will improve quality, equity, and internal\n            efficiency by: 1) providing in-service teacher training to\n            change the predominantly one-dimensional teaching format\n            based mainly on rote learning and dictation, to more\n            interactive methods; 2) establishing a fund to promote the\n            design and implementation of school-based educational\n            development projects; and 3) providing educational resources\n            in a targeted manner. Finally, the project will also include\n            components to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity."}, "docdt": "1995-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
