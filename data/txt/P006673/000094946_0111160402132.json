     world Bank performance is adjudged as satisfactory while\n            Borrower satisfaction is regarded as highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: During project\n            preparation to the appraisal stage, there is a need to\n            combine supply (State) and demand-driven (market )\n            interventions, gauge timely (appropriate) project\n            implementation, include proper targeting criteria and\n            performance indicators at the onset of project\n            implementation, and use a flexible project design. During\n            project implementation, ensure enabling conditions, pilot\n            and evaluate before taking to scale, staff to build robust\n            institutions, set up an appropriate legal and regulatory\n            framework, build learning systems, ensure ownership at the\n            outset of project implementation, arrange for appropriate\n            dissemination and cross-fertilization, put in place a timely\n            conceived exit strategy, and provide continuity in project\n            management and supervision. At project completion, there is\n            a need to continuously and consistently address pending\n            issues in the education sector. For example, despite project\n            efforts and investments, some inequities worsened throughout\n            the life of the project, mainly due to exogenous factors\n            benefiting private-paid secondary schools (outside the\n            project's interventions) over the municipal and private\n            subsidized ones. This points out that project objectives\n            still need to be achieved after completion."}, "docdt": "2001-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
