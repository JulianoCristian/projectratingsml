sustainability is un-evaluable;\n            institutional development impact is high; overall Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and overall Borrower\n            performance is satisfactory. The following lessons may be\n            derived from this project. First, the success of the project\n            indicates that, in order to effectively respond to natural\n            disasters such as drought, there are two principal\n            requirements: (a) there needs to be a structure in place at\n            the local level through which the relevant government\n            departments and non-governmental actors can meet speedily to\n            address the situation and coordinate their actions; (b) that\n            body needs to have some resources, not necessarily\n            substantial, to fund initial measures to address the\n            identified problems, so that response is not delayed by the\n            need to obtain resources through normal bureaucratic\n            channels. Second, the statement of project objectives is\n            important. Care should be taken by both the Bank and the\n            Borrower to ensure that the objective statement is clear and\n            does not become blurred by vaguely stated goals. This is\n            especially important when, for example, though the project\n            may be broadly targeted to assist the poor, the nature of\n            its interventions is such that it will be difficult to\n            demonstrate whether it has met a specific poverty objective.\n            Third, in operations like this one, it is important to\n            design, at the outset, performance indicators to track\n            qualitative as well as quantitative progress on achievement\n            of objectives, or to agree at the outset on specific steps\n            to monitor performance in meeting qualitative objectives."}, "docdt": "2005-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
