     Management Project for Kenya was satisfactory with likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development impact\n            and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and the\n            Borrower. The components remained the same throughout the\n            implementation period, however the drought management\n            component was enhanced at the mid term review with the rapid\n            response fund at the district level.  The project, through\n            its approach to addressing the risk and vulnerability of the\n            arid lands populations, achieved its objective of building\n            the capacity of communities to better cope with drought.\n            Lessons learned include the following.  Risks can be managed\n            and the livelihoods of vulnerable, populations living in\n            drought prone areas can be improved, through an effective\n            drought management system (containing decentralized\n            planning, decision making, financing and implementation\n            system at district level, supported by a responsive and well\n            coordinated national body).  The strengthening of district\n            level multi-sectoral institutions can significantly improve\n            the effectiveness of project interventions on the ground.\n            Capacity building is an important investment and should\n            include all key project actors and be carried out on a\n            continuous basis. Broader access to social services in the\n            arid lands can only be achieved by strengthening communities\n            and supporting actors to provide appropriate and\n            cost-effective facilities.  Project support of women's\n            income generating activity groups should continue and be\n            further expanded."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
