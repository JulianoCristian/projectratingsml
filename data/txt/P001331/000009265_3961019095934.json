    security in the arid districts of Turkana, Marsabit,\n            Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Samburu, and\n            the arid divisions of Baringo District; and 2) conserve the\n            natural resource base in the arid lands (ALs) through: (a)\n            improving crop and livestock resilience to drought; (b)\n            increasing economic linkages with the rest of the economy;\n            and (c) improving basic health services, water supply and\n            other social services. The project will have the following\n            components: 1) drought management, which includes\n            preparedness (drought monitoring), mitigation (drought\n            contingency planning and rapid reaction) and recovery\n            (continued drought relief activities); 2) marketing and\n            infrastructure, which will address the bottlenecks that\n            impede livestock market linkages between the ALs and the\n            rest of the national economy; and 3) economy development,\n            which will be instrumental in assisting line ministries and\n            collaborating agencies to adapt their organization and\n            delivery systems to the specific conditions of the ALs."}, "docdt": "1995-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
