The national technical\n            assistance component would finance: (a) studies of the\n            organization of the sector and the reordering of\n            institutions, financial policies, including a system of\n            finance, tariffs and cost recovery; community promotion; and\n            training requirements; (b) an inventory of technologies and\n            technical standards; (c) the preparation of state investment\n            plans; (d) special assistance to ten Northeast states for\n            project preparation including implementing community\n            participation programs; and (e) equipment. The component\n            would also finance special assistance to the emergency water\n            works included in the Northeast's Small Farmer Program\n            (PAPP) to be financed by proposed rural development\n            projects. The pilot project would support the above\n            objectives by testing and evaluating the delivery of services."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
