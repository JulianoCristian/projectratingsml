The project consists of\n            three components. The policy support component supports\n            development of a legal and regulatory framework. The\n            infrastructure development component provides technical\n            assistance, equipment and facilities investments to\n            establish and strengthen the securities depository,\n            registry, clearing and settlement facilities. Finally, the\n            public awareness component provides technical assistance to\n            devise, develop and execute a mass media public awareness\n            campaign. The campaign seeks to improve the general\n            public's understanding of the capital markets and of\n            their role and rights as participants."}, "docdt": "1996-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
