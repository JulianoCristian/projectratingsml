It facilitated the economic transformation in\n            Croatia, and built the necessary operational, and regulatory\n            capacity to meet growing investment requirements in the\n            private sector. Sustainability however, differs among some\n            components: the Public Awareness component, will require\n            further financing to target the professional capital market\n            community; the Policy Framework component, led to the\n            creation of the Croatian Securities and Exchange Commission,\n            which achieved international recognition. Yet, additional\n            technical assistance financing needs to be provided; and,\n            the Securities Depositary Agency, created under the\n            Infrastructure component, is subject to an uncertain\n            sustainability. The key lessons focus on: 1) the expertise\n            of project management, which was developed within the\n            Project's Management Unit, was a key element, since its\n            core group of trained staff, now contributes to the work of\n            the Ministry of Finance; 2) the strong counterpart\n            commitment, and project ownership, reinforced by outside\n            expertise, proved decisive, and diligent in achieving\n            success; 3) the adequate project design defined simple\n            components, complementary to the policy reform program; and,\n            4) while political risks were high, evidence proves the\n            success of Croatia's capital markets."}, "docdt": "1999-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
