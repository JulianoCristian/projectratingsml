The project will\n            provide technical assistance and includes five components.\n            The institutional component will assist to: (a) strengthen\n            the capabilities of the Finance and Planning Ministry to\n            design, implement and monitor reforms in the public\n            enterprise sector; and (b) train staff. The privatization\n            and liquidation component will support the design of a\n            divestiture strategy and action program and initiate its\n            implementation. This will be achieved through the provision\n            of: (a) divestiture advisory services; (b) legal, accounting\n            and valuation services; and (c) specialized services to\n            identify and attract foreign investors' interest in\n            companies selected for divestiture. The public enterprise\n            performance improvement component will assist to: (a) devise\n            and implement a restructuring and performance improvement\n            program; and (b) improve the legal and institutional\n            arrangements governing the relations between the government\n            and public enterprises maintained in the state portfolio."}, "docdt": "1992-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
