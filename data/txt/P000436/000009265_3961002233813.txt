MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTRNATlIONAL DEVELOPMET ASSOCIATION
TO TIHE EXECJUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE
FOR A PRlVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Cape Verde for SDR3.1 million, the equivalent of US$4.2
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a privatization technical
assistance project.
2.           hIaclgomnd:  Cape Verde comprises 10 small islands with poor natural resources,
unfavorable climate conditions and a small domestic market. Despite these limitations, the country
achieved a strong record of economic growth since independence in 1975, with GDP average annual
growth of 5.7 percent in real terms in the 1980s. This performance deteriorated in 1989 and 1990
with the emergence of internal and external imbalances. One of the sources of these imbalances was
the poor economic and financial performance of public enterprises involved in manufacturing,
fisheries and productive services.
3.           The public enterprise sector consists of 32 enterprises, 21 of which are wholly state-
owned enterprises and 11 mixed economy companies. It employs over 6,400 persons, generates
about 25 % of GDP annually and accounts for 70% of industrial activity. Whereas in 1987, the
sector still contributed a large portion of government revenues, financial performance has deteriorated
significantly since then. From 1985 to 1989, the turnover of the public enterprises grew by 42% to
about US$200 million; while profitability decreased by 275%, with cumulative losses totalling more
than US$3.6 milion. Some enterprises have been sustained thanks only to increased credit from the
Bank of Cape Verde (BCV) which amounted to about US$40 million in 1990, or an increase of 86%
since 1985. Many enterprises have been unable to honor internal and external debt amortization and
interest obligations (foreign loans to public enterprises constitute one-half of Cape Verde's external
debt), thereby putting considerable pressure on Government's budget and/or threatening the health of
the BCV. In addition, state-owned enterprises receive over 40% of all foreign exchange allocations.
4.           The issues in public enterprise performance in Cape Verde include: involvement in
activities that are not viable, inappropriate macro policies (pricing, investments, labor, etc.); weak
institutional framework (Government/enterprise relations); and poor internal management (over-
staffing, inadequate cost control, high financing leverage, etc). The Government which took office in
April 1991, has made a commitment to improve the allocation of the national resources by shifting
towards a competitive market structure with a greater role for the private sector, including improving
the incentive system, decentralizing economic decision-making, etc. It has made reform of the public
enterprise sector a priority in its program and is keenly aware that success in this sector is likely to
have a major impact on public finances, the banking sector and the development of the private sector.
5.           The private sector in Cape Verde is dominant in agriculture and construction, and
actively involved in food production, commerce, personnel services, housing, fishing and some
manufacturing activities. The potential for further private sector development in Cape Verde is
charcteized by: (i) high basic literacy rate and relatively low cost of labor; (ii) stability of the



-2 -
exchange rate; (iii) negligible export barriers to other countries: (iv) potential for mobilization of local
household and emigrant savings; and (v) adequate foreign investment laws. In the first 12 months of
operation, Promex, an agency set up with the support of USAID to promote investments and exports,
received a total of 80 requests for information from potential investors from 10 different countries.
6.           The Government has already started to implement a number of reforms in the public
enterprise sector. It has liquidated two enterprises and sold its majority shareholding in a shoe-
manufacturing company to foreign investors. It has removed its monopoly on imports of most
consumer goods and foodstuff, and its monopoly on the insurance sector. It is presently engaged in
negotiations with private investors to sell a government-owned garment making factory, a drug
manufacturing company and a state fish;ng enterprise. It is also considering the privatization of a
number of activities of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, such as road maintenance. The
Government, however. is in need of assistance and has requested IDA both to help it in its efforts to
privatize as well as to implement other parts of the reform program.
7.           Froect Ojectives:  The major objectives of the proposed operation are to help
build the capacity of the Government of Cape Verde: (a) to design and implement a wide-ranging
public enterprise sector rationalization program; and (b) to begin to implement its policy of promoting
the private sector as the main vehicle for economic development.
8.           P,ect Descriptio:  The project was prepared on the basis of a diagnostic
assessment of the sector financed by USAID and would consist of the following five components:
(i) Institutional Development. This component would involve: (a) reorganizing and strengthening an
existing unit within the Finance and Planning Ministry to design and implement reforms in the public
enterprise sector, and to monitor the performance of the enterprises remaining in the Government's
portfolio; and (b) training of Finance and Technical Ministry staff involved in PE supervision;
(ii) Privatizaion and Liquidation. This component would provide assistance to the Government for
(a) the design of a privatization and liquidation strategy; and (b) initiating the implementation of a
divestiture action plan. In addition, a public relations campaign would be organized by the
Government to explain the objectives of the public enterprise reform and privatization program to the
general public, and to mobilize interest on the part of local and foreign investors; (iii) PE
Performance Improvement. This component would consist of furnishing advisory services to: (a)
help devise and implement a restructuring and performance improvement program for selected public
sector enterprises performing economically or socially strategic activities which may not lend
themselves to privatization under the project; and (b) improve the institutional arrangements
governing the relations between the Government and public enterprises maintained in the state
portfolio; (iv) Aomanying measures. The implementation of a program of improvement of the
productivity and efficiency of the public enterprises and of divestiture will likely lead to retrenchment
of excess or redundant staff in a narrow labor market. To facilitate the process, the project will
support the transfer of people from the public enterprises to the private sector through: (a) the
provision of advisory services to match the supply of labor created by reduction of staffing in the
restructured public enterprises and the demand for labor in the private sector, and to recommend an
action plan for promoting the creation of business enterprises by former PE employees; (b) the
provision of financial resources to promote the on-the-job retraining of retrenched PE staff recruited
by private employers; and (c) the financing of local private sector-operated, demand-driven, work-
oriented training workshops and evening courses for PE staff; and (v) Promotion of the private
sector. This component would consist of studies and advisory services to: (a) further review and
adapt the legal and business environment to make it more responsive to private sector development



needs, particularly its administratve implementation procedures; (b) design and/or refine the legal,
insttutional and regulatory framework required to open up additional sectors of the economy to
private sector initiative and induce competition (in such areas as drug import and distribution,
telecommunications and telecommunication-related information services, off-shore banking, ar.d
international maritime registration); and (c) to promote private sector development in areas offering
good prospects for growth and potential for export. No action or measure of any kind will be
directly or indirectly financed under the project with regards the tobacco manufacturing mixed
economy company.
9.           The project expected to be carried out over four years is estimated to cost US$4.2
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$3.4 million (72 percent). IDA would
finance 100 percent of foreign exchange costs and about 60 percent of local costs. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Cape Verde are given in Schedule C
anjT  respeziively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10542-CV dated May 14, 1992, is being
circulated separately.
10.          Proiect Imementation:  A reorganized Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization
(PERP) unit in the Ministry of Finance and Planning will be responsible for implementing the project
in close coordination with the other ministries involver'. This technical unit would work in close
collaboration with Promex. Promex is expected to be particularly useful in promoting and facilitating
the privatization of public enterprises. The Government has also decided to create a PE Sector
Rationalization Advisory Board (PESRAB), a high level advisory group, to advise the Minister of
Finance on all policy issues having an impact on the successful achievement of the PE Setor reform
and privatization program. Members of tis Advisory Board would come from the private and the
public sectors and shall be selected on the basis of their high qualifications and experience. The role
and responsibilities of the memberb of the PESRAB will be: (i) to provide policy guidance to the
Minister of Finance and Planning on the direction and pace of the PE rationalization program,
including the detailed divestiture proposals and the proposed programs for assistance to PEs; and (ii)
to advise the Minister of Finance and Planning on the conduct of the implementation of that program,
with a view of ensuring effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the process. The project would
be executed over four years.
11.          Poject SstainabilitH:  The Government has made a policy commitment to divest
itself of public enterprises to the extent feasible and recognizes that assistance is required not only to
fully develop a strategy and action plan, but also to establish an effective institutional capacity to
implement these reforms. The strong emphasis on capacity building through technical assistance and
training would ensure that actions required would continue to be carried out after project completion.
12.          IMons Learned:  The project is in response to the demonstrated commitment of
the Government to reforms in the PE sector which assures ownership of the project. The
Government does not want to embark on a reform program in the sector without adequate preparation
of a strategy and detailed action plans, a situation that has occurred in other Sahelian countries with
less than adequate results. Also, technical assistance is much more effective when provided in
conjunction with a reform program that has already been launched and to which Government is fully
committed.



-4-
13.          Rationale for IDA involvement:  Reducing the fiscal burden and improving the
efficiency of resource use by the PE sector are key elements fcr financial equilibrium and economic
growth in Cape Verde. The proposed project would help improve Cape Verde's financial situation
while allowing IDA to continue the dialogue on the need to 'attain a sound sustainable growth, with
high employment that will ensure social and economic justice', one of the principal objectives of the
new Government. The project will also help complement measures being undertaken through other
IDA projects involving key public enterprises, ministries and the banking sector, and lay the ground
for the proposed institutional development and management project.
14.          Agreed Actions:  A number of policy reforms have already been implemented, or
are under implementation, by the Government. Other agreed actions are contained in the
Government' Statement of Policy with regards to PE Sector Rationalization Program which endorses,
inter alia, the following principles: pursuit of the liberalization of the economy; management of PEs
by generally accepted private management norms and standards in the context of contractual relations
with the Government; phasing out, over time, of all direct and indirect subsidies to PEs that shall not
be privatized; absence, barring exceptional circumstances, of special privileges or measures
detrimental to fair competition (market protection, direct or indirect subsidies, Government financing)
granted to investors buying PEs. The Government has agreed that, as a condition of effectiveness,
the Director and professionnal staff of PERP would be selected. To ensure complete transparency in
the implementation of its privatization program, the Government has decided to set up an Advisory
roard (PESRAB), and to adopt a Procedures Manual by December 1992 governing the
implementation of its divestiture program. Creation of PESRAB, and appointment of its members, as
weIl as selection of an advisor to prepare the Procedures Manual, are conditions of effectiveness.
The Government has also decided to launch a public relations campaign by March 1993 aimed at
explaining the PE reform and privatization program to the general public and at mobilizing investors'
interest. Agreements have been reached on terms of reference for the operation of PERP and
PESRAB, and for the various technical assistance components. The adoption of a model consultancy
contract, acceptable to the Association, for the recruitment of consultants and advisors under the
project is a condition of effectiveness. Agreements have also been reached on a schedule for the
implementation of key actions under the project, and on the scope and content of the mid-term review
of the project which will be undertaken jointly by the Government and by IDA in October 1994.
14.          Environmental Issues:  This is a category UC" project as far as the environment is
concerned. It basically involves the financing of consultant services and training. An agreement has
been reached that the Government shall have an environmental audit carried out for those public
enterprises selected for privatization which have been classified by the Government's National Council
for the Environment as potentially hazardous for the environment, and that the Government would
take such measures as may be required in order to mitigate the potentially adverse environmental
impact of their activities. Funds for such audits are included in the proposed project. In addition, a
Country Environmental Strategy Paper (CESP) is under preparation which will help define an
environmental strategy for the country.
15.          Program objectives:  The project emphasis will be on the fc;lowing objectives: (i)
reduction of the fiscal burden of the sector; Qi) improvement of performance of the PE portfolio; and
(iii) development of privatc- seenr.



-5 -
16.          Benefits:  The project will assist a business-oriented Government at a criticil time in
the implementation of its liberalization program wbich is expected to reduce tha financial and
administrative burden on the Government and on the banking sector. Closing of uneconomic
enterprises would also save public resources. More importantly, the Government expects the renewal
of sound economic growth to be brought about by higher investment by the private sector,
particularly m export-oriented activities. The proposed project would help initiate and accelerate the
dialogue with private investors both locally and from abroad.
17.         EIUL&:  There is some risk of shortfalls in implementation of adequate macro-
economic policies and reforms warranted in the areas of trade, pricing, finance, and labor to set the
stage for the envisaged public enterprise reform. Secondly, as the operation involves broad-ranging
and complex reforms both at the sector and enterprise levels, there is a risk that vested interests
within Government and the affected enterprises will resist reform measures as these may imply
increasing PE autonomy and replacing some existing PE managers. Given the statements and positive
actions of the Government to date, these risks are not considered high. A third risk relates to the
privatization program. The financial situation of some of the enterprises, coupled with a small
domestic market may make them unattractive to private investors. Further, domestic capacity to
mobilize funds in favor of privatization may be limited. Given the recent experience with
privatization and the interest shown by both local and foreign investors, these risks are considered
acceptable. Finally, there is the risk that the implementation of the reform program may be slowed
down by the limited capacity of the Government administration to carry out the policy reform package
and to monitor the execution of enterprise restructuring programs. These risks are addressed through
the strengthening of an existing team in the -1inistry of Finance and Planning which will be in charge
of implementing he reforms, and the provision of technical assistance and consulting services to help
Cape Verdean institutions to carry out the tasks envisaged under the project.
18.          Recommendations:   I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.

PRIATtATION TECHMCAL ANSSISTANCE PROJECTr
NOT E ON SrATUS OF D$ 
Cape Verde - Primary Education UDfrading Project (Cr. 1853CV)
This project has experienced significant lags in disbursements due to: (i) delays in
construction of the Pedagogical Institute; (ii) non-completion of textbooks preparation/testing;
Ciii) delays in the initiation of studies; and, (iv) unfamiliarity of new project management with Bank
guidelines and procedures. A Bank supervision mission in February 1992 discussed and resolved
most of the issues. The contract for the construction of the Pedagogical Institute was signed on
April 29, 1992, and construction is expected to start in May 1992. The terms of reference for all
studies have now been prepared and agreed upon, and contracting of consultants is underway. A
Bank mission currently visiting Cape verde will agree on a new schedule and actions to strengthen
textbook preparation. Bank missions have been working closely with project management to bring
them up to speed. Disbursements are expected to pick up significantly in the coming months.
