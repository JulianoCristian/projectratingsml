project seeks to increase water use\n            efficiency and raise agricultural production and farm income\n            in Wadi Tuban through the use of modern inputs and improved\n            cultural practices. It provides for credit to cooperative\n            and state farms, construction of feeder roads, a village\n            water supply scheme and improved irrigation system; a water\n            management study; an agricultural policies study; and\n            technical assistance and training. The principal\n            beneficiaries would be 7,000 cooperative farm families\n            (36,000 persons) whose present income is well below the\n            poverty level; the project would help to increase their\n            income by about 63 percent in six years. The project faces\n            no special risks although delays in recruiting the\n            expatriate experts to assist in implementing the project\n            would result in a postponement of the benefits to a period\n            later than envisaged. Institution building objectives would\n            be achieved through technical assistance comprising\n            management support to the implementing agency and training\n            of its staff."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
