technology and to maximize the utilization of\n            existing facilities.  To this end the project will:  (i)\n            upgrade existing facilities to handle containers and\n            roll-on, roll-off traffic; (ii) rectify the subsidence of\n            the breakwater in Mogadishu; and (iii) construct container\n            freight stations.  Additionally, it will (iv) procure cargo\n            handling and other equipment and pallets; (v) construct and\n            equip workshops for the proper maintenance of equipment;\n            (vi) construct a Port Training School; and (vii) provide\n            technical assistance, training, and training equipment."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
