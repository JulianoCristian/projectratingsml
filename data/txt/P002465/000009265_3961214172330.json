The\n            overall performance of the project was moderate, performance\n            of the Banks was satisfactory, and the borrowers performance\n            during the implementation of the project in many respects\n            was deficient. Due to the outbreak of hostilities and the\n            deteriorating security situation in the country resulting in\n            the collapse of the Government of Somalia, the Bank\n            suspended all operations in December 1990 and disbursements\n            on March 15, 1991. Final disbursement took place on January\n            8, 1991, at which time the credit balance was undisbursed.\n            The Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) under a\n            parallel financing arrangement with the Government of\n            Somalia (GOS), financed the consulting engineering\n            supervision component of the project. The objectives of the\n            Port Modernization Project were to: (i) assist Somali Ports\n            Authority (SPA) to meet the changes in cargo handling\n            brought about by new shipping technology; and (ii) to\n            maximize the utilization of existing facilities. Lessons\n            learned are as follows: a project of this complexity\n            required varying levels and type of engineering\n            constructions skills and resources to enable successful\n            execution of the project. Additionally, the project required\n            the organizational capability and project management skills\n            to enable a contractor to perform at multiple sites. It also\n            required effective coordination and supervision by the\n            borrower and the Bank. Each of these factors was found to\n            have been deficient under this project. More attention must\n            be given to how the project is to be organized, managed, and\n            implemented by the borrower, its implementing agencies, and\n            supervision and follow-up by the Bank."}, "docdt": "1996-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
