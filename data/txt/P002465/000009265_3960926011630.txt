PORT t(ODERNIZATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUUARY
Borrower:          Somali Democratic Republic
Anount:             SDR 19.9 million (US$22.6 million equivalent)
Term:               Standard IDA terms
Re-jeading Term:  The credit will be on-lent to the Somali Ports Authority
(SPA) for a period of 15 years including five years
grace, at an interest rate of 12%. SPA will bear the
foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:     The Project's main objective is to assist SPA to meet
the changes in cargo handling brought about by new
shipping technology and to maximize the utilization of
existing facilities. To this end the Project would (i)
upgrade existing facilities to handle containers and
ro-ro traffic; (ii) rectify the subsidence of the
breakwater in Mogadishu; (iii) construct container
freight stations; (iv) procure cargo handling, pallets
and other equipment; (v) construct and equip workshops
for the proper maintenance of equipment; (vi) construct
a Port Training School; and (vii) provide technical
assistance and training.
roect Benefits
and Risks:       The main benefits would be a reduction in ship waiting
time and improved port performance. The improvement in
productivity will allow SPA to defer heavy investments
in additional berths until the year 2010. The main
risks are that the modest growth in traffic as forecast
or the increase in productivity targetted for the
Project will not materialize. These risks have been
taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.

1.01.     Somalia (637,000 km2) lies on the northeastern corner of Africa,
beroeen Ethiopia and Kenya on the west and south, and the Gulf of Aden and
the Indian Ocean on the north and east (Map IBRD 19505). Although Somalia
has one of the longest coastlines on the continent (3,200 km), there are
few natural harbors. The terrain is mostly plateau and steppe lands, and,
apart from some escarpments in the north, does not pose serious
difficulties for land transport. The arid and semi-arid climatic
conditions, however, make road construction and maintenance quite costly.
The areas more favored with rainfall, and therefore of most agricultural
potential, are the northwest and the south. There are only two rivers of
any significance, the Shebele and the Juba, both of which rise in Ethiopia
and flow through the south. Neither is navigable and the Shebele only
flows about eight months of the year on average.
1.02      The population estimated at 5.6 million is unevenly distributed,
with the highest concentration (about 500,000) in the southern region
centered in the capital, Mogadishu, and in the basins of the Juba and
Shebele Rivers. In the northern region, the main population concentrations
are in Hargeisa (the northern regional capital) and Berbera (Somalia's
second leading port).  Approximately 46% of the population are nomads, 291
settled farmers and 25% urban dwellers.
1.03      Animal husbandry is the main occupation of the rural population,
and livestock accounts for about 35X of GDP. Exports of live animals and
animal products are the chief earners of foreign exchange. Bananas, the
only other major export, are grown near the southern coast. Total
agricultural production has accounted for about 10% of GDP in recent
years. Livestock and agriculture will continue to dominate Somalia's
economy, and the areas of greatest potential are the Bay region around
Baidoa, the Juba valley and the northwestern region.
1.04      During the 19709 the Somali economy experienced stagnation in
production and a decline in per capita income. Only the services sector
grew during the period, by 3.5 percent per year and the growth in
government services, at an annual rate of about 7 percent, was particularly
striking. Beginning in 1981, the economy witnessed a reversal of the past
trend, with real GDP in 1981-82 growing on average by 6.4 percent per year
notwithstanding some decline in the services sector.
1.05      Following a border conflict with Ethiopia in 1977/78, there was a
great surge in Government expenditures which resulted in widened deficits
in both the budget and the balance of payments. During 1978-80, the
Government's financial situation deteriorated ra,£dly, mainly because of
the sizeable expansion in expenditures consequent upon the border conflict,
the cost of maintaining large numbers of refugees, and the wage bill
associated with the Government's policy of guaranteeing employment for
secondary school leavers. At the same time, official foreign aid



-2-
declined. This resulted in Government recourse to deficit financing. With
further deterioration in the budgetary situation in 1979 the Government's
recourse to the Central Bank rose to record levels (about 13 percent of
GDP). This, in turn, led to rapid inflation, from 10 percent in 1978 to 60
perceat in 1980.
1.06      Official data on Somalia's balance of payments are incomplete,
but it seemed that the country had a reasonably comfortable overall balance
of payments position up to the beginning of 1979. The stagnation in
exports and surge in imports since 1979 resulted in a widening of both the
current and overall balance of payments deficits. The current account
deficit during 1980-83 averaged $290 million, as, compared to $110 million
in the years 1977-78. Total international reserves, which rose steadily in
the 1970s to $158 million in March 1979, dropped to $15 million at the end
of December 1980, and have since dwindled to nearly zero.
1.07      Somalia's external debt burden has grown rapidly in recent yea_s
and amounted to about $1.4 billion at end 1984. The structure and terms of
borrowing have also hardened. The debt service ratio in terms of
obligations rose from 7 percent in 1979 to nearly 50 percent in 1983 and is
projected at about 100 percent in 1986. The country also has accumulated
debt service arrears. The problem of arrears has not been fully resolved
by the debt rescheduling at the Paris Club in March 1985.
1.08      As the financial crisis deepened through 1978-1980, the
Government became convinced of the need to take remedial action and
embarked on a course of moving towards a more market-oriented economy.
Beginning in early 1981, the Government successfully implemented two
successive stabilization programs supported by IMF standby arrangements.
The measures taken under these programs included adjustment of the exchange
rate, fiscal and monetary restraint, and significant liberalization of
agricultural marketing. Under the first standby program, a dual exchange
rate was introduced, producer prices for agricultural crops were increased,
and banana growers received the full benefit of devaluation. This program
also involved a substantial reduction in Government recourse to the banking
system and increased interest rates.
1.09      Following the completion of the 1981/82 program, a new
stabilization program was adopted in mid-1982. The dual exchange rate was
unified on July 1, 1982, the Somali shilling was again devalued, interest
rates were raised, and fiscal and monetary expansion was restricted. In
mid-1983, a more flexible exchange rate system was introduced whereby the
Somali shilling was pegged to the SDR adjusted by the relative rates of
inflation between Somalia and the five countries in the SDR basket.
1.10      The policy reforms introduced by the Government from 1981-83 had
a positive impact on the economy. Reductions were effected in the rate of
growth of the money supply, in Government recourse to the banking system,
and in the rate of inflation. There was also some increase in commodity
production and exports. These measures represented the first stage in the
formulation and implementation of a policy agenda directed at restoring
financial equilibrium, rehabilitating and making fuller use of existing
agricultural and industrial productive capacity, and establishing the
foundations for long-term growth.



-3-
1.11      In March 1983 the Government requested the Bank to organize a
first Consultative Group meeting for Somalia. It prepared a Medium Term
Recovery Program (MTRP) for the Consultative Group meeting, cons4.s.ing of
(i) a program of phased policy measures aimed at restoring the balance of
payments and public finances and at rationalizing the pricing and incentive
structure; and (ii) a resource-constralned Public Investment Program (PIP)
for the period 1984-86. The formulation of this recovery program
represented a major accomplishment.
1.12      Despite the remedial policy measures taken by the Government of
existing facilities and the substantial adjustments made by the Government
in the size and composition of the investment program at the Consultative
Group Meeting in October 1983, the progress in financial stabilization and
economic recovery suffered a major setback in 1984 due to the ban on Somali
cattle export, the drought of 1983 as well as the Government's failure to
sustain the stabilization efforts and to make further policy reforms.
Exports plummeted, inflation reached a record high and debt service arrears
increased further in 1984.
1.13      Faced with mounting external and internal imbalances in 1984, the
Government embarked in early 1985 on a comprehensive economic and financial
program supported by a new IMF Stand-by Arrangement (and compensatory
financial facility) for a total amount equivalent to SDR 54.7 million. The
program was a bold and ambitious undertaking aimed at stabilizing the
economy and raising the rate of economic growth by fostering a more
market-oriented economy.
1.14      During the first three quarters of 1985, the Government adheared
closely to the agreed terms of the program by dismantling all price
controls, adopting more liberal marketing policies, removing all
restrictions with respect to foreign trade, undertaking a major devaluation
of the official exchange rate, introducing a freely floating exchange rate
for mont private transactions, providing export incentives through
increased acceptance of the free exchange market, and pursuing a tight
monetary and fiscal policy. These measures combined with favorable weather
conditions led to iacreased agricultural production, a reduced inflation
rate, and the expansion cf livestock and banana exports.
1.15      This performance, however was overshadowed by a substantial and
growing deficit in the official foreign exchange budget which stemmed from
some slippages in the implementation of program measures, a considerable
delay in the release of previously agreed external assistance to finance
the balance of payments gap for 1985, and shortfalls in the level of
foreign exchange receipts, particularly from workers' remittances which
shrank because of the more difficult employment conditions in the gulf
States. The acute shortage of foreign exchange resultked in substantial
shortfalls from the target level of imports-and the emergence of new
external payment arrears, including to the IMF. These arrears., in turn,
led to the inability of Somalia to draw on all resources negotirted under
the stand-by arrangement and to reduced drawings on loans from various
international organizations and governments, thereby compounding the
balance of payments financing problems and causing a halt to many
development projects.

B. The Transport Sstem
General
1.16      Somalia's transport infrastructure is limited, consisting of some
21,600 km of roads (only 3,600 km of which are all-weather), three
principal ports and four airports with paved runways. There are no
railways, pipelines or internal waterways, and coastal shipping is
negligible.  Road transport ts by far the principal means of modern
transport. Camels and donkeys are important, camels for long distance
transport (carrying 100 kg loads over average distances of 30 km per day)
and donkeys for snall loads within cities and their environs.
1.17      Of the total road network 3,000 km are paved, 600 km are
gravelled and the rest are earth roads and tracks. The share of gravel
and paved roads has increased significantly since 1976 from 1,800 km to
3,600 km in 1985. The coverage of the network, despite its density being
below the Eastern African average, is adequate for the country's present
needs. The main problem, however, is the standard and condition of the
roads which are far from satisfactory. Despite considerable road upgrading
in recent years, low road standards prevail in 85S of the network with
consequent high vehicle operating costs. The arid to semi-arid conditions
make road construction and maintenance relatively costly (longer distances
to carry water and crushed stone material for construction) and in the case
of gravel roads, the surface deterioratinn is faster than normal due to the
harsh winds and extremely dry condition hhich prevail in certain parts of
the country.
1.18      All public roads in the country are suffering from lack of proper
maintenance. Inadequate organizational setup, shortages of skilled and
semi-skilled maintenance staff to carry out routine or periodic
maintenance, and the low availability rate of road maintenance equipment
combined with the fact that such resources are often diverted to other
activities, are all contributing factors to the low level of road
maintenance. Funding of road maintenance operations falls far below what
would normally be required. However, the capacity of the Civil Engineering
Department (CED) is such that even the small amounts being allocated to
road maintenance are seldom fully utilized. Technical assistance and
training programs for the Civil Engineering Department of the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) have been financed through the Bank's Third and Fourth
Highway Projects. The net impact of this assistance on improving road
maintenance, organization and execution has been less than could have been
expected. Under the Fourth Hlghway Project, the Bank has financed a road
maintenance study which recommends certain changes that should enable
government to improve road maintenance operations and thereby the quality
of roads waintenance in general. The Bank has also recently initiated
donor meetings in the country to seek better coordination of external
assistance in the road maintenance sector in Somalia.

Road Trgasport Industry
1.19      No systematic records have been kept of road usage and the
nation's vehicular fleet and there is a shortage of available Information.
Available data on fleet composition, age and condltlon indicate that there
were about 15,600 privately owned vehicles along with about 3,000
Government owned vehicles in 1980 when the first systematic
data collection was made. of the total vehicular fleet of 18,600, about 25
percent were medium to heavy trucks including bui,es, 40 percent pick-ups
and vans and the balance (35 percent) passenger cars including taxis. With
no rail service in the country, road vehicles cater to the majority of
freight movement in the country although animal powered transport (with
donkeys and camels) also provide an important mans of transport. Freight
transport is carried by private truckers and by the National Transport
Agency (NTA), a parastatal company established In 1978 to provide freight
transport services. There are no specific regulatory barriers to entry
into the freight transport industry, and although official tariffs exist,
these are not enforced and the market appears reasonably competitive.
However, the lack of vigorous private sector actilities, the poor road
condition, shortage of spare parts and fuel, and seasonality of demand for
freight transport have -rndered the profitability of the industry low.
Furthermore, due to the lack of foreign exchange, replacement of the
trucking fleet has been slow. The majority of the newly imported trucks
have either been for food aid transport or for aid financed construction
projects. The average age of the vehicular fleet is estimated to be
between 8 to 10 years old.
1.20      The road transport industry is dominated by the private sector
which owns about 4,000 trucks (light and heavy) and handles over 75 percent
of the demand for the internal movement of goods. The balance of the
demand is met by NTA with its fleet of about 290 trucks. NTA has incurred
losses since its inception in 1978 and is dependent on Government subsidies
for fleet expansion and replacement. Since an alternative transport system
does not exist to handle the internal freight transport demand it is both
strategically and economically imperative that the growth of the road
transport industry be fostered. Further investigations of the status of
the industry and its need for assistance should be undertaken in the near
future.
Ports     See Chapter II for details.
Civil Aviation
1.21      The air transport system in Somalia serves ten scattered regional
centers with Mogadishu as the focal point. Only the airports at
Mogadishu, Berbera, Kismayo and Hargeisa have paved runways. Investments
in civil aviation have been an insignificant part of the Public Sector
Investment Program (PIP) thus far.  They will continue to be so under the
revised 1986-88 PIP. Somali Airlines, established in *964, operates one
Fokker F27 aircraft and two Cessnas on its domestic routes and two Boeing
707 aircrafts on its international routes waich connect Mogadishu with
Rome, Frankfurt, Cairo, Nairobi, Djibouti, Seychelles and various points on
the Arabian Peninsula. Somali Airlines if. an autonomous parastatal under
the Department of Civil Aviation of the Miniw :y of Land and Air
Transport.

Technical and management assistance is provided by Lufthansa. A few
foreign airlines link Somalia with other African countries and Europe.
C.  Transport FolicyK Plnning and Coordlnation
1.22      The role of the transport sector in the development of the Somali
economy is to open up centers of mainstream economic activities and to
integrate those areas which are geographically isolated. Road transport,
thus far, has been the main transport subsector which ha% contributed to
tIis goal.  Coastal shipping with dhows whi.h once contributed
substantially to trade with the neighbouring Arab countries, as well as to
link the economically active coastal cities of Somalia, has essentially
ceased. The road transport system (both roads and vehicles), which has a
large share of foreign costs, is expensive for the general Somali public,
and other means of transport must be given serious thought in order to
improve the provision of transport services to the Somali economy (para
3.09)-
1.23      The Government of Somalia recognizes the vital role that adequate
transport facilities and services play in the deveiopment of the nation's
economy. Its objectives in transport are to ensure a regular supply of
fuel, spare parts and vehicles, reliable transport services and improve
road maintenance to reduce transport costs and protect its assets.
However, it is well recognized that Government faces pressing macro
economic issues which are formidable to overcome in many areas (e.g.
inflation, balance of payments, foreign exchange earnings, efficiency of
productive sector etc.).  In light of this priority, the role of the
transport sector will be to maximize the provision of transport services
with minimum foreign exchange availability; i.e., to (i) reduce costly
reconstruction of its paved road network through improved maintenance; (ii)
achieve more efficient use of road vehicles through improved maintenance
and losd factor (most likely through greater private sector involvement);
;iii) maintain the foreign exchange earning capacity of the major ports;
(iv) improve the efficiency of port operations to avoid undue delays; and
(v) reduce transport costs in the distribution of goods through promoting
the use of traditional dhows and expanding coastal shipping.
1.24      The four ministries wlhich are concerned with the transport sector
are: (i) the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) which, through its Civil
Engineering Department, is responsible for highway maintenance and for
planning and construction of highways, ports and airports: (ii) the
Ministry of Land and Air Transport which is responsible for road transport
regulations including vehicle registration and control and for civil
aviation through its Civil Aviation Department; (iii) the Ministry of
Portseand Marine Transport which, through the Somali Ports Authority (SPA),
is responsible for port operations, and through the Somali Shipping Agency
and Line, is responsible for marine transport; and (iv) the Ministry of
Interior which is responsible for highway traffic control. Coordination is
provided by the State Planning Commission.

1.25      Under the 1974-78 development plan, transport investments
accounted for about 20 percent of total planned public investment.
However, due to cost overruns caused by implementation delays and
inflation, a number of projects were carried over to the next development
plan period. Investments in roads accounted for 76 percent of sector
investments, and ports and aviation accounted for 19 and 5 percent
respectively. The investment plan for transport generally followed
recommendations made by consultants in their 1966 Transport Survey and was
basically well conceived. Overall, the plan was only partially successful
in meeting the implementation targets in the sector. In the next
development plan (1979-81), transport investments made up 25 percent of the
total public investments. Investments in roads accounted for 48 percent of
transport sector Investments; and ports and civil aviation accounting for
39 percent and 13 percent respectively. However, only 76 percent of
planned investments actually materialized during these years; the shortfall
in the planned targets occurred due to the overall economic crises and
shortage of funds and was particularly pronounced in the ports and civil
aviation subsectors.
1.26      During the 1982-84 plan period, the allocation for the transport
sector fell to 13 percent of the investment plan. However, the absolute
amount invested in the transport sector rose by 50 percent. The major
accomplishments during this period was the completion of Berth 6 at
Mogadishu Port and the initiation of a major development and
rehabilitationof Berbera Port. Many of the road works during this period
were either delayed or terminated in the midst of construction work due to
the curtailment of bilateral financing forced by mounting arrears of loan
repayments by the Government.
1.27      In the proposed 1986-88 plan period, the sector allocation has
fallen to 9% of total PIP, and subsector composition has shifted toward
greater emphasis on port investment rather than in highways. The reduction
in sector allocation vis-a-vis the total PIP is an acceptable trend given
the need for Somalia to concentrate on rejuvenating the productive sector.



-8-
The shift in subsector emphasis to ports is due mainly to the urgently
required Kismayo port rehe'ilitation works which commenced recently with
USAID financing. In the highway subsector, the Government haM followed it.
stated strategy of emphasizing road maintenance and rehabilitation by
allocating 70X of subsector investment to maintenance.   The port's PIP, in
general, is acceptable and follows the strategy set out by the Government.
Civil aviation has severely cut its program and 95% of the subsector
allocation is for technical assistance. This strategy is satisfactory.
1.28      The main transport sector issues, as outlined briefly in
pars. 1.23, is how to provide transport services given tremendous
constraints in resources, both in terms of foreign exchange availability
and the lack of manpower resources. The first priority is to maintain
donor interest in providing resources for highway maintenance and
rehabilitation. The second priority is to improve the institutional
capacity for maintenance of existing assets, be it the highways, ports or
road transport subsector. Improvements in institutional capacity will be
slow at best, but external assistance is crucial. Relative to other
institutions, the ports subsector has the manpower to carry out its
operations efficiently if proper coordinated assistance is provided (one of
the main objectives of this Project). The highway subsector is less
endowed in terms of manpower and is hampered particularly by the
decentralized structure of road administration. Continued training and
technical assistance are required to avoid a collapse of the road network.
The third priority is to rejuvenate coastal shipping. Due to the wide
georgraphical area of the country, the use of road transport as well as
constructing and maintaining a large road network is costly. Better use of
coastal shipping can reduce the cost of goods and stimulate economic
activities which otherwise would not materialize. Further investigatior. is
required (see para. 3.09 for a proposed study).
D. Past Bank Group Involvemat in Sector
1.29      The World Bank group has been extensively involved in the
development of the transport sector in Somalia through the provision of IDA
credits for four highways and four port projects. The first involvement,
consisting of an initial credit (74-SO) approved in 1964 and a
supplementary credit (123-S0) in 1968 which totalled US$8.5 million, was
used along with co-financing funds primarily to construct the 216 km
Afgoi-Baidoa Road and to organize and improve the Civil Engineering
Department in MPW. The road construction was completed successfully in
1971 although a dispute developed between the Government and the contractor
which went to arbitration and was only recently settled. Notwithstanding
this problem, the project has had beneficial effects on the area served by
the road and on the nation generally. An economic re-evaluation in 1978 by
Bank staff in connection with a project completion audit confirmed the
soundness of the project.
1.30      The Second Highway Project, financed by a US$9.6 million IDA
credit (295-SO) in 1972 and by funds from the African Development Bank, was
concerned largely with construction of the 158 km Hargeisa-Berbera Road.
Completed in 1975, the road has greatly facilitated the movement of
livestock from Hargeisa to the port of Berbera. A Bank staff economic



-9-
re-evaluation of the project in 1978 revealed a 36% economic return. A
Third Highway project provided a US$7.0 million IDA credit (699-SO) in 1977
primarily to assist in extending the above road 132 km westward from
Hargeisa to Borama and Tug Wajale. Construction began in January 1978.
Due to hostilities in the area, the original contract was terminated; a new
reduced contract was awarded and 70 km. from Hargeisa to Nabadid were
completed in January 1985, 4-1/2 years later than the original estimate.
The project was cofinanced by the Arab Fund for Social and Economic
Development, the Islamic Development Bank and the African Development
Bank. A Bank staff economic re-evaluation of the project (December 1985)
showed a rate of return of 11% as compared to 24Z estimated at appraisal.
The main reasons forthe reduced ERR are: (i) 82% increase in per km
construction cost; and (ii) lower than expected traffic due to the drought
(lower livestock traffic) and lower economic activity in the area. The
training and technical assistance program was unsuccessful in achieving its
targets due mainly to: (a) no financial incentive for the local counterpart
staff; (b) transfer of staff; and (c) certain cases of unsatisfactory
performance by the consulting firms.
1.31      A Fourth Highway Project, financed by IDA (US$23 million), the
Arab Fund (US$16.3 million) and Government (US$4.2 million), was signed in
1983. The major civil works component involving reconstruction of the
Afgoi-Baidoa road was completed in October 1985, although reduced in scope
due to the suspension of the loan from the Arab Fund following Government's
inability to meet the debt service obligation on other outstanding loans.
The technical assistance component and the urgent maintenance component are
still on-going. The project closing date is set for September 1987.
1.32      Port project financing began in 1964 with a technical assistance
grant of US$311,000 followed in 1969 by a credit (55-SO) of US$550,000 for
engineering and accounting consultancy services.  Although the Mogadishu
Port Project was first identified in 1964 it took nine years to put the
project together because of lack of donor funds and the occurrence of a
political revolution in the country. In 1973, these preparations resulted
in a US$12.9 million IDA Credit (359-SO) which, together with an EDF grant
of US$12.5 million, financed the construction of the sheltered deep-water
harbor of Mogadishu, consisting of a breakwater, two general cargo berths,
a livestock berth and a banana berth, sheds and other facilities. In 1975,
during execution of this project, a Third IDA Credit (586-SO) for US$5.2
million was approved for an additional general cargo berth and
corresponding extension of the breakwater. The original Mogadishu Port
Project and its extension Credit (586-SO) were completed in 1977, about six
months behind schedule. The physical execution of the project was plagued
with contractor disputes arising from the numerous claims advanced by the
contractor. These claims were eventually settled without resort to
arbitration. The breakwater, however, experienced subsidence problems
(para. 3.06). A Bank staff economic re-evaluation in 1979 indicated an
economic return of 17% which is slightly higher than that derived during
reappraisal in connection with the project extension.
1.33      The Fourth Port Project, approved by IDA in July 1978 for a
US$5.5 million credit, consisted of construction of a tanker pier and
related facilities for handling crude oil tankers and small products
tankers. Bids were received on November 21, 1979. However, the lowest bid



-10-
was substantially higher than the appraisal estimate, and a decision was
made to extend the banana berth and construct a ro-ro ramp instead. The
project was completed -n July 1983. A Project Completion Report prepared
in December 1985 showed that: (i) ERR was re-evaluated at 342 compared to
21% estimated at appraisal; and (ii) financially, SPA showed much better
results than were projected, enabling SPA to pay large dividends to the
Government. The favorable performance of the project was due mainly to
higher throughput than forecasted, 30% lower contract price for civil works
and readjustment of tariffs in 1983. During execution of the project,
however, it became evident that there were fundamental weaknesses in SPA
such as the scarcity of skilled staff and the poor use made of then, and
that, to overcome these defficiencies, substantial additional efforts in
institutional development and training were required in future projects.
B.  Rationale for Bank 6roup Involvemt
1.34      Assistance provided to the Somali Ports Authority (SPA) thus far,
including the four port projects financed by the Bank, have concentrated
predominantly on infrastructural development at the three major ports of
Mogadishu, Berbera and Kismayo. Limited assistance in cargo handling
equipment was provided from time to time by various donors and technical
assistance, including training, were provided on an ad hoc basis. The
proposed Project is the first of its kind to provide a coordinated and
comprehensive port modernization program for the Somali Ports Authority.
The main objective of this assistance is to enable SPA to progress into an
era of modern port management and operations through a phased mechanization
program as well as comprehensive training for all levels of port staff.
The ProJect is based on the Somali Ports Master Plan Study initiated under
the Fourth Port Project with financing from the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA). The study, finished in 1985, reviewed the
infrastructure requirements of the three major ports for the next 20 years
and recommended a phased mechanization program along with a comprehensive
training and technical assistance program. The Project also provides
operational experts in on-line management positions in SPA. This is a new
endeavor in Somalia and is aimed at the transfer of modern port management
and operation know-how to SPA in a short span of time.



II. TIM SOfALI PORTS ArRORIITY
A. Background
2.01      The Government of Somalia recognizes the important role the
country's ports play in the economic development of the country and since
1962, the year in which it established the Somali-Ports Authority, has
actively pursued a policy of developing port facilities which will service
its international trade efficiently. Prior to 1962 deep water port
facil ties were practically non-existent and cargo handling services were
loosely rendered by numerous contractors using lighters. With the
Iestablishment of the Somali Ports Authority, lighterage operations were
ihased out and replaced with cargo handling operations alongside berths.
2.02      The initial thrust was in infrastructural development.  Since
1968, three major harbors have been commissioned: Kismayo in the extreme
south-east of the country serving the Juba Valley (1968); Berbera, on the
Gulf of Aden, serving Hargeisa and the northern region (1969); and
Mogadishu, inaugurated at the end of 1977, serving the Shabelle Valley and
the eastern part of the Juba-Shabelle inter-river area.
2.03      Whilst the Government's goal of developing modern deep-water port
facilities has been achieved, its expectation of effectively operating
these facilities is as yet unrealized. The shortage of funds did not
permit the Government to invest in mechanical cargo handling equipment
which would complement the infrastructural development of its terminal
facilities. Being a relatively young organization with no experience and
history in port management and port operation, compounded by its inability
to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel because of the
high wages offered by the neighboring oil rich countries, SPA has not gone
far enough in introducing the necessary systems and procedures in cargo
handling in line with the transformation of cargo handling operations from
lighterage to alongside berth. Its initial emphasis on infrastructural
development has prevented it from giving sufficient attention to
institutional development.
2.04      As SPA has not had the capability to undertake long-term port
planning and engineering studies, a Master Plan Study by consultants was
commissioned in 1984 to provide guidance to SPA for the planning and
development of the ports under its jurisdiction in the short to medium term
(1985-1990) and to act as a planning guide for possible infrastructural
investment in the medium to long term (1990-2000). The study was financed
by DANIDA with the terms of reference discussed with IDA. The
recommendations of the Master Plan Study formed the basis upon which the 
Government of Somalia is embarking on its next port development program.
2.05      Somalia has numerous ports due to its long coastline.  Most of
them are small (Mait, Las Khoreh, Bosasso, Kandala and Alula) and are used
only for the shipment of livestock and a very small quantity of general
cargo carried by local craft. A few (Zeila and Boolimoog) are used only
for fishery. Traffic at these minor ports is negligible and for all
intents and purposes, SPA has little need to exercise any form of
administration or control.



-12-
2.06      The ports of significance are Mogadishu, Berbera and Kismayo.
Merca, with facilities for the loading of export bananas via lighters, is
no longer in use. Its proximlty to Mogadishu (approximately 100 km) and
the difficult conditions under which vessels were loaded in the anchorage
led to the diversion of banana export through Mogadishu. The attention of
SPA is focussed on the three sheltered deep-water ports of Mogadishu,
Berbera and Kismayo.
2.07      Port facilities at Mogadishu consist primarily of six berths with
a total length of 1,000 a.  Maximim draft alongside is 12 m.  Berbera and
Kismayo each has four berths with a total length of 640 m and a maxinum
draft of 9.5 a. Pilotage and tug assistance are compulsory for all vessels
above 200 net registered tons. For a detailed listing of port facilities,$
please see Annex 2.1.
5. Oru nuaFtiom, Mur"lanapnt and Staff
2.08      The Somali Ports Authority (SPA) which is responsible for the
administration, operation and maintenance of the country's ports was
created in 1962 and reconstituted under Law No. 70 of December 1970 and Law
No. 17 of January 1973. Planning for the expansion and development of the
ports as well as the execution of the ports' infrastructural developments
is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works while provision for
the financing of these projects is incorporated in the Government's
Centralised Capital Investment Budgets. Completed projects are handed over
to SPA ownership for the conduct of port operations.
2.09      SPA falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ports and
Marine Transport (MPMT). Although there are certain restrictions imposed
by the Government (priaarily pertaining to employment and transfers of
staff, salaries and terms and conditions of service, financial management
and the distribution of operating surpluses) SPA has sufficient powers to
discharge its responsibilities except in the financial area (para. 5.12)
including its ability to obtain foreign exchange.
2.10      SPA is managed by a President with a General Manager as its chief
operating officer. SPA's functional activities are organised under four
departments: Planning, Finance, Personnel and Engineering with day to day
operations at each port under a Port Manager who reports directly to the
General Manager. Each port has its own operating, maintenance,
administrative and accounting divisions. See Chart II for the organization
chart of SPA.
2.11      SPA is facing a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower
because of the exodus in large numbers of educated Somalis to the
neighbouring oil producing countries. Although the manpower drain has
halted because of the drop in oil earnings in the neighbouring countries,
it is unlikely that the public sector will be able to attract back into
service those who had left for higher salaries. This exodus has resulted
in numerous positions in the organization being either unfilled or filled
with inexperienced personnel. Out of a total regular employment of 802,
only 24 form the managerial and professional group (Annex 2.2).   The
result is that effective supervision is lacking and this is reflected in



-13-
the day to day operations at the ports. Cargo is haphazardly handled and
stored and there are frequent disputes over quantities, marks and condition
of the cargo.
2.12      As in operations at the ports, management at SPA is weak in such
areas as planning, information systems and accounting and financial
management, There is a need to inject sound management techniques and
practices in controlling and directing SPA's activities.
2,13      SPA provides employment to about 3,300 people of which 802 are
regular employees whilst the rest are engaged as temporary workers through
labour co-operatives. The current system of casual engagement has an
undesirable effect. Because of the uncertainty in employment and the low
pay, labour registered-for casual employment tends -to first look elsewhere
for work, turning up at the ports only when other work is not available.
Thus while the labor registries at the various ports have large labor
pools, in reality the ports are often confronted with a shortage of skilled
labor.  Very often,therefore, dock labor engaged to work for the day
consists of the untrained and what is available after better paying jobs
for the day have been met. This has created an inherent tendency for SPA
to have a large number of labour in a gang to make up for the shortage of
skills. A training school to train dock workers is necessary so that the
ports can draw from a larger pool of trained dockers.
C. Training
2.14      With very few exceptionslftraining provided to SPA's staff in
the past has been ad hoc, consisting of senior officials attending short
courses and seminars provided mainly by UNCTAD. These courses and seminars
dealt with the general aspects of port management, operations and
statistics. In the last five years, such training totalled 36 man months
(Annex 2.3). Although technical assistance provided under previous IDA
Credits included training elements, the basic need for continuous training
has not yet been met in a satisfactory manner due in part to the inability
to find suitable instructors. The lack of suitable training facilities
contributed to this situation which has been improved with the completion
of the Somali Institute of Development Administration and Management
(SIDAM). The Industrial Vocational Training Center at Mogadishu,
established by GTZ, also has the capability to carry out tailor-made
courses for machine operators, mechanics, fitters and electricians. The
training facilities under the proposed Project have been determined on the
basis that some of the required training will be undertaken by SIDAM and
the Industrial Vocational Training Center.
D. Operations
2.15      All cargo operations, except for the delivery and receipt of
cargo at storage areas, are undertaken by SPA at all three ports using
1/ One engineer was sent for training with a U.K. consulting firm and
two officers are pursuing a degree in maritime law in Sweden.



-14-
workers obtained from labour co-operatives. Cargo is loaded or discharged
using ships' gears. Delivery of cargo at storage areas is undertaken by
importers and exporters using labour from another co-operative. Cargo
handling is labour intensive (Annex 2.4). The size of a gang varies
depending on the type of commodities. A gang handling bagged cargo is made
up of 26 men (12 stevedores, 2 winchmen, 10 longshoremen and 2 foremen).
For break bulk general cargo, the gang is made up of 34 memi (17 stevedores,
2 winchmen, 13 longshoremen and 2 foremen). A working uni: for ro-ro cargo
has 10 men. Dock labourers who are engaged on a contract basis participate-
in an oversimplified productivity scheme which requires each gang to load
or discharge a specific quantity of cargo within an eight hour shift. This
over-simplified productivity scheme does not provide adequate incentive.
Labour productivity per man, based on the productivity norms for bagged
cargo (100 tons per gang per shift) and break bulk general cargo (50 tons
per gang per shift) is low. Representative handling rates per ship working
day are 280 tons for general cargo, 530 tons for bagged cargo, 250-400 tons
for bananas and 1340 tons for ro-ro traffic.
2.16      The low labour productivity is the result of the lack of
mechanical handling equipment and the shortage of skilled cargo handlers.
The majority of the available equipment is old and dilapidated and in many
instances structurally unsafe. The lack of equipment has resulted in two
shipping lines providing their own equipment to handle their containers and
ro-ro traffic. This equipment is lent to SPA when it is not in use by the
owners to handle containers of other shipping lines.

E. Maintenance
2.17      The standard of niaintenance of port facilities and equipment is
low. Workshop facilities are inadequate, improperly equipped and in
Mogadishu and Kismayo are wrongly located being approximately 3 km away
from the ports. Except for a very few, SPA "engineering" and "technical'
maintenance staff have no formal technical training. They acquired their



-I5-
knowledge and skill through on-the-job training. Such training is not
planned and supervised and the employee is left very much on his own to
learn what he can. Another constraint is the inability to secure spare
parts due to SPA's difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange.  Given these
limitations, maintenance staff do attempt to keep the few pieces of
equipment working, in some instances fabricating their own parts. However,
no planned or preventive maintenance of equipmert exists.
2.18      There is a sufficient number of staff to undertake all
maintenance work. The technical competency and organizational ability of
the staff, however, leave much to be desired. In order that the technical
sections at the three ports can perform at a reasonably competent level,
departments/sections with responsibility for maintenance have to be
re-organised and tasks explicitly allocated, workshops properly equipped
and staff adequately trained. All these constraints are being addressed in
the proposed Project.
F. Past and Present Traffic
2.19      Total import and export traffic through SPA ports fluctuated
considerably during the period 1978 to 1984, increasing from 0.9 million in
1978 to its historical high of 1.3 million tons in 1980 and declining to
0.9 million tons in 1983. The traffic recovered to 1.1 million tons in
1984. Despite these fluctuations, there has been a gneral upward trend in
traffic throughput, averaging 3.5 percent per annum for the 1978-1984
period and 2.8 percent per annum since 1973.  (See table 2.2).  Dry cargo
throughput (i.e. excluding petroleum) increased at an average annual growth
rate of 3.2 X with imports growing at 71 per annum and exports declining at
83 per annum. The rapid import growth reflects the significant volume of
food aid imports and the aid-assisted infrastructure development program.
The precipitous decline of the dry cargo exports, (which constitutes only
202 of dry cargo traffic), was led by a major decline in the exports of
bananas (largely due to the impact of Government price controls and
drought) and livestock (impact of drought and ban on Somali livestock by
Saudi Arabia). As for petroleum products, the total throughput has
fluctuated around 200,000 tons depending on the foreign exchange
availability and commodity aid from oil exporting countries.
2.20      Of the total throughp't of SPA ports, on average, 72% of the port
traffic passes through the port of Mogadishu with 22% and 6% passing
through the ports of Berbera and Kismayo respectively. This composition
reflects the relative importance of the capital city as the main economic
and population center of the country.  The main imports are bagged cement,
grains and petroleum products, and main exports are livestock, petroleum
product reexports, and bananas.
feport TIraffic
2.21      Somalia exports bananas, livestock, hide and skins, canned meat
and fish. The tonnages of hides and skins, meat and fish are insignificant
as far as demand on port capacity is concerned. Banana and livestock



-16-
traffic, on the other hand, has a much greater demand on port capacity,
constituting about 15% of the total dry cargo traffic of 820,000 tons.
Banana traffic reached its peak in 1972 at 134,000 tons but declined
precipitously to 30,000 tons in 1979. Since then price controls have been
recoved and steady recovery is underway (50,000 tons in 1984). The main
production areas are located in the southern region below Mogadishu, and
both Mogadishu and Kismayo ports have been used for exports.
2.22      Livestock trafflc is concentrated in Berbera.  Practically all
sheep and goats and about 90% of the camel are exported throigh this port.
Although Berbera will remain the export port for most livesrock, Kismayo is
expected to increased its-exports since cattle production and exports are
expected to grow faster than in the north.
Import Traffic
2.23      Cement is the single largest category of dry cargo imports at
about 18% of the total dry cargo throughput. Cement imports have increased
at an annual average of 14.51 since 1978. Over 70% is imported through
Mogadishu. Other bagged cargo, including cereals, flour, food grain and
sugar, has been growing at 19% per annum, and consists largely of food
grain and food aid imports for refugees. Though at a lower rate, food
imports are expected to remain important traffic for the ports.
2.24      Somalia presently imports both crude and refined products through
Mogadishu. Crude oil is re6ined at Mogadislau and redistributed to Berbera
and Kismayo. Importation of crude oil is estimated to stabilize at the
current level of 150,000 - 200,000 tons per annum and the balance of the
demand will be fulfilled by importation of refined products.
2.25      Container traffic at the port of Mogdishu has increased rapidly
after the commencement of regular container liner services by Messina Lines
in 1982. The container traffic has increased from 4,700 TEU in 1982 to
12,800 THU in 1984. In keeping with the shipping characteristics of
Eastern Africa, this trend is expected to continue. The traffic break
downs for each port and for each major comodity are given in Table 2.2.

C.  Port Planning and Devel,opnet Strate8y
2.26      In view of the lack of sheltered locations for ports along the
coast of Somalia and the high cost of providing breakwater protection for
ports, port development in the foreseable future should concentrate on
Mogadishu, Berbera and Kismyo. These three ports are well located to serve
the needs of the population centers of Somalia.  The role of the smaller
ports is essentially to serve the needs of the fishing industry and local
trade. Unless the import/export trade at any of these ports grows to be
sufficiently large it wouAd not be justifiable to have sizeable investments
in the form of port facilities for the conduct of international trade and
shipping through these ports. Provided that the ports are properly managed
and operated and the berths achieve a throughput within their means there
should be no physical limitation to the capacity of the three ports to
handle forecasted national traffic up to the year 2010. In the interest of



-18-
assuring soundly based future development of ports, it was agreed during
credit negotiations that additional investments in the commercial ports sub
sector will be made only after their economic and financial justification
have been demonstrated on the basis of criteria acceptable to the
Association (para. 5.17).
2.27      While the ports' physical facilities in the form of berths are
well designed and developed, their current berth throughput is iow. This
low productivity is the result of the: (I) shortage of suitable cargo
handling equipment; (ii) poorly trained and motivated staff; and (iii)
inadequate systems, procedures and methods of handling cargo.   Planning
at, and development of, Somalia's ports should therefore be to: (i)
complement previous infrastructural developments with needed mechanical
cargo handling equipment; and (ii) provide technical assistance and
training for SPA staff.
2.28      In overcoming manpower and institutional constraints attention
should not be focussed only at the ports. The management and operation of
organizations and trade practices which have an impact on the operation of
the ports should also be addressed. Operations of peripheral port
organizations such as customs, shipping agents and forwarding agents and
trade practices and documentation which inhibit the development of trade
and the distribution of cargo out of the port will have to be improved,
up-dated and made compatible with current international shipping, trading
and transport practices and requirements.  The shipping agency is a case in
point. Shipping agency work is being carried out in the country solely by
the Somali Shipping Agency and Line (SSAL). This monopolistic position
breeds certain inefficiencies which could be overcome if shipping agency is
open to competition. Various recommendations to improve the efficiency of
shipping agency work have been made by the Bank and by experts provided by
the Government of West Germany and these recommendations are being studied
by the Government through a high level committee. These recommendations
include, inter alia, (i) the opening up of shipping agency work to private
interests; and (ii) allowing joint ventures of foreign and local interests
in establishing shipping agencies in Somalia. As a condition of Credit
Effectiveness, Government will submit to the Association for review and
approval a plan of action for improving the efficiency of SSAL including
allowing private individuals and companies including joint ventures of
foreign and local interests to engage in shipping agency work and
thereafter implement the agreed upon plan of action in accordance with a
timetable acceptable to the Association (6.01 (i) (d)) and (6.01 (ii)(n).
2.29      Due to the inadequate transportation network of roads in the
country as well as the relatively high cost of road transport, prima facie,
the distribution of goods along the coast by sea would appear desirable and
practicable. To utilize the comparative time advantage of coastal
shipping, the ports of Mogadishu and Berbera, and to a lesser extent,
Kismayo will need to be developed into major transshipment centers for the
country with feeder coastal services feeding into the various minor ports.
A road distribution network centered around each of the ports will allow
the ports to serve their hinterlands. This direction in the development of
ports in Somalia will require the institution of systems, procedures and
practises to facilitate a speedy transfer of cargo, the promotion of



-19-
inter-modal transportation of goods and the development of through
transportation. The Government has requested the Bank to analyze the
possibility and the extent to which coastal sh pping can be a cost
effective alternatlve mode and a financially viable sector. These issues
would be examined In a study on the transport and distribution system of
the country to be funded by the Project (para. 3.09). The terms of
reference for the study were agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 3.8).
Bu.  ets, Accounts, Audit and Iosurance
Budgets
2.30      Before the start of each fiscal year SPA prepares an annual
budget of operating revenues and expenses and an annual investment budgt
for submission to the Ministry of Ports and Marine Transport and the
Ministry of Finance. The investment budget consists of equipment additions
and replacements and minor civil works. Major port investments are
excluded since planning and financing of these are the responsibility of
the Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Planning. The investment
budget provides the basis, in principle, for Ministry of Finance
allocations of foreign exchange to SPA. The operating budget is in
principle a tool for evaluation of port operations by the Ministry of Ports
and Marine Transport, the Ministry of Finance and SPA senior management.
However, it is compiled in manner that limits its usefulness as a tool for
planning of operations and ultimately also as a tool for evaluation of the
efficiency with which ports' resources are used. As part of the program of
technical assistance in financial management and accounting in the proposed
Project, assistance will be provided SPA to develop a more rigorous
budgetary framework to serve both the needs of senior management and the
responsible ministries.
Accounts
2.31      Between 1978 and 1983, SPA operated a commercial chart of
accounts designed by consultants under the Second Port Project
(Credit 359-SO). The system is decentralized with individual ports
maintaining their own sets of accounts and SPA headquarters responsible for
monthly consolidations. The system was designed as an integrated
financial-management accounting system with provision for fixed assets
accounting inccrporating periodic asset revaluations. However, due to
shortages of trained accountants and bookkeepers in the country together
with the low salaries that SPA has been able to pay to staff, SPA has not
been able to recruit sufficiently able or motivated staff to operate the
system. As a result only a basic financial accounting system has been
operated.
2.32      Since 1983, SPA has been obligated to operate the Uniform
Accounting System (UAS). This system consists of a much more extensive
chart of accounts than the one SPA had hitherto operated. All
Government-owned enterprises are required to adopt the system in order to
facilitate consistent statistical compilations by central government.



-20-
Given its limited accounting staff, SPA has encountered considerable
difficulties in operating the UAS as well as producing its own final
accounts on a timely basis. In fact, SPA has only, thus far, modified its
old chart of account on a very adhoc basis to comply on a minimal basis
with the requirement to adopt the UAS.
2.33      To strengthen SPA's accounting capability, 2 man years of
technical assistance will be provided under the proposed Project to help
rationalize the existing system, selectively introduce cost accounting
procedures, and introduce simplified procedures for fixed asset revaluation
and accounting. This will be in addition to helping develop course
material to train junior staff and in developing sound budgetary procedures
(para. 3.07 and 3.08).
2.36      Maintenance of the UAS will be inconsistent with SPA provision of
audited accounts on a timely basis to IDA given the likely continued
shortage in SPA of skilled accounting personnel in the next few years.
Accordingly, during negotiations, Government agreed to permit full
introduction of the UAS to SPA on a phased basis over a period of time to
be determined taking into account the need for the development of SPA's
accounting capabilities.
2.35      The annual accounts of Government-owned enterprises including SPA
are required to be audited by a separate unit established for this purpose
in the office of the Magistrate of Accounts (MOA). This arrangement is
acceptable to IDA.
2.36      Because of shortcomings in SPA's accounting department and-a
shortage of staff at MOA, completion of SPA's audited accounts have in the
past been frequently subject to delays.
2.37      SPA was required under the previous IDA-funded Fourth Port
ProJect (Credit 838-SO) to furnish audited accounts to IDA within 6 months
of the close of its financial year. SPA had difficulties in complying with
this requirement. In view of the difficulties in preparing final accounts
and weaknesses in the auditing organisation outlined above (paras
2.34-2.38) it is recommended that SPA be required to submit to IDA its
audited accounts within 9 months of the close of its financial year for the
financial years 1987 and 1988 and within 7 months after the end of its
financial years thereafter (para. 6.01 (ii) (p)). SPA agreed to this
arrangement during negotiations.
Insurance
2.38      Under previous port credits, IDA has,stipulated that SPA takes
out insurance against risks such as fire, damage and loss of property. SPA
has, accordingly, obtained the necessary coverage.

III. THE PBQJOCT
A.   Oblectives
3.01      The main objective of the proposed Project is to help improve
cargo handling capacity and performance at the three major ports of
Wogadishu, Berbera and Kismayo by introducing appropriate systems and
procedures in cargo handling and port management, and by providing
necessary cargo handling equipment to meet the current needs of shipping.
The phased mechanization program will enable SPA to handle increasing
volume and types (e.g. containers) of cargo without undue congestion or
large investments for additional berths; the technical assistance and
training will enable SPA to maximize the use of the new equipment to
improve its operational efficiency.
- BU. Yroiect DescriRtion
3.02      The Project consists of:
(a) Procurement of cargo handling (including pallets), office,
training and workshop equipment, refurbishing of old
equipment and docking of tugs;
(b)  Port improvement (civil) works:
(i) Paving of the container yard at Mogadishu;
(ii) Provision of fenders for wharves at Mogadishu;
(iii) Construction of container freight stations at
Mogadishu and Berbera;
(iv) Construction of a ro-ro ramp at Mogadishu;
(v) Construction of workshops and stores at Mogadishu
and Kismayo; and
(vi) Construction of the port training school at Mogadishu;
(c) Rectification of breakwater subsidence at Mogadishu;
(d) Training and technical assistance for SPA;
(e)  Consultant services for:
(i) supervision, including assistance in equipment
procurement, of (a), (b) and (c); aud
(ii) study on transport development including the role
of coastal shipping and the minor ports.



-22-
(a) Caro l andling, Office, Trainiug and Workshop Kquip.ent
3.03      Port operations have remained labor intensive although the change
in cargo mix towards the need to use mechanical cargo handling (e.g.
containerization) has been steadily increasing. Gontainers and ro-ro
traffic now constitute approximately 50% of the general cargo tonnage in
Mogadishu and this form of cirgo handling is anticipated to increase
further.  Non-containerized general cargo is also gradually moving in
pre-palletised or unit loads which require the use of mechanical cargo
handling equipment. The provision of the equipment recommended for the
Iroject will not only allow SPA to cope with the form in which cargo is
increasingly being handled (containers, ro-ro, pre-palletised unit loads)
but will also result in the reduction in the general cargo gang size by 33%
(from 30 men to 21 men) (para. 6.01 (ii) (k)).- This will enable SPA to -
reduce the number of workers from the labour co-operatives.  However, in
respect of container and ro-ro operations, the project provides SPA with
cargo handling equipment-that can only cater for part of the traffic.  The
rest of the traffic will be handled by private sector interests which will
provide their own equipment, personnel and supervisors. As SPA has to go
through a learning process with regard to the more sophisticated cargo
handling systems and procedures, the Association during appraisal
recommended to the Government and SPA to encourage private sector
participation in container/ro-ro terminal operations by formalizing
arrangements with selected major shipping lines to undertake
container/ro-ro operations within a defined area set aside for this purpose
in the port in Mogadishu. During negotiations, Government advised the
Association that specific areas have been assigned to two private sector
interests to undertake container/ro-ro operations at the port of Mogadishu
and that negotiations between SPA and such interests on the terms for the
lease of the areas were in progress. The entering into arrangements by SPA
with private sector interests to participate in such operations will be a
condition of Credit effectiveness. (pars. 6.01 (i)(c)).
3.04      The project will finance the purchase of 26 forklift trucks, 10
cranes, 2 front-end loaders, 3 tractors, 6 trailers, 5000 pallets and
miscellaneous cargo handling gears and equipment; refurbishing of old
equipment; dry docking of tugs for overhaul and maintenance to comply with
required safety and performance standards and workshop equipment. These
components were determined on the basis of operational targets which were
agreed with SPA at appraisal and are shown below (para. 6.01 (ii)(o)):

average 2 working points per shift.
The performance shall be 80% of the agreed targets 1 year after

2 years and 100% after 3 years.
Cargo HandliLg quipment Availability: 75Z
Averase Annual Ship Waiting Time: 2 days, 2 years after delivery of
cargo-handling equipment provided for under the project; 1 day, 3 years
after such delivery.
(b) Port Improvement (Civil) Works:
3.05      In view of the complete lack of basic facilities for container
handling in all three ports, the project provides for paving of a container
yard (31 400 i2) at Mogadishu; construction of container freight stations
at Mogadlshu (6750 m2) and Berbera (1260 m2); construction of ro-ro ramp at
Berth 4, Mogadishu; construction of workshops and stores at Mogadishu (1060
m2) and Kismayo (310 m2) and provision of fenders for the wharves at
Mogadishu. In addition, a port training school will be constructed at
Mogadishu.
(c) Rectification of Breakwater Subsidence at Ibeadishu:
3.06      The breakwater at Mogadishu Port was constructed during 1975 and
1976 under the Second Port Project with financing from the EDP and since
then some 68 separate subsidences have occured over the 770m length of the
breakwater adjacent to the storage area behind the quay. Subsidences were
first observed during the construction period in 1975 and despite repairs
and changes in the design, the subsidence persisted. Consultants who



-24-
undertook a study on the causes of the subsidence between September 1981
and January 1983 pointed out that a collapse of the filter layers is
unpredictable and recommended two alternative solutions for early
implementation: (i) drive an interlocking steel sheet-pile through the
core at an appropriate distance from the concrete superstructure and with
improved ventilation to reduce the build-up of entrapped air pressure; or
(ii) install an adequate protective filter of synthetic filter cloth for
the length of the breakwater. Due to the non-availability of funds, the
Government of Somalia/SPA have not yet been able to execute the remedial
works. The steel sheet-pile alternative is considered to be the most
praetical and economical solution and will be adopted for the Project.
(4)  Tr*inin  and Technical Assistance
3.07      The transformation of port operations from lighterage to
alongside berth has not been followed by appropriate and systematic changes
in cargo handling systems and procedures. The provision of operational
experts in key positions will enable SPA to introduce proper systems and
procedures in port operation, maintenance of equipment and improved
financial management. The Project will also provide for training experts
whose major task will be to train and develop local instructors. The
Project provides for a total of 162 man-months of technical assistance of
which 126 man-months will be for the provision of operational experts in
on-line management positions and 36 man-months for training experts. The
composition of the proposed technical assistance package is detailed in
Annex 3.1. The technical assistance staff will be provided by a consulting
firm; the draft outline terms of reference are given in Annex 3.2. The
terms of reference were discussed and agreed with Government at
negotiations. The training requirements of SPA staff agreed during
negotiations are shown in Annex 3.3.
3.08      Apart from the new port training school to be built under the
Project (para. 3.02 (b)), arrangements will be made for training of Somali
port personnel at: (i) Bandari College in Mombasa; (ii) the Vocational
Training Institute at Mogadishu which was developed with the assistance of
GTZ; and (iii) the Somali Institute for Development, Administration and
Management (SIDAM). As agreed during appraisal, SPA has appointed a
Training Steering Committee to assist management in the determination of
courses to be conducted by the various institutes, class selection, course
scheduling and the identification of potential instructors to be trained.
Port training material developed by UNCTAD will be extensively used. To
ensure that the training effort started by the Project will be sustained,
SPA will establish and thereafter maintain a Training Fund by setting aside
a portion of its revenue (by April I of each year) to finance the annual
training budget equivalent to 0.5% of the previous year's gross revenue for
fiscal year 1987, 1% for fiscal year 1988 and 1.5% for fiscal year 1989 and
thereafter (para. 6.01 (ii) (1)). Establishment of such a Fund will be a
condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 6.01 (i)(a)).
(e) Consultant Services
3.09    - Consultants will be engaged for the purpose of supervising port
improvement (civil) works and rectification of breakwater subsidence, as
well as equipment procurement (para. 3.02 (e)). Consultants will also be
funded to undertake a study on future transport development which will
examine the transport network and distribution pattern of the country, the
role of coastal shipping and the minor ports and the institutional and



-25-
legal framework relating to international trade, shipping and
transportation with a view to instlituting appropriate changes and reforms
(para. 2.29.). The terms of reference for the study (Annex 3.8) were
discussed and agreed with Government during negotiations.
C. Cost Estimtes
3.10      The total estimated cost of the project, including contingency
allowances, is estimated at So.Sh. 3,406 million or US$24.4 million net of
taxes and duties (Table 3.1). The foreign exchange component of total
costs is estimated at US$22.6 million. SPA is exempt from local duties and
taxes on imports.
3.11      Project base costs are in May 1986 prices. Physical contingencies
to cover unforeseen quantity increases are calculated at 10% of base costs
for all items except the rectification of the breakwater subsidence where a
20% provision has been made. Price escalation for local and foreign costs
are based on projected increases in international US-dollar prices of 7.22
p.a. in 1986; 6.8% p.a. in 1987 and 1988; 7.0% in 1989; 7.1% in 1990 and 4%
p.a. in 1991 through 1994. It is assumed that any difference between
domestic and international price inflation will be offset by adjustments in
the foreign exchange rate.
3.12      The length of the implementation period is based on past
experience in port projects as reflected in the relevant standard profile
(Para 3.15). It is, however, possible that if tie project is implemented
more efficiently and with fewer delays, the implementation period could be
reduced to 3 1/2 years. This would result in project costs being reduced
by about 12%, from US$ 24.4 million to US$21.5 million.

3.13      The base costs are estimated as of Nay 1986 and have been derived
as follows:
(a)   Cargo-handling, office, training and workshop equipment,
refurbishing of old equipment and dockingof tugs:   aed
on SPA/appraisal mission estimates and recent quotations by
suppliers, and have been found reasonable.
(b) Port improvement (civil) works: Based on quantities
derived from preliminary engineering studies
carried out by consultants who did the Master Plan
Study, and unit costs on recent contrLcts in port
construction (Berbera and Kismayo). Detailed
engineering studies undertaken by consultants with
financing from DANIDA are expected to be completed
by October 1986.
(c)   Rectification of breakwater subsidence at Mogadishu:
Based on quantities and unit costs developed by
consultants who undertook the study on the causes of
the subsidence; the cost has been appropriately
adjusted to current values based on recent port
construction works.
(d)   Training and technical assistance: Based on average
man-month costs comparable to the average cost of
foreign port personnel undertaking similar tasks in
an IDA financed project in a neighboring country.
(e)   Consulting services:  The consultant services for
supervision of civil works and equipment procure-
ment have been estimated at 126 man-months, with a
total cost of US$1.14 million. Consulting services
for the study on transport development including
the role of coastal shipping and minor ports have
been estimated at 33 man-months with a total cost
of US$300,000.
D.   Finencing
3.14      The total project cost is estimated at US$ 24.4 million (net of
taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of US$22.6 million.
The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 22.6 million will finance the total foreign
exchange component of the project. The credit will be on-lent to SPA for a
period of 15 years including 5 years of grace at an interest rate of
12X p.a. SPA will bear the foreign exchange risk. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and SPA, acceptable to the
Association and incorporating these terms will be a condition of
effectiveness. Local cost of the project,estimated at US$ 1.8 million,
will be met by SPA.

B.   Iale _tation aed Procurmat
3.15      Implementation of the civil works component of the Project will
be the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works assisted by SPA which
has set up a Project Planning Unit for the purpose. Procurement of goods
and services, other than civil works, will be the responsibility of SPA
aided by consultants (paras. 3.02(e)). The implementation period for the
project is estimated at 8 years based on past experience with Bank/IDA
financed projects in the regional port sub sector as reflected in the
standard profile. However, under normal conditions, a project of this
nature and scope would be expected to take about 3 1/2 years. A target
implementation schedule is presented in Chart II. This was agreed with
Government during negotiations.
3.16      The procurement of cargo handling equipment will be timed so that
they are delivered at about the time that the workshops are expected to be
completed. The services of operational experts will be obtained as soon as
the Credit becomes effective and training experts when the Port Training
School is completed.
3.17      The new cargo handling, office, training and workshop equipment
will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Guidelines with seperate contracts for each type or
group of similar types of equipment. Refurbishing of old equipment and
docking of tugs will be procured following limited international bidding
procedures. Port improvement (civil) works and the rectification of
breakwater subsidence will be procured under unit price contracts under
separate contractsfollowing international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Guidelines with eligible domestic bidders being awarded a price
preference of 7.5%. The consultants for construction supervision,
equipment procurement and technical assistance will be employed in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants. All IDA
financed contracts will be subject to prior review.

F.   Disburseints
3.18      All requests for disbursement shall be fully documented, except
that statement of expenses will be used for contracts costing less than
US$10,000. Disbursements would be against 10OZ of foreign expenditures on
cargo handling, office, training and workshop equipment, refurbishing of
old equipment and docking of tugs and consultancy services, 822 of total
expenditures on port improvement civil works and 90% of total expenditures
on the rectification of the breakwater subsidence. An estimated schedule
of disbursement is shown in Annex 3.6.
3.19      To expedite and facilitate disbursement, a special account would
be established in a foreign commercial bank with an initial deposit of
US$400,000 representing an approximate average of four months
expenditures. Assurances were given during negotiations that appropriate
financial staff will be available to manage the account.
G.  Project Monitoring and Reporting Reqi&semnts
3*20      The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) assisted by SPA will be
responsible for submitting to the Association quarterly progress reports

containing information needed to monitor project implementation on the
civil works components.  SPA will be responsible for submission of the
quarterly reports on the procurement of goods and services and progress on
implementation in respect of all other Project components. The reports
should include detailed project expenditures and should highlight any
circumstances that may adversely affect the schedule of construction, date
of completion or project costs. SPA would be responsible for submitting to
the Association quarterly reports containing information needed to review
traffic trends, effectiveness of training, performance of expatriate
advisors, cargo handling productivity, ship waiting time, port revenues and
expenses, capital expenditure for ports other than the Project and
efficiency of maintenance operations. During credit negotiations agreement
was reached with the Government on the format and frequency of the above
reports (Annex 3.7).
3.21      During negotiations agreement was also reached with the
Government that it will submit to the ALsociation a project completion
report within six months of the credit closing date. The report will: (i)
comment on project timing, execution and cost; (ii) performance of
coitractors, supervision consultants and advisors; (iii) benefits obtained
from the Project during an initial period of operation; and (iv) updated
forecasts of port operations. The report will also comment on the
performance of the MPW and the SPA in fulfilling their respective
obligations under the Credit Agreement and on the degree of accomplishment
of the Project objectives.
H. Environmental Impact
3.22      The project will not have any adverse efiect on the present port
environment and will not pose a hazard to human well-being in the ports.

IV. EGONOIIC EVALMUTION
A. Future Trafflc
4.01      The future level of port traffic will largely be a function of
she economic recovery of Somalia, particularly the exports of livestock and
bananas and the availability of foreign exchange, donor assistance and
commodity aid to help fund the national investment program. Due to
Somalia's difficulty in earning sufficient foreign exchange to meet its
import requirements, the volume of imports will be determined to a
significant extent by the level of international aid for Sotalia.
4.02      Traffic projections based upon a recently completed study by SPA
consultants are detailed in Annex 4.1.-- Underlying assumptions for each
commodity growth rate (for each port) are given below.
4.03      In aggregate the total SPA traffic is forecasted to increase at a
iodest rate of 2% per annum with individual port throughput for Mogadishu,
Berbera and Kismayo increasing at 2%, 4% and 4% respectively (see
Table 4.1). While the growth rate for Mogadishu and Berbera is half of the
rate experienced in the past 7 years, Kismayo is expected to recover
rapidly through its livestock, bananas and molasses exports. The area
surrounding Kismayo is the most fertile in the country and Government's
agricultural program emphasizes developing this region. The Juba Valley
dam/irrigation development program, which has been under review by the
Government for many years, has not been taken into consideration in the
-analysis period. If the Juba Valley project is implemented, the associated
construction materials and other traffic generated by the project will most
likely pass through the port of Kismayo, significantly increasing its
traffic (Kismayo Port is not equiped to handle this increase both in terms
of management and operational capacity).

1/ Figures rounded to nearest one percent.
4.04      General Cargo:  The growth rate of general cargo imports through
Mogadishu has been assumed to equal the expected growth rate of GDP which
is 4 percent. For Berbera and Kismayo, a lower figure of 2.5 percent was



-32-
applied due to a lower past growth rate. It has also been assumed that a
higher proportion of general cargo will be containerized in keeping with
the shipping trend in Eastern-Africa. Thus containerization has been
assumed to increase from the current level of 50% to over 75% of total
general cargo traffic by year 2000 for Mogadishu and from 3% to 55% for
Berbera and from 2% to 55% for Kismayc for the same period. General cargo
exports (i.e. general cargo plus container traffic) for all three ports
have been assumed to be stable at the current level.
4.05      Gamut:  Cement imports (mostly from Kenya) are the largest
imported comiodity after food grain and have been increasing at a rate of
8.5% per annum for the past five years. The total annual consumption
currently is about 180,000 tons. With the opening of the Berbera cement
factory in 1986, a-large proportion of the demand for cement will be met
locally. However, the tonnage of cement handled at the ports will not
change significantly; what is altered is merely the flow pattern. Instead
of each port receiving individual shipments from Kenya, it will receive
shipments from Berbera which then becomes a major distribution center for
Somalia's cement demand. The Berbera factory has a production capacity of
180,000 tons per aninum. The annual growth rate for cement demand is
assumed to be 4% per annum or half of the growth rate for the past five
years. Output of the Berbera cement factory has been assumed at 135,000
tons per annum or 75% of the capacity.
4.06      Food Grain:  Importation of bagged foodstuff consists mainly of
grain and flour, imported commercially and as food aid (for local
consumption and for refugees). Grain production has been increasing at a
rate of about 5 percent per annum since 1975. For the purpose of this
analysis, it is assumed that the domestic production will increase at about
4 percent which is equivalent to future expected population growth and per
capita consumption growth. In terms of food grain import, it is assumed
that for Mogadishu and Kismayo, which are surrounded by relatively rich
agricultural areas, the current level of traffic will be maintained. For
Berbera, less endowed with agricultural activities and closer to many of
the refugee camps, it has been assumed to increase at 2 percent per annum.
These assumptions are predicated on the basis that the current level of
food aid will remain and that domestic grain production will expand at the
rate of increase of population.
4.07      Crude Oil and Oil Products:  Crude oil imports to the Mogadishu
refinery have been assumed to be constant at the current level of 150,000
tons per annum. The increase in demand in Mogadishu for petrol and diesel
(assumed at 3% per annum) will be met by reducing the reexport of :he
eefined products from the current level of 55,000 tons to 10,000 tons by
year 2000. Demand for other fuel, such as jet fuel, is assumed to grow at
2% per annum from the current level of 30,000 tons. For Berbera and
Kismayo, the fuel oil traffic is assumed to grow at 3% per annum which is
lower than the planned rate of economic growth. Berbera, however, will
need to import 25,000 tons of fuel oil per annum more than the current
level of consumption to meet the fuel oil requirement for the Berbera
cement factory.
4.08      Livestock:  Livestock will continue to be the single most
important export commodity for Somali% during the analysis period. After



-33-
a two year ban on cattle exports to Saudi Arabia (1983-1985), the export
prospects have returned to normal. Within the parameters of the carrrying
capacity of the land for the expanding herd, domestic demand increases and
future prospects for demand for Somalia livestock, the forecast of
livestock exports is arrived at on the basis of: (i) a 2% per annum growth
rate at Berbera and Kismayo, peaking at 75,000 tons and 13,000 tons per
annum respectively; and (ii) Mogadishu recovering to its. 1982 level of
15,000 tons per annum. The total livestock export on this basis is
forecasted to increase at less than 2 percent per annum for the analysis
period.
4.09      Baanas:  As in the case for domestic food grain production,
banana production has been recovering steadily since the liberalization of
the agricultural pricing policy by the Government. Banana exports have
nearly doubled in the past five years. The export is exclusively from
Kismayo and Mogadishu. The forecast assumes that banana exports at
Mogadishu will level off at 33,000 tons per annum while Kismayo will have a
8% per annum growth rate.
B. Projeets Benefits
4.10      Three main benefits can be discerned from the Project.  First,
the berth utilization rate in Mogadishu is currently 74% and any further
traffic growth will translate into ship waiting time exposing Somalia to
the possible imposition of surcharges. The modest mechanization program,
particularly for general and bagged cargo, will avoid the surcharges as
well as the immediate need for the construction of another berth. The
construction of another berth will not have to be considered until the year
2010 if the productivity targets set for the Project are achieved. Second,
containerization is rapidly increasing in Somalia, and given the cost
advantage, bagged cargo as well as general cargo is being containerized.
Without the mechanical cargo handling equipment proposed for the Project,
SPA will not be able to cope with this form of cargo handling. Indeed, the
procurement of container handling equipment is likely to increase the rate
of containerization leading to a more cost effective shipping service for
Somalia. Third, the increased productivity expected from the Project will
reduce ship's waiting time and consequently ship's turn around-time in
port. Thus, in general, the benefit of the Project is derived from the
improvement in the operational efficiency of cargo handling in each port in
turn, this will reduce the ship waiting and service time.
4.11      In analyzing the net economic benefits of the operational
improvements, investments relating to container/ro-ro traffic have been
distinguished from those relating to general/bagged cargo for each port.
Each investment package (by handling mode for each port) is therefore-
considered on its own. Table 4.2 (column 1) summarizes the investment
costs of each package (the breakdown of each package into equipment, civil
works and training is detailed in annex 4.2). The quantifiable benefits on
the other hand, consists of cost savings due to reduced ship waiting time
as a result of improvements in cargo handling operation. In order to
realize these benefits SPA has agreed to set performance targets which will
improve its cargo handling productivity by:



-34-
(1) 65% for general cargo; (ii) 45% for bagged cargo, and (iii) 50% for
containers (details of current and future productivities for ship output
per berth per day Is given on Annex 4.3). Estimates of reduction in ship
waiting time due to these improvements is given in Annex 4.4. The
estimates were derived based on the analytical relationships between cargo
handling productivity, berth occupancy factors and ship waiting time
developed by UNCTAD. Quantification of the benefits derived from reduction
in ship waiting time was computed using the average ship cost per day
ranging from US$ 5800-7000 for general cargo ships and US$8,600-12,000 for
ro-ro and container vessels (see Annex 4.5 for details).
4.12      In calculating the economic rate of return, half of the benefits
from reduced ship waiting time have been taken into account. There are
other benefits resulting from improved cargo handling operations such as
reduced damages and wastage but for lack of data these have not been
estimated. Table 4.2 below summarizes the investment costs and estimated
benefits for each investment package.

2/ Refer to Annex 4.2 for breakdown of investmenv components.
4.13      For the purpose of calculating the economic rate of return, total
project costs have been adjusted by excluding price contingencies; training
and technical assistance costs have been allocated to various port
investments proportionate to their respective traffic throughput; cargo
handling equipment is assumed to have a life of 7 years, and the cost of
replacement and annual maintenance and fuel costs have been included.



-35-
4.14      Based on the above benefits and costs, and assuming a 20 year
life, on a best estimate basis, the project yields a quantifiable economic
rate of return of 21% to 46% on the various investment packages with an
overall rate of return of 32%. The estimates show that the rate of return
for container handling operations is appreciably lower than the general
cargo operations. This is due to the larger civil work's investment
required to establish the container operations (i.e. construction of
container stacking area and container freight station). Similar
investmenzs required for general cargo operations (i.e. construction of
warehouses), have already been made and only minor works is required under
this project.

4.15      Apart from the investments necessary to improve the cargo
handling operation, the Project includes a component to rectify the
subsidence of the Mogadishu breakwater. The rectification is needed to
correct a shortcoming in the design of the breakwater which was constructed
under a previous Project for which a justification was made at the time the
Project was approved (para. 3.06). Without the rectification, the filter
layers of the breakwater could collapse with a catastrophic impact on
existing facilities and investments. The benefit of the rectification is
the saving of the investments in the existing facilities which would be
lost if the breakwater collapses. These consequential losses are so large
(estimated US$38.63 million in 1986 prices) vis a vis the investment
required to rectify the problem-(US$3.52 million in 1986 prices including
physical contingency) that an economic rate of return analysis was not
carried out.
C. *Sensitiviety A y18
4.16      A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the project, based on the
following scenarios:
(i)    best estimate using 50% of the benefits derived from a
reduction in ship waiting and service time and traffic



-36-
growth of 2%, 4% and 4% for Mogadishu, Berbera and Kismayo
respectively;
(ii)    investment cost increases by 50%;
(iii)    no traffic growth; and
(iv)    combination of (ii) and (iii) of above.
4.17      The result of the sensitivity analysis is shown in Table 4.3.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the project, under the worst scenario
of a cost increase of 50% and no growth in traffic will yield a rate of
return ranging from 10 to 21% for the various investment packages. The
investments are therefore considered well justified.
D. Project Risks
4.18      The first risk is that the even modest growth in traffic forecast
will not materialize. This, however, has been taken into consideration
through the 'no traffic growth' scenario in the sensitivity analysis. The
second risk is a cost increase. Although the possibility of a cost
increase exists, the probability of costs substantially exceeding the
estimates is not likely in this Project. All three ports have had major
construction works in recent periods and have good cost data and these form
the basis upon which the costs of civil works under the Project are
estimated. The third risk is that the increase in productivity targetted
for the project as a result of the investments in cargo handling equipment
and institutional development will not materialize even at the modest rate
projected. This possibility is being minimized by the Project's
comprehensive training program with heavy reliance on courses and materials
developed by institutions with proven track records in training (e.g.
UNCTAD, SIDAN and the GTZ sponsored Industrial Vocational Training Center
in Mogadishu).

V. FINANCIAL IVALUATION
A. Historic inianial Performance
5.01      The recent financial performance of SPA is detailed in Annex 5.1
and 5.2 and highlights and key operating ratios are illustrated in
Table 5.1 below.
Table S 1 SPA - ESum     Of Recent Fiuancial Performance
1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984
Revenues              123.7   130.8   133.5   152.4   181.3   266.4
Working Profit         76.0    82.0    82.6    90.1   108.0   180.3
Pretax Profit          63.2    70.1    64.2    74.1    92.0   164.5
Working Ratio (Z)      48.9    46.4    51.9    51.4    49.2    38.2
5.02      The financial performance of SPA as disclosed in its annual
accounts for the period 1979 to 1984 appears very satisfactory. The
working ratio was broadly maintained at a satisfactory level between 1979
and 1983 and improved substantially in 1984 as a result of the combined
effect of a tariff increase implemented in 1983 and the recovery of cargo
throughput from the depressed levels of 1983. SPA's liquidity remained
good throughout the period with the current ratio improving from 1.5 in
1979 to 1.9 in 1984 despite cumulative remittances of So.Sh. 455 millions
in corporate taxes and dividends to the Government out of cumulative cash
generation of SoSh 619 million between 1979 and 1984.
5.03      This apparently satisfactory performance, however, masks the
serious deterioration in SPA's financial performance in real terms over the
period. The apparently good financial performance together with inadequate
accounting capabilities within SPA inhibited the revision of tariffs in
line with domestic inflation over the period. Tariffs have been revised
only three times between 1977 and early 19851/ and have only partially
offset underlying increases in operating and"capital costs.  By 1985,
shipside tariffs2/, payable wholly in US dollars, had declined by 46% in
dollar terms on the 1977 levels (an increase of only 158Z in So. Sh. terms
compared to cumulative domestic inflation of about 900% over the period).
1/   In 1977 when the tariff structure was established; in December 1982;
and in January 1985.
2/   Comparisons are based on Mogadishu port tariffs; however, tariff
increases have been based on proportionate-increases which are uniform
for the 3 major ports.



- 38 -
Shore handling charges payable in domestic currency increaoed by only 60X
over the period. Only stevedoring charges, payable partly in domestic
currency, have been largely maintained in US dollar terms and even this
represents a significant erosion in real terms in domestic currency (see
Annex 5.6 for comparative tariff levels analysis). Against this
background, the real return on net fixed assets declined from around 16% in
1979 to zero in 19843/ as compared to the nominal return in 1984 of 48%.
Importantly, the respectable working ratios were achieved largely at the
cost of severe compression in real wages and salaries with attendant
adverse consequences for labour productivity and morale.
5.04      Moreover, despite the significant erosion in shore handling
charges, SPA has had to devote a significant and increasing proportion of
its free cash flow to financing the indebtedness of other state agencies
and civil service departments to it on account of shore handling services.
As a result, debtors as a proportion of turnover increased from a high 411
in 1979 to 62% in each of the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 and declined
thereafter to 53% in 1983 and further to 42% in 1984 only because the
December 1982 tariff increases were heavily weighted towards prompt paying
vessel owners and their agents.
5.05      Finally, despite its status as one of the country's major foreign
exchange earners, SPA has experienced increasing difficulties in acquiring
foreign currency to meet its routine capital expenditure and spares
requirements because of the country's severe foreign exchange shortage and
the Government's strict rationing of available foreign exchange.
This has severely affected equipment availability and led to concommitant
declines in overall port productivity.
B. Financial ObJectives
5.06      The SPA's financial objectives are:  (1) to ensure through
appropriate pricing and cost control measures the efficient utilization of
the fixed assets and cther resources vested in it; (ii) to generate
adequate returns for the Government on its investment in the ports; and
(iii) to generate a sufficiently high level of free cashflow to cover its
routine recurrent and capital expenditures. In pursuit of these objectives
the SPA has been subject to some constraints. The most important of these
constraints have been: (a) statutorily defined distribution obligations to
Government including the proportion of profits SPA can retain; (b)
restrictions on SPA's ability to pay its workforce as it deems appropriate;
(c) restrictions on the abi-lity of SPA to revise tariffs; and (d)
constraints on the SPA's access to its foreign currency requirements.
5.07      The broad financial objectives are considered appropriate during
the proposed Project period. Some of the constraints, in particular those
on tariff setting and access to foreign currency, have had a deleterious
effect on the ports operating and financial performance (paras. 5.03 and
5.05). These adverse effects have been exacerbated by SPA's inability to
3/   Based on the revaluation of fixed assets undertaken in December 1984
as part of the Master Plan Study.



- 39 -
recognize the underlying deterioration in the ports' performance due to an
inadequate information system and lack of skilled accounting staff to
operate the basic but adequate management and financial accounting system
designed for SPA by consultants in 1977 (para. 2.31). Under the proposed
Project, specific changes in the existing institutional arrangements
governing tariff setting and the SPA's access to foreign currency will be
sought (para. 5.15). In addition, the proposed Project will seek to
strengthen the SPA's accounting, financial management and management
information system through a -program of technical assistance and training
(para. 2.33).
C.  P?oiections of Financial Performuce                -
5.08      The financial projections for SPA for the period 1985 to 1994 are
detailed in Annexes 5.3 to 5.5 and summarized in Table 5.2. The
projections, which are in current So.Sh. terms, are based on the traffic
projections detailed in Chapter IV. The detailed print-out of the
financial models used is available in the Project file. The key
assumptions used are that: (i) US dollar and So.Sh. denominated tariffs
are revised annually from 1986 and semi annually from 1989 to reflect
respectively the rate of foreign inflation (MUV index) and domestic
inflation in the elapsed year; (ii) structural tariff increases of the
following magnitude are implemented in 1988: US dollar denominated
shipside tariffs other than for stevedoring + 85%; stevedoring fees + 35%;
shore handling charges + 175%; (iii) fixed assets are revalued annually
using the domestic inflation rate as a proxy for changes in the specific
prices of the ports' fixed assets; (iv) labour utilization in the ports
follows broadly the targets agreed with SPA and outlined in para. 3.04; in
addition wages and salaries are annually adjusted to reflect the prior
years rate of domestic inflation and the excess of wages paid per unit ton
performed over the contract payments is progressively reduced from 150% of
contract payments in 1985 to 75% in 1988 and thereafter - this allows for a
substantial increase in the real wage of the casual work force; (v) the
free market exchange rate of the So. Sh. vis-a-vis the US dollar is
determined on a (trade unweighted) purchasing power parity basis; the
current foreign exchange regime in which SPA has participated since October
1985 and under which exporters are entitled to retain 65% of their foreign
currency revenues and surrender %he balance at the official exchange rate
is maintained through the projection period (the official rate is
assumed equal to 50% of the market exchange rate). These assumptions are
considered reasonable.

with 5 yeas gace peiod at 12% p.a.; SPA w    aseam  the forei o    rLsk.
5.09       The projections indicate a material improvement in SPA's working
performance.  The working ratio improves from an estimated 38% in 1985 to
an average of about 17% p.a. between 1990 and 1995.  As a result, cash
generation is st.rong with cumulative cash generated amounting to
So.Sh. 14,785 million over the projection period 1985 to 1995.  Debt
service coverage is also satisfactory over the projection period which
includes the first year after full Project implementation.
5.10      Notwithstanding this good working performance the rate of return
on SPA's net fixed assets, after excluding the cost of the recently
completed Berbera quay extension and the expected cost of the
rahabilitation of Kismayo port from the asset base, averages only 5.7%
between 1990 and 1995.  Inclusion of these costs in the asset base reduces
the projected rate of return to an average of 3.3% between 1990 and 1995.
This low rate of return relative to the substantial degree of cash
generation reflect mainly 3 factors: {i) the ports of Kismayo and Berbera
have fixed (infrastructural) assets significantly in excess of the



- 41 -
requirements of their forecast levels of cargo throughput; (ii) the old
port of Mogadishu, which houses the SPA's headquarters, has substantial
infrastructural assets which either have alternative uses but are
substantially underutilized or are effectively sunk investments with the
development of the new port; and (iii) the development of Mogadishu's new
port, which is not in a sheltered harbor, entailed substantial investments
in construction of a breakwater (the breakwater represented, as of December
1984, about 40% of the gross replacement cost of all fixed assets in
Mogadishu's new port and 16% of SPAs total fixed assets similarly valued).
The rate of return on net fixed assets at Mogadishu's new port where
infrastructural assets are well-sized for the prospective level of traffic
is projected at about 7% p.a. between 1990 and 1995 (excluding the cost of
the breakwater). Under this project IDA will seek assurances that any new
investments (particularly infrastructural ones) in the commercial ports are
both economically and financially justified (para. 2.26).
5.11      The rates of return on net fixed assets, although relatively low,
are however, consistent with the SPA being able to generate sufficient
resources to meet its financial and operating objectives (para 5.06).
Accordingly, it is recommended that under the proposed Project, agreement
be reached with the Government and SPA that SPA will set its tariffs so as
to achieve a rate of return on its net fixed assets in use as annually
revalued of at least 5% p.a. from January 1989 (para. 6.01 (ii) (f)).
Further, to facilitate attainment of such a return, agreement was reached
during negotiations that SPA will provide to IDA by March 31, 1987 a plan
for phased tariff increases to be implemented between July 1986 and
December 1988; such increases will be of a magnitude to enable SPA to
achieve the agreed rate of return; thereafter, tariffs will be reviewed
semi-annually and adjusted to meet the rate of return objective as
necessary (paras. 6.01 (ii) (g) and (h)).
5.12      The projections also indicate that remittances to the Government
in the form of corporate taxes and dividends will be significantly reduced
from the levels they would otherwise have been without adequate (inflation
adjusted) depreciation provisions. The projected cumulative pay-out to the
Government in dividends and corporate taxes over the period 1985 to 1995 is
So.Sh 3568 million out of cumulative cash generation over the same period
of So.Sh 14785 million. This represents 24% of cumulative cash generation
as compared to 74% of cash generation paid out to the Government in the
previous 6 years. However, this increase in the proportion of cash
generation retained by SPA carries little practical significance.
Currently, the distinction between the SPA as an (autonomous) entity and
the Government's interest in SPA as a proprietor is at best a blurred one:
the SPA is not endowed with autonomous cash management responsibilities and
all but a small proportion of cash generation is either distributed to
Government as dividends, paid in as corporate taxes or deposited with the



- 42 -
Ministry of Finance on an interest-free basis. Hence, the effective
distribution to the Government will still be very high notwithstanding the
low dividend and tax payments. This high level of dlstribution does not
matter in principle so long as it is consistent with SPA being left with
sufficient resources and autonomy to operate effeciently. This has not
been the case in the past. However, the Government has indicated that the
existing institutional relationship between government and government-owned
enterprises (ineluding SPA) is under review and may be subject to change in
a direction that will enhance the financial and operating autonomy of these
enterprises. In addition, during negotiations, the Aasociation was
informed that: (i) measures have been taken to reduce the proportion of
SPA's retained cash currently devoted to financing involuntarily other
Government agencies indebtedness to SPA (para. 5.13); and that (ii)
arrangements will be devised whereby SPA will effectively be able to use
its retained cashflowto purchase equipment, spares and supplies required
for efficient operations from overseas (para. 5.15).
5.13      The projections are also based on the assumption that from 1986
debtors at year-end will represent 16% of turnover (58 days). By decree,
inter-Government-owned enterprises' indebtedness should not exceed 45
days. However, outstanding indebtedness of other Government-owned
enterprises and Government departments to SPA has been running
significantly in excess of this (para 5.04). It is reco_mended that the
provision by SPA and the Government of a detailed plan for the phased
reduction of such overdue debts over a period of time acceptable to IDA be
made a condition for Credit effectiveness (para. 6.01 (i) (e)).

5.15      These projections indicate that SPA's net foreign currency
revenues after foreign currency expenses and mandated foreign currency
surrenders will range from US$ 0.7 million to US$ 3.5 million p.a. over the
projection period. Under prevailing and expected balance of payments
conditions over the projection period, there is little justification for
SPA retention of this balance of foreign exchange earnings in foreign
currency.  However, since timely and certain access to foreign exchange
will be particularly important under the proposed Project which will
considerably increase the capital intensity of port operations, the
Association obtained the agreement of the Government during negotiations
that SPA will maintain until the completion of the Project, a special
account in a commercial bank outside Somalia and shall deposit therein an
amount in dollars sufficient to meet its annual needs for spare parts and
equipment (paras. 6.01 (i) (b) and 6e01 (ii) (m)).  The total amount to be
deposited in the account each year will be determined in advance based on 3
yearly forecasts of foreign currency expenses to be provided each year by
SPA to the Ministry of Finance and the Association for approval. Any
excess of



- 44 -
retainable foreign currency over agreed amounts to be deposited in the
external account in any year will be subject to surrender by SPA to the
Ministry of Finance at the prevailing market rate of exchange.
Establishment by SPA of an external account will be condition of credit
effectiveness (para. 6.01(i)(b).
5.16      Qverall, with agreements on:  (i) returns on net fixed assets in
use (para. 5.11); (ii) settlement of overdue debts to SPA (para 5.13);
(iii) access to foreign exchange (para 5.15); and (iv) the partial
restoration of 1977 real tariff levels and, based on the assumptions used
in the projections - which are considered reasonable - SPA should be able
to attain, in a satisfactory manner, its objectives (para. 5.06).
Other Pinancial Covenants
5.17      During negotiations agreement was reached with SPA that during
the proposed Project implementation period: (a) no additional capital
expenditure beyond the So.Sh. equivalent of US 0.5 million would be
undertaken without IDA agreement; and (b) no additional debt would be
contracted if the debt service obligation on such debt will result in the
debt service cover for all debt in any year falling below 4x (paras. 6.01
(ii)(i) and (j)).

3.        The Borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to be
submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Closing
Date.
4.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation by
the Borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project. In particular, the PCR
should include an assessment of the following:
a)  the performance by the Borrower and the Association of their
respective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether
the Association could have been more helpful;
b) the results that can be expected from the project, as compared
with expectations at appraisal, and whether the original expec-
tations were realistic; and
c)  whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could have
been done better.
5.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return was
estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculation should be
as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a minor
portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex with the
relevant information supporting this analysis should be Included.

PORT MODERNIZATION PROJECT
TRANSPORT STUDY - TERMS OF REFERENCE
INTRODUCTION
1.        The improvement of transport system is a vital factor to the
economic and social development of any nation. This Is in fact very true
in developing countries like Somalia where transport facilities and
services are very limited and hence where there is urgent need for the
development of the various modes of transportation, the institutions and
the practices of the trade.
2.        The Ministries of Ports and Marine Transport (MPMT), Land and Air
Transport (MLAT) and Public Works (MPW) are entrusted with among other
responsibilities the task of planning, implementing and maintaining
transport infrastructure and facilities, licensing and regulating land, air
and water transport services and organizations, providing transport
services and ensuring a coordinated and integrated development and
4)peration of all modes of transport and other services.
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
3.       The primary objective of the study is to enable the Government of
Somalia to foster and undertake a rational development of its transport
facilities and services. In pursuant of this objective the study should:
a.    provide a 10-year national transport sector plan (1987-1997) to
serve the national economic plan/policies, and to promote optimal
and balanced regional development;
b.    recommend policies for effective coordination of the transport
sector, for optimal inter modal-mix and for minimization of
resource costs including development of energy-efficient modes of
transport;

facilities and syste_s), the level of their operating efficiency,
the potential of non-transport options or substitutes, and the
comparative economic and operational advantages of each mode;
e. investigate the potential for development of additional services
(e.g. bunkering, fisheries, etc.) to be provided by the port sub-
sector;
f.  outline strategy and policy guidelines that promote the
development of optimal lntermodal-mix to adequately satisfy
traffic demand;
g.  prepare policy guidelines for optimal investment decisions and
for proper handling of user charges, pricing and subsidiary
issues;
h. analyse present sector responsibilities of EPW, MPMT and MLAT,
their organization and staffing and prepare necessary
institutional change(s) which vill improve efficiency and
positively affect the sector management
L.  study and review carefully the MMPT and HAT role in coordinating
and managing the sector and recommend major policy decisions for
achieving their objectives. Specifically, recommend efficient
measures on how to improve MPHT and MAT planning, coordinating

tariff management and physical distribution system Including
efficient facilitation, documentation, packing and unitization
techniques both for domestic and foreign trade traffic and for
oombined transport operators;
a. recommend measures for strengthening data base for the sector of
transport both at the ministerial and organizational level and
develop the necessary technical, economic and other conditions
for collecting, processing, storage, retrieval and use of the
essential sectoral data at ministerial level for proper planning,
coordination and operational efficiencyg
a. assess manpower needs at all levels of skills and lay down an
outline for a systematic and coordinated strategy for manpower
development in the sector;
