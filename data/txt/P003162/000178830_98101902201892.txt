INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOITMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA FOR A
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Zambia for the equivalent of US$33.0 million to help
finance a project for agricultural, health and general education. The loan
would have a term of 25 years, including 10 years of grace, with interest
at 7-¼ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONO1Y
2.         A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Zambia" was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 18, 1973 (R73-11). A
summary of this report is presented below along with an account of develop-
ments since January which may adversely affect    the general level of economic
activity and the availability of resources.
3.         The economy of Zambia is dominated by the copper industry, which
contributes nearly 40 percernt of GDP, 95 percent of exports and, up to 1970,
60 percent of government revenue. It follows that the world copper price
has a large and pervasive effect on the economy. Since independence in
1964, copper prices have been notoriously unstable, fluctuating between
1700 and K1,300 per ton. Because the government has no adequate instruments
to insulate itself from the vagaries of the copper market, the economy is
inherently unstable.
4.         GNP per capita is relatively high (estimated at $355 in 1971),
but there is a distinct contrast between the modern sector and the tradi-
tional rural sector. The modern sector is concentrated in the Copperbelt
Province where the mining activity is located, and along the "line-of-rail"
which is the central area of the country where European farmers settled in
the colonial era and a number of industries have been established. Almost
half the population lives ir, the Copperbelt and near the line-of-rail, and
is involved in the modern sector. The rest of the population is scattered
over the country and is mainly engaged in small-scale agriculture.
5.         Since independence the government's main economic and social
goals have been, firstly, to narrow the gap between urban and rural stand-
ards of living by increasing the productivity of small-scale agriculture,
and secondly, to raise the general level of education, as well as develop
a wide range of technical, administrative and managerial skills to lessen



the dependence on expatriate expertise. The expansion of education facili-
ties has been inpressive since independence, but in spite of t1h's the
shortage of' educated and skilled manpower has remained Zambia's most impor-
tant structural constraint in economic development. Little progress was
made in improving the standards of living of the raral population. The
main reasons for this were the decisions, in 1965, to sever the ties with
Southern Rhodesia, following that coauntry's unilateral declaration of
independence (UDI), and in 1968, to assume state con'trol over most of the
important sectors of the economy. These decisions caused a major shift in
priorities and a great strain on the admintstrative capacity of the country.
6.          In the Second National Development Plan 1972-1976
(SNDP), the general economic and social goals, mentioned above are
restated.  However, the Plan recognizes that in Spite of all effort which
might be made to stop the flow of people leaving r.ral areas, this will not
prevent all such movements. It uherefore stresses the need to further
develop the modern sector, including mining. In the past, expenditure for
agriculture was thinly spread over the country, with little impact anywhere.
Under the END-" the government intends to concentrat,e its efforts in a
number of areas with sufficient potential wvihere an i ntegra-ted approach to
ru-ral developmecnt will be attempted.
7.          Economic developments in 1970 and 1971 are in sharp contrast
with those up to 1969. Between 1964 and 1969, gross national income at
constant prices grew on the average by almost 17 percent a year. More than
half of th~is increase, however, resulted from the improvement in terms of
trade, (rising copper prices), 15 percent from a relative decline of factor
payments abroad, and 5.5 - 6 percent from the physical increase in production
(GDP).  The sharp increase in world copper prices had placed Zambia in a
strong financial position.  The government's budget and the balance of pay-
ments produced growning surpluses. In the course of 1970, however, the eco-
nomic tide turned as a result of a combination of unfavorable factors.
8.          The two most irmportant factors were no doubt the sharp decline
in copper prices in the second half of 1970 from K1200 to K780 a ton and, in
September 1970, the partial flooding of the Mufulira mine which accounted
for 25 percent of Zambia's copper output. As a result of lower copper
prices and production losses, the value of copper output in 1971 was 40
percent lower tharn in 1969.GNP Per capita is est1mated to have fallen from
$425 in 1960 to about $355 in 1971.
9.          The decline in prices and output of coppar had, of course, also
strong adverse effects on government re-venue and the balance of payments.
The deterioration in the budgetary situation, however, was compounded by
two additional factors: first, recurrent expenditures had been allowed to
increase sharply, and, second, government revenue from the mining sector
declin-d also sharply because of newi capital allcuances granted under the



-3-
1969 14aster Agreement governing state participation in the mining industry.
Previously, 'capital depreciation allowances were based on estimated asset
life, but, in order to boost production from some 700,000 tons at present
to some 900,000 tons by 1976, all capital expenditure was made tax deduct-
ible in the year it occurs. This will result in lower revenue in the
medium-term, but increase the tax base substantially after completion of
the expansion program in 1976. As a result of the factors mentioned above,
the recurrent budget, which in 1970 still had a surplus of K176 million -
more than enough to finance all development expenditures - showed a deficit
of K18 millio-n in 1971. Foreign reserves declined from a peak of K.32
million in August 1970 to Knoo million by June 1972 (3 months' imports),
but this sharp decline cannot be explained by the unfavorable development
of prices and output of copper alone. There can be little doubt that legal
and illegal capital flight has increased since 1969. In 1971 alone, it
may have amounted to more than K100 million, most likely in reaction to the
government's decision to have the ccantry's retail and wholesale business
transferred to Zambian ownership.
10.       During 1972, the government took a number of steps to restore
financial balance. To improve the balance of payments, imports of certain
luxury goods and consumer goods that are also produced locally were prohi-
bited, and a surtax on dutiable imports was introduced. Exchange control
regulations were tightened, including measures to curb capital flight. Pre-
liminary indications are that these measures have had some success; since
June, 1972 tne level of external reserves has remained stable at an equiva-
lent of somewhat over two months' imports. To improve the budgetary situation,
new tax measures were introduced in the 1972 and 1973 budgets. Austere
spending policies reduced recurrent expenditure in 1972 by nearly 2 percent.
These policies are to be continued in 1973. Nevertheless, it
appears unlikely that the government will be able to generate any budgetary
savings in 1973. Although by the mid-1970s a substantial increase in
mining revenue can be expected as a result of the expansion program current-
ly underway, a continuation of the government's policy of increasing non-
mining tax revenue and, at the same time, containing recurrent expenditures
is necessary if the government is to make a substantial financial contribu-
tion to its own development budget once again.
11.         To limit deficit financing, government development expenditure
was severely cut in 1972 and 1973 to a level of some K115 million in both
years as compared to levels originally intended under the Second National
Development Plan 1972-1976 of some K175 million in 1972 and K185 million in
1973. In 1972, the goverrnment was ill-prepared for the need to cut develop-
ment expenditure. Cuts were made in an indiscriminate way without proper
consultation with spending ministries with the result that some severe
disruption in ongoing priority programs occurred. In 1973, the determination
of priorities has been made in a far more rational and selective manner.



-14 -
Preference has been given to the compleUion of ongoing high-priority projects,
such as those supporting the copper expansion program and education. Projects
of relatively low priority such as new roads, improvements and extensions of
airports and government office buildings have been postponed. The government
has recently begun to redefine priorities and levels of development expenditure
for the remainder of the plan period (1974-76) in the light of the expected
resource availability.
12.        The government is now actively seeking foreign assistance for
projects for t.he execution of high priority development programs that it
originally intencLed to finance domestically.  But the goverrnment will have
great difficulty during the next two or three years in providing local
counterpart funds to foreign loans, and especially in projects where the
foreign exchange component is low, some local cost finarncing by external
agencies is required.  It will also take some time before disbursements from
new foreign loans will become available. In the interim, to keep deficit
financing within tolerable bouncas and to prevent further cuts in the develop-
ment program, it woulc appear necessary for Zambia to seek quick-disbursing
non-project aid.
13.        Zambia's immediate economic future is clouded by the closure of
the border between Zambia and Rhodesia last January. With the help of a United
Nations Special Paission, the government is drawing up an emergency program to
maintain the country's transport capacity unti'l the Tan-Zam Railway between
Dar es Salaam and Zambia opens in 1975 or 1976. The direct and indirect
econormic costs of the border closure are difficult to evaluate. Volume of
exports might not be adversely affected, but since t+he tonnage of imports is
roughly twice that of exports, it will be much more difficult to maintain the
normal level of imports.   Therefore, in the short-term, scarcity of raw
materials, internediate goods and equipment is likely to affect the level of
production. Houwever, no decline is expected in copper production from the 1972
level.  The recent increase in copper price may actually lead to an increase in
the value of exports.  With lower imports, production in the rest of the economy
would fall and cause a loss in government revenue, thereby exacerbating the
already precarious budgetary position.
11i.       The estimated direct cost of the emergency is still highly
uncertain. The Zambian government estimates that in order to maintain the flow
of strictly essential imports, an additional budgetairy outlay of about K44 mil-
lion woula be necessary in 1973. To cover the foreign exchange cost it has
actively tried to mooilize loans and grants from various governments as well
as suppliers' credits. Indications are that the necessary amounts will be
forthcoming. To cover the local cost connected with the emergency the govern-
ment intends to increase its borrowing from the non-banking sector and in the
Euro-Dollar market, thereby avoiding a diversion of funds intended for the
development bucget.



15.        Because of its considerable mineral and agricultural development
potential, Zambia's longer-term economic prospects are good despite her
dependence on copper and her landlocked position so far from markets, provided
she continues successfully to weather the recent econonic and political
storms. In the future, Zambia's need to borrow will be much greater than in
the past.  Because  of limited borrowing in the past, Zaxnbiats debt   l-
service obligations are low. Thus, there is considerable scope for further
borrowing abroad at conventional terms. If, for example, Zambia contracts
foreign loans in the amount of K175 million on the average each year from
1973 through 1985, which would be well above the level of borrowing in the
recent past, the debt service ratio would still not exceed 10 percent by
1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.        The Bank has made thirteen loans to Zambia and IFC one investment.
Four loans were made for railways and electric power before Zambia became in-
dependent and are guaranteed by the UK as well as Zambia. 'fter independence,
four loans were made for agricultural development, two for education, twto
for highways, and one for the Kariba North hydro-electric station. Total
lending to date has been $178.6 million after cancellations, of which $83.9
million is for electric power, $47.2,million for transportation, $22.7 million
for education and $24.8 million for agriculture. Six loans are fully disbursed
and the first loan made in 1953 (No. 74-RN), was repaid in full in February, 1972.
The IFC made its first investment in Zambia in February, 1972, providing $1.1
million for expansion of a shoe manufacturing company. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank and IFC operations as of April 30, 1973 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.      Progress on Bank operations in Zambia has been adversely affected by
the difficulties Zambia has faced over the past few years. The Unilateral
Declaration of Independence in Southern Rhodesia in 1965 forced Zambia to
sever her close ties with Southern Rhodesia at a considerable cost and dis-
ruption to the development program. Shortage of educated and skilled man-
power has interfered with progress on some projects while recent cost esca-
lations have caused difficulties on others, especially the Kariba North Bank
project. Finally, the sharp fall in copper prices forced the government to
rephase capital expenditures on the first education project for which the
government is providing 52% of project cost (see Annex II). The recent
border closure, however, is not expected to cause significant delays on Bank
financed projects as the government is giving transport priority to goods
required for development projects supporting the mining industry, education
and agriculture.
185        We propose to continue assisting Zambia in achieving its develop-
ment objectives of (a) improving rural conditions and increasing productive
employment in order to gradually correct the rural-urban imbalance; (b)
making Zambia self-sufficient in foodstuffs of all kinds; (c) diversifying
the economy to reduce the country's overwhelming dependence on copper; and



-6 -
(d) improving levels of skill and training and thus, inter alia, make the
country less dependent on expatriate personnel.
19.          A mixed farming project, aiming at increasing maize, sunflower
and beef produlction to national self-sufficiency, has been appraised, and
an integrated rural development project in areas of high agricult-ural potential
has been identified. To meet growing mining and other industrial demand for
energy essential in diversifying the economy, I intend to    shortly
present to the Board a loan to help finance the Kahue hydro-electric project.
Assistance in telecommunications and urban development is also envisaged.
And, in addition to the present project, further assistance to the education
sector is expectedp primarily for technical education.
20.          To maintain its development momentum in the face of the current
financial crLsis, Zambia has asked the Bank for a program loan to finance its
immedIlate resources gap. A special economic mission to Zambia in January
appraised the gcovernment's investment program and fiscal efforts. I expect
to uresent a program loan to the Executive DirectorE for approval shortly.
PART III - HMNAN PRESOURCES
General Education
21.          At independence in 1964, Zambia had only about 100 university
graduates and some 1,200 with a secondary school leaving certificate. Today,
primary education, which consists of seven years of schooling, is provided
on a country-wide basis for some 80 percenat of the age group of whom about
20 percent go on to secondary schools. 'Secondary education, which consists
of three years lower and two years upper cycle education, is provided for
about 56,000 pupils or 12 percent of the age group. About 50 percent of
the students are enrolled in boarding schools which are established in rural
areas nationwide and admit on average 80 percent from the region. The re-
maining 20 percent come from other regions as part of government's strategy
to reduce tribal disparities.  Education programs aLmed at rapid Zambianization
at all levels have been partially successful in middle and lower categories,
but most professional positions are still held by expatriates,   For example,
only 4 percent of the medical doctors, 30 percent of the engineers, and 12
percent of the secondary school teachers are Zambians. Zambia's heavy
reliance on expatriate staff is estimated to cost more than KlhO million a
year, of which at least half is remitted abroad, in addition to extensive
fringe benefits.
22.          The expansion in primary, secondary and higher education during
the First National Development Plan 1968-72 (FNDP) was consistent with man-
power projections at that time. However, the recent economic difficulties
have slowed down economic expansion, and hence creation of jobs, so that the
present job market, particularly for secondary school leavers, -;s weak.  It
is estimated that there will be a surplus of secondary school leavers in the



-7-
mid-seventies, although this will be replaced by a shortage in the late
seventies or early eighties. The government has therefore slowed down the
rate of secondary school expansion; enrollments in 1971 were some 15% below
the estimates made during' the appraisal of the first education project and
will be further reduced as a result of the slow down in the construction
rate of secondary schools in the first education project (see Annex II).
23.          The rapid increase in enrollment in primary education during
the FNDP was achieved at the expense of quality. High pupil:teacher ratio
(50:1), many triple session schools and use of unsatisfactary buildings
resulting in poor school attendance, were contributing factors. Standards
at secondary level are also low, at least as measured by failure rates in
the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examination which students take
at the completion of the upper cycle.- The government is determined to improve
the relevance and quality of education, both for those who continue in the
school system and for those who leave it at the lower levels, by changing
the highly academic curricula to ones that are more related to the skills
required for Zambia. The curricula of upper primary schools will now empha-
size social studies, environmental sciences (including agriculture), home
crafts and other practical subjects. And in secondary school education, a
diversified curriculum, including agricultural, commercial, home economics
and technical courses, is being introduced with Bank assistance (see para.31 )
to prepare the majority of students, who do not seek further education, for
a productive life as soon as they leave the school system. In addition,
the government is aiding non-formal education through pilot projects which
attempt to closely relate primary and post-primary education to community
development and vocational training.
Medical Education
24.          Zambia has a good climate. Few diseases arise from climatic
conditions, but average life expectancy is nevertheless low mainly due to
malnutrition which is widespread, resulting in high infant mortality rate
(in Zambia 160 out of 1,000 children die before the age of one, compared to
1h0 in India and 15 in Japan), protein-calorie deficiency and reduced resis-
tance to other diseases. Anemia is an alarming problem especially among
infants; and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and bilharzia, are endemic.
Shortage of water causes low hygienic standards. The drift to the towns from
rural areas results in the creation of crowded shanty towns around cities,
which in turn generate their own disease-prone conditions.
25.          These  diseases can be controlled with appropriate measures, and
the government has taken numerous steps. During the FDP, the number of
rural health centers and clinics increased from about 343 to 553 and hospitals
from 51 to 75. In 1967 the government created the National Commission on
Food and Nutrition to initiate nutrition programs such as surveys, supplementary
feeding in day schools, diploma courses at the lIatural Reousrses Development
College to train women for nutrition work in the subsistence secotor, and
communication programs to educate the public about dietary needs. Mosquito
and tse-tse fly-infested areas have been subject to continuous spraying,
and a prograxii of providing rural water supplies to avoid contact with
bilharzia carriers was initiated.



- 8 -
26.          The rapid construction of health faci.Lities during the F-DP
was, however, not accompanied 'oy adequate manpower training, and shortage
of m.edical personnel is now even more acute0  About 3:3 percent of professional
and technical medical personnel are non-Zambian; in 1971 only 20 out of 530
doetors and only 110 out of the 540 registered nurses and midwives in govern-
ment medical services were Zamboians . The Second Five-Year Development Plan
affords priority to training of medical personnel and precedence to preven-
tive over curat ve medicine0 The proposed project is intended to alleviate
the more imnediate training constraints for various levels of nursing and
auxiliary staf.f .
Agricultural Education
27.          Zambian society is characterized by a mrarked difference in
standards between urban and rural living. For about half of the population
small-scale traditional agriculture offers the only means of livelihood. The
average per capita gro3s national income in 1971 was estimated at $355.
However, in the traditional sector it was not more than $100 per capita, as
compared to some $600 in the modern sector.  The vast difference in rural
and urban living standards and the contirnuirig lack of opportunities in rural
areas have caused heavy migration of working-age people from the land to the
mining tol,ns or areas where employment opportunit-es exist.
28.          Ever since independence the government's social and economic
objectivte has been to narrow t.he gap between urban and rural incomes.  But
the rural development programs initiated in many parts of the country over
the past few years have suffered from lack of adequately qualified local
staff.  Until 1968 there was no university-level and onlv one intermediate-
level trairnng institution.  The Ministry of Rural Development has over the
years built up an agricultural staff totalling some 2,300, many of whom are
occupied in teaching farmers to improve agricultural productivity, but most
of this staff have little formal training0  In, order to upgrade the quality
of agricultaural staff the governmient is desig,ning  a Schoo'l of Agricultural
Sciences at the University and a middle-level agricultural colleae, and has
constructed one Farm Institute (FI) in each province. Most of the F'Is have
adequate buildings but their effectiveness could be increased by providing
additional facilities or equipment. Farmer training takes place in 28 Farmer
Training Centers (FTC) in various parts of Zambia. At the centers a variety
of courses are conducted, primarily for men, directed at modernization of
agricu'lture. Grea-,er emphasis should be placed on programs for women in
food production, nuttrition and child care to improve family health conditions
in rural areas,
Technical Education
29.         In contrast to many other African countries, Zambia has a well
de-veloped modern sector based on the dominantf mining industry. The mining
industry, which has spurred other industrial and processing industries,
calls for highly skilled manpower. But Zambians, who until 1959 were barred
even fron apprenticeship training, are not available in sufficientu numbers,
and expatriate personnel still occupy most key positions. To accelerate
and improve the quality of Za-mbian technical manpower, the government in
1969 establish,ed a Commi.ssion for Technical Education and Vocational Training.
In three years      Cor-is Conrissimn developed a technical education system, greatly



- 9 -
expanded technical and technological institutions, and replaced the appren-
ticeship system with formal full-time pre-employment classes, including
on-the-job industrial experience (see Annex II).  The Commission was recently
incorporated into the Ministry of Education and Culture.
External Assistance
30.          Zambia is receiving substantial external assistance from both
multilateral and bilateral sources for the development of human resources.
By far the largest capital contribution in general and technical education
has come from the Bank which has made loans totalling $22.7 million. The
largest contribution of a recurrent nature has come from the UK which has
provided the majority of the teachers. Canada helped staff the Commission
for Technical Education and Vocational Training, and Norway and Denmark
provide teachers. The UK also provrides important technical assistance for
health services; about one-half of the registered nurses are British. The
Swfedish International Development Authority intends to provide nurse and
m7idwife teachers. UNICEF has been active in Zambia for a number of years,
equipping rural health centers and clinics, and FAO has supported nutrition
training programs. A Bank loan for integrated family farming included
technical assistance for tobacco farmer training,-and Sweden will finance an
Agricultural College at Mpika which will have a capacity of 250 a year when
in fall operation.
P4RT IV - THE PROJECT
First and second Education Projects
31.          In 1969 the Banxk made its first loan of' US$17.4 million (592-ZA)
for education in Zambia. This project is making a significant contribution
to secondary and teacher education by providing for (a) doubling of secondary
school enrollments through rationalization of the secondary school systems,
expansion of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, (b) diver-
sified curricula to include agricultural, commercial, home economics, and
technical courses to prepare students for a variety of careers, and (c) better
distribution of educational opportunities across the country. It has suffered
considerable delays (see Annex TI) but construction is now proceeding well.
The second loan of US$5.3 million for education in Zambia (645-ZA), which
finances extensions to the University of Zambia, would increase enrollment
in the School of Engineering from 27 to 360 by 1975 and in the School of
Edacation from 178 to 670. The project is almost complete.
The Proposed Project
32.          The proposed project wfas identified by a FAO/IBRD mission in
August 1971D FAO, UNESCO, 'WHO and R-IEA continued to assist the government
in preparing a request for Bank financing whilch was appraised in October/November
1972. Negotiations were held in gashington in April 1973. The Zambian
delegation was headed by s.C. Chibwe, Permanent Secretary, IMinistry of Finance.

nedical and agricultural training by increasing anaual o-utp,rut of medical
personnel f>ram about 230 to B300 and professional agricull-mira1ists from zero
to 60; it would assist in correcting the imlblance betwPn< the modern and
traditional sectors by strengtheni-ing farmer trainling programs thr-ough
increasing enrolnlments fron abc,Jt 6,000 to 13,000 a year; it would bring

(NONUD) has indicated an interest in -providing a s-bstartial gr-ant- toward the
cost of this project subject to parliame?ntary and goverrnmntal approval later
this year. The Nlor.-w,-egian contr:i"Lutiox, if anpproved, would sezve to reduce
the Bank's contribution0  Zamnbia would finance the remaining costs. A Loan
and Project Samar- is attached in Annex IIIT toge-her -with a nop. showing the
location of the. perfo.Ject institutions. A report entitled hAppra isal of the
Third TEducation Pro:Ject - Reru'bli-c of Zwfbia, ' dat,ed. Nlay  , '3 97J ('To.l26a-ZA)
is bei-ng dis-!-trib tuted to the Tecutive Directors separately.
IHledical Education
36.          Three existing me6i cal training instit utions at Chainama Hills
wqould be -inte.gatied and exparded to double the outpUt of medical and health
assistant.s and provride advanced trLiTing for teachers and supervisors. The
prcject 4 ould also finance fellowshhips for training of Zambian staff and the
salary of a Birektor who woul'd be appointed writhin E. year of the sigrning of
the loan agrement. to integrate the different teachi.ng programs. Consistent
with g,overnrmsunt s poliC- of E.cuanding preventive and promotional health
seri-aces. tie. currI-icula gculcT give greater empea-:Lis to preventive medicine,



and the students would receive practical training in six rural health centers
during the last year of their three-year course.
37.          To meet the crucial shortage of nursing personnel and reduce
.ambiats dependence on expatriates, the project would finance a Health Services
Training School at iJdola, which would be built to train in an integrated
program hospital staff including registered nurses, registered midwives and
rad ological and laboratory assistants under the guidance of two chief tutors.
Ample teaching staff is available at nearby hospitals. The curricula would
emphasize curative health care in hospitals.
38.          L3ecause of the crucial shortage of senior nursing and admriinis-
trative personnel, the project would finance a Director, who would prepare,
organize and implement a one year post-basic training program for senior
nurses, administrator and nurse tutors to be financed by the Zambian govern-
ment and conducted at the existing School of Nursing at the University's
teaching hospital in Lusaka. This Drogram would comprise training in public
health nursing, nursing administration, and nursing education of both pre-
ventive and curative nature.
39.          Although largely Zambianized, enrolled nurses and midwives are
still in short supply, and the project would finance training schools for
enrolled nurses and midwives adjacent to the provincial hospitals in M4ansa,
Kasama and Chipata, and expand the school at Kabwe, while certain uneconomic
schools would be closed. The curricula would. stress family and community
health studies, and would include nutrition-oriented courses.
Agricultural Education
40.          To meet the need for high level agricultural manpower and permit
Zambianization of professional agricultural posts in the Ministry of Rural
Development (where about 800 of the professional posts are held by expatriates)
and in related parastatal .agencies, the project wiould finance new facilities
for the School of Agricultural Sciences at the University. The four-year
curriculum in agriculture, which includes one year in the School of Natural
Sciences, would lead to the award of a BSc in Agriculture. The project would
also introduce a small post-graduate program and finance improvements on a
farm for practical training and research purposes. To strengthen the faculty
and training of Zambians the project would finance an advisor, farm manager,
specialists and fellowships.
41.          Capacity of in-service training for agricultural staff would be
increased by improvements to three Farm Institutes. The project wfould also
finance extension of seven Farmer Training Centers (FTC) so that the women,
who do most on the farming, could participate more fully; to this end the
government will endeavor to achieve a 50 percent participation rate by
women in the FTC programs. In areas with low population density, the project
would finance mobile units for female extension staff to teach in the village
environment in far away places. The curricula would, in addition to courses
in commercial agriculture, concentrate on production and processing of



- 12 -
nutritious foods to improve :family diets, child care, hygiene, etc.  Project
funds would also be applied t.o study the effectiveness of the >7C s and
rnake recommrendations for fuure programs.
General Education
42.          Five important services, the Curriculum Development Center, the
Correspondence Course Unit, the Audio-Visual Ser-vices Librnry, the Zambia
Library S-ervice and the Instructional Resources Center for technical education,
all supporting curriculum development and improvement of the country's
education system, occupy separate and lunsuitable temporary accommodations.
The proposed project would bring tc-gether these servi-e es inlto one center in
Lusaka. Niew links would be established between school radio and television
programs and the curriculium de-relopment programs. Greater attention would
be paid to the relationship of pxrimary curricula to the rural environment
as wfell as technical education in secondary schools. Their centralization
would not only result in qualitative improvemeent uit also redcuce costs
through pooling of mhrsical staf-f and other resources.
43.          For the efficient utilization and operation of schools constructed
under the first education project, the propcsed lcan would help finance in-
dispensable facilities such as water supplies, treatment systems, staff
housing, some additional workshops, classroaRes and couninal facilities at a
total cost of about `)15 million.  The gover:nent was to finance these additional
facilities, for which no cost estimates were prepared, concurrently w-ith the
first education project in aodition to its counterpart contribution of about
US',19 million for that prorect.  Because of its seVere financial difficulties,
discussed in paras 8-10, the government no longer has funds to prov,ide these
needed facilities, and therefore these itemis are included in the proposed
project.
Execution of the Project
h1.          A project coordinating corL-iittee, which would consist of the
Permanent Secretaries of the relevant mTiiustries ancd the urniversity, would
be established to formulate procedures for carrying out the project and for
coordinating the implementation among the tcarious enotities involved.  The
existing project unit in the Ministry of Education and Culture, ,hich is
implementing the first education project, would be responsible for the
additional facilities which will be executed simultaneously with the rem-lining
works of the first project.  fhese works are expected to be completed by
end 1976, The Universit;y [chool of Agricultural Sciences component would be
administered by the proiect unit established for the second education project.
The remaining project items, the educational services center and the health
and agricultural training facilities would be constructed by a new unit to
be establlshed in the Rdildings Branch in the ifinistry of Power, Transport
and Torks which is the .inistry responsible for construction of government
projects. Th.s unit w.-ould become a permanent part; of the Mlinistry in contrast
to the other two *mit,s. To minimize delays in the construction program, the



- 13 -
project unit executing the first educat-ion project wTould be responsib7e for
preparatory works on these facilit'ies until the new project unit; is fully
established.
45.          Each project unit would comprise a director with supporting
s taff,  The N.iorwegian Agency for International D]evelopment (wORAo) would
continue to provide technical assistance for the unit executing the fi'rst
education project and the additional facilities in the third project under a
contract ending in December 1976. The uirversity project unit is also ade-
quately staffed to take on the added responsibilities.   Staff for the new
proJect unit along with vehicles, equipment, etc. at an estimated cost of
about US`O.5 million would be partly financed out of the proceeds of the
proposed Loan.  The establishment of this new unit wTould increase the NinistryTs
capacity to handle future externally financed projects.
46.          The project is expected to be completed in about six years.
Design a;id supervision of construction -would partly be carried out by consultant
architects and partly by the Buildings Branch in the IMinistry of Power, Trans-
port and Works. Professional staff and services required for the execution
of the project w7ould be appointed in consultation with the Bank.
Procurement and Disbursement
47.          Selection of civil works contractors and procurement would conform
to the Bank's Guidelines other than for civil works costing less than K100,000
and for furniture and equipment costing less than r1'20,000 wihere local compe-
titive bidding would be required. Domestic manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be accorded preference equal to the existing rate of customs
duty applicable to competing imports or 15' of the c.i.f. price, whichever
is lower.
48.          The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100% of the c.i.f.
c ost of imported furniture and equipment or 100% of the ex-factory cost of
locally produced furniture and equipment, and 80% of the total cost of civil
works, professional services, technical assistance and project unit expendi-
tures.  Retroactive financing from August 1, 1972, not exceeding U31$1.5 million
would also be included for goods and services procured in accordance with
Bank Guidelines on the additional facilities to some educational institutions
mentioned in paragraph 4,, design and preparatory work on the health traircing
facilities and the School of Agriculturd Sciences. A disbursement schedule
is shown in Annex III.



PLRT V - LEGAL INSTRUTS AND AUTHiORITY
49.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zanbia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft loan agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for
education projects.
5°.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMY2EDATION
51.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loanl.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION/1
Loan No. 562   Industrial Forestry Project:  $5.3 million loan of October 5, 1968;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Execution of the project is making more rapid progress than expected
at the time of appraisal. There is a lack of accountants and the
project management still relies on the services of a member of our
Agriculture Development Service. We have suggested that government
seek technical assistance from bilateral sources until qualified
Zambian accountants become available. Project costs have proved to
be higher than expected so that the disbursement percentage applicable
to expenditures other than direct imports will have to be reduced
from 44 to 25.
Loan No. 592   First Edacation Project: $17.4 million loan of April 11, 1969,
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
The project became effective in July, 1969, but was initially delayed
some 12-14 months dae to management problems and prolonged
negotiations regarding studies and the consultant's contract which
eventually led to the efficient and economical modular construction
system ultimately adopted for the project schools. Construction is
now proceeding well.  The efficient construction method would have
regained six months of delay but for the government's financial
problems which resulted in a cutback of funds early in 1972 and the
extension of the closing date by 2X years.  The Northern Technical
College (Nortec) item ($1 million) is behind schedule because of a
review of the government's technical education policy which has now
been completed. This review has resulted in greater emphasis on
pre-employment training and less on apprenticeship than originally
envisaged; the school is now being redesigned. The entire project
was to cost US$36.2 million; the government now expects a US$3.41
million cost overrun which it will finance itself.
Loan No. 627   Livestock Development Project:  $2.5 million loan of June 30, 1969;
Closing Date: November 30, 1974
The project was expected to be completed by mid-1974 and development
has begun on all but one of the beef ranches. However, progress is
now at a standstill and serious financial problems have emerged.
Financial viability of the Zambia Cattle Development Limited (ZCDL),

regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in
particular to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be

not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

which is responsilble for execution, and also of some of the ranches
to be developed urnder the project, is uncertain.  Management problems
and government policy which held down prices on beef and milk while
costs rose rapidly are the principal causes. At the government's
request the Bank aind Barclay's Bank, a co-lender, assisted govern-
ment officials in reappraising the projec;t.  We concluded that the
project be reduced to include only those components which offer
promise of becoming viable, that managenent be given authority to
operate fully on a commerciai basis, thatL. organizational changes be
introcuced to that end, and that prices z)n beef and milk be raised.
The government has subzequently raised t1lese prices anda is consider-
ing the other recommendations.
Loan No. 645   Second Education Project      $5..J million loan of November 30, 1969;
7losing7 Date: August 31 5973
This project is almost complete, tlTt a delay in the initial stages
caused by periodic building material shortages, contractors limited
managerial capacity and insufficient local representation by one
firm recuires a nine months' extension of' tle C'losixng Date (to
June, 1974) to allow for the construcc,.io.n guarantee period and for
the closing ol the accounts.
Loan No. 68>   Commercial Crops Farming Project: $5b' :alllion loan of June 5, 1970;
Closing Date: Decenber 31, 1975
The Project is scheduled for completion in- mid-197,.  After a slow
start, the project is now making satisfactory progress.   So far, 66
assisted tenants have been settled, 23 of' them since the end of the
last growing season.  During that season, assisted tenants proouced
400,650 kg tobacco, representing 7 percent of the national crop;
yields were slightly above the national average of 901 kg/ha.
Loan No. 701   Kariba North Bank H-ydro-electric Power P-roject:  $40.0 million loan
of July 29, 1970; Coi       te: July   L97b
The cost of the Kariba North Hydro-eiectric Project, for which the
Bank made a loan oi $40 million in July, 1970 to cover the foreign
exchange expenditure, has turned out substantially higher than
estimated at the time of appraisal.   When bids were opened in
October, 1970 it became clear thaat the foreign exchange expenditure
alone would be more than $10 million higher. That increase was
attrikutable to world wide price increases on heavy electrical
equipment over and above appraisal est-imates and high contingency
allowances included by contractors in their bids for unexpected
expenditures arising from Zarmbia's position as a land-locked country.
Subsecueatly  changes in exchange rates in December, 1971, delayed
provis=on of access roads to the site an6' staff housing on the site,
and adverse rock conditions have caused furtner significant increases
in cost. In addition, the main civil woz,ks contractor experienced



ANNEX II
Page 3
severe financial difficulties and was forced into liquidation in
February, 1973. Negotiations are now under way with a new
contractor; a work schedule and revised cost estimates, including
the effects of the recent currency realignments, are being prepared.
A supplementary loan is contemplated as soon as the cost estimates
have been revised.
Loan No. 882   Integrated Family Farming Project:   $11.5 million loan of February 26,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Conditions of effectiveness are likely to be met shortly, but one
month's extension of the termination date of May 28, 1973 might be
required.
