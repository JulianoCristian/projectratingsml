FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   The Land and the Economy
1.00      Togo covers about 56,000 km2, with only 50 km of coastline on
the Gulf of Benin. In shape, it is a narrow 600 km-long corridor between
Ghana and Benin. Except for a long mountain range, which runs in the center
along the border with Ghana and in the north along the border with Benin,
the terrain is flat and presents no major topographical obstacles to trans-
port. Its population, about 2.4 million (1978), is growing at a high rate
of 2.6% per year.
1.02      Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at US$340 1/ per capita
in 1978, has been one of the fastest growing in Africa: 5.3% per year over
1970-77. In the period 1975-79, GDP at constant prices grew on average
about 4% per year. The slowdown started in 1978 and has continued into
1980. Earnings from phosphate, which account for about 50% of all export
earnings, suffered from a sharp decline in the world price be8inning in
1976. This drop-off in revenue, coupled with the Govenment-s excessive
investments, led to a serious financial situation which is expected to pre-
vail in the near future. Consequently, the Government has been forced to
take austerity measures.
1.03       Implementation of the past economic development plans has been
generally satisfactory according to Government sources: the First Plan
(1966-70) achieved about 80% of the planned targets; the Second Plan (1971-
75) 64%; and for the Third Plan (1976-80) 70% is estimated to be accomplishea.
In the current economic plan, internal resources were to contribute as much
as 65% of the total investments in the economy. But because of the shortfall
in Government revenues, domestic financing over 1976-79 was limited to only
37%.
1.04      As the country is rich in natural resources, Togo's long-term
economic perspectives appear good. However, in the short run, economic
prospects are constrained by low phosphate and cocoa prices, and by the
country's inadequate economic policy.  Transport infrastructure is generally
developed to meet basic economic and other needs of the country; therefore,
preserving and gradual upgrading of the system, particularly of roads, will
become necessary rather than to launch new projects. Major adjustments will
therefore have to be made in the Fourth Plan to stabilize the economy since
Togo-s relatively high level of past and current capital outlays were largely
determined during the past phosphate boom.

B.   The Transport System
(i) General
'.05      The transport infrastructure encompasses about 7,000 km of roads
and 490 km of railway lines; a new deepwater port at Lome and a phosphate
wharf at Kpeme; and an international airport at Lome and five scattered
airfields in the interior of the country. The infrastructure is basically
suited to the needs of the country and no major expansions of the system are
needed in the near future.
1.06      The major transport artery is the 680 km, south-north axis, anchored
l  Lome port, which is used by domestic and international transit traffic
(Mali, Niger, Upper Volta). The average annual tonnage of transit traffic,
which pays transit taxes to Togo, is about 100,000 tons. The modal allocation
of traffic has been shifting significantly from rail to road, partly due to
the swift growth of the paved road network and partly due to the limited
activity of the railway network and the inefficient operations of the Togolese
l;ail-ay (Chemins de Fer du Togo, CFT).
(ii)  Roads
1X07      Details of the road subsector are presented in Chapter II.
(iii)  Railways
108      There are three railway lines fanning from Lome:  (a)  the Central
line (Lome-Blitta, 276 km) extending northwards; (b) the Border line
(Lome-Kpalime, 116 km) extending northwestward to the cocoa and coffee
growing area bordering Ghana; and (c) the Coastal line (Lome-Aneho, 44 km)
extending eastward to Aneho via Kpeme, site of the phosphate wharf. A
fourth spur line of 50 km was constructed in 1979 to serve the CIMAO cement
plant; it connects the Central line to Tabligbo, the site of the plant.
1.09      Development of CFT's freight traffic has been erratic, but in
gerneral extremely low: in 1978 and 1979 about 100,000 tons per year was
transported by all three lines combined. Passenger transport has become the
more important operation for CFT; about 2 million passengers are transported
annually.  CFT's deficit increased continuously, reaching a peak of about
US$2.0 million in 1978; however, in 1979 it was reduced to US$1.6 million,
mostly due to reduction of administrative expenditures. Most of the deficit
was covered by subsidies from the general budget, and the rest by loans.
1.10      A number of serious interrelated problems which have been facing
CFT for years are the cause of the annual deficits: inefficiency of opera-
tions, lack of qualified staff, poor management, overstaffing, and drastic-
ally reduced traffic. These problems are aggravated by old rolling stock,
and growing competition from road transport. The traffic switch to roads
increased significantly at the beginning of the 1970s, when roads parallel to
the railway lines were paved. Since 1971, aside from the CIMAO line, there has



- 3 -
been no significant capital investment in the CFT. France and Canada have
provided limited technical assistance and the African Development Bank (AfDB)
finances assistance for training CFT staff.
1.11      A dialogue between the Bank Group and the Government on railway
issues has been maintained since 1968. In that year, the Governmient agreed
to phase out the Lome-Kpalime and Lome-Aneho lines within 10 years after the
paving of the parallel roads (the First Highway Project). The Government has
also agreed not to extend the Central line (Lome-Blitta, 276 km) unless it can
be economically justified. On the basis of a 1976 consultant's report, which
stated that the closing of two branch lines would not substantially reduce the
railway deficit, the Bank agreed to modify its position on closing the branch
lines, but under the Third Highway Project (Cr. 693-TO) recommended a study to
improve CFT operations. The study was completed in November 1979 (by Canadian
Pacific Consulting Services, Ltd.) and has been reviewed by the Association.
Prior to project negotiations, the Government confirmed its agreement made
under the Third Highway Project (Cr. 693-TO) to prepare and implement a program
to improve CFT operations. Furthermore, the Government agreed at negotiations
to assign a high priority to this task in the work program of the newly created
General Directorate of Transport (para. 1.17). During the negotiations, agree-
ment was reached and Covenant 4.04 of Credit Agreement 693-To will be modified,
setting December 31, 1981 as the new deadline for submission of the CFT
program to the Association for comments.
(iv) Ports
The Lome Deepwater Port
1.12      The deepwater port of Lome, replacing an old wharf, was opened
to traffic in 1968, and a port extension project was completed in 1977. Now
spread over 675 ha, the port has one pier and three major berths for ships
of a maximum of 270 m in length and 9.5 m in draught; there is also one
smaller berth for fishing ships with less than 5.0 m draught. An additional
pier has since been constructed for petroleum tankers and mineral ships
(export of clinker from CIMIAO). The annual capacity of the port is about
500,000 tons of general merchandise (reached two years ago), 1.2 million
tons of bulk cargo and 2 million tons of fuel. In 1979 two storage facili-
ties for Upper Volta (10,000 m2) were completed; and Niger has expressed
interest in similar facilities.  Further extension of the port in the 1980s
appears necessary. The draft 1981-85 Development Plan provides for a modest
extension of the port-s capacity, mainly, construction of new half-length
pier, increasing the capacity for general cargo to 800,000 tons per year.
This limited extension seems justified, and external financing (about US$40
million) has already been secured (EDF, FRG and Saudi Arabia).
1.13      Over 1975-79, total traffic in the Lome port increased by 23% per
year (imports 27.5% and exports 19.6%). Of about 1.6 million tons of total
traffic handled on average in 1978-79, only 0.1 million tons or 6% was transit
traffic to or from Upper Volta, Niger and Mali. The substantial traffic
increase was mainly caused by materials needed for a few big industrial
projects.



-4-
Kpeme Wharf
1.14      The Kpeme wharf, 30 km east of Lome, is a modern structure that
allows exports of about 3.5 million tons of phosphate per year and imports of
petroleum for the phosphate mine. It is managed by the state-owned phosphate
mining company (Compagnie Togolaise des Mines du genin, CTIB).
(v) Air Transport
1.15      Air transport in Togo is focused on international traffic, with
the international airport at Lome used by over a dozen foreign companies.
Until 1968, Air Togo had several scheduled domestic flights; but internal
traffic is now limited to military and chartered avaition. The Lome airport
is managed by ASECNA and supervised by the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA)
in MCT. UNDP has been assisting DCA in training Togolese pilots and mechanics
abroad. Over 1974-79, the airport had a rapid growth of passenger transport
at 17% per annum (215,000 passengers in 1979) and of freight at 7% per annum.
Five secondary airfields serve Dapaon, the most northern city, Mango, Lama-
Kara, Sokode and Atakpame.
C.   Transport Planning, Sector Management and Investments
1.16      Transport responsibilities are scattered among different agencies
and departments. Road network development is handled by the Planning and
Design Office (PDO) in Public Works Department of the Ministry of Public
Works, Mines and Power (MPWMP); vehicle registration, licensing of commercial
vehicles, inspection and axle load control are under the Road Transport
Service within MCT; civil aviation is under the Department of Civil Aviation
in MCT, while the port of Lome is an independent public corporation. CFT is
directly under Government control within M4CT. The Ministry of Planning and
Industrial Development (MPID) also has a transport planning function throu6h
its Division for Infrastructure which is understaffed and makes only a margi-
nal contribution to transport planning.
1.17      The above set-up has not been functioning properly; lack of adequate
coordination between the different agencies has become an issue in the sector
and has caused negative repercussions on sectoral management and on invest-
ments. To remedy the situation, in 1977, under the Third Highway Project, the
Government agreed to create a new Transport Planning and Coordination Unit
(TPCU) in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport; this was, however, delayed
mainly because of lack of staff and continuity of leadership. Technical
assistance was provided from November 1979 under Cr. 693-TO for eight months
to prepare a draft work program for TPCU (para. 3.13). The unit was finally
established as the General Directorate of Transport (GDT) by decree in June
1980. The appointment of GDT-s director is still pending. However, the
Deputy Director has been appointed and one Togolese transport economist and
one transport engineer have been assigned to GDT. At negotiations, the
Government agreed to complete staffing by nominating the Director General and
hiring one more transport engineer and equipping GDT by May 1, 1981.
1.18      The Government objectives and investment policy are presented
in the five-year development plans. In the first two plans (1966-70 and
1971-75), the share of transport investments was 40% and 25%, respectively,
of total public investments. The Third Plan (1976-80) was more ambitious



than the previous ones. Transport was to receive about CFAF 60 billion or
US$255 million. The Government was to contribute about 65%, with the remain-
ing 35% from external sources.  Investments made so far under thze Plan are
shown in the Table below.
1.19      The declining Government revenues could not come up with the planned
internal contribution.  Preliminary data indicate actual investmnents in the
transport sector of about CFAF 50.0 billion (US$213 million), with Government
financing of about 37%. If investments related to the CI.MAO project are
excluded, only about CFAF 31.0 billion (US$132 million) will actually be spent
*n the sector or about 18% of total actual public investments. The largest
snare is for highways, about 50% in relative terms, lower than in the previous
plans. Civil aviation represented 40%, more than before because of a new
airport at Niamtougou; port investments represented 10%. Although the planned
targets for the transport sector were not fully achieved, the final outcome is
basically satisfactory.

-1,20     In the draft Development Plan for 1981-85, the Government assigns
transport fifth priority after rural development, industrial development,
mining and energy, and health. The two basic objectives for the sector are:
(i) development of infrastructure for transit traffic of landlocked coun-
tries, and (ii) strengthening/improvement of east/west transversal roads off
the south/north main axis in order to open new regions for economic develop-
ment. Most of the planned investments are related to the improvement of the
corridor for transit traffic. Out of about CFAF 250 billion envisaged for all
public investments in the economy (40% to be financed by the Government), only
11% or about CFAF 28 billion (US$119 million) is for transport. Thus, the
share and the total amount of the transport investment is less than what had
been actually achieved in the Third Plan. About 36% would go to the expansion
of the Port of Lome (construction of a second pier); 52% to highways (mostly
east/west roads, about 380 km in total), 7% to railways, and 5% to civil
aviation. The proposed transport investments in the draft Plan appear
realistic. A few projects will require close scrutiny as to their economic
justification, e.g. proposed investments for CFT, a new international airport
at Lome, and the balance in development between trunk and feeder roads.
3.   Bank Group Assistance to the Transport Sector
1.21      The Association has so far contributed only to the highway sub-
sector. Assistance totalling US$28.2 million has involved three highway
-rojects and one feeder road project. The Bank Group-s projects were
implemented with reasonable success except in road maintenance and training
which suffered from shortcomings in maintenance operations and a shortage
and turn-over of trained personnel.
1.22      The First Highway Project (Cr. 131-TO, US$3.7 million, 1968)
consisted of a four-year road maintenance program and preinvestment studies
of about 450 km of secondary roads. The project was completed in November
1973, about a year later than originally scheduled. Equipment purchase and
personnel training for the maintenance program were executed, however, setting
up a new maintenance organization proved more difficult than expected, and
at project completion only half of the expected yearly output had been
achieved. The Project Performance Audit Report (1977) also concluded that
the quality of PWD staff and availability of counterparts were overestimated,
and part of the road maintenance equipment was diverted to other tasks. In
sDite of these shortcomings, the project remained economically justified.
1.23      The Second Highway Project (Cr. 450-TO, US$8.7 million, 1973)
consisted of a rehabilitation of the paved Blitta-Sokode road (78 km),
construction of the Sokode-Tchamba-Kambole (75 km) and Agou-Notse roads
5  km) to gravel standards; extension of the maintenance program started
under the First Highway Project (technical assistance, equipment for soil
laboratory, and training); a survey of about 2,000 km of unpaved roads;
oreinvestment studies for reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo road (45 km);
and technical assistance to the Road Transport Service (RTS) in MCT. As a
result of worldwide inflation, the bids for road construction were 30% higher
hnan appraisal estimates, and construction of the Agou-Notse road was post-
poned and later included in the Third Highway Project.  Improvement of the
Tchamba-Kambole road (40 km) by force account was deleted and carried out by



PWD under its own budget. The project was completed in June 1979, about 30
months later than estimated at appraisal. The delay was due to late implemen-
tation of technical assistance to RTS and late installation of laboratory
equipment. The Project Completion Report (1979) concluded that the objectives
of the project were basically met. Each project component, was economically
justified, but, the technical assistance component failed to achieve expected
objectives (Project Completion Report, 1979). The borrower s performance was
good, except in institution building which was to be remedied under the Third
Highway Project.
1.24       The Third Highway Project (Cr. 693-TO, US$10 million, 1977) consists
of reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo (45 km) and the Agou-Notse (51 km)
roads; purchase of road maintenance equipment; provision of technical assis-
tance and fellowships to PWD for road maintenance and strengthening of the
road planning and design unit, and to MCT for overall transport planning and
coordination; a study on improvement of the operations of Togolese Railways
(CFT); a study of feeder roads; and preinvestment studies of the Bassar-Mango
road (136 km). The project began in mid-1977 and, with the exception of the
technical assistance item, is completed. The construction element of the
project stopped for a period of six months in 1979 for lack of Government
counterpart funds; the problem was resolved by an EEC Special Action Credit
and both roads were completed by May 1980. The study of CFT WEas reviewed by
the Association and comments conveyed to CFT management.
1.25      The Feeder Road Project (Cr. 810-TO, US$5.8 million, 1978) consists
of a four-year program for the improvement and maintenance of about 1,000
km of feeder roads and short-term consultant services for studying a follow-
up feeder road program. The project is progressing satisfactorily so far:
however, unfavorable weather conditions have necessitated some changes in
construction schedules, but creditable progress has been made all the same
(para. 2.13).
1.26      The focus of the Bank Group future operations in the transport
sector should remain basically similar to the ones in the past. In the
future, the Bank Group should concentrate on continuing assistance to: (a)
improve road maintenance; (b) upgrade and strengthen the road network in
order to preserve past investments, particularly paved roads; and (c)
strengthen the transport planning, in particular in PWD and MCT. As for
CFT, the Association-s involvement should be focused on the consultants
study and recommendations to CFT management, thus assisting the Government
in preparing an appropriate action program to improve the operations of
CFT.
II. THE ROAD SUBSECTOR
A. The Road Network
2.01       The road network consists of about 7,000 km of roads.  The 2,760 km
of primary and secondary roads fall under the MPWMP, while the 4,200 km of
feeder roads and tracks are the responsibility of the Feeder Road Unit (FRU)



- 8 -
in the Direction du Genie Rural (DGR) of the Ministry of Rural Works (MRW) and
the Ministry of the Interior through its District Offices (circumscriptions).
The primary network of about 1,500 km is paved. The road network to be
maintained by the MPWMP is defined every year in the budget; it increased by
27% in the period 1975-80, as shown in the table below.

2.02      The two most important paved roads run from Lome north to the
Upper Volta border (680 km) and along the coast (48 km). About 800 km of the
secondary roads are engineered. The primary and secondary roads, branching
east and west from the main south-north axis, are generally adequate in extent
and geographical distribution. Most of the primary and engineered secondary
roads are in good to fair condition; the rest of the network is in fair or
poor condition since it receives only sporadic maintenance. Some sections of
the paved network (about 400 km) are over or about 10 years old and need
strengthening and rehabilitation. Maintenance deteriorated since 1978 due to
a combination of lack of qualified personnel, inadequate and untimely alloca-
tion of funds, and frequent breakdowns of aged maintenance equipment (para.
2.26).
B. Characteristics and Growth of Road Transport
2.03      The total vehicle fleet for 1979 is estimated to be over 20,000
vehicles, based on vehicle registrations. Between 1974-78 the average annual



-9-
growth was about 9%. Passenger cars are by far the largest group, 69% of the
total, pickups next, at 18%; and trucks 11%. The highest annual growth rate
was for tractors, 45%; followed by buses, 25%; and trailers, 22% (table on
page 10).
2.04      Regular traffic counts on the primary and secondary road networks
have been carried out since 1978 by the Planning and Design Unit in the PWD.
Based on these data, the average growth is estimated at 8-10% per year.
The total fi:ight traffic on the network is estimated to have been over
one million t; ns in 1978.
C. The Road Tr_>nsport Industry
2.05      There are six major public freight transporters; five are privately
owned, mostly by foreign capital. The largest company is Togoroute, which is
60% owned by the Government. These companies are primarily engaged in transit
traffic (Upper Volta, Niger and Mali), one third of which, according to an
international agreement, is to be transported by Togolese transporters.
Annual transit traffic is about 100,000 tons. In addition, there are about
150-170 small transporters who own 800-1,000 trucks of a smaller size used
to carry about 35,000 tons of domestic traffic.
2.06      The entry into the market is free and competition leads to the
undercutting of the official tariff rates. The tariff per ton/km for general
merchandise is CFAF 21, while actual tariffs charged are CFAF 17-18 per
ton/km. However, the actual cost estimated by Togolese truckers in early
1980, including vehicle depreciation, was about CFAF 23-24 per ton/km.
Therefore, a number of them are operating at a loss. The biggest loss is
recorded by Togoroute--US$360,000 per year in 1978 and 1979. In order to
improve the situation in the trucking industry, GDT-s terms of reference
include an analysis of the state of the industry, in particular of road
transport costs. GDT is expected to make recommendations on road transport
policy matters and their implementation.
2.07      There are four bus companies with about 100 buses; however, a
significant number is always out of operation due to the lack of spare parts.
The passenger transporters are mostly involved in inter-urban transport. Two
are Government owned and two are private. In addition, there are 3,500-4,000
taxis, mostly in the Lome area. The existing tariffs, dating from 1974, are
low and need revision, but the Government appears reluctant to increase the
tariffs for political reasons.

2.08      RTS is in charge of vehicle registration, licensing, technical
inspection (twice per year), tariffs, and traffic regulations. Bureau of
Freight (BF) is mainly in charge of distributing freight among truckers
operating in Togo. Both Government departments lack qualified staff. As a
short-term solution, RTS and BF will be assisted by GDT in performing their
main tasks before they improve the staffing.
2.09      Maximum gross vehicle weight is 38 tons, with a maximum single axle
load of 13 tons. The Government in cooperation with neighboring countries
intends to adopt legislation which should result in better traffic control.
Since overloading seems to be widespread, the Government was reminded of the
Credit Agreement's covenant (Cr. 693-TO) regarding enforcement of axle load
regulations. The Government intends to enforce compliance with vehicle weight
legislation, once enacted, by gradually establishing weighing stations on the
main south/north road axis. During negotiations the Government agreed to
prepare and submit to the Association for review and comment an action program
for the effective enforcement of vehicle weight legislation by December 31,
1981.
D. Administration
2.10      The Roads Division, (RD) of The Public Works Department (PWD) of the
Ministry of Public Works, Mines and Power (MPWMP), is in charge of planning,
constructing and maintaining the primary and secondary road networks, while
FRU and the Ministry of the Interior through its District offices are respon-
sible for feeder roads (para. 2.01). Current PWD organization is shown on the
following page. RD has five field subdivisions comprising 18 sectors. The
subdivisions are also engaged in construction (mostly by force account) and
maintenance of all Government buildings (except in Lome) under the supervision
of the Buildings Division. RD's equipment for road maintenance and construc-
tion is maintained by the Equipment Division, either at its main workshop in
Lome or at its annex in Sokode. The Equipment Division also maintains equip-
ment used on feeder roads.
2.11      PWD's organization is satisfactory.  Under the Third Highway Project,
two offices were created within RD which have enhanced the overall performance
of this Division. One office is in charge of planning, design and construc-
tion of roads and the other is in charge of road maintenance executed by field
subdivisions, sectors and specialized brigades. Both offices are properly
staffed and are being assisted by consultants. The proposed project will con-
tinue this technical assistance. A major drawback currently is that policies
do not assign adequate importance to personnel management and training. To
correct this deficiency and to implement a comprehensive training program
(para. 3.04), the proposed project will add a training function to PWD's
Personnel Office which the Government has agreed to transform into a Personnel
and Training Division (PTD). The Government has further agreed to cause this
transformation to occur by January 1, 1982 and to staff and equip the PTD by
that time.

2.12      MRW through the DGR has primary responsibility for the administra-
tion, development, and maintenance of feeder roads, but other ministries and
agencies are also involved. To coordinate and implement feeder road develop-
ment, a Feeder Road Unit (FRU) was created, staffed and equipped within DGR
under the Feeder Road Project. FRU brigades have started working on 600 km
of roads under the Feeder Road Project (Credit 810-TO); as FRU still needs to
increase its capacity, PWD subcontracted with DRG to take over betterment
works on the remaining 400 km of roads under the same project, (para. 3.06).
To meet these obligations, PWD diverted equipment to these works, which has
adversely affected maintenance of primary roads. This arrangement is unsatis-
factory, and would be corrected by amending Credit 810-TO and the contract to
provide for the procurement of PWD fast depreciating equipment (para. 3.06) as
agreed upon at negotiations.
E. Staffing and Training
2.13      PWD employees in charge of roads and equipment number about 1,060,
including about 20 engineers and 580 technicians; the remaining employees
being unskilled laborers. Most of the engineers and technicians were trained
abroad and a few in Togolese institutions, one of which is the Regional Center
for Training in Highway Maintenance (CERFER).
2.14      An April 1980 survey showed that an acute shortage of trained
personnel has developed for road maintenance, and it is essential that in the
next five years (1981-85) PWD should recruit and train about 185 technicians
and retrain 140 existing employees. The survey found that about half of the
essential core of engineers and technicians were over 40 years old and that
another third would retire in five years when they reach 55. Only about 4% of
these employees were less than 25 years old. This problem was due to a large
defection of younger trained professionals from Government services to the
private sector. The survey showed further that some employees in the private
sector return to Government services when they approach retirement age to take
advantage of the Government's liberal retirement compensation.
2.15      This shortage is a major impediment to effective operations.
Previous highway projects provided reasonably successful on-the-job training
of mechanics, operators and cost accountants. These projects also provided
fellowships for training abroad of staff for road maintenance and design.
This staff is in place. The proposed project will reinforce arnd expand this
effort by including an enlarged training program to meet the needs of road
maintenance for the next three years (para. 3.03).
F. Financing and Planning
2.16      Togo has invested substantially in the development of its road
network, and as a result the paved road network increased rapidly from 376
km in 1970 to 1,500 km in 1980. The Government's share in this investment was
22% in 1971-75 and 20% in 1976-80, or on average about US$3.8 million annually
which came from its Investment Budget. Major foreign financing came from EDF,
FRG and IDA. The draft Development Plan (1981-85) anticipates about US$70
million for the road subsector, mostly for strengthening and rehabilitation of
sections of the paved network and for construction of east/west road links off
the main south/north road. The program for roads appears reasonable.



- 14 -
2.17      Until 1979 investments in feeder road improvements were provided
by various government agencies, often part of agricultural projects. Feeder
roads have also been financed by OPAT, IDA and the EDF. Construction and
improvement was limited to about 50 km of feeder roads annually at a cost
of about US$380,000.  Maintenance budgets have been small and insufficient
amounting to about US$175,000 annually for local communities.
2.18      There was little road development planning until 1978 when the
Planning and Design Office (PDO) was created to institute systematic planning
and design. The Third Highway Project backed PDO with scholarships and
technical assistance; with two Togolese trained abroad under the same project
and assisted by one consultant, PDO started operating in early 1979. Its
major task is now to prepare a comprehensive program for development of
primary and secondary road networks. In its early stage PDO has made good
progress (para. 2.21).

2.19      Maintenance of primary and secondary roads, financed from the
general budget, is subject to scrutiny and cuts by the Ministry of Finance.
Due to the country½s financial difficulties, funds for maintaining the network
(Table, page 14) have been insufficient since 1977. In 1979, only about CFAF
488 million (US$2.08 million) was spent for road maintenance including admin-
istration and equipment renewal which was substantially lower than needed.
During negotiations the Government has agreed to concentrate on maintaining
2,300 km of roads, which includes the total primary network (1,500 km, all
paved) and all engineered unpaved secondary roads (800 km). The remaining
450 km of unengineered earth roads require an improvement before a regular
maintenance could be warranted. Adequate maintenance would require an increase
from the current CFAF 488 million (US$2.08 million) to CFAF 750 million
(US$3.19 million). During negotiations, agreement has also been reached with
the Government on minimum annual allocations of CFAF 750 million in 1980
prices from the General Budget for road maintenance.
2.20      Revenues from various road user charges have been increasing; in
1978 they reached about CFAF 4 billion (US$17 million). Revenues from fuel
taxes alone (US$6.20 million in 1979) exceeded by far the funds needed for
adequate road maintenance (US$3.19 million). Even without revenues from other
road user charges (Table, below), the available resources would be also
sufficient to cover most of Government's share of the local cost of road
construction projects in the draft five-year plan (about US$3.0 million/year).
It should also be noted that in early 1980, in order to increase public
revenues, a new tax was created--a road maintenance tax of 10% on annual
turnover of commercial vehicles. It is estimated that its revenue to the
general budget will well exceed CFAF 1.0 billion per year. Hiowever, the
current grave financial situation of the country (para. 1.02) makes it very
difficult for the Government to earmark these revenues to road maintenance.

2.21      RD is responsible for road feasibility studies, final engineering
and construction supervision of roads. Togo follows the standards of road
design as developed by the French Ministry of Equipment. Until recently, road
design was carried out by foreign consultants under RD supervision.  However,
the Planning/Design Office created under the Third Highway Project has suc-
cessfully carried out, with assistance by consultants BCEOM, the feasibility
studies and engineering for the strengthening and reinforcement of the Lome-
Notse-Atakpame road (para. 3.07). This technical assistance will continue for
the supervision of reinforcement works of this road. The Government intends
to continue using this office for minor design projects and preliminary studies
of major projects and planning. Under the Second and Third Highway Projects,
a Soils Laboratory was created within PWD and provided with equipment; its
staff is being trained. The Soils Laboratory is expected to carry out all
soils studies for design and construction supervision of civil works, tech-
nological research, and building materials. The laboratory is assisted by the
French Centre Experimental de Recherches et d'Etudes du Batiment et des
Travaux Public (CEBTP). The proposed project will continue this assistance.
The proposed project would support further development of the Soils Laboratory
by providing further technical assistance, and fellowships for training its
staff and future managers abroad.
2.22      Road construction is generally carried out by contract awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding. Some improvement and betterment works are
carried out by PWD mobile brigades (para. 2.24). The construction industry
is dominated by foreign contractors who carry out three fourths of the busi-
ness. The remaining 25% is carried out by five domestic contractors and one
Togolese-French contractor.  The domestic construction industry only supplies
materials and constructs drainage structures and other minor civil works. They
obtain contracts for these works through either joint ventures with or sub-
contracts from foreign contractors. Development of the domestic construction
industry is impeded by the lack of adequate equipment and working capital.
To encourage local construction industry, IDA-s 7.5% margin of preference
would be granted to eligible domestic contractors bidoing for civil works
(para. 3.22).
H.   Road Maintenance
2.23      In the 1960s, only sporadic road maintenance was carried out.
Maintenance operations did not improve until the First Highway Project
(1971-74) introduced a four-year maintenance program. Efforts have been
sustained under the Second and Third Highway Projects. These programs were
designed to improve the road network and provide proper maintenance to paved
and engineered gravel roads.
2.24      Under the First Highway Project, existing equipment was repaired,
new equipment purchased, and technical assistance helped carry out the road
maintenance program and train personnel. Under the Second Highway Project,
a major reorganization of maintenance operations was implemented to increase
productivity. All regravelling equipment was concentrated in three specia-
lized brigades and managed by the RD, rather than scattered throughout the
five field subdivisions. Routine road maintenance continued to be performed



- 17 -
by field subdivisions. Under the Third Highway Project, additional equipment
was procured in 1978, and limited training of staff for road maintenance was
carried out.
2.25      Due to the successive road maintenance programs, the primary road
network (all paved) and all engineered secondary roads (laterite) provide
year-round transport links.  The condition of the remaining secondary network
varies, but has improved in recent years. However, some sections of the paved
network have aged and reached the stage where regular maintenance is no longer
sufficient to preserve their structural strength. To forestail costly recon-
struction and increased transport costs, the proposed project will initiate a
program of pavement strengthening of heavily trafficked primary roads (paras.
3.07 and 3.08).
2.26       Problems impeding proper road maintenance can be summarized as:  (i)
a lack of and a large turnover of trained personnel who often leave PWD for
the private sector where salaries are higher; (ii) untimely and insufficient
road maintenance funds due to the Government's financial difficulties; and
(iii) frequent breakdowns of equipment, which was procured under the previous
Bank financed projects, and has aged. In order to sustain the efforts begun
under the previous projects and to resolve these problems, the following steps
would be taken under the proposed project: (i) establishment of a comprehensive
training program to satisfy the PWD needs in trained personnel, taking into
account the attrition rate (paras. 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05); (ii) provision by the
Government of timely and adequate funds for road maintenance (para. 2.19); and
(iii) procurement of equipment to replenish the equipment provided under the
First Highway Project (para. 3.06).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01       The road network of Togo is well defined, basically developed
and approaching a stage which meets the country's economic and social needs.
This network, with its paved south-north axis (Lome-Kante-Upper Volta Border),
provides a reliable link between the sea and the landlocked countries of Upper
Volta and Niger.  Previous highway projects contributed to the development of
this network and its maintenance. The objectives of the proposed project are
to: (i) increase PWD's capacity to maintain and improve the road network,
particularly by reducing the shortage of trained personnel; (ii.) prevent the
increase of road transport costs and costly road reconstructiorL by timely
strengthening of sections of the paved roads: (iii) promote the improvement of
selected east-west road links to open new agricultural areas; and (iv) improve
transport planning and coordination.
B. Project Description
3.02      To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project includes:
(a) a three-year training program for road maintenance personnel,
including technical assistance (120 man-months) and f-ellowships;



- 18 -
(b)  procurement of road maintenance equipment and spare parts;
(c)  pavement strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame (157 km) road;
(d)  pre-investment studies of the Notse-Tohoun road (57 km); and
(e)  technical assistance to MCT including the General Directorate
of Transport (60 man-months) and CFT (46 man-months).
(a) Training Program for Road Maintenance
3.03      The training program should provide the personnel needed over the
next three years to carry out proper and timely road maintenance operations.
During the three-year program, about 85 existing employees should be retrained
and promoted. Another 100 employees should be recruited and trained, includ-
ing 25 technicians, 65 mechanics, operators and drivers, 5 accountants and
5 secretaries.
3.04      The three-year program will be implemented by PTD (para. 2.11)
through appropriate Togolese and foreign institutions (para 3.05). PTD will
be assisted by a technical assistance team (120 man-months). The technical
assistance will be located in key positions within PWD organization: one
training expert in PTD, one road engineer in the Road Maintenance Office, one
mechanical engineer in the Equipment Division in Lome and one soils engineer
in the soils laboratory. The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) has
agreed to continue its technical assistance to the Equipment Division's annex
in Sokode and will provide another mechanical engineer. In addition to their
training assignment, the highway and mechanical engineers will assist RD in
the execution of annual road maintenance programs. The technical assistance
will help the PTD head: (i) select trainees, the appropriate curricula, and
institutions; (ii) monitor the progress of the trainees; and (iii) integrate
trained personnel into MPWMP.
3.05      The proposed project will provide scholarships to the trainees in
Togolese institutions; such as CERFER, for 10 specialized road technicians,
CNPP for the bulk of technicians, mechanics, operators and drivers (para.
3.03), and Centre National de Promotion des Petites et Moyennes Entreprises
(CNPPME), for 5 accountants and 5 secretaries. The project will also provide
fellowships to two soils engineers, two mechanical engineers, one transport
engineer, one transport economist and four technicians. This personnel will
receive two years of supplementary and specialized education in their respec-
tive field in appropriate foreign institutions. The proposed training package,
by utilizing effectively the existing vocational institutions, is the most
cost-effective means of providing specific skills in road construction and
maintenance. The training program will be reviewed every 12 months by the
Government and IDA to assess its efficiency. Details on consultants qualifi-
cations, team composition, length of service and terms of reference are given
in Annex 1. These terms of reference have been agreed upon at negotiations.
(b) Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.06      RD has two betterment and three regravelling brigades for periodic
road maintenance, and, in each of its five subdivisions, a routine road



- 19 -
maintenance brigade. These brigades are equipped mostly with equipment
procured in 1971 under the First Highway Project. Trucks bought at that
time were replaced in 1978 under the Third Highway Project. The bulk of the
remaining equipment has aged, requires frequent repair and contributes to the
decreasing productivity of the road maintenance brigades. This equipment will
be replaced through three separate sources: (i) by EDF, which has agreed to
replace the equipment for paved road brigades (estimated cost about US$1.0
million); (ii) by funds accruing under the Feeder Road Project, Cr. 810-TO for
amortization of the equipment used by PWD in the execution of 400 km of roads
(para. 2.12), estimated at CFAF 180 million (US$0.8 million); and (iii) by the
proposed project. The equipment (with estimated costs, net of taxes, as of
January 1981) to be procured by IDA financing under the project is listed
below:

(c) Strengthening and Rehabilitation of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road
3.07      The paving of Togo's primary road network started in the late 1960s.
These roads were designed and constructed for low volume and light traffic.
They are reaching the end of their economic life, and about 400 km have been
identified for strengthening and rehabilitation in the next five years. The
proposed project will initiate a program of pavement strengthening and re-
habilitation by including the Lome-Notse-Atakpame section (157 km) of the
south-north road axis. Detailed engineering studies for these improvements
were carried out by RD's Planning and Design Office assisted by consultants
BCEOM.
3.08      The Lome-Notse-Atakpame road could technically be divided into two
sections. The first section, Lome-Tsevie (32 km), was built in 1969 with a 9m
wide platform, 7m wide and 15 cm thick cement stabilized laterite base, and 6m
wide double asphalt surface treatment. It carries about 3,500 vehicles per day



- 20 -
(vpd) 16% of which is trucks. The second section, Tsevie-Notse-Atakpame
(125 km), was built 9 years ago with the same geometric characteristics as
Lome-Tsevie, but its pavement is composed of a layer of laterite, 15-20 cm
thick, with a double asphalt surface treatment. Tsevie-Notse-Atakpame now
carries an average of about 600 vpd with 25% trucks. Pavement improvements
of these road sections, as proposed by the PWD Design and Planning Office,
assisted by consultants BCEOM, consist of: (i) rebuilding of some sub-grades;
(ii) construction of new sub-base and base courses; (iii) construction of a
4 cm asphalt concrete wearing course on high traffic road section (Lome-Agoueve,
9.8 km) and a double asphalt surface treatment on the remaining road section;
(iv) regravelling of shoulders; (v) improvement of drainage structures; and
(vi) widening of some sections (Lome-Agoueve, 9.8 km) of the roadway from 9m
to lOm, and pavement from 6m to 7m, to accommodate high traffic volume. It is
expected that resurfacing will be required after 7-8 years.
(d)  Study of Notse-Tohoun Road (57 ki)
3.09      The proposed project would provide for the feasibility study of
the Notse-Tohoun road, to be followed by the detailed engineering of the
economically justified improvement level. When constructed, Notse-Tohoun will
complete the west-east road link, Agou-Notse-Tohoun, started under the Third
Highway Project, with the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km). The
improved link between Ghana and Benin will be important for local as well as
international traffic.
3.10      Notse-Tohoun would serve the south-east region.  This area has good
agricultural potential, since it has sufficient rainfall and about 80% of the
land in the road zone is suitable for cultivation (50,000 ha). Despite
difficult road conditions, agricultural organizations such as SRCC and SOTOCO
are running successful operations in this area, and FAO is designing an agro-
industrial project to promote the area production of cotton and tobacco. This
road will J-so provide an economic, administrative, and political link between
the rest of the country and the enclaved region east of the Mono River.
3.11      Notse-Tohoun, which carries in average about 55 vpd (1980 traffic
count), is a poorly-aligned and poorly-drained track 3-5m wide. It is pass-
able only during the dry season (9 months a year), and totally cut off during
the rainy season (July-September) by the flooding of the Mono River. This
road links Notse to Tohoun on the Benin border, where a connecting road
already exists. A bridge and its approaches have recently been built across
the Mono River on the road alignment. PWD carries out some annual regravelling
works on this track, but they are uneconomical as they are washed out every
rainy season because of the lack of drainage structures. Notse-Tohoun is
expected to be designed to the level of a two-lane gravel road. The terms of
reference for the preinvestment studies, given in Annex 2, have been agreed
upon at negotiations.
(e) Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Commerce and
Transport (MCT)
3.12      Under the Third Highway Project, the Governnment created in June 1980
a General Directorate of Transport (para. 1.17) within MCT in order to streng-
then overall transport planning and assist in solving main issues in the
transport sector. The tasks of GDT consist of:



- 21 -
(a) collection of data and definition of transport policy for the
country;
(b) analyzing special issues in the sector (CFT, road transport
industry, etc.);
(c) preparing proposals for future development and following the imple-
mentation of the ongoing Plan in the sector; and
(d)  coordinating transport modes, particularly rail and road.
GDT is also expected to carry out or supervise the execution of several
studies which will help the Government define and implement a strategy to
improve the efficiency of the transport sector: studies on the improvement
of CFT operations; a study of current and future supply and demand for land
transport; and a review of road user taxes.
3.13      GDT has just started to operate.  Two Togolese economists have been
assigned to it, but it still needs two engineers and a director (para. 1.17).
The draft work program of GDT was discussed and agreed upon during project
appraisal. Under the Third Highway Project, 72 man-months of technical
assistance were provided for transport planning and coordination, of which
about 55 man-months remained unused. The proposed project should continue
this effort by providing an additional 60 man-months of technical assistance
for: (i) a transport economist as team leader, (ii) a transport engineer,
and (iii) a road transport specialist with experience in financial analysis.
The terms of reference for the technical assistance, given in Annex 3, have
been agreed upon at negotiations.
3.14      The project provides further technical assistance tc MCT (46 man-
months) to improve CFT operations. This technical assistance would consist of
one engineer attached to the office of the General Manager, one engineer to
supervise the lines and the workshop, a financial analyst and an economist who
would define an action program to improve the railways operation (management,
maintenance and traffic organization) and help in the implementation of such
a program. It was agreed at negotiations that the action program would be
submitted to the Association by December 31, 1980 for its review and comments.
The technical assistance terms of reference were agreed upon aLt negotiations.
C. Project Cost and Financing
3.15      The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated
at US$31.2 million equivalent, with local costs of US$6.0 million equivalent
(19%) and foreign costs of about US$25.2 million equivalent (81%). The
Government has exempted the project from taxes and duties estimated at US$9.7
million. Project costs, detailed in Annex 4, are summarized on page 22
(including contingencies).
3.16      The foreign cost component of civil works is estimated at 79% of
total cost, net of taxes, similar to other countries in the region for this
type of works; the foreign cost of equipment is estimated at 90%. The
foreign component of consultants  services for construction supervision
and road preinvestment studies is estimated at 80%, and 90% for technical
assistance to GDT.



- 22 -
3.17       The estimated quantities for the project civil works are based on
detailed engineering plans prepared by RD Design and Planning Office assisted
by consultants BCEOM; 10% physical contingencies are allowed for the items in
civil works during execution. Project cost estimates are at January 1981
prices; price contingencies are calculated taking into account expected inter-
national price increases of 9% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982, and 7.5% p.a. thereafter.

3.18       The road rehabilitation and strengthening works on the Lome-Notse-
Atakpame road average CFAF 27.0 million (US$115,000) per km, excluding taxes
and contingencies. These costs are in line with the costs of similar works in
Togo carried out after competitive bidding. The cost of construction super-
vision amounts to about 6% of construction costs. The cost of technical
assistance is based on man-month unit prices of similar services in Togo. The
billing rate for consultant services, excluding contingencies, is estimated at



- 23 -
an average of US$7,000 per field man-month and includes salaries and overhead
(home office expenses, expatriate allowances, social security, proposal
preparation, and other indirect expenses). Reimbursable expenses, excluding
contingencies, payable to consultants are estimated at US$3,400 per field
man-month including housing, internal and external travel, and telecommunica-
tions. Overseas fellowships are estimated at US$8,000 a year including travel.
The cost of road pre-investment study is estimated at about CFAF 1.8 million
(US$7,800 per km) on the basis of recent similar studies carriecl out in Togo
and comparable countries.
3.19      Togo is experiencing considerable financial difficulties at present.
As this situation is likely to continue in the near future, it has been agreed
that, under the proposed project, the Association and any co-lender should
finance about 88% of the total project cost, net of taxes. This represents
the total foreign costs plus about 37% of local costs. External sources will
thus provide about US$27.4 million to finance the project. The OPEC Fund
would provide US$7.4 million (24% of total cost or 29% of foreigrn) to jointly
finance the foreign costs of the project. The Association would contribute
a US$20.0 million credit (64% of total cost), and the Government, which has
decided to exonerate the project from taxes and duties, will contribute the
remaining US$3.8 million (12% of total cost) toward the cost of the project.
The financing plan is shown below.

D.   Implementation
3.20      Implementation of the project elements will be the responsibility
of the MPWMP through its PWD except for the technical assistance to GDT and
CFT, which will be the responsibility of the MCT.
3.21      The expected implementation schedule for major activities of each
project element is shown on the chart on the next page. This schedule was
agreed upon at negotiations. The project will take about four years to
complete.  The pavement strengthening works of Lome-Notse-Atakpame (157 km)
road should start in April 1982 and take approximately 20 months to complete.
Technical assistance for training, road maintenance and soils laboratory would
be provided for three years starting January 1982. Technical assistance
to transport planning would continue for two more years starting June 1982.
Technical assistance to CFT would be provided for a year and a half starting
January 1982. Pre-investment studies of Notse-Tohoun road (57 km) should
start in January 1982 and take about a year and a half to complete with a
review by the Government and IDA in the third quarter of 1982. Road mainte-
nance equipment should be delivered by September 1982, about a year after

notification of contracts to the suppliers. The Government has agreed, during
negotiations, to prepare and submit to the Bank Group, within six months of
the final disbursement, a completion report of the project.
E.   Procurement
3.22      Civil works on Lome-Notse-Atakpame road will be carried out by
contract awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Prospective bidders will have to be
prequalified. To encourage local construction industry, it was agreed during
negotiations that IDA's 7.5% margin of preference will be granted to eligible
,omestic contractors bidding for civil works.
3.23      The road maintenance equipment will be procured after international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for Procure-
ment. However, items costing under US$20,000 equivalent may be procured on
the basis of quotes obtained from competing suppliers, provided the aggregate
amount of such purchases does not exceed US$300,000 equivalent. Bidders will
compete on the basis of cost, delivery time and reliability of after-sales
service. Due consideration will also be given in bid evaluation to equipment
standardization in order to simplify equipment maintenance. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15% or the level of
applicable duty, whichever is less, when comparing domestic bids with those
of foreign manufacturers.
3.24      Technical assistance to RD-s Design Office for supervision of
improvement works of Lome-Notse-Atakpame Road would be procured by mutual
agreement between Government and the consultants BCEOM; who satisfactorily
carried out the detailed engineering of these improvements. Technical
assistance to the soil½s laboratory and GDT would also be procured by mutual
agreement between Government and consultants CEBTB and Louis Berger Interna-
tional, Inc., respectively; these consultants satisfactorily carried out
previous assistance program under the Third Highway Project. Other technical
assistance and pre-investment study items would be carried out by qualified
and experienced consultants under the terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
F.   Disbursement
3.25      The proposed IDA Credit disbursements, which will be fully docu-
mented, would be effected on the following basis:
(a)  100% of expenditures for consulting services, technical
assistance, and fellowships:
(b)  100% of CIF cost for imported road maintenance equipment, and
90% of the cost if procured locally; and
(c)  54% of total contract expenditures net of taxes for pavement
strengthening work of Lome-Notse-Atakpame road (OPEC will con-
tribute 31% toward the cost of this element or its total financ-
ing, US$7.4 million, and the Government 15% or about US$3.6
million of its total contribution of US$3.8 million).

G.   Project Risks
3.27      Continuation of assistance to road maintenance operations may be
adversely affected for the following reasons: (i) insufficient funds, (ii)
misuse or underutilization of equipment, (iii) lack of qualified personnel,
and (iv) inadequate equipment servicing facilities. According to the Associa-
tion-s past ten-year experience in road maintenance in Togo, the main risk is
a possible shortfall of the minimum funds needed for road maintenance. To
reduce this risk, the Government has agreed during negotiations to provide
the necessary minimum funds (para. 2.19). In addition, the Government's



- 27 -
timely contribution to meet part of the local project cost will be crucial.
To safeguard against this project-related risk, the Government's funding of
its share in the project will be monitored, discussed, and agreed upon annually.
3.28      The road strengthening program has few technical risks as it is
based on sound engineering principles and involves normal road construction
practice. Construction costs, however, are likely to increase if the proposed
pavement strengthening is delayed beyond the 1981/82 dry seasons--mainly
because of additional work resulting from further deterioration of the roads.
3.29      Finally, there is a risk that the proposed technical assistance and
institutional development in transport planning may not achieve its intended
objectives. The proposed technical assistance is, however, indispensable
for the newly created GDT to perform critical line functions where locally
available resources are insufficient to resolve the pending issues in trans-
port development. This part of the proposed project is the most: delicate
one and will, consequently, require the Bank's close supervision.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      Improvement of the primary and secondary road networks,, in par-
ticular the south-north road axis, has been given high priority in the
Government development policy, including the draft Plan for 1981-85. Since
1978, the road maintenance operations have deteriorated (para. 2.27), in
particular periodic maintenance. The proposed project is geared to strengthen
efforts made in road maintenance by the Government and the Bank Group during
previous IDA financed highway projects. In addition, the proposed project is
designed to contribute to an urgent need for strengthening of the main
south-north road axis used by long-distance international transit traffic.
4.02      The proposed project has an overall economic rate of return (ERR)
of about 56%. The assistance to road maintenance operations (including
anticipated EDF contributions) will have a high benefit/cost (B/C) ratio of
4:1 with a corresponding ERR of about 90%. The proposed road strengthening
(157 km) is also well justified and expected to yield an average ERR of about
30%. Other project elements, pre-investment studies for the Notse-Tohoun road
construction and technical assistance to CDT in MCT are also economically
sound; a preliminary analysis of the road construction shows a rate of return
of about 14%, while the technical assistance is considered to be of great
importance in improving investment decisions and reducing pending problems in
the transport sector.
B. Project Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The bulk of project benefits is related to savings in vehicle
operating costs (voc) from improving condition of the road network. Other
expected benefits from the road strengthening component are: time savings
and reduction in number of road accidents. They were not included in the
computation of ERR, since the first is considered to be marginal and the



- 28 -
second is difficult to quantify due to lack of reliable data. Important
benefits could also be anticipated from the proposed timely road strengthen-
ing program where costly full reconstruction of Lome-Tsevie-Notse-Atakpame
road will be avoided.
4.04      It is expected that, in the first round of distribution, the major
beneficiaries of transport cost reductions will be the users of the roads--
owners of taxis, pick-ups, and trucks. Some of the transport cost reductions
are likely to be passed on to low income groups--small farmers and their
families along the network to be included in the maintenance program and in
particular in the zone of the road strengthening--in the form of higher
farmgate prices due to lower transport costs or slower increases in transport
costs because of the competitive situation in the road transport industry.
Consumers should benefit from the expected reduction in transport cost in the
form of lower transport rates or at least in prevention of further increases.
Some benefits are expected to be passed on to passengers since there is some
competition in inter-urban passenger transport. The project is also expected
to produce general benefits to other sectors, such as supporting an increase
in marketed agricultural production and to the economy as a whole by improving
and maintaining main roads in the country. It is not feasible, however, to
estimate quantitatively how project benefits would diffuse to the Government,
among the population and to different economic sectors. Finally, recipients
of long distance transit traffic will also benefit from the road strengthening.
4.05      On the institutional side, the project will help improve the capa-
city of the Roads Division in PWD in planning and executing road maintenance
operations; in addition, the project is also designed to continue the assist-
ance to the newly created GDT in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport.
These benefits, although difficult to quantify, should result from more
rational investment decisions in the transport sector and in savings or
better use of limited resources.
C. Assistance to Road Maintenance
4.06      Deficiencies of the road maintenance operations are explained
in paras. 2.26-2.27. It is clear that efforts made under the previous Bank
Group financed highway projects need to be continued in order to strengthen
the institutional development and to prevent deterioration of the main road
network. The thrust of the maintenance component of the proposed project is
to secure the necessary improvements in organization of the maintenance
operations, funding, usage and maintenance of equipment, and staffing, to
make the revised road maintenance operations efficient countrywide and to
sustain them permanently.
4.07      In three years (1982-84), the assistance to road maintenance will
cover about 84% of total primary and secondary network under PWD jurisdiction.
The roads selected for the revised road maintenance operations (about 2,300
km) are the most trafficked ones with at least a minimum design standard; the
part of the network not included in the program (about 450 km) are mostly
unimproved earth roads and tracks, where a substantial investment in con-
struction is required to bring them to a minimum design standard prior to



- 29 -
maintenance. The road maintenance operations to be financed by the project
and EDF will encompass (i) routine maintenance of paved (about 1,500 km) and
of unpaved roads (about 800 km) and (ii) periodic maintenance of the unpaved
roads.
4.08      Existing traffic volumes on the network to be included in the
program are relatively high (Table below).  About 1,650 km of roads (72% of
all roads to be included in the program) had traffic exceeding 100 vpd
in 1979. PWD began countrywide traffic counts in 1978, and it is now rather
difficult to determine a reliable annual traffic growth rate. From 1978 to
1979 the growth rate was about 11-12%. From the available data, (para. 2.04),
a conservative growth rate of 8% per year was assumed in the economic analysis
of the road maintenance operations.

4.09      Project costs of the program to strengthen the road maintenance
include: capital expenditures for equipment, spare parts, and technical
assistance, as well as incremental recurrent costs. The project benefits
consist of vehicle operating cost savings resulting from improved road sur-
face conditions due to additional efforts in road maintenance. The savings
in vehicle operating costs (voc) are translated to passenger car units (pcu)
savings. The capital and recurrent cost streams as well as the benefit stream
are shown in Annex 5. In the six-year economic life, the revised road main-
tenance operations with assistance from IDA and EDF are expected to yield an
ERR of about 90%, with a corresponding B/C ratio of 4.1:1 at a discount rate
of 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Togo. In the sensitivity
analysis, if the operations of periodic and routine maintenance are reduced by
about 50%, the ERR is still high, 61% with a B/C ratio of 2.6:1 (Annex 5).

D. Road Strengthening and Rehabilitation
4.10      The road to be strengthened and rehabilitated, Lome-Agoueve-Tsevie-
Notse-Atakpame (157 km) is one of the most heavily trafficked sections of the
road network. Built in 1969-70, the road has a weak foundation and low design
standards which are inadequate to support the growing volume of traffic (Table,
page 30). Normal road maintenance can no longer arrest the accelerating
deterioration of the pavement. Unless the pavement is rehabilitated and
strengthened soon, it is estimated that it will break up completely in a few
years (by 1985/87).
4.11      The rehabilitation is essential for the national economy, the
Lome-Notse-Atakpame road is a part of Togo's main south-north axis. Annual
average daily traffic is very high as it serves a domestic, local, and inter-
national traffic. About 100,000 tons of transit traffic per year, or about 15
heavy trucks per day on average, have been transported to and from Upper Volta
and Niger. Compared to the total traffic volume on the road, the transit
traffic has, however, an insignificant share. According to systematic traffic
counts over the last four years (1975-79), average annual traffic growth on
the road was about 11%.  The traffic volume varies substantially by road
section, as presented in the Table on page 31: in 1979, annual average daily
traffic was over 6,100 vpd at the outskirts of Lome, decreasing to about
2,000 vpd at Tsevie, and to about 600 vpd at Notse and Atakpame. The share of
heavy vehicles increases from an average 16% at the Lome-Tsevie section (32 km),
to average 25% on Tsevie-Notse-Atakpame (125 km) section.
4.12      The recommended level of road strengthening/rehabilitation was
compared to the "without-the-project" case, i.e., further deterioration of
existing pavement with consequent increase in voc. In the economic analysis,
the Atakpame-Notse-Lome road was divided into four sections due to different
scope of works needed, cost per km, and uneven traffic volumes. The cost (at
end 1980 prices) includes civil works, physical contingencies of 10% and super-
vision. Road strengthening/rehabilitation was estimated to start in early 1982



- 31 -
and to be completed in early 1984. The proposed works are well justified with
first year returns between 11-41% (Annex 5). Based on a ten-year economic
life for the road strengthening and annual growth of 8%, the combined ERR for
Lome-Notse-Atakpame road is 38%; rounded ERRs per section are presented below:

4.13      The various components of the economic evaluation have not been
estimated with equal degrees of reliability. To determine the sensitivity
of the ERR to variations in the estimated costs and benefits, an analysis
was carried out, assuming an overall increase in costs and decrease in
benefits separately and simultaneously. The results of this analysis, which
are summarized in the Table on page 30, indicate that, with costs increasing
or benefits decreasing by as much as 25%, the ERR would still remain well
above 10%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Togo. More details
on the economic analysis are presented in Annex 5.
E.   Other Project Components
4.14      The project also provides for a study of Notse-Tohoun road (57 km)
construction. On the basis of preliminary engineering (assuming an all-weather
gravel road) and preliminary economic analysis, the road's ERR is estimated at
about 14%. The other project element--technical assistance to newly created
GDT in MCT--is also justified although its benefits are difficult to quantify.
GDT is expected to provide the Government with important recommendations for
resolving major issues in the sector (CFT, road transport industry, transport
tariffs, etc.), and it should have an important impact on future planning of
transport investments.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Negotiation of the proposed project proceeded only when the
Association received the necessary assurances from the Government that:
(a) it will stick to its agreement to prepare and implement an action
program to improve CFT operations and its intentions to assign high
priority to this in the GDT work program (para. 1.11); and
(b) necessary budgetary funds have been made available to the newly
established GDT in MCT, its deputy director and some local staff
have been appointed, its work program formally agreed and GDT has
actually become operational (para. 1.17.).
5.02      During negotiations the following principal items were discussed and
agreed upon by the Government and incorporated as covenants in the Credit
Agreement:
(a) the covenant 4.04 (c) of the Credit Agreement 693-TO was modified
and December 31, 1981 set as a new deadline for submission of the
CFT-s action program to the Association for comments (para. 1.11);
(b) vehicle weight control legislation would become effective and
enforced by the Government by December 31, 1981 (para. 2.09);
(c) the Personnel Office in PWD would be changed to the Personnel
and Training Division (PTD); this would be done and adequate staff
provided by January 1, 1982 (para. 2.11);



- 33 -
(d)  road maintenance operations will be limited to 2,300 km incorporat-
ing all paved roads (1,500 km) and about 800 km of engineered gravel
roads; in addition a minimum annual allocation of CFAF 750 million
in constant 1980 prices from the general budget for road maintenance
would be provided (para. 2.19); and
(e) project completion report will be prepared by the Government within
six months of the final disbursement (para. 3.21).
5.03      During negotiations the following items were discussed and agreed
upon by the Government:
(a) outline Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance for Training
and Road Maintenance (para. 3.05);
(b) the contract between PWD and DGR and Credit 810-TO for feeder road
construction would be amended to provide for the procurement of the
earthwork equipment (paras. 2.12 and 3.06);
(c) outline Terms of Reference for pre-investment studies (para. 3.11);
(d)  outline Terms of Reference for the Technical Assistance to the
Ministry of Commerce and Transport (paras. 3.13 and 3.14);
(e) the implementation schedule for each project element (para. 3.21);
and
(f) IDA's margin of preference of 7.5% would be granted to eligible
domestic contractors (paras. 2.22 and 3.22).
5.04      Satisfactory agreements and arrangements having been reached on the
items listed in paras. 5.01 to 5.03, the proposed project is suitable for a
credit of US$20.0 million equivalent on standard IDA terms to the Government
of the Republic of Togo.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Construction of the Notse-Tohoun Road
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering
Outline Terms of Reference
I. OBJECTIVES
1.        The Ministry of Public Works, Mines and Power (MPWMP') intends to
undertake the construction of the Notse-Tohoun road (57 km). The economic and
technical studies necessary to define these works are described in these terms
of reference.
The objectives of these studies are:
(i) to define on the basis of technical and economic criteria the
optimum level for the road construction; and
(ii) to prepare the final engineering and bidding documents for the
works defined on the basis of the studies under (i) above.
2.        The Planning/Design Unit in PWD prepared in April 1980 a brief
analysis of the Notse-Tohoun road including some preliminary economic and tech-
nical data. In the course of the preparation of the pre-investment studies,
the Planning/Design Unit will prepare some basic data for consultants who will
carry out the studies; the scope of the assistance will be determined later in
agreement with selected consultants.
3.        Notse-Tohoun is now a poorly aligned and poorly drained track, 3
to 5m wide, which is passable only during the dry season, 9 months a year,
linking Notse to Tohoun on the Benin border, where a connecting road in Benin
already exists. The road is now carrying about 55 vpd (1980 traffic count);
this traffic is totally interrupted during the rainy season, three months a
year (July-September), due to the flooding of the Mono River. A large bridge
has recently been built across the Mono River, and works on its access are
being carried out. PWD is also carrying out some annual regravelling works on
the existing track. These works are short lasting and uneconomical as they
are washed out every rainy season.
II. STUDY
4.        The study will be executed in two phases by a team composed of
consultant experts with the assistance of MPWMP staff.



- 38 -
Annex 2
Page 2
(a) Phase I. Feasibility Study and Preliminary Engineering
Phase I includes all the economic and technical studies necessary to
define the nature, importance, and characteristics for the reinforcement
and/or reconstruction works to be undertaken.
On the basis of the Phase I studies, the Government will decide the
type of construction to be undertaken.
(b)  Phase II:  Detailed Engineering
Phase II will proceed only if the proposed technical solution is
supported by sound economic justification; it will include the detailed
engineering and bidding documents for the execution of the works to be
undertaken.
Phase I
5.        Feasibility Study.  The objective of the feasibility study is to
define the optimum technical solutions based on economic analysis for the con-
struction of the Notse-Tohoun road. The choice will be based on a comparison
of alternatives including:
(i) the scope of the construction to be undertaken-
(ii)  the technical characteristics to be given to the road sections;
(iii)  the cost for the execution of the works; and
(iv)  economic rate of return of each alternative.
6.        The feasibility study will include:
(1) Traffic studies
Forecasts of traffic will be made for the Notse-Tohoun
road. They should take into account local and international
traffic (Ghana-Benin).
The following vehicle types should be used:
- heavy trucks (greater than 5t load) and buses
- light trucks (about 5t load)
- vans and land rovers
- passenger cars
The forecasts should be established with the help of origin-
destination surveys of typical users. In that respect, the road
may need to be divided into sections.



- 39 -                        Annex 2
Page 3
The following points should receive special attention:
(i) seasonal variations in traffic;
(ii) international traffic between Ghana and Benin;
(iii) traffic generated by agricultural development in the road
zone;
(iv) forecast of a major traffic increase immediately after the
road is constructed; and
(v) determining future traffic growth rate per year.
(2) Study of road transport costs
For each technical solution considered, the operating
costs for each type of vehicle during the economic life of the
investment will be studied. The costs of routine and periodic
maintenance will be included, as well as the costs of road con-
struction. The interrelationship between traffic, the voc,
maintenance costs and the cost of construction will be con-
sidered.
7.        Economic comparison of the solutions examined.  To define the
economically most advantageous solution, a comparison will be made of the
total transport costs (all net of taxes) on the road (including all VOC),
for the economic life of the proposed investment, as well as the costs
of investments and maintenance associated with the different solutions consid-
ered. The comparison is to determine the optimum technical characteristics
as well as the timing of the investment. Normal and generated traffic will
be separately identified. Other benefits to be quantified are: the economic
savings due to reduced vehicle accidents and breakdowns, and the development
benefits in the zone of influence of the road (avoiding double-counting of
generated traffic). The effects of the alignment on the environment shall
be examined, and the consultants shall recommend appropriate measures to
minimize any adverse effects.
8.        The various solutions will be compared to a reference solution, which
is defined as the continued use of the existing road, on its present alignment,
without major investments and with maintenance as required. The ERR and the
net present value using a 10-12% discount rate will be determined for each
solution, as well as the first year return (comparison of costs to benefits
the first year after completion). A sensitivity analysis will be performed to
account for uncertainty in any of the cost and benefit parameters entering in
the calculation. Any possible interdependence among the variables should be
considered.



- 40 -
Annex 2
Page 4
9.        The costs to be taken into account are economic costs, i.e., net
of taxes and subsidies and adjusted to reflect the scarcity or surplus of the
resource. In addition, to convert all local costs into border prices, an
analysis with conversion factors for local material and labor (shadow wage
rate) will also be undertaken to calculate ERR.
10.       Technical Investigations.  Consultants should undertake all
pertinent topographic, soils, and hydrological surveys to determine a new
alignment or partial realignment for the construction of the Notse-Tohoun (57
km) road; they should undertake topographic surveys for necessary road
widening.
11.       All bridges and drainage structures to be repaired or constructed
will also be examined and the necessary works defined. The documents neces-
sary for the execution of these works will be prepared, including investiga-
tions for foundation studies and hydrological surveys for drainage works.
12.       The Consultants should also study with special attention the
materials best adapted for the construction of the subgrade, sub-base, the
base and wearing courses. They should identify and carefuly evaluate the
quality and quantity of available materials within economical hauling dis-
tance to the road.
13.       The Phase I studies will-be defined with the accuracy of preliminary
engineering.
Phase II
14.       Detailed engineering and bidding documents.  The second phase will
include the preparation of detailed engineering cost estimates and bidding
documents for the works found economically justified and selected by the
Government with IDA concurrence, on the basis of the Phase I recommendations.
15.       The bidding documents will be prepared for international competitive
bidding with prequalification of contractors, in accordance with the Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits.
16.       As soon as the necessary elements for the detailed definition of
the works are known, the consultants will prepare a prequalification dossier.
It will include an invitation to apply for prequalification as well as a
brief descriptive notice on the nature of the works. The consultants will
also prepare the newspaper publicity and the circulars for informing the
embassies of IDA member countries and Switzerland.
17.       The bidding documents shall include:
(a)  all plans necessary for staking the road centerline, cross-
sections and grades and for construction of sub-grades, base
course, ditches, shoulders, as well as for all drainage
structures and bridges where needed;



-41 -                              Annex 2

(b) the general conditions of contract;
(c) the special conditions of contract, including the technical
specifications of the construction methods and materials and
the control and measurements procedures;
(d) schedule of unit prices; and
(e) the quantity estimate.
18.       The confidential report shall comprise the detailed cost estimate,
broken down into foreign costs, local cost and taxes. The foreign cost will
include, in particular, the following: depreciation of imported equipment,
imported materials and supplies, salaries and benefits for expatriate personnel
(but excluding any payments or expenses in local currency), overheads and
profits of the contractor, as well as the main foreign exchange cost of goods
produced in Togo which are used in the project.
19.       The Government will supply the formats and other details necesary
for the preparation of written documents.

1/   Analysis was done in end 1980 prices, net of taxes;  economic rate of return for A and B combined is 55.6%.
2/   Economic analysis wa6 made on the basis of economic life of 6 years and annuval traffic growth of 8%;  road maintenance oneratio.b on 2,300 km include isvestments in road maintenanee  equipoenL
and spare parts to be made by IDA** and EDF*, and technical assistance financed bi  IDA (CFAF 82 million per year);  incremental recurrent annual expenditures of CFAF 200 million were also
included;  in addition, an estimated cost of resurfacing of paved roads was included in the analysis.  The benefits of the new, revised rood maintenance operations wcre derived frn tLhe
difference between the state of paved (about 1,500 km) and gravel (ahout 800 km) toads without the new assistance (lssumin8 e-trapolatic:: of current road maintenance performance) and with
the new inveatments and technical assistance.  The benefits, savintgs in VOC, were made on the basis of PCU (passenger car unit, average of passenger vehicle/pick up), where all the vehicles
were translated  into PCU (1 truck = 3 PCUs).  Benefit/cost ratios were discounted by 10%, esLimated opportu-sty cost of capital ill Togo.
3/   Routine and periodic road maintenance were assumed to be carried cut by 50% only of the e-pected output.
4/   Economic life for the works was assumed at 10 years;  routine road maintenance was not included iv: the calculation, since it was estiated t  h  about the                                 i  "witi" and i"wi vhoctl  the
proaect case;  traffic growth es.trmate ewas c---  i- aLt 8%  per year;  no residual -aue  7a  Ass-med at the ed of the economic life;  the benefits  deriving fr., savings in VOC were
calculated ass-ming a gradual deterioration of the road (full deterioration by 1985-87) depeodi,:p on section, instead oi rapid dterioratio. estimate;  no timn  ot accidents savings/
benefits werc included in the calulation;   since the paved road already exiated, generated traffic was not considered;  the cost of  urkbs also includes 6% inc supervision and 10% foe
physical contingencies.
5/   These economic returns were calculated on the basis of applying sladow rate for local cost of the civil works;  its share in total cost nset  f taxes is sbout 21%,  the share of local
materials is negligible (about 2%).  Consequently, shadow wage rate (.75%) was applied to the cost of local labor;  as only about 19% of total cost of civil works was affected with the
minor ehanges, the results in ERR are not far away from the basic ERR.  In the bre-lits side, IOCl input in VPC--driv-ers  wago  make only 5-7% of total VCii  and consequently h-ae
little significanse.
