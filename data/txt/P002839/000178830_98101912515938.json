three-year training program for road\n            maintenance personnel, consisting of technical assistance\n            (120 man-months) and fellowships; (b) procurement of road\n            maintenance equipment and spare parts; (c) pavement\n            strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame road (157 km); (d)\n            pre-investment studies of the Notse-Tohoun road (57 km); (e)\n            technical assistance (60 man-months) to the General\n            Directorate of Transport to improve transport planning and\n            coordination; and (f) technical assistance (46 man-months)\n            to CFT to improve railway operations. Project benefits will\n            essentially be in savings in vehicle operating costs, which\n            will directly benefit the transporters but could eventually\n            be passed on to small farmers and consumers in the form of\n            higher farmgate prices and slower increases in transport\n            costs. The main risk of the project is linked to the\n            generally slow response of the Togolese authorities to\n            technical assistance, in particular as it relates to\n            planning. The recent progress made, however, in the\n            establishment of the General Directorate of Transport (GDT),\n            staffing and the definition of its work program is an\n            indication of the Government's commitment to strengthen planning."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
