FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:     Republic of Togo
Amount:       SDR 16.4 million - (US$20.0 million equivalent)
Terms:        Standard IDA terms
Co-Lender:    OPEC Fund for International Development - US$7.4 million
Project
Description:  The project would comprise:
(a) a three-year training program for road maintenance person-
nel, consisting of technical assistance (120 man-months)
and fellowships;
(b) procurement of road maintenance equipment and spare parts;
(c) pavement strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame
road (157 km);
(d) pre-investment studies of the Notse-Tohoun road (57 km);
(e) technical assistance (60 man-months) to the General
Directorate of Transport to improve transport planning and
coordination; and
(f) technical assistance (46 man-months) to CFT to improve
railway operations.
Benefits
and Risks:    Project benefits would essentially be in savings in vehicle
operating costs, which would directly benefit the transporters
but could eventually be passed on to small farmers and consumers
in the form of higher farmgate prices and slower increases in
transport costs. The main risk of the project is linked to the
generally slow response of the Togolese authorities to technical
assistance, in particular as it relates to planning. The recent
progress made, however, in the establishment of the General
Directorate of Transport (GDT), staffing and the definition of
its work program is an indication of the Government's commitment
to strengthen planning.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC
OF TOGO FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Togo for an amount in various currencies
equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16.4 million (US$20.0 million) on stan-
dard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Highway Project. Additional financing
for the project would be provided on a joint basis by the OPEC Fund for
International Development in the amount of US$7.4 million on terms to be
established in a separate agreement between the Borrower and the OPEC Fund.
PART I - THE ECONOMiY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974.
Economic missions visited Togo in December 1978, and in October 1980. Their
findings are incorporated below and in Annex I which contains basic country
data.
Economic Performance
3.        Togo is a small country (56,000 km2) in which trade has always
featured prominently in overall economic activity. Population is currently
estimated at 2.4 million and GNP per capita is US$340. Phosphate mining has
been the principal source of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for an
estimated 39% of export revenues in 1979/1980.
4.        Slow growth and increasing financial disequilibria were the salient
features of the Togolese economy during the 1975-80 period. The slow growth
represented a deceleration from historical growth trends, and was the result
of a drop in phosphate production and exports in 1975 and a recovery to full
capacity thereafter, and of stagnation or decline in the production of export
crops. The 1974/75 boom in world phosphate prices contributed to a substantial
increase in export earnings and Government revenues, and prompted the Govern-
ment to adopt an ambitious Development Plan for 1976-80.
5.        Growth in real GDP averaged less than three percent per annum during
the 1975-80 period. Gross domestic expenditure outpaced production, with the
result that the resource gap widened significantly through 1978. Due to the
rapid increase in public investment, gross domestic investment rose sharply
to exceed 50% of GDP in 1978, but declined to an estimated 21% in 1980, as
growing fiscal constraints necessitated a cutback.
6.        In the primary sector, accounting for 30% of GDP and 80% of employ-
ment, growth has been limited by inadequate investments and extension services,
insufficient price incentives, and occasional droughts. Although Togo relies
largely on traditional production techniques, it is generally self-sufficient



- 2 -
in food crops, except during serious droughts. Yet the relative neglect of
agriculture has meant that only tiny portions of the cultivable land used to
grow food crops benefit from fertilizer, insecticides, and selected seeds.
Yields are consequently low. Production of export crops, mainly cocoa and
coffee, has been hampered until recently by less attractive producer prices
and by aging trees with declining yields.
7.        The secondary sector experienced drastic swings during the 1975-80
period. Production of phosphate rock slumped badly in 1975 due to a recession-
induced decline in demand but recovered almost completely during the following
two years. The massive investments channelled into industrial projects did
not boost real GDP on account of the little or occasionally even negative
value added of several new industrial units. Construction went through boom
and bust as output doubled between 1975 and 1978, because of greatly stepped-
up investment, and subsequently declined to the 1975 volume. From a peak of
10,000 in 1978, employment in construction was cut to 4,000 in 1980. The
capital-intensive nature of much investment led to an increase in demand
for energy, most of which is met through imports of petroleum products and
electricity.
8.        In the tertiary sector growth was concentrated in public services
and other private (mainly financial) services during the 1975-80 period. The
rapid increase in public services was caused by substantial recruitment into
the civil service in 1975-78, which grew during the whole period from 23,000
to 39,000. The growing size and sophistication of the banking system accounted
for the rapid expansion of other private services, while economic activity in
private transport and commerce, which are little affected by public interven-
tion, was more in line with the rest of the economy.
Public Finance
9.        In 1975 current revenues of the Government nearly doubled to
CFAF 33 billion as revenue from phosphates tripled from CFAF 4 to 12 billion.
In 1976, the first year of the third Five-Year Plan, the Government embarked
upon its expansionary program just when the phosphate market collapsed.
However, while phosphate prices fell, output rose and--supplemented by higher
import duty receipts--current revenue nevertheless continued to rise. Al-
though current expenditure also increased rapidly, mainly due to a rising wage
bill, a sizeable surplus was left to finance investment and debt service.
10.       Public investment (in current prices) of the Administration, state
enterprises and agencies increased from CFAF 30 billion in 1975 to CFAF 88
billion in 1978, and continued at the still high but reduced rate of CFAF 51
billion in 1980, as disbursements were made on projects being implemented.
In part because of the heavy reliance on foreign financing, which was often
project-tied, the investments undertaken differed greatly from those foreseen
in the 1976-80 Development Plan. Compared to its predecessors, the Plan had
placed more emphasis on rural development and, to a lesser extent, on social
services. However, during implementation major shortfalls were experienced
for these categories, while more than planned was spent on infrastructure,
tourism and industry.



11.       Much of the foreign borrowing was undertaken on commercial terms to
finance the investment programs of newly-created state enterprises, which upon
their completion were unable to service their foreign debt. This situation
led to the assumption by the Treasury of a rapidly rising debt service burden.
By 1977/78, debt service had risen to such an extent that the Treasury had
accumulated sizeable arrears, and in 1979 the Togolese authorities negotiated
a financial program with the IMF, and a rescheduling of debt obligations was
obtained through the Paris Club. Togo adhered scrupulously to the new terms,
but even with the debt relief, available resources were severely strained
during 1980, when CFAF 14 billion (25% of current revenue) had to be allocated
to debt service. Because of the short-term nature of the agreement, amorti-
zation and interest due by the Government would have amounted to CFAF 37
billion (over 50% of current revenue) in 1981. Togo therefore undertook a
second round of debt negotiations, and in February 1981 an agreement was
reached on the rescheduling of most of Togo's debt due in 1981/82. In
February 1981 the IMF approved a stand-by arrangement in the upper credit
tranches in support of the Government's financial and economic program for
1981/82. The prcoram aims at further reducing both the deficit in current
account balance of payments and the budget deficit, and at strengthening
management of existing state enterprises and implementing a selective invest-
ment policy.
Development Planning and Policy Issues
12.       The Fourth Development Plan, 1981-85, which was recently approved
by the National Assembly, sets forth the Government's goals in general terms:
promoting industrialization through the development of small-scale enterprises;
promoting rural development in order to reach self-sufficiency; developing
transport and improving the maintenance of the road network; developing
research and human resources and promoting regional development. The total
amount of the Plan's "priority program"--CFAF 250 billion--is, however, sub-
stantially in excess of the resources likely to be available, given the debt
service burden now facing the Government. In recognition of this fact the
Togolese authorities have undertaken to revise the Plan, excluding projects
whose implementation is doubtful and concentrating on those with adequate rates
of return. Further, the five-year period will be divided into two tranches,
the first corresponding to the time of greatest financial strain and providing
for much reduced capital spending plans, and the second allowing for some
expansion.
13.       With respect to public enterprises, the Government has established
a new Ministry of State Enterprises and Industry, which has undertaken a
preliminary review to identify their problems and prospects. At Government
request, a Bank mission visited Togo in March/April 1981 to advise on a course
of action, including the closing of certain enterprise activities in appro-
priate circumstances.
Economic Prospects
14.       In the 1981-85 period, the outlook is for average annual real
GDP growth of about 3.5%, i.e. an increase in GDP per capita of about 1% per
annum. Growth is expected to become more evenly spread among the sectors



- 4 -
but still highest in the secondary sector due to expanding mining operations
and higher industrial production from existing plants. The modest improvement
in projected growth will not relieve unemployment which will be aggravated by
the number of new entrants into the labor market. The pursuit of less expan-
sionary policies is expected to lead to a substantially smaller resource gap
and higher domestic savings.
15.       In agriculture there is scope to increase the output of both food
and export crops, and growth is projected to be about 3% annually between 1981
and 1985. More resources allocated to food crops to modernize production
techniques, and the beginning of returns on IDA-supported cocoa and coffee
replanting schemes will be the main reasons for the more rapid growth in
agriculture. Investment would be concentrated on relatively high yielding
schemes in food crops, cotton and other cash crops.
16.       The outlook for the secondary sector between 1981 and 1985 is mixed,
with growth on the order of 5%. Production and export of phosphate rock and
phosphate intermediates is expected to continue to increase in response to
world demand. Since in addition, the Bank-supported CIM.AO clinker project is
expected to approach full capacity utilization, overall output in mining is
likely to increase significantly. In manufacturing, the Government s inten-
tion to adopt remedial policies to redress state enterprises is expected to
overcome the stagnation of this sector. Growth in construction will be modest
or nil because of financial constraints, while the energy sector will be
boosted by projects and policies to replace electricity imports by domestic
production. In the tertiary sector, the severe financial constraints facing
the Government will limit growth in the output of public services. Growth in
transport and commerce is, on the contrary, likely to quicken on the assump-
tions that Togo will be better able to organize its transit trade to benefit
from existing infrastructure, and that--as in the past--the sector will
continue to be largely unaffected by Government intervention.
17.       Notwithstanding the debt rescheduling in 1981, the 1981-85 period
will demand judicious policies to balance the need to meet rising debt service
obligations with the need to maintain a minimum development effort, in parti-
cular in 1983 when debt servicing reaches a sharp peak. Except for enclave-
type operations, there is no scope for additional borrowing on financial
markets, and even with a lower level of investment, foreign financing, espe-
cially on concessionary terms, will be required. Government finances will be
extremely tight during the beginning of the period, requiring austerity in
current expenditure and highly selective investments. Toward the end of the
period, rising revenues from phosphates and a moderate acceleration in eco-
nomic growth will begin to ease the financial constraint, although low net
capital inflows will put pressure on the balance of payments, requiring
further recourse to balance of payments assistance. With the restoration of a
sounder financial situation, Togo's longer term development prospects remain
quite promising and there remains considerable scope to exploit the resource
base of the economy.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
18.       To date the Bank Group has extended ten credits to Togo, amounting
to US$84.9 million, and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo, and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO jointly and severally guaranteed by the Ivory Coast, Ghana
and Togo). Four of the credits were for highway construction and feeder road
maintenance. Another four were for agricultural projects. One was for techni-
cal assistance to strengthen the Government s planning capacity. One was for
education. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations in
Togo, as well as notes on the execution of projects.
19.       In the highway sector, the Association has assisted the Government
of Togo since 1969, in the building up of an efficient maintenance service,
the upgrading of its main and more trafficked roads, and the initiation of
a comprehensive transport planning and coordination system. A feeder roads
project (FY78) lays the basis of feeder roads improvement and maintenance
services, although project implementation has not been progressing as smoothly
as anticipated and parts of the project's work program are under review.
Overall, however, the projects have been satisfactorily implemented and are
commented on in para 39.
20.       The objectives of the Association in agriculture are to increase
food production and farm incomes through the development of cash crops such
as cocoa, coffee and cotton. The first agricultural project (FY75) was aimed
at developing Togo's cocoa and coffee potential. Satisfactorily completed in
1980, the project is being followed up by a second project (FY79), which has
recently started. The second agricultural project (FY76) provided financing
for a rural development project in the Maritime Region. The implementation of
the project has been complicated by adverse weather conditions and the diffi-
culties of developing a technology appropriate to the depleted coastal soils.
The third agricultural project (FY78) supports a five-year program to increase
cotton and foodcrops production. The project is being successfully completed,
ahead of schedule. A Bank mission visited Togo in March 1981, to examine the
scope for agricultural sector reform through a comprehensive cotton and food
crop project. This would incorporate a development strategy to overcome the
slow growth of output and incomes in the sector.
21.       The thrust of Bank Group lending in Togo is also to help develop
the large mining potential of the country and strengthen the institutions and
the training/education system. Togo is the host of the CIMAO project, the
largest regional industrial venture (including Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana)
undertaken so far in West Africa. Implementation of this US$284 million
clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other official aid agencies,
has proceeded satisfactorily, and production started in March 1980. The Bank
Group is presently preparing an engineering credit to develop a phosphoric
acid project aimed at exploiting the lower quality phosphate rocks; this
Credit is planned for presentation to the Executive Directors later this
fiscal year. Another regional venture, involving Togo and Benin, is the
Nangbeto power project intended to develop the hydroelectric potential of the
Mono river. IDA has recently appraised an engineering project which would
complete the preparatory work for this undertaking.



- 6 -
22.       A technical assistance project (FY79), providing for the streng-
thening of the Ministry of Plan's planning capacity, has started. At the
request of the Government, a Bank mission visited Togo in March-April 1981, to
study means to improve the performance of the state enterprises, including
their contribution to the budget. The Government has also indicated a strong
interest in obtaining external support for an action program leading to
structural reform, and has been advised that such a program would have to
tackle problems of financial management and investment.
23.       Present Bank Group disbursements account for about 8 percent of
Togo's disbursed and outstanding public debt (including CIMAO) as of late
1980. Service payments to the Bank Group are about 1 percent of total debt
service and will remain at about the same level over the medium term.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
24.       With a coastline of only 50 km on the Gulf of Benin, Togo forms a
narrow corridor, between Ghana to the west and Benin to the east, stretching
600 km from the coast to Upper Volta. Except for a mountain range extending
from the southwest to the northeast that culminates at less than 1,000 meters,
the terrain is rather flat and presents no major topographical obstacles to
transport.
Transport sector
25.       At independence, Togo inherited a poor quality and incomplete road
network and three old railway trunk lines. The Togolese immediately gave
priority to the development of their transport infrastructure to assure
efficient international access to the country and improve domestic communica-
tions within the various regions. A deepwater port was constructed in Lome in
the late sixties, consisting of a wharf for general cargo and one pier for
petroleum, tanker and mineral ships. Emphasis was placed on the construction
of the south-north axis and the strengthening of the most trafficked roads:
about US$27 million was spent between 1971-75 and US$107 million between
1975-80 on road construction. As a result, in 1979 there were about 1,500 km
of paved roads in Togo. The two most important roads run from Lome north to
the Upper-Volta border (680 km) and along the coast (48 km).  The primary and
secondary roads, branching east and west from the main south-north axis, are
generally adequate in extent and geographical coverage. About 800 km (60
percent) of the secondary road network are engineered. Most of the primary
and engineered secondary roads are in good to fair condition. Some sections
of Togo's primary road network totalling 400 km have, however, reached the end
of their economic life and need rehabilitation, principally on the most
trafficked south-north axis.
26.       Togo has invested substantially in the development of its road
network. In the draft Development Plan for 1981-85, the Government assigns
second priority to transport infrastructure after the productive sectors.



- 7 -
US$119 million is allocated to transport, mostly for the expansion of the
Port of Lome and highways strengthening and improvement on the south-north and
east-west axes. The proposed transport investments in the draft Plan appear
realistic.
27.        In July 1980, the price per liter of super gasoline was increased by
32 percent to CFAF 145 (tax CFAF 35), of regular to CFAF 142 (tax CFAF 34),
and diesel fuel to CFAF 117 (tax CFAF 20). The revenues from fuel taxes and
other road user charges have been increasing, and reached about CFAF 4 billion
(US$17 million) in 1978, or about 7 percent of the Government's total revenues.
Transport sector issues
(a) Transport planning
28.        Transport responsibilities are scattered among several ministries,
agencies and departments, with negative repercussions on sector management and
investments. To remedy the situation, the Government agreed, under the Third
Highway Project, to create no later than December 1978 a unit responsible for
transport planning and the formulation of development policies within the
Ministry of Commerce and Transport (MCT). This unit, called General Direc-
torate of Transport (GDT) was created in June 1980, a year and a half behind
schedule mainly because of the numerous changes at the head of the Ministry of
Commerce and Transport over the two preceding years. The unit is now being
staffed. The Government and the Association have recently agreed on a work
program for the GDT, which would mainly focus on the definition of a develop-
ment strategy, the preparation of projects, the collection of basic data, a
review of costs and the analysis of special issues in the sector such as
rail/road coordination.
(b) Railways
29.        In view of the short distances, road transport is the predominant
mode in Togo, except for bulk commodities such as phosphate, cement and fuel
which constitute 80 percent of the traffic carried by the railway, Chemins de
Fer du Togo (CFT). The role of CFT has therefore been declining since the
roads parallel to the railway lines were paved 10 years ago. Due to limited
activities and inefficient operations, the railway is estimated to be losing
an average of CFAF 380 million (US$1.6 million) per annum. A dialogue between
the Association and the Government on railway issues has been maintained since
1968 when the First Highway Project was being prepared. In that year, the
Government agreed to phase out the Lome-Kpalime and Lome-Aneho lines within
10 years after the paving of the parallel roads. The Government also agreed
not to extend the Lome-Blitta line unless it would be economically justified.
On the basis of a 1976 consultant's report, which.stated that the closing of
two branch lines would not substantially reduce the railways' deficit, the
Association agreed to modify its position on closing the branch lines, but
recommended that a study be conducted under the ongoing Third Highway Project
to improve CFT operations, and that recommendations resulting from the study
be implemented by December 31, 1979. Partly due to delays in establishing GDT
(para 28), the study itself was completed only at the end of 1979. The Asso-
ciation commented on it in the course of 1980, indicating to the Government



- 8 -
that the study did not provide an appropriate basis for an action program,
since it appeared to overestimate the needs for renewal equipment which did
not appear justified by projected demand. The Association and the Government
have agreed under the proposed Fourth Highway Project that an action program
to improve CFT operations and reduce its deficit would be submitted to the
Association for review and comments by December 31, 1981. The Credit Agree-
ment No. 693-TO will be amended accordingly, and Section 4.04 will be
modified, setting the same date as the new deadline for submission of CFT's
program to the Association for comments.
Road transport
30.       The entire vehicle fleet is estimated at 20,000 vehicles (1979),
or one vehicle per 125 inhabitants. Passenger cars account for about two
thirds of the fleet; pickups and trucks for about 30 percent. Between 1974
and 1979, the number of vehicles increased by about 9 percent annually. There
are six major freight transporters in Togo, mostly engaged in transit traffic
(about 100,000 tons per annum), and about 160 small transporters carrying
domestic traffic (36,000 tons per annum). Entry into the profession is free
and competition is stiff.
31.       Anxious to develop transit trade through the port of Lome, the
Government established Togoroute, the 60 percent state-owned trucking company,
in 1976, equipping it with 55 trucks and 70 trailers. Because of inadequate
equipment, lack of spare parts, insufficient activities (the Niger trans-
porters proved to be better organized and continued to get the lion's share
of the transit transport to Niger) lack of working capital and management
problems, Togoroute is experiencing serious difficulties, losing about
US$300,000 per annum. The difficulties of Togoroute will be examined, and
solutions suggested in the study of transport tariffs to be carried out by DGT
(para 28).
32.       Overloading is a widespread problem in Togo.  The Government is
planning to pass vehicle weight legislation and to enforce it by gradually
establishing weighing stations on the south-north axis. To this end, the
Government has agreed under the proposed project to carry out an action
program acceptable to the Association for the enforcement of the vehicle
weight legislation by December 31, 1981 (Section 4.02 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Road administration
33.       The Roads Division (RD) of the Public Works Department (PWD) within
the Ministry of Public Works, Mines, Power and Water Resources (MPWMP) is in
charge of planning, construction and maintenance of primary and secondary
roads. The maintenance of feeder roads is intended to be progressively taken
over by the Feeder Roads Unit established within the Ministry of Rural Develop-
ment under the Feeder Roads Project. PWD's organization is satisfactory to
enable it to execute its assigned responsibilities. Under the Third Highway
Project, two offices were created within the RD; one is in charge of planning,
design and construction of roads; the other is responsible for road maintenance



- 9 -
executed by field divisions, sectors and specialized brigades. RD has two
betterment and three regravelling brigades for periodic maintenance and, in
each of its five subdivisions, a routine road maintenance brigade. RD's
equipment for road maintenance and construction is maintained by the PWD's
Equipment Division (main workshop in Lome and annex in Sokode).
34.       PWD has a staff of about 1,100 (580 technicians, 20 engineers and
500 unskilled laborers). There is an acute shortage of trained personnel,
and a recent survey shows that, within the next five years, PWD should recruit
and train 185 technicians and retrain 140 employees. The Government has
agreed to restructure the Personnel Office of the Public Works Department into
a Personnel and Training Division (PTD) and to establish within it a training
program for road maintenance personnel. The Government has further agreed to
enact this change by January 1, 1982, and to ensure that PTD is adequately
equipped and staffed by that time (Section 3.06 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
35.       Until recently, roads design was carried out by consultants.  The
Planning and Design Office (PDO) created under the Third Highway Project
is progressively taking over that responsibility. The soils laboratory
established under the Second Highway Project within PWD has started working
efficiently.
Road construction industry
36.       Presently about three quarters of the civil works are carried out by
foreign contractors; the remainder is executed by domestic contractors and one
locally established French contractor. The domestic construction industry is
not well developed, and only supplies materials, and constructs drainage
structures and other minor civil works. Domestic contractors obtain contracts
for these works through joint ventures with or subcontracts from foreign
contractors. Development of the domestic construction industry is impeded by
the lack of adequate equipment and working capital, because the local small-
scale contractors have only limited access to financing. But in addition to
funds, they also need assistance to strengthen their technical and financial
management. A Bank mission has recently visited Togo to review the operations
of the two development banks and the prospects for improving their contribution
to the domestic construction sector.
Road maintenance
37.       Road maintenance began in earnest under the First Highway Project
(FY69), which provided for the purchase of equipment and technical assistance
to help carry out the maintenance program and train personnel. These efforts
have been sustained under the Second and Third Highway Projects. As a result,
the primary road network (all paved) and most secondary roads (laterite) are
in good to fair condition and provide year-round transport links. The condi-
tion of the remaining secondary roads varies, but has improved in recent
years.



- 10 -
38.       Although Togo is progressing in building up an efficient road
maintenance system, some problems impeding proper road maintenance remain.
There is the shortage of skilled manpower, partly due to the large turnover
of personnel in PWD, who often leave for the private sector where salaries
are higher; the aging of the equipment, which was procured under previous
projects; and recently, because of severe budgetary constraints mentioned
in para 11, the compression of maintenance expenditures. In 1979, only
CFAF 500 million was spent on road maintenance compared to CFAF 545 million
at current prices in 1976. Maintenance efforts, moreover, were spread thinly
over the entire network. However, the Government has agreed under the pro-
posed project to concentrate on maintaining 2,300 km of primary and secondary
roads (1,500 km of primary roads all paved and 800 km engineered earth roads)
to allocate a minimum of CFAF 750 million annually in 1980 prices for road
maintenance over the project period, and to exchange views on a regular basis
with the Association on the amount of such expenditures (section 4.03 of the
draft Credit Agreement). Also as stated in para. 41, the proposed project is
aimed at further strengthening PWD's maintenance system.
Bank Group Activity in the Highway Sector
39.       The First Highway Project (FY69) consisted of a four-year mainte-
nance program and pre-investment studies of about 450 km. The project was
successfully completed in November 1973, although the setting up of the
maintenance services was slower than expected, partly because of insufficient
attention to training local counterparts. The Project Performance Audit
Report (1977) concluded that project implementation was generally satisfactory
and that the pre-investment studies have enabled follow-on investments to be
made. The Second Highway Project (FY74), provided for the extension of the
maintenance program started under the First Project and the upgrading of
three highways:  Blitta-Sokode (78 km), Sokode-Tchamba-Kambole (75 km) and
Agou-Notse (51 km). The effects of inflation necessitated a reduction in
the scope of the road upgrading program and Agou-Notse was dropped from the
project. The late implementation of the technical assistance delayed comple-
tion of the project. The Project Completion Report concluded that the objec-
tives of the project were basically met. The Third Highway Project (FY78)
had as its main objectives the upgrading of two roads serving the agricultural
area Aneho-Tabligbo (45 km) and Agou-Notse, the continuation of the maintenance
program, and the initiation of an overall transport planning and coordination
system. The maintenance and upgrading components have been successfully
completed, but delays occured in the start-up of the transport planning
and coordination program (para. 28). Togo's road network is well-defined,
basically developed, and approaching a level which meets the country's
economic and social needs. The proposed project is aimed at sustaining and
pursuing the efforts begun under the previous projects to develop and maintain
the network.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
40.       A report entitled "Togo Fourth Highway Project" Staff Appraisal
Report (No. 3190-TO), is being circulated to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately. An appraisal mission took place in May 1980. Negotiations were



- 11 -
held in Washington March 9-11, 1981. The Togolese delegation was led by
Ambassador Y. Grunitzky and included representatives of the Ministries of
Finance and Economy, Commerce and Transport, and Public Works, Mines, Power
and Water Resources.
Project description
41.       The objectives of the proposed project are to:  (i) increase PWD's
capacity to maintain and improve the road network, particularly by reducing
the shortage of trained personnel; (ii) prevent the increase of road transport
costs and costly road reconstruction by timely strengthening of sections of
the paved roads; (iii) promote the improvement of selected East-West road
links to open new agricultural areas; and (iv) improve transport planning and
coordination.
42.       The proposed project would include:
(a) a three-year training program for road maintenance personnel
consisting of technical assistance (120 man-months) and fellowships;
(b) procurement of road maintenance equipment and spare parts;
(c)  pavement strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame (157 km) road;
(d)  pre-investment studies of the Notse-Tohoun road (57 km);
(e) technical assistance (60 man-months) to the General Directorate of
Transport to improve transport planning and coordination; and
(f) technical assistance (46 man-months) to CFT to improve railway
operations.
43.       The three-year training program would provide for the retraining of
85 staff of PWD already in place, and the recruiting and training of 100 new
staff (technicians, mechanic operators, drivers, and administrative personnel).
The program would be implemented by the Personnel and Training Division (PTD)
of PWD through appropriate Togolese and foreign institutions. PTD will be
assisted by a technical assistance team (120 man-months), which would be
located in key positions within PWD; one training expert in PTD itself, one
road engineer in the Road Maintenance Office, one mechanical engineer in the
Equipment Division in Lome and one soils engineer in the soils laboratory.
The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) has agreed to continue its
technical assistance to the Equipment Division's Annex in Sokode and to pro-
vide an additional mechanical engineer. In addition to their training assign-
ment, the highway and mechanical engineers would assist RD in the execution
of its maintenance programs. The Government has agreed to provide PTD with
sufficient qualified and experienced staff by January 1, 1982 (Section 3.06 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement).
44.       The project would provide training in Togolese institutions for
road technicians, mechanics, operators, drivers, and some administrative
personnel; and overseas scholarships for two soils engineers, two mechanical



- 12 -
engineers, one transport engineer, one transport economist, and four techni-
cians. The training program would be reviewed every year by the Government
and IDA to assess its efficiency and introduce appropriate adjustments.
45.       Most of PWD's existing equipment was procured under the First
Highway Project in 1971. The bulk of this equipment has aged, requires
frequent repair, and contributes to the decreasing productivity of the road
maintenance brigades. This equipment will be replaced through three separate
sources: (i) by EDF, which has agreed to replace the equipment for paved road
brigades (estimated cost about US$1.0 million); (ii) by funds accruing under
the Feeder Road Project, Credit 810-TO, for amortization of the equipment used
by PWD in the execution of 400 km of roads estimated at CFAF 180 million
(US$0.8 million); and (iii) by the proposed project.
46.       The paving of Togo-s primary road network started in the late 1960s.
Primary roads were designed for low volume and light traffic and some of them
are now reaching the end of their economic life. The proposed project would
initiate a program of pavement strengthening and rehabilitation by including
the rehabilitation of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame section (157 km) of the south-
north road axis. Necessary construction works would consist in the reconstruc-
tion of the pavement, the improvement of drainage structures and the regravel-
ing of the road shoulders.
47.       A pre-investment study would be undertaken of the Notse-Tohoun
road (57 km), which would complete the Agou-Notse-Tohoun road started under
the third highway project, linking Ghana to Benin. At present, the Notse-
Tohoun road is only passable during the dry season (9 months a year); it is
expected that it would be redesigned as a two-lane gravel road.
48.       The project would provide technical assistance to key MCT depart-
ments to improve transport planning, coordination and operations. Technical
assistance to the GDT (60 man-months) would consist of a transport economist
as team leader, a transport engineer and a road transport specialist with
experience in financial analysis. Technical assistance to the CFT (46 man-
months) would consist of one engineer attached to the office of the General
Manager, one engineer to supervise the lines and the workshop, a financial
analyst and an economist, who would define an action program to improve the
railways operation (management, maintenance and traffic organization) and help
in the implementation of such a program. The action program would be submitted
to the Association by December 31, 1981 for review and comments (Section 3.07
of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Project cost and financing
49.       Project costs (exclusive of taxes and duties) are estimated at
US$31.2 million with a foreign exchange cost of US$25.2 million (81 percent)
and US$6 million (19 percent) local cost. The project would be exempt from
all taxes and duties which are estimated at US$9.7 million equivalent.
50.       The cost of the pavement strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame
road averages US$115,000 per km (excluding contingencies). This cost is in
line with that of similar works recently carried out in Togo. The cost of



- 13 -
technical assistance averages US$7,000 per month for salary and benefits plus
US$3,400 for reimbursable expenses such as housing and transport. Overseas
fellowships are estimated at US$8,000 a year (including travel).
51.       The proposed IDA credit of US$20.0 million would finance about
64 percent of project costs. OPEC co-financing of US$7.4 million would cover
24 percent of project costs. The Government contribution to total project
cost would be US$3.8 million or 12 percent of total project costs (63 percent
of local costs). IDA and OPEC together would finance the foreign exchange
costs. The OPEC Fund would contribute 31 percent of the cost of the pavement
strengthening work or its total financing of US$7.4 million. IDA would
contribute 54 percent to this element and the Government 15 percent. IDA
would finance US$2.2 million (37 percent) of local costs. A condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit would be the satisfying of all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the OPEC loan (Section 6.01 of the draft
Credit Agreement).
Implementation
52.       The MPWMP would be responsible for project implementation through
its PWD, except for the technical assistance to transport planning and coordi-
nation and railway operations, which would be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Commerce and Transport. The project would take about four years
to complete. Technical assistance for the training of road maintenance
personnel would be provided for three years starting January 1982. Road
maintenance equipment would be delivered by September 1982.  The pavement
strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame road (157 km) would start in April
1982 and be completed within about 20 months. Pre-investment studies of the
Notse-Tohoun road (57 km) would begin in January 1982 and require about 18
months to complete. Technical assistance to improve transport planning and
coordination would continue to be financed under the Third Highway Project
until January 1982 when the funds allocated for this project element would be
exhausted. The present project would provide financing for extension of the
technical assistance for a further two-year period. Technical assistance to
the railway would start in January 1982, and take about a year and a half
to complete.
Procurement
53.       The strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame road, estimated at
US$23.8 million, would be carried out by contract awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Domestic contractors for civil works would be allowed a preferential margin of
7 1/2 percent over the bid prices of competing contractors. Road maintenance
equipment valued at US$2.23 million, would be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. In bid
evaluation, due consideration would be given to the need for standardization
of the equipment. Spare parts for equipment estimated to cost less than
US$20,000, but not exceeding an aggregate of US$0.3 million, would be procured
through negotiated purchase on the basis of quotations from at least three
reliable suppliers or manufacturers. Consultants BCEOM (France), who satis-
factorily carried out detailed engineering studies for the Lome-Notse-Atakpame
road, will assist the Government in supervising the improvement works.



- 14 -
Consultants CEBTP (France) and Louis Berger International, Inc. (USA), who
satisfactorily carried out assistance under the Third Highway Project to the
soils laboratory and GDT respectively, will be retained under the proposed
project. Other technical assistance and study items would be carried out by
qualified consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Associa-
tion (Schedule 3 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Disbursement
54.       Proceeds from the proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 54 percent of the cost of the pavement strengthening work
(SDR 9,840,000);
(b) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of equipment (or 90 per-
cent of local expenditures for equipment locally procured)
(SDR 1,480,000);
(c)  100 percent of expenditures for experts and consultants  services
(SDR 3,690,000);
(d) 100 percent of expenditures for scholarships and fellowships
(SDR 240,000); and
(e) SDR 1,150,000 would remain unallocated.
All disbursements from the IDA credit would be fully documented.
Benefits
55.       The proposed project is expected to yield a 56 percent rate of
return. The bulk of the benefits relate to savings in vehicle operating
costs. The direct beneficiaries of transport cost reductions would be the
transporters. However, some of the benefits would also be passed on to small
farmers in the form of higher farmgate prices, to consumers through slower
increases in transport costs, and to passengers because of competitive condi-
tions in inter-urban transport.
56.       Road maintenance component would cover 2,300 km, 84 percent of
the primary and secondary network, i.e. the most trafficked roads in Togo
(1,650 km of these roads have a traffic exceeding 100 vpd). The projected
growth rate of traffic on these roads is estimated at 8 percent. Project
investments covering equipment, spare parts, technical assistance as well as
incremental recurrent cost are expected to yield a 90 percent rate of return
(50 percent under unfavorable assumptions of increased cost and reduced
traffic). The strengthening of the Lome-Notse-Atakpame road, which serves
local and international traffic, is expected to yield a 30 percent rate of
return (declining to 17 percent under unfavorable cost-benefit assumptions).
Traffic on the Lome-Atakpame road ranges between 600 vpd around Notse-Atakpame
and 6,000 vpd around Lome, and is expected to increase by 8 percent. Benefits
of the assistance to GDT, although unquantifiable, are important since GDT is
expected to play a determinant role in rationalizing investments and policy
decisions in the transport sector, and in identifying and formulating measures
to remove constraints on its efficiency.



- 15 -
Risks
57.       The main risk of the project is the slow response of the Togolese
authorities under the previous projects to technical assistance, in particular
the technical assistance to planning. However the recent progress made in
establishing the DGT, staffing it and defining its work program is evidence of
the Government's desire to strengthen planning. Due to the presently severe
constraints of the budgetary and balance of payments situation, there is also
the risk that the Government would have difficulty in providing the counter-
part funds and sufficient maintenance expenditures, although this risk has
been alleviated by a high percentage of foreign financing of the project
costs. Also the Government has given assurances that it would increase its
maintenance expenditures to a minimum level required to assure adequate
maintenance (para. 38).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Togo and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
59.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially to
the pattern of recent agreements used for highway projects. Special
conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex IV. A special
condition of Credit effectiveness would be the satisfying of all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the proposed Loan from the OPEC Fund for
International Development (para. 51).
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

D. Projects in Execution *
Credit No. 638-TO Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9.5 million;
Credit of June 16, 1976; Effectiveness Date: October 26,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production of
upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop lowland
rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastruture for about 20,000 farm
families. Adverse weather conditions, difficulties in developing a technology
appropriate to the depleted coastal soils and insufficient supervision of
extension works have delayed implementation of the project. Infrastructure
development has been satisfactory. A project monitoring and evaluation unit
has been recently established.
Credit No. 693-TO Third Highway Project; US$10,0 million; Credit of
April 1, 1977; Effectiveness Date: September 13, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The project provides for the reconstruction of the Aneho-Tabligbo
road (45 km), the construction of the Agou-Notse road (51 km), the provision
of technical assistance for improving transport planning and road maintenance,
and preinvestment studies for a follow-up project. Implementation of the
project has been satisfactory and is by now practically complete. The
implementation of the technical assistance component has been slower than
expected.
Credit No. 741-TO Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$14.0 million;
Credit of October 5, 1977; Effectiveness Date: March 17,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The project aims at increasing cotton production from 7,000 tons to
34,000 tons and foodcrops grown in rotation with cotton from 40,000 tons to
57,000 tons (maize and sorghum); and strengthening of SOTOCO, the agency in
charge of the project. The project is progressing well. Over 45,000 farmers
are now involved in the project. 22,000 tons of seed cotton were produced in
1980. The area planted to improved foodcrops was 23,000 ha. Credit repayment
by farmers has been good. 215 km of feeder roads have been constructed and
120 wells have been drilled. Extension of the project, with greater emphasis
on foodcrops is under consideration. SOTOCO financial management has improved

considerably over 1980. However, its financial situation remains unsatisfac-
tory, because of delays in the payment of the Government's contributions. A
contract for the purchase of fertilizers and pesticides for the 1979 season
was awarded to other than the lowest bidder. The Government's choice was a
local supplier who did not require irrevocable documentary credits. The
amount earmarked under the credit to finance these inputs (US$792,000) was
cancelled as of March 5, 1980.
Credit No. 810-TO Feeder Roads Project; US$ 5,8 Million Credit of June 28,
1978; Effectiveness Date: March 2, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The project consists of a four year program for the improvement
and maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, technical assistance to
establish a Feeder Roads Unit in charge of the program, and consultant ser-
vices to study a follow-up feeder roads program. The equipment provided to
the Feeder Roads Unit is now fully operational, while efforts are being made
to ensure that future work programs adhere more closely to what has been
foreseen under the project. Implementation of the project has suffered from
serious institutional difficulties, but the Government has recently agreed to
undertake corrective measures.
Credit No. 930-TO Technical Assistance Project; US$2.2 million;
Credit of June 22, 1979; Effectiveness Date: October 23,
1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project provides for two advisers in the Ministry of Planning
for a three year period each and for short term consultants to carry out
specific project related and macroeconomic studies. The first adviser is
expected to counsel on general economic and public finance questions, while
the second adviser is expected to assist in selecting major new investments
and in finding ways of improving existing large projects. The first adviser
has served for over a year. The search for the second adviser is drawing to a
close with a suitable candidate expected to be appointed shortly.
Credit No. 945-TO Second Cocoa and Coffee Development Project; US$14.0 million
Credit of July 23, 1979; Effectivenes Date: July 11, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985.
The project is a continuation of the first Coffee-Cocoa project. It
provides for the planting and maintenance of a further 7,500 ha of coffee and
4,000 ha of cocoa by 17,000 smallholder farmers, marketing, storage and extension
services, applied research, associated foodcrop development, and construction of
300 km of feeder roads. Coffee planting for 1981 is expected to be ahead of
target. The cocoa program has been delayed by an outbreak of capsid disease,
and by land tenure problems.

Credit No. 969-WAF Project Preparation Credit to Banque Ouest Africaine de
Developpement; US$3.0 million of January 25, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: April 29, 1980; Closing Date: June 30,
1983.
The objective of the project is to finance feasibility and detailed
engineering studies by external consultants of regional development projects,
which a priori have a high probability of success. The project is proceeding
satisfactorily. BOAD is a well managed institution, but its financial situa-
tion will have to be carefully monitored.
Credit No. 1018-TO First Education Project; US$ 11.0 million; Credit of
September 15, 1980; Effectiveness Date: January 27, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Construction of training institutions is progressing on schedule.
