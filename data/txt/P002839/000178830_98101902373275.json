Project benefits will\n            essentially be in savings in vehicle operating costs, which\n            will directly benefit the transporters but could eventually\n            be passed on to small farmers and consumers in the form of\n            higher farmgate prices and slower increases in transport\n            costs. The main risk of the project is linked to the\n            generally slow response of the Togolese authorities to\n            technical assistance, in particular as it relates to\n            planning. The recent progress made, however, in the\n            establishment of the General Directorate of Transport (GDT),\n            staffing and the definition of its work program is an\n            indication of the Government's commitment to strengthen planning."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
