                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Environmental Management Project (EMP) should provide critical support to the Environmental Framework Program (EFP) whose major objectives are to
                         incorporate environmental and natural resources management concerns directly into the economic, social and political adjustment process, and strengthen
                         financial delivery mechanism. The main objectives of the EMP were to assist the Russian authorities to: (i) strengthen and streamline federal and regional
                         institutional structures for environmental and natural resource management; (ii) improve federal and regional environment policy and strategy formulation and
                         implementation; (iii) upgrade environmental and natural resource management systems; (iv) address priority environmental management investment needs
                         through the setting up of initial capitalization of the National Pollution Abatement Facility; (v) assist in the financing of economically viable, high priority
                         resource recovery/pollution abatement projects in the country; and (vi) facilitate the flow of donor funds and resources to the environmental protection sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Russian Federation inherited economic structures and obsolete technologies encouraging pollution and wasteful use of natural resources. The inefficient environmental quality
                         management systems severely restricted the ability of the Government to address the issue of deteriorating environment. The Environmental Management Project provides short and
                         medium term support to address these issues. The original project, which was redesigned between 2000 and 2002, included technical assistance for (i) policy and regulatory
                         development; (ii) environmental epidemiology; (iii) water quality and water resource management; and (iv) Hazardous Waste Management. These activities were completed in 2002.
                         Implementation of the National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF) ­ a credit line for pollution abatement projects - was completed at the end of 2009. The Project also supports the
                         preparation of a project to address past environmental liabilities in the Russian Federation, with preparation activities to be completed by June 30, 2011. The project development
                         objectives were marginally achieved. This is partly due to the lengthy project implementation and also due to the absence of receiving technical assistance at the national and
                         regional level. The original project design concept was revised and the previous project pipeline was abandoned resulting in the cancellation of more than USD 20.4 million. Half of
                         NPAF funds were invested in seven pollution abatement projects.
