MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF T  IBMD TO0T  EXECU  DIRCORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and r  mtion On a
proposed loaa to the Russian Federation for $110 million equivalent to help finace dte Environment
Management Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable intest rate, with a maurity
of 17 yeas, Including S years of grace. The proc-wis of the loan ($57.7 million) would be onlen to the
sub-borrowers under the National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF) and nvestm   Project
Preparon Advamce (IPPA) Facdiity in US dollars, with an intr  rate spread satisoy  to the Bank
(nitially 400 basis points) and with matuities gmerally up to eight years, includmg up to three years of
grace. lhe sub-borrowers will bear the US doLar exchange risk.
A.    SECIrOR BACKGROUND
2.           The system of  vironmental mnagement in the Fonner Soviet Union (FSU) has been
chara ized as fragmented and uncoordinated with more than ten government agencies havig some
ponibilit for envirmental concerns. The longstanding problem has been that the implementg
minstries and overseeing goverment bodies had a built-in conflict of interest in being responsible for
both economic targets and envion      protection. Several reorganization attempts to better integrate
enviromena management under thepresent Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
(MEPNR) have had limited success in providig better coordination and regulatory capaciq. This is
mainly explained by the legacy of centraized management of the economy that emphasized productio
over efficiency, concentrated pollution-intensive industries in enormous complexes, comzed
decision-making, and treated natural resources as free goods.
3.           The failure of the previous, centrally planned Soviet system to efficiendy and effectively
mae  region economic development and environmental issues was implicitly recognized inthe Russian
Federa Treaty of March 14, 1992,1 that formally devolves much of the former powers and resources of
the central miies and commite  to regional and local level agencies. The trend toward
decentaliztion has major implications for solving environmental and natural resource management
probems. Th*e changes, while creaig much uncerty and confusion, also present unprecedented
opporuntes for providing strategically targeted support and assistance, based on sound ecowomic, social,
environmenta, and nawral resource management principles. Ihe Environmenta  Management Project
has been designed to support these changes.
4.           While environmental p con legislation and insitltions were being developed during
the Soviet era, both at the cental level and in the republics, environmental objectives in general remained
seconay to neartm industri production objectives, as noted above, and a formal envimt
policy did not emerge untl aer 1985. The limited financial and other resources earmarked for
envionmental protection, te lack of enforcement of environmental norms and reguhtions, and the use
of censrship and other means to control public information on the environment contributed to weak
ImpmI on of these policies. Generally, the govemment largely ignored the growing environmental
problems and public e m      l concerns. However, there were some notable exceptions to tl,
practice during the Soviet era, particularly with protction of wildlife and forests, and efforts to ensure
safe drinig water. A shift in Soviet policy ot-rred in 1986 and 1988, when efforts were increased
to rationai the use of natal resources and protect the enmironment Icentives for decreasing material

and energy inputs per umit of output were intoduced. While economic imperatives were the primary
drviWg force behind the new policy, the growing costs to the environment were also increasingly being
appreited.
S.           In 1988 the Union-Republic State Committee of the USSR for the Environmentl
Protection (USSR 'Goskompriroda") was established in order to modernize the conservation and
regulaion of natural resourme use. In 1990, this State Committee was refbshloned into the Minisbtry for
Nature Use and Envental Proction of the USSR (USSR "Nnpdroda'). The MEPNR was inaly
subordinatto the Union Ministry but emerged in its presentform aker the dissolutdo ofthe USSR in
1991. Under MEPNR there is a system of environmental or ecological committs at regional lev -
i.e., for republics, oblasts, krals and okrugs - and at local or municipal level which are responsible for
the detailed implemenaon of policies and regulations in the sphere of eronm     protectio. In
practice, progessin implemtng policies has been slow and inconsistent. The MEPNR and ils reional
bodies have met strong resistamce from other Ministries, State Committees and agencies which were
previously responsible for environmentl issues within their respective sectors.
B.    PIROJECr OBJECTIVES
6.           The Russian Federation has requested the World Bank to assist in estabihg  an
Environmena  Framework Program (EPP) whose objectives are to (a) incorporate enment and
natura resource management concems direcdy into the economic, social and politcal adjusutm  process
at the federal and regional levels of government, including the executive and legislaive branches; (b)
strenthlen and streamline institutonal and orgaizational strucures for environmental and natural resource
management; (c) improve environmental and natural resource policy and strategy formulation and
imple enti  (d) upgorde environm   and natural resource management systems; (e) stegthen
finncial delivery mnisms to address priority environmental management investment needs thugh
the setting up and initi capitalization of a National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF); and (f)
facilitate the flow of donor and multilateral funds and resources to the environmental ption sector.
The En    m nl M ement Project (EMP) would provide critical support to the EFP.
C.    PROJECr DESCRIPTON
7.           The project consists of the following five principal components: (1) Instiuona and
Policy Stengthening, including the following two subcomponents: (a) Policy and Regulatory Support;
and (b) En ioe  pidemiology;, (2) Water Quality and Water Resource Management; (3) Hazadous
Waste Management; (4) the NPAF for fumdiDg economically and financially viable pollution abatement
projects; and (5) the Center for Project Preparation and Implementation (CPPI) under MEPNR. Ihe
three techical assitance components of the project will  s  on environmenta management and
instal strengthening at the federal and regional levels in three regions of European Russia: the
Upper Volga, the Urals and North Caucasus. An Integrated approach to regional en nenta
management will be achieved through the Policy and Regulatory Support Component, which will closely
link with the oher two technical assistance componens in identifying, developing and setting policies and
reguations for implementation by regional environmental reguatory agencies, and at federal level.
8.           The NPAF would help to finance a porton of the investment costs of commercialy viable
resource recoverylpollution abatement projects with an Idendfiale and secure stream of either foreig
exchange or ruble denomined earnings that could be used to repay NPAP sub-loans as well as loans
from other lenders. The NPAF will not finance the instllation of additional production equipmet, or
the eansion of existng production fcilities, but will focus Instead on the dean-up projects designed
w capture commercially valuable emissions from existing prodixtion failities. It would be authorized



- 3 -
to lend to state owned enterprises, local or foreign private entities, and joint ventures. The NPAF would
only support projects that were prepared on the basis of comprehensive technical and financial feasibility
studies, including an environmental assessment. The NPAF would be established on a revolving basis
so that amortization payments from the first round of short to medium term loans would be redeposited
in the NPAF and used to finance additional loans for subsequent high priority investments; this would
help ensure the sustainability of the NPAF to finance pollution abatement projects. Proceeds from the
NPAF Account will be used as follows: (i) to pay the interest on the portion of the Bank loan used to
fund the NPAF; (ii) to pay the operating expenses of the NPAF; and (iii) of the remaining balance after
deducting these charges, 30 percent will be transferred to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and 70 percent
will be used to fund additional NPAF sub-loans.
9.           An Investment Project Preparation Advance (IPPA) Facility will be established to help
potential sub-borrowers prepare the necessary feasibility studies and business plans for prospective NPAF
sub-projects. These advances would be normally refinanced by the NPAF sub-loan, but would be repaid
by the sub-borrower if the proposed sub-loan was not approved by the NPAF. IPPA would be set up
with an initial funding of $5 million under the Bank loan. Donors have also expressed interest in
providing grant fimds for investment project preparation and identification Such funds, if available, will
be used prior to the drawdown of the Bank loan for this purpose.
10.         The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $194.8 million equivalent (including
taxes and duties totalling about $3 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of $91.9
million, or 47 percent of the total project cost. A detailed breakdown of the project cost estimates and
the financing plan is given in Schedule A. The Bank loan will finance $110 million, or 56 percent of the
total project cost, including 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 17 percent of the estimated
local costs ($18.1 million equivalent). In addition, funding from the Government of Russia (GOR) and
Russian enterprises would total $84.8 million equivalent. These estimates are based on a GOR
contribution of $9.8 million and total local financing for the pollution abatement projects supported by
the NPAF of $75 million. It is expected that $25 million of this local financing will take the form of
equity put up by enterprises and the reamining $50 million will be funded ty various types of loans. In
some cases, enterprises may finance their equity contributions through joint venture arrangements.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the steus of Bank Group operations in
the Russian Federation are given in Schedules C & D, respectively. Maps of the project areas and
naturl zones are attached (IBRD Nos. 25118 and 25119). The Staff Appraisal Report, Report No. 12838
RU, dated October 19, 1994 is being distributed separately.
D.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION
11.         The Govermnent of Russia (GOR) has designated the MEPNR as the lead agency for the
management of the loan and the coordination of its implementation. Because of the need to strengthen
the project preparation and implementation capacity of MEPNR, work began al an early stage of
preparation of the project with the setting up of the CPPI as a separate non-commercial legal entity under
MEPNR. An advance from the Bank's Project Preparation Facility (PPF) totalling $460,000 would
enable the early recruitment and training of staff for this unit. Both the Director and Deputy Director
have been appointed. The principal role Af the CPPI will be to facilitate the implementation of the Bank
financed components of the EFP, as well as Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded Project
Preparation Advances and other projects following World Bank procurement, disbursement, accounting,
auditing and reporting procedures and requirements. Other important roles of the CPPI will be to: (i)
provide overall project management and coordination; (ii) provide procement and financial management
services for the project; (iii) disseminate information regarding Bank and donor financed EFP



-4-
componen; (iv) facitate and liaise wth other fuding agencies supporting EFP; and (v) facilt
taining actvites under the project. Project subcomponents will be managed by s
Implementaion teams under the directon of a subcomponent project manager. lhese team  will report
to subcomponent management committe consist  of representatives of the major stakeholders in the
subcomponet project. These may be either federal or regional bodies, including local NGOs.
12.          Duing the start-up phase of the project, the CPPI will be assisted by a project
management advisory firm fmiliar with World Bank procurement and disbursement procedures. The
services of this firm will be reained as long as it is needed for th9 efficient management and operation
of the CPPI. The procurement and disbursement functions fall under the responsibility of the Depuy
Director, who has already received Bank taining in these procedures. During the start-Wup phase, the
CPPI will consist of six full time staff, increasing to eleven during implementation. The CPPI wfll be
responsible for contractig all foreign advisers and local experts at national and regional levels - both
individuals and firms. The subcomponent implementing team to which the firm or expert is atthed wil
be responsible for their selection and technical management, but contract administrton will be by the
CPPI. It will also be responsible for equipment procurement in accordance with World Bank guidelines.
13.          Ihe CPPI also will be assisted by a general consultant firm, which will provide exrise
in project start-p and management, and in the training of suboomponent project managers during the
sa-p phase of the project, and will assist the CPPI with project supervision and project pormance
and progress evaluation during implemention.
14.          A core NPAF consultant team wil be established under the CPPI to manage the appraisa
and supervision of investent projects. This team wiUl include technical and legal consultant as required.
An NPAF Supevisory Board will also be established, consisting of high level govenument officials, to
review and approve sub-project investmet proposals and to decide policy matters relating to the operation
of the NPAF. An NPAP account wiUl be set up by the MOP, which will contract with a commercd   bank
to manage the account. Ihe MOF, as the sub-loan lender of record, wil make decisions related to
invesment projects considered and approved by the NPAF Supervisory Board and wil enter into
appropriate sub-loan agreements.
15.          A comprehensive supervision plan has been drawn up for the project which includes
World Bank staff from Headquarters and from the Moscow Resident Mission, as well as the gea
consultant fim. The plan not only includes regular tn-yearly supervision activities, but also incorporates
assistance for the project start-up phase, a project launch workshop and at least yearly project reew
workshops to bring together subcomponent project managers and management committees chairpersons,
the CPPI, MEPNR and World Bank staff to learn from the experiences and to make adjustment to the
program as required. Donors responsible for financing components of EFP will also be invited to attend.
E.  PROJECr SUSTAINABIJLY
16.          Ite project is primarily concerned with the mainenance and strengthening of viable and
sustainable environmental management institons at the federal level and in three demonstion regions
in the country, as well as supporting the development and demonstration of sustainble 3 t sment
financing mechanisms for pollution abatement projects. Demonstration regions have been selected on the
basis of their ommitment to adopt policies and reguations developed during project implementation and
to continue supporting project implementation teams that will become part of the new govanment
structure at federal and regional levels. Ihese commitments are contained in framework agreements
between the MEPNR and Regional administration/legislaues.

F.    LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK OPERATIONS
17.          The Banks experiences in otfier countries with both onviroment management loan and
financial iemediary loans for pollution abatement are relevant to the design and implementation of the
proposed project. With respect to enuimuental nagement projecds, the Bank has found that (i)
limited absorptive capacity and enforcemeat powers often exist at the federal level requirig a
concentation  of activities at regional lvels; (ii) confiusion and ftustration resuting from uncoordinated
donor agency support programs leads to Inefficient utlization of scarce resources; (iii) fill commitment
by the beficiaries is needed for effective implementaton; iv) strengthening implemenaion capacity
prior to loan effectiveness reduces delays in project start-up; (v) greatr emphasis must be placed on
supervision and the monitoring of project performance and progress. Forpolluon abaton    din
acivies, the main lessons have been to: (i) simplify sub-loan pproval procedutes consitent with
prudent commercial practices; (i) allow sufficiendy broad geogaphical coverage; (iii) apply a balanced
use of economic and regulatory incentives; (iv) provide technical assistance for sub-project preparation
and appraisal; and (v) link with environmental sector work to identify priorities for pollution abatement
Lessons leamed from the First Oil Rehabilitation Loan and from other completed or pending loans to
Russia highlight the importance of: Oi identifying a consistent counterpart team with sufficient authodrty
to move a project forward; (ii) coordinaing among key interested parties (Ministries, agencies, levels of
government) on critical or controversial project issues; (iii) early detailed atention to procurement and
other implementation issues and the potential benefits of a PPF advance in this regard; (iv) involving local
consulan  and ins_ttu  in the process; and (v) an early start in cooperation with the relevant Misti
on an Environmental Assessment (EA). The proposed project has built these lessons into the proposed
project design and implementation arrangements.
G.  RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
18.          The most recent dcsion of the Country Asistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia was held
on April 28, 1994 in the context of the Financial Insttions Develoment Project. At that time, the
Bank proposed to operate under an ltmediate Case scenario that would include a core investment
program of projects that would be relatively unaffected by changes in the macroeconomic environment
T-he proposed project foms part of the core program. It meets all three priority objectives for the Bank's
assistce program contained in the CAS by: (i) suprtng the development of a mw*et-.dented
econom  by demonsaing tbrough te NPAF how to involve the prvate sector in projects with tangible
environme ntl benefits; (ii) redvting pulc sector invovement In the economy by strengthening the
policy-making and regulat  acdvities of key institutions involved in environmenal magement and
estahlishing a sound techical and policy framework for future environmental aciities; and (hi)
establlsig a key rolefor the BA in project design and helping to mobilize donor funds that might not
otherw  be available to support priority activities in environmenl magment. A donors meetidng
hostedbythe World BankonApril 13, 1994 resulted inpledges in supportof the EFP amntng to $90
milion from Canada, the European Union, Finland, Norway, Switzeland, the United States and the
GEF. In addition, a grant from the UK Know How Fund helped finance the preaaion of the NPAF
component. The proposed project is fully consistent with the recent CAS and represents a priority use
of Bank resources in assisting the transformation of the Russian economy.
H   AGREED ACTIONS
19.          During negoiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it would carry out,
or cause to cury out, the following acdons: (a) adopt legal and regulatory decisions to enable NPAF sub-
loaX and IPPA to be onleot to the sb-borrowers; (b) ensure that NPAF would operate pursuant to the
Orting Insructions satisfactory to the Bank; (c) utilize the proceeds from the NPAF Account in



-6 -
accordance with the agreement with the Bank; and (d) ensure that the CPPI would maintain functions,
staffing, Including consultants, and other resources satisfactory to the Bank.
20.          In addition, it was agreed that the following actions would be conditions of loan
effectiveness: (i) adoption by the Borrower of a resolution and other actions acceptable to the Bank
necessary to implement the NPAF component; and (Hi) the hiring of a core team of consultants for the
NIAF.
21.          It was also agreed that the following actions would be conditions of disbursement for the
NPAF component: (i) adoption by the Borrower of the Operating Instructions for the NPAP satisfactory
to the Bank; (i) an arangement by the Borrower with a bank for the administration of sub-loans and
management of the NPAF account satisfactory to the Bank; and (iii) each NPAF sub-loan or IPPA has
been approved in accordance with the requirements agreed with the Bank, including procedures,
eligibility criteria, and terms and conditions of sub-loans or advances.
L   ENIONMENTAL ASPECTS
22.          The project is consistent with Bank policy and follows accepted Bank Evironmment
Assessment (BA) procedures; it has been assigned a "B" rating for EA purposes. In conformity with
Bank practice, detailed environmental guidelines and procedures have been drawn up for sub-project
envionmtal appraisal including: (i) environmeneal selection criteria evaluation; (C) envromental
assessment; and (iii) environmental liability auditing, as required. In addition, sub-borrowers from the
NPAF will be responsible for ensuring that the proposed investment complies with all applicable
environmental assessment rules, regulations, and procedures of the Russian Federation. Efforts are
currently underway to harmonize the Russian Federation and World Bank Environmental Assessmaet
guidelines. This should help to minimze compliance difficulties and speed the approval process.
J.    PROJECT BENEFlTS
23.          Ihe specific benefits that are expected to accrue as a result of this project are as follows:
(1)   the a ih ent ofnatnal databases and standardized methodologies and systems for
the collection and verification of environmental health and hazardous waste generation
data for policymakers at the national and regional levels;
(2)    he upgrading and adoption of overaU envionmenta  acion plas based on

(6)   the estalivhmentand management of a natonalfaclity to fund investment in pollution
abatement and improved resource utilization and recovery. The effectiveness of this
Facility will be judged on the basis of the amount of private loan aD. equity fimds it is
able to leverage for pollution abatement, the extent of pollution reduction achieved
through its investments and its ability to address pollution priorities identified under items
(2) and (3) above;
(7)   the improved orgwaizoln, management and taiAng of staff of envimrmenta

Caucasus regions; and
(8)    .faI itAng doner panipaton in the environmental sector in Russia through the
establishment of a Center for Project Preparation and mplementation and donor
involvement in project workshops.
K.  PROJECT RIS
24.          The main risks that the project may face include: (1) the fragmented decision making
process for enviromental management at the federal and regional levels; (2) the shortage of experienced
and qualified Russian speciaists in environmental economics and law; (3) the poor environmental
regulation enforcement capability of the legal system in Russia; (4) conflicting mandates and lack of
cooperation between government agencies and even between departments within the same agency; (5)
possible delays in project implementation due to a l1ck of familiarity with Bank procedures and the
requirements of project management in general; (6) difficulties in arranging local cost financing for
Pollution abatement; and (7) potental adverse impacts of high inflaton on projects financed by the
NPAF. The project will build on initiatves already being introduced by the Government in order to
address these issues. Firsdy, at the federd level, the prr >ct will be under the direction of the recendy
formed Federal Commission on the Environment (witu MEPNR acting as the Secretariat of this
Commission), which has been set up to improve inter-agency cooperation and decision making for
environmental management. The regional project areas were selected on the basis of already existing
arrangements for promoting inter-agency cooperation for environmenta! management and their
governnts strong commitments to environmental quality improvement (usually becaus of srong local
community pressures). The project proposes an early start to a comprehensive tining program to
improve skills in environmental policy and regulation, as well as in the technical areas of enmironmenal
epidemiology, hazardous waste, water quality management and project management. Ihe ,=s of twinning
arrangements with foreign institutes will ensure practical application in the development of these skills.
Trained personnel will also be delegated to work at regional, as well federal level to transfer their skills.
In the participating regions, cooperative arrangements for pollution abatement at major polluting
enterprises will be negotiated with appropriate incentive arrangements for compLiance with agred permi
schedues.
25.          To minimize risks of project implementation delays, framework agreemensl have been
reached with federal and regional agencies that will be responsible for project implementation laying out
in detail the responsibilities and arrangements for component implementation. The early sefting up and



- 8-
staffing of the CPPI and recruitment of a project management advisory firm to assist the CPPI with the
se. ig up of procurement, finmcial and information management systems has been desigrated to reduce
iw.- tementation delays. The NPAF will be especially equipped to assist sub-borrowers to put together
packages for project fmancing including a full array of financing arrangements from local and foreign
sources. One of the criteria on which the NPAF operations will be judged will be its ability to leverage
other sources of financing. A TA unit is also being established with access to a TA fund in order to
develop high quality projects to attract project finance. The pollution abatement projects that will be
targeted by the NPAP have a number of inherent characteristics that will protect them from the inpacts
of high inflation, namely: (i) recovery of valuable resources from waste streams with zero or negative
costs; and (ii) end products that have a high economic value in world markets and are exportable.
L.  RECOMMENDATION
26.          I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreem_en of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approves it.
