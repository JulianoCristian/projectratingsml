Some\n            lessons learned included: taking into account a multitude of\n            development issues which Russia was facing in early 1990s\n            the team was tempted to address as many development issues\n            in the sector as possible. Reality proved that even abridged\n            EMP Project which included four Technical Assistance (TA)\n            components and National Pollution Abatement Facility (NPAF)\n            credit line to be implemented in a dozen of regions was far\n            too challenging for implementation both for the client and\n            the Bank. Arguably, better results could have been reached\n            if project activities will have been centered on fewer\n            regions and components, and even on more focused\n            interventions within those components. Future TA in this\n            sector in Russia may benefit from a 'bottom up'\n            regional approach rather than a 'top down'\n            approach until there is sustained interest and political\n            commitment to utilize technical assistance by the national\n            government for environmental management. EMP illustrated\n            that where the objectives and scope were best defined,\n            undertaken on a reasonable scale, and were linked to\n            specific tasks (i.e. waste management, water and\n            epidemiological sub-components) better outputs were\n            obtained. Conversely, in the policy sub-component where\n            broad policy and environmental improvement objectives were\n            set, it was more difficult to correlate outcomes and outputs\n            with objectives. The assumption that the experience in\n            Poland of measurable environmental performance improvement\n            being correlated with reform of the environmental management\n            system was not realistic for Russia, given the different\n            history of market reforms and the substantial TA from\n            bilateral sources that preceded Bank intervention in the\n            case of Poland. Notwithstanding other factors that created a\n            relatively inefficient and overly bureaucratic\n            implementation arrangement, a basic lesson from EMP is that\n            complex implementation arrangements involving a matrix of\n            interagency supervisory structures may not be workable when\n            overlain on a direct relationship with TA clients. In\n            combination with pre-established stable counterpart\n            arrangements for receiving and applying TA products, future\n            TA projects should maintain a clear separation between the\n            counterpart agency's functional technical management\n            and the provision of administrative Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU) services. NPAF's design will have benefitted\n            from a more streamlined on-lending approach, a well\n            functioning M&E system and targeting a more narrow set\n            of priority areas."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
