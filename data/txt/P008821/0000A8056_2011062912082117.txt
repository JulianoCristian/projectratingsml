                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Environmental Management Project (EMP) should provide critical support to the Environmental Framework Program (EFP) whose major objectives are to
                         incorporate environmental and natural resources management concerns directly into the economic, social and political adjustment process, and strengthen
                         financial delivery mechanism. The main objectives of the EMP were to assist the Russian authorities to: (i) strengthen and streamline federal and regional
                         institutional structures for environmental and natural resource management; (ii) improve federal and regional environment policy and strategy formulation and
                         implementation; (iii) upgrade environmental and natural resource management systems; (iv) address priority environmental management investment needs
                         through the setting up of initial capitalization of the National Pollution Abatement Facility; (v) assist in the financing of economically viable, high priority
                         resource recovery/pollution abatement projects in the country; and (vi) facilitate the flow of donor funds and resources to the environmental protection sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project was designed to provide support to the Russian Federation to address inefficiencies of the environmental management system resulting from economic structures and
                         obsolete technologies encouraging pollution and wasteful use of natural resources and deterioration of environment. The Project was redesigned between 2000 and 2002, and
                         included technical assistance for (i) policy and regulatory development; (ii) environmental epidemiology; (iii) water quality and water resource management; and (iv) hazardous waste
                         management. These activities were completed in 2002 and were considered to marginally achieve their development objectives. Implementation of the National Pollution Abatement
                         Facility (NPAF) was closed at the end of 2009 and despite completion of seven industrial pollution abatement investment projects and notable environmental benefits achieved the
                         NPAF implementation remains moderately satisfactory. This is partly due to the lengthy project preparation and implementation and abandonment of previous pipeline resulting in the
                         cancellation of more than USD 20.4 million of the Loan. The Project was restructured in December 2009 to support the preparation of an investment project to address past
                         environmental liabilities (APEL) in the Russian Federation (Part E of EMP). The plans to complete project preparation by June 30, 2011 did not materialize. Although no visible
                         progress was reported on APEL project preparation before the project closing date, the GORF remains committed to address environmental liability issues in the Russian Federation.
                         To this date the implementation of Part F remains unsatisfactory. The total loan disbursements by June 2011 equal to USD 86,483, 720 or 96.5% of the loan amount. This is the last
                         ISR prior to project closure.
