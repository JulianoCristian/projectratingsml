NEMoa^NDul AND IECDOUNDATIOV OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
IINTRNA!IONAL ShNK POR  AlON$?RUC?ION 4ND DEZVLORPENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO JANAIC&
FOR A SOCIAL SECTORS DEVMLO UEIT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Jamaica for US$30.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repayable over a period of 17 years, including five
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would
help finance a social sectors development project, covering selected
investmenta in health and education, within the framework of the Govern-
ment' s five-year Human Resources Development Program (HRDP).
2.       Background.  Social development in Jamaica has benefited from a
long tradition of public and private support. Among countries of com-
parable income per head, Jamaica has, over the decades, consistently ranked
close to the top on conventional indicators of social development.
However, unavoidable economic adjustment during the mid-1980s, compounded
with the cumulative effects of several years of economic decline, resulted
in significant economic hardship to important segments of the population.
Real public expenditures for education, health, and other social services
fell sharply during 1982 to 1986 and still remain depressed. Despite
government efforts to mitigate the effect of these cuts, the deterioration
in basic public services has been severe; human capital formation and
social well-being have been adversely affected. In September 1988,
Hurricane Gilbert caused extensive losses throughout the island, including
additional damages to the school and health service network, which were
already in need of repair.
3.       The HRDP was designed to address rehabilitation and development
needs of the social sectors. It encompasses projects in public health
(29Z), education (192) and poverty alleviation (nutrition and employment
aid) (522). The total estimated cost of new initiatives, approximately
US$390 million until 1993/94, includes both recurrent and capital
expenditures. A special Secretariat has been created in the Planning
Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) for the duration of the HRDP, to support and
coordinate HRDP implementation by various ministries and government
agencies. The latter will strengthen their organizations to be able to
implement the HRDP. The Bank has assisted the Government in formulating
the HRDP, in ensuring its consistency with Government's Medium Term
Economic Framework Program (MTFP) and Public Sector Investment Program
(PSIP), and in canvassing potential lenders and donors for its financing.
At a Consultative Group for Caribbean Economic Development (CGCED) meeting
in June 1988, several agencies and governments indicated willingness to
support projects under the HRDP. The Government has secured commitments
from these donors for FY89-90, and is in the process of arranging financing
with them, and of identifying HRDP components that may be implemented by
non-governmental organizations, for subsequent years.



2-
4.       Rationale for Bak Involvement.  Bank comtry assistance strategy
in Jamaica has focused ons (a) continued support for the ongoing program
of economic adjustment; (b) selected investments in key economic and social
sectors, combined with policies to improve the efficiency of resource use
and combat the worst effects of povertys and (c) assistance to the Govern-
ment in securing the external financing needed for its development program.
The proposed project fits within this strategy. The Bank's involvement
with the HRDP as a whole (in addition to its financing of a part of it)
provides a framework for broad reforms in the social sectors on an inte-
grated basis. In addition, Bank participation woulds (a) help ensure
continued consistency of the uRDp with Jamaica's agreed macroeconomic
framework and public investment program targets; and (b) encourage donor
financing for the HRDP at suitable terms, as an Integral part of the
overall financial strategy to support the MTFP. In this contest, annual
donor coordination meetings will be conducted. The proposed project has
been built on sector work the Bank undertook prior to the June 1988 CGCED
meeting, and takes into account the lessons learned from previous projects.
It complements past Bank efforts in Jamaica to improve the social services,
through seven previous projectst three In population/healthlnutrition and
four in education. Five of these projects have been completed, with
acceptable results; the ongoing education project is proceeding
satisfactorilyt and implementation of the ongoing population and health
project is expected to accelerate, after resolution of problems which
caused initial delays. The experience gained with past projects
underscores the need for effective programming capability, competent
project management, and adequate and timely counterpart funding. It also
emphasizes the importance of a sound policy framework, particularly with
respect to the fir-icing of social services. Project design has also
benefitted from th. Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS), set up by
the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN), with Bank assistance. The
LSMS. based on household surveys, was designed to monitor key social
indicators and the impact of several HRDP components. The preliminary
results of the 1988 Survey of Living Conditions in Jamaica was used as a
basis for setting policy targets in education and health.
S.       Proaram/Proiect Objectives. The HRDP aims at an Increased
transfer of financial resources to the social sectors, wlth improved
efficiency and greater equity in the use of those resources. It also aims
at strengthening program management, while implementing institutional and
policy reforms to make the social services more cost-effective. The
objectives of the proposed project are to improve the efficiency, delivery
and management of social services in Jamaica, and in particular of health
and education. It would support the Government's adoption of social sector
policy reforms and efficiency measures (listed in a Statement of Sectoral
Policies and Policy Matrix), which include the following: (a) increasing
the share of primary health care services out of the Ministry of Health
(MOH) recurrent expenditures from 21Z in 1988 to 25Z by 1991 and the share
of pre-primary and primary education out of the Ministry of Education (MOE)
recurrent expenditures from 35Z in 1988 to 38Z by 1992; (b) improved
targeting of nutrition aid (including gradual phasing out of general food
subsidies, tightening of eligibility requirements for food stamps, and
expansion of school lunch programs) and employment aid programs (including
rural works and related training for women and youths); (c) increased cost
recovery in public hospitals, increased charges for drugs delivered at



-3-
public hospitals, rental scheme for and increased cost recovery (with
exemptions for the poorest students) in provision of secondary school
textbooks, divestiture of some public hospital services such as janitorial,
catering and laundry services, and community participation in school and
health clinic maintenance; (d) improved budgeting and financial management
in public health services, including increased retention of revenue from
fees by public hospitals; (e) institutional strengthening, including
incentive measures to retain and recruit managers and other key personnel
at MH and MOE; and (f) improved civil registry and ancillary vital
statistics collection and analysis.
6.       Project Description.  Within the HRDP. the Bank would finance
certain priority investments, including primary health care, pre-primary
and primary education, and HRDP administratiorn and monitoring.
Specifically, the project vould provide for: (a) construction, furniture
and equipment for 12 primary health care centers, including nurses'
quarters in eight of th-, and dental clinic equipment for eight centers;
(b) medical, surgical, dental and medical support equipment for hospitals;
(c) replenishment of depleted stocks of pharmaceuticals for preventive,
curative, and rehabilitative health care delivery; (d) health sector
institutional strengthening, including the staffing of a project
implementation unit at the MOH, as well as training for MOH staff; (e)
upgrading the Registrar General's Department at the MOH, which is in charge
of vital statistics for the country; (f) upgrading the basic schools
program of community-supported, pre-school centers in low-income
neighborhoods by supporting the refurbishing of about 390 pre-primary
schools, training of pre-primary teachers, and program supervision and
monitoring; (g) renovating about 20 primary and all-age schools to
alleviate overcrowding; (h) increasing the availability of primary level
textbooks by supporting the development, production, and distribution of
English, mathematics, science and social studies textbooks for about
350,000 primary school children; (i) education sector institutional
strengthening by supporting the construction of five and staffing of six
Regional Education Offices, the operation of the National Assessment
Program, teacher training, a pilot program of awards for selected schiols
(to reward overall school performance based on absolute academic standards,
improved academic performance, care of school facilities, and school
involvement in the commiaity), and provision of educational materials for
needy children; (j) operational support for the HRDP Secretariat; and (k)
BRDP monitoring, including semi-annual household surveys on living
standards, in collaboration with STATIN.  About 47X of the estimated total
project costs are for health sector development, about 49Z for education
sector development and the remaining 4X for HRDP administration and
monitoring.
7.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$67.0
million, excluding taxes and duties, of which US$27.2 million is expected
to be in foreign exchange. Retroactive financing will be provided for
project activities occurring after August 1, 1988 (or a date twelve months
prior to loan signing) and not exceeding US$2 million. Cost estimates and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key events of project processing is summarized in Schedule C.
The status of Bank Group operations in Jamaica is shown in Schedule D. A
map of Jamaica is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7573-JM, dated
June 1, 1989 is also attached.



4-
8.       A8reed Actions.  Agreement was reached at negotiations thatt  (a)
the project will be implemented on the basis of annual subprograms to be
agreed between the Government and the Bank, including annual targets for
public expenditures in various social sectors; (b) anneal joint Bank-
Government PDP and project progress reviews will be conducted; and (c) if
during an annual review the Bank is not satisfied with progress in project
implementation diring the preceding year, or with the implementation and
financing plans for the following year, the Bank would have the right to
withhold further disbursements. Agreement was also reached on: (a) the
policy framework (sumasrized in para. 5 above) as laid out in the
Government's Statement of Sectoral Policies and Policy Matrix, which
include an action plan to implement necessary changes to the general food
subsidy, food stamp and school lunch programs; (b) key staff required for
the HRDP Secretariat in the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and for
the MOE and MOH units; (c) a plan and procedures for upgrading pre-primary
schools, including the use of a supervisory agency, and on arrangements to
seek the cooperation of the communities in the upgrading of pre-primary
schools; (d) hiring of engineering firms to supervise civil works under the
project; and (e) criteria for the identification of beveficiaries and for
the allocation of primary school supplies for needy children. As a
condition of effectiveness, the Government will appoint key staff to the
BRDP Secretariat and to the MOE and MOB units concerned with BRDP
implementation.
9.       Benefits.  The Bank's leading role in HRDP formulation and execu-
tion will help Jamaica to reap increased benefits from the program, while
keeping it within the agreed macroeconomic framework and overall medium-
term investment priorities. Through its policy reforms and other measures,
the program will increase the overall efficiency of social services,
improve targeting of subsidies and assistance, and promote formulation of
suitable strategies to protect the vulnerable groups of the population.
The proposed project's focus on primary health care and pre-primary and
primary education will help rehabilitate, improve and expand these priority
social services, and would give the poor, especially women and children,
better access to them.
10.      Risks.  The main risk both for the proposed project and for the
HRDP as a whole is possible administrative delays in program/project
implementation. An effective role by the HRDP Secretariat in monitoring,
coordinating and expediting the HRDP execution by the several ministries
and agencies concerned would reduce such a risk. Staff incentives and
strengthened implementation capacity in major ministries and agencies will
help to expedite program and project execution. Another important risk is
that the Government may find it politically expedient to overemphasize
certain segments of the HRDP (such as food distribution and public works
programs), to the neglect of other and more economically sound BRDP
components. The BRDP monitoring system being established and the annual
progress reviews with -he Government will focus on program priorities on a
ccntinuing basis. The Bank's involvement in the overall program and its



leading role in the donor aid coordination process will provide an
effective basis for discussion and close monitoring of URDP expenditures.
11.      Recommendations  I am satisfied that the proposed loan of US$30.0
million would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recom-
mend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
