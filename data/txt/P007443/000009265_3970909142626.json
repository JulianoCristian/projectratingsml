This report provides an evaluation of the\n            implementation of the SSDP with particular emphasis on\n            lessons learnt from the experience. The main objective of\n            SSDP was to improve the efficiency, delivery and management\n            of social services in Jamaica, and in particular of health\n            and education. The other objectives were as follows: (i)\n            continued support for the ongoing program of economic\n            adjustment; (ii) selected investments in key economic and\n            social sectors, combined with policies to improve the\n            efficiency of resource use and combat the worst effects of\n            poverty; and (iii) assistance to the government in securing\n            the external financing needed for its development program.\n            Overall, Bank performance was marginally satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from the implementation experience of this\n            project follows: (a) project design must reflect the\n            institutional capacities of agencies to execute the\n            activities and incorporate adequate strengthening measures\n            beyond the hiring of additional staff; (b) the better\n            integrated project implementation units and their activities\n            are within the implementing agency the greater the\n            probability is of objectives being achieved and sustained.;\n            (c) new options for the management of civil works must be\n            seriously considered and piloted; (d) introducing\n            post-qualification to better evaluate the contractor's\n            financial and technical resources at the time the works are\n            to be undertaken; (e) specific project outcome and impact\n            measures in addition to input and output indicators should\n            be established during design, evaluated as part of the\n            project and consistently monitored to determine project\n            achievement and development impact; and (f) it is\n            unreasonable to expect an investment project which disburses\n            on the basis of narrowly-defined outputs and contributes a\n            marginal amount to overall sector spending to effect\n            wide-reaching policy reform."}, "docdt": "1997-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
