There are three main project components. The first\n            component strengthens health services delivery at the\n            district level, as part of the policy of the Ministry of\n            Public Health and Population to operationalize a District\n            Health System (DHS) by upgrading district hospitals and\n            health centers in eight districts and ensuring the effective\n            delivery of a package of integrated maternal and child\n            (PIMAC) health services together with supporting the\n            decentralization of resource management. The second\n            component improves the effectiveness of public health\n            programs by strengthening two critical programs, namely,\n            malaria and health education. It finances civil works for\n            minor renovations of referral laboratories, proivides\n            equipment and supplies for laboratories and vector control\n            and disease surveillance, computers and vehicles, emergency\n            stocks of essential drugs and insecticide treated materials,\n            staff training, etc. The third component supports human\n            resources development in the areas of financial analysis and\n            health systems management."}, "docdt": "2002-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
