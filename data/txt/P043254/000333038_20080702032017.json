The report is divided in nine sections.\n            Section A provides the introduction to the report and the\n            country context. Sections B and C review the key health\n            indicators and trends and the key aspects of the sector in\n            terms of financing, service delivery, human resources,\n            health services, organizational framework, and policy\n            environment.

Section F is an outline of the\n            MOPH/HSR program. Sections G and H provide an overview of\n            the Bank's current assistance and its response to HSR\n            as well as the different donors' support. Finally,\n            Section I outlines the future areas where the Bank can\n            support the government in its health reform efforts.
