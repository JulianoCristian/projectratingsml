Some lessons learned included: in\n            health projects where usually the public sector operates\n            under many constraints (particularly the lack of incentives\n            for civil servants), strong leadership at the highest level\n            of the ministry is essential to ensure satisfactory\n            implementation and operation of the projects. In an\n            environment of weak institutional capacity, the design of a\n            project must be simple, realistic and consistent with the\n            government's capacity to implement it. Technical\n            ministries like the ministry of health should concentrate\n            their energy and activities on purely sectoral matters and\n            issues and delegate the carrying out of civil works to\n            agencies specialized in those activities, such as Public\n            Works Project (PWP). At the same time, agencies like PWP\n            need to expand their capacity to respond to the demand for\n            their service to ensure further quality and timeliness of\n            their delivery. A vertical program versus a system approach\n            is a complex issue. In a context of burning need for quick\n            health outcomes, working through vertical programs could\n            achieve quick health outcomes while building implementation\n            capacity and should be designed to ensure gradual building\n            of a change management platform. Renovating and equipping\n            health facilities and training medical staff could turn out\n            to be a total loss of resources if adequate budgets are not\n            made available for operation and maintenance. Ensuring a\n            satisfactory utilization of the available capacity of health\n            facilities may also require improvements in the management\n            of these facilities so that the population is encouraged to\n            use them. Special efforts must be made to ensure\n            satisfactory design and drawings of utilities and waste\n            management systems and to sensitize end-users for better\n            management of liquid and solid waste, including medical waste."}, "docdt": "2010-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
