A.    OVERVIEW


This report is intended to provide a base for discussions of Yemen's health sector strategy with
the Government of Yemen (GOY) and other donors in light of the Ministry of Public Health
(MOPH) initiative of Health Sector Reform (HSR) as well as the potential areas of World Bank
support.

1.    INTRODUCTION

This report is based on a review of a number of documents including an earlier draft of this note,
the MOPH/Health Sector Reform program (1998), the Public Expenditures Reviews (1998 and
2000), the Comprehensive Development Review report, Phase I (2000), the National Health
Accounts report (2000), and the GTZ technical assistance reports (2000).

The report is divided in nine sections. Section A provides the introduction to the report and the
country context. Sections B and C review the key health indicators and trends and the key
aspects of the sector in terms of financing, service delivery, human resources, health services,
organizational framework, and policy environment. Sections D and E provide international
comparisons and an assessment of the sector performance with regard to health outcomes,
equity, access, efficiency, quality, and sustainability. Section F is an outline of the MOPH/HSR
program. Sections G and H provide an overview of the Bank's current assistance and its
response to HSR as well as the different donors' support. Finally, Section I outlines the future
areas where the Bank can support the government in its health reform efforts.

2.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

Yemen is a country challenged with limited economic and social development. In particular,
health indicators are some of the poorest in the world, and the task of improving them is
daunting, particularly in light of the difficult economic situation.

The early 1990's were marked by spiraling inflation, real devaluation, pervasive inefficiency in
the public sector, increasing poverty, growing unemployment, and mounting public debt. At the
end of the civil war of 1994, Yemen was faced with macro-economic instability, which was
threatened by large fiscal imbalances, and price distortions including exchange and interest rate
controls. With the arrival of a multi-party democracy, the political consensus could be forged for
the urgent economic reforms that had been delayed since unification.

In 1995, GOY launched an economic reform program, supported by the International Monetary
Fund as well as the World Bank and other institutions and countries, aiming in its core at
enhancing the foundations of a market-based and private sector driven economy, integrated into
world markets, and in the context of broad financial stability. During the second half of the
1990's, macro-stability improved in terms of growth and inflation, but considerably less for

social indicators. Total government revenue increased from 19.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to over
30 percent in 1999, mainly as a result of increasing oil revenue which constituted over 68 percent
of total revenues whereas 24 percent was from taxes and the remainder from other sources.1

However, world oil prices dictate the oil revenue base, and Yemen had faced a sudden decline in
their oil revenue from 22.1 percent of GDP in 1997 to 13.8 percent of GDP in 1998 following a
dramatic drop in oil prices. As a result, the government budget was cut by 15 percent across-the-
board, which further tightened scarce resources for the health sector. Specifically, the low
budgetary allocation to the health sector was further reduced resulting in the lowest per capita
health spending in the region of US$20. Limited public resources and poor health indicators are
the catalysts from which the MOPH is rethinking its strategy in partnership with the World Bank
and other key donors.

In 1998, the MOPH launched a comprehensive sector reform initiative. The objectives of this
reform program are to improve equity, quality, efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility, and the
long-term sustainability of health services. Its "Health Sector Reform in the Republic of Yemen:
Strategies for Reform" (December 1998) provides a framework for this reform. The MOPH
acknowledges the constraints people face in affording and accessing care as well as its own
budgetary limitations. The reform is to be done in the context of the Government's broader
reform strategy, which supports financial rationalization and restructuring, decentralization, and
reform of the civil service.


B.    KEY HEALTH INDICATORS AND TRENDS


Yemen faces major challenges to improving the health status of its population, which go beyond
the health delivery network. Poverty, low participation in education especially among girls, and
high illiteracy2 are major contributing factors to poor health as are limited access to potable
water and proper sanitation.3

The results are alarming. Adult mortality and total fertility rates are the highest while maternal
and infant mortality rates are the second and third highest in the MENA region, respectively.
Yemen is also one of the few countries in the region where under-nutrition is a major problem,
particularly among children where about 50 percent are malnourished and stunted.4 Population
growth, at 3.6 percent per year (1998), is among the highest in the world, family planning
activities are minimal, and the use of modern contraceptives is particularly low at 13 percent.
The situation is compounded by the wide regional disparities and the significant differences
between urban and rural conditions. For example, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in rural areas is

    67% of women are illiterate.

3   Only 55% of the rural population has access to safe drinking water and only 14% of the rural population has
    access to adequate sanitation.

23 percent higher than the overall total for the country and rural children have a 22 percent
greater chance of dying in their first five years than urban children.5 Yemen's key human
development, health, and reproductive health indicators are provided in Box (1).

Yemen is at an early stage of the epidemiological transition, with morbidity and mortality from
communicable diseases dominating that from non-communicable diseases.6 These indicators
point to difficulty in balancing the urgent need for improved access to basic health services with
the rising demand for costly specialized services for non-communicable diseases and injuries.


C.    INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS


From an international comparative perspective, a more serious pircture of Yemen's health care
system emerges. Tables 1-3 provide a comparison of Yemen's health care system in terms of
demography, health status, delivery system, and health expenditure to other countries in the
MENA Region.          Figures 1-7 depict the comparison of Yemen's infant mortality, bed to
population ratio, physician to population ratio, the public share of total health expenditures, per
capita health expenditures, and health to GDP ratio to those of other countries worldwide, as well
as those countries with similar income levels.7

1.    DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH INDICATORS

·   Yemen's population growth rate of 2.8 and TFR of 6.3, are both above the MENA average of
    2.1 and 3.9 resepectively. Yemen's TFR is among the highest in the world.
·   Yemen's share of population over age 65 of 3 percent is below the regional average of 3.4
    percent.
·   Yemen's IMR of 82 is the third highest in the region (after Djibouti and Iraq).
·   Relative to other comparable income countries of the world, Yemen's IMR is slightly above
    (Figure 1).
·   Yemen's maternal mortality rate of 350 is the second highest in the MENA region (after
    Djibouti).
·   In terms of adult mortality, Yemen's probability of death for males and females in the 15-60
    age range is well above the regional average.
·   Yemen's life expectancy at birth of 56 years, is well below the regional average of 69 years.
·   In terms of malnutrition, 50 percent of children under 5-years of age are malnourished and
    strunted, which is the highest level in the region.




6   The most prevalent conditions are diarrheal diseases, malnutrition, acute respiratory infections, complications of
    pregnancy, and malaria. Chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart disease and injuries are also on the rise.

7   Data are based on 2000 World Bank estimates.

In summary, in a comparative international context, Yemen's health outcomes are lower than
most countries; population growth and fertility is well above many countries in the region; bed
and physician to population ratios are below regional averages and below those found in other
comparable income countries in the world; and health expenditures are below the regional
average, but slightly above the level found in other comparable income countries.


D.    KEY ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH SECTOR


The following section provides an overview of the key aspects of the health sector and the
challenges that need to be addressed under the HSR program.

1.    HEALTH SECTOR FINANCING

As noted above, resources for health are limited. Total health spending is estimated at 5.6
percent of GDP in FY 1997. Total public spending is estimated at 1.9 percent (excluding all
foreign assistance)8 and private spending at 3.3 percent of GDP, making Yemen among the
countries with the highest share of private (out of pocket) expenditures on health in the region.
Total per capita health spending amounts to about US$20.9


8  When foreign technical assistance to public sector is included, total public health expenditure rises to around 2.3
   percent of GDP. Foreign assistance accounts for about one-quarter of public health spending. Sources:
   National Health Accounts Report (2000) and Public Expenditure Review for the Health Sector (2000).

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                                           Page 12


Government health sector employees are salaried and Government facilities are financed based
on budgets and nominal user charges collected at the facility level. The MOPH has passed
legislation to formalize cost sharing in public facilities, the implementation of which is currently
underway. There are provisions for exempting the poor from paying such fees. It is common
practice, and permissible by law, for public health care providers to also have a private practice.
Private providers are paid on a fee-for-service basis.

Public Expenditures on Health.         10  Total public spending on health remains among the lowest in
the MENA region, at 1.9 percent of GDP and accounting for about 4.3 percent of total
government expenditure, which is also low in comparison to other developing countries that
typically allocate for health between 5 and 10 percent of government expenditure. MOPH
accounts for almost 86 percent of total public spending on health.

Recurrent expenditure is mostly consumed by salaries, which constitute more than 45 percent of
total public spending on health. However, the share allocated to salaries and wages, in real
terms, has declined steadily over the past few years, resulting in deteriorating staff morale and
forcing providers to augment income by engaging in private practice. In 1996, for example, an
analysis of wages and salaries of public health sector employees in four governorates showed
that between 50 and 80 percent of these employees received salaries that placed them below the
poverty line.11

Operations and maintenance budgets are extremely low and estimated in 1998 to fall short by as
much as 56 percent of the budget required to adequately finance the operation of the existing
facilities. Drugs and medical supplies represent less than 10 percent of the current budget.12 For
example, health centers have revenues equal to 45 percent of their required recurrent costs to
operate optimally where only 20 percent come from the government and 25 percent from other
sources, including cost-sharing contributions; similarly, health units receive only 9 percent of
their required operational costs from the MOPH and 28 percent from cost sharing.13 Obviously,
the recurrent budget allocation has not kept pace with the expansion of physical facilities and
staffing. For example, after adjusting for inflation, 1998 current expenditures were at the same
expenditure level as in 1993.14           Moreover, control of the recurrent budget remains highly
centralized, as the central MOPH retains direct control over 46 percent.15

10  "Public expenditures" in this section refers to the expenditures which are channeled through MOPH,
    autonomous hospitals that fall outside of the MOPH budget, and overseas treatments financed by all ministries.
    Not included are health expenditures incurred by other public entities (e.g., the military and police), which are
    expected to be relatively small compared to the MOPH budget.

Investment (capital) expenditure accounted for 8 percent of the total MOPH budget between
1992 and 1995, and then it rose to 30 percent between 1996 and 1998. As a result of the sector
dialog with GOY as part of the Public Expenditures Review in the last two years, the MOPH
investment budget declined to less than 23 percent in 1999-2000.

Private Expenditures on Health. Private spending on health is estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP
in FY 1997, almost 1.4 times the public expenditures on health, making Yemen the country with
the fourth highest share (59 percent) of private expenditures on health in the region. It is
important to note that this share is financed directly by households (out-of-pocket) and not
private firms, as no information is available on private sector financing. On average about 3
percent of household expenditure is spent on health.16 Spending on pharmaceuticals constitute
68 percent of total household health spending, followed by almost 20 percent on private
providers.17

There are major issues facing public financing of the health sector. The most important is the
low budget allocation as percent of total government budget. In addition, the investment
program does not reflect actual need where decisions on investment priorities are mostly ad-hoc
and often in response to political pressure, with the result being an uneven distribution of
facilities and types of services offered. Moreover, there is a disconnect between investment and
recurrent expenditures where the current budget allocation has not kept pace with the expansion
of physical facilities and staffing. The new and existing facilities do not have the operations and
maintenance budgets to operate effectively.                 Furthermore, too few recurrent resources are
allocated for public health activities, and drugs are in short supply in most health facilities.
Finally, control of the recurrent budget remains highly centralized.

With respect to private spending on health, there exists inequity in financial access arising from
the cash payments system, both direct and indirect as will be discussed below. Private payments
are being made to the unregulated and rapidly expanding private sector as well as to public
sector providers through an informal and ad-hoc cost-sharing arrangement. Finally, the lack of
an insurance market results in missed opportunities to attract and utilize private expenditures.18

2.     HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM

The public sector remains the major provider of health care at all levels of services. At present,
there are 2,177 public health facilities directly under the MOPH including 101 public hospitals
which comprise 12 specialized, 18 general, 41 district, and 30 rural hospitals in addition to 517
Health Centers and 1,559 Health Units. Moreover, there are two autonomous tertiary care
hospitals (Al-Thawra and Al-Kuwait Hospitals in Sana'a City), which receive budget allocation
from the Ministry of Finance. The secondary level, represented by district and rural hospitals, is

18  The actual level of revenues from cost-sharing is not known since most of the revenues are retained at the
    facility and not reported to central authorities. Officially, cost sharing contributed just 0.6% of MOPH's current
    revenues in 1996. Actual revenues are assumed to be considerably higher and increasing.

underutilized as demonstrated by a bypass rate19 between 42 and 73 percent.20 With regard to
the first level of health care, almost one third of the health units are temporary, one half with
neither water supply nor sewage drainage, more than two thirds with no electricity, and almost
two thirds have no adequate current budget.

The private sector is estimated to have a total of 6,857 health facilities including 555 hospitals
and facilities with beds and 6,302 clinics. There are also 753 private pharmacies and 1,907 drug
stores. In 1998, the total number of beds amounted to 10,625 beds (9,103 public and 1,522
private), which represents 0.62 bed per 1000 population. There is evidence, however, of the
expanding role of the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in the delivery
of health services.

The health service delivery system is characterized by the lack of planning norms and standards
that result in wide regional variations in infrastructure distribution. In addition, there is lack of
vertical continuity of care between the different levels because of deficient referral systems. The
quality of infrastructure is deteriorating because of the lack of an effective maintenance system.
The health units and health centers are underutilized while rural health units are almost
dysfunctional mostly because of lack of drugs and manpower. The exact number and scope of
activities of the NGO and private sectors are not known. Coordination of investments and
activities between the public and private sector is absent.

3.     HUMAN RESOURCES

There are currently 32,590 staff employed in the MOPH, accounting for 9.6 percent of civil
service employment, thus making the MOPH the second largest public sector employer. There
are a total of 3,788 physicians and 9,419 nurses in Yemen, which represents a national ratio of
0.23 physician and 0.55 nurse per 1,000 population. MOPH offices are generally overstaffed
with administrative and non-medical personnel. Health facilities are highly overstaffed in urban
areas while remote posts remain vacant, particularly health units. There is lack of specialized
physicians, and foreign medical specialists consume a high share of the current budget. There is
considerable lack of female service providers, such as community midwives, particularly in
primary health care services.              Moreover, there are wide regional variations in manpower
distribution as exemplified by the presence of almost 50 percent of all physicians in Aden &
Sana'a.

Human resources are characterized by the lack of staffing norms, right skill-mix, composition,
and distribution. In addition, training and continued medical education are inadequate and
ineffective. These problems are compounded by the poor work environment including work
conditions and morale. This underscores the lack of effective human resources planning and the
difficulty of management under the civil service constraints




19  The bypass rate is expressed in terms of percentage of the population, in a specific catchment area, who use
    either tertiary level or private health facilities as first contact for primary health care services.

4.    HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS

Yemen is at an early stage of its epidemiological transition, which means that communicable
diseases continue to be prevalent as demonstrated by the high child and maternal morbidity and
mortality rates. For example, malaria, which has been successfully eliminated in most countries
of the region, continues to cause about 1.5 million cases of illness and 15,000 deaths per year.
MOPH does have a number of vertical public health programs, which lack integration and their
effectiveness is questionable. For example, an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
(IMCI) is being initiated by the MOPH to address childhood illnesses, however, reliable
governorate-level data to track trends are not available, and the basic inputs to address childhood
illness, such as oral rehydration salts for diarrhea, are in short supply.

In terms of health benefits, all Yemenis are eligible to receive care at MOPH facilities.
However, public services are generally regarded as poor quality, and therefore those who can
afford it, seek care in private facilities as represented by the high rate of public service bypass.
Some private companies (principally the larger ones or those affiliated with an international
company) either contract with the private sector to provide health services for their employees or
provide services through their own facilities.

Health services are characterized by a lack of continuity of care; for example there is no formal
referral system or integration of services at different levels.      The quality of health services is
poor in both public and private sectors. Health services provided by the public sector are mostly
focused on curative and hospital based services rather than more cost-effective primary care
services. The MOPH primary care services lack adequate resources, particularly for public
health programs. Finally, the weakness of the public health programs is exemplified by a lack of
basic data needed for program planning such as disease prevalence, regional variation, and
epidemiological trends; lack of national control strategy and coordination; delayed response to
outbreaks and epidemics; poor case management; and lack of supplies. Strengthening the public
health programs is a major concern and constitutes a priority in reforming the health sector.

5.    THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

The MOPH is the organization responsible for the health sector in Yemen. However, there are a
number of other public organizations involved in the financing, planning, regulation,
management, and provision of health services in Yemen. These include the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), Ministry of Planning and Development (MOPD), Ministry of Civil Service (MOCS), the
two autonomous hospitals, the Health Manpower Institutes, military and police health services,
and the Drug Fund. The Minister of Health is assisted by three Undersecretaries for Planning
and Development, Health Care Services, and Finance and Administration.                There are 20
Directors-General who are heading the health directorates in the governorates, while the health
districts are headed by a director supported by a few staff. The MOPH organizational structure
was not updated in two decades.          The management systems are weak, for example, the
inequitable allocation of resources across governorates and services reflects lack of strategic
planning and the inefficient use of resources reflects ineffective management.

The organizational/institutional framework of the health sector may be characterized as being
overly centralized, poorly coordinated, and weak. The MOPH core functions such as policy
analysis, strategic planning, sector regulation, performance evaluation and monitoring, and

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                         Page 16


sector coordination are under-developed. Management systems such as financial management,
human resources, and information systems are weak. The MOPH management structure is out-
dated and the health districts, on which depends the District Health System model, are
rudimentary.

6.    THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT

The MOPH has launched a comprehensive sector reform initiative aimed at improving equity,
quality, efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility, and the long-term sustainability of health
services. The MOPH acknowledges the constraints people face in affording and accessing care
as well as its own budgetary limitations. The reform is to be undertaken in the context of the
Government's broader reform strategy, which supports public expenditure rationalization and
restructuring, management decentralization, and civil service reform.

The proposed government health reform initiative however will require the mobilization of large
amounts of resources that are not yet available, and it does not take into consideration the
limited capacity of the public sector for undertaking such a reform program. Also, there are no
clear implementation strategies and most importantly, the costs of the proposed reform program
are not indicated. Additionally, public health programs, which are a major weakness in the
system, are not adequately addressed in this reform initiative. Moreover, the achievement of the
long-term objectives of the health reform will be contingent upon improvements in other sectors
such as water, sanitation, education, civil service, finance, roads, and transportation.


E.    HEALTH SECTOR PERFORMANCE


A rational strategy for reform should build upon the strengths of the existing system, while at the
same time address its weaknesses.        In assessing strengths and weaknesses, one needs to
determine both conceptually, and to the extent possible, empirically how well the system
performs in terms of the underlying goals of improving health outcomes, assuring equity and
access, promoting efficiency of the service delivery system, and assuring quality of care and the
sector's financial sustainability. The strengths and weaknesses of Yemen's health system are
evaluated along each of these performance parameters.

1.    HEALTH OUTCOMES

The performance of Yemen's health delivery system with respect to health outcomes, both in
terms of its own performance and in comparison to other countries, was discussed above and
demonstrated by the high child and maternal morbidity and mortality indicators. It is clear that
Yemen faces major challenges to improve health outcomes. Given its early health transition
status, health outcomes may be dramatically improved if public resources are shifted to focus on
cost-effective health services and technologies, which become readily available. The main
constraint is that the Government's political commitment to improving health outcomes does not
translate into making such policy choices in terms of resource allocation to the most cost-
effective health interventions.

2.     EQUITY

The regional and urban/rural variations in the distribution and availability of resources and the
disparity in health outcomes illustrate the inequity in the provision of health services. Within the
governorates, there are also serious imbalances in the distribution of resources. For example,
most of the health staff are highly concentrated in and around the urban areas and in these
settings the facilities are highly overstaffed, while services in the rural and remote regions
remain severely under-staffed and under-financed.

With respect to equity of financing, in assessing the "fairness" of the contribution/revenue base
for financing the health system, one should consider whether individuals' contributions, both
through the general government revenue system and out-of-pocket are based on "ability to pay".
There is inequity in the financing of health services in Yemen as indicated by the fact that only a
small portion of the population has access to formal risk sharing arrangements. The remainder of
the population pays out-of-pocket when they need care through formal and informal cost sharing
arrangements. That the same fees are charged to those with a lower income as well as those with
a higher income means that the charges are regressive and hence a greater burden for those with
a lower income.21           The problems with not having risk sharing arrangements are further
exacerbated by those patients with chronic illnesses who must pay for regular interactions with
the health delivery system, or with a catastrophic illness when charges for care can mount
precipitously.

2.     ACCESS

There are physical, financial, and social factors that impede access to health services where less
than half of the population, particularly those living in the rural areas, have access to basic health
services. Physical access is limited by lack of transportation, rough terrain, and a dysfunctional
health infrastructure (many health units are literally closed, others are open but either not staffed
or without adequate supplies or both). Lack of financial access arises from the fact that the
availability of health services generally corresponds with the ability to make cash payments (as
described above). These payments are both direct (cost sharing in public and fee-for-service in
private facilities) and indirect (e.g., transportation). Access to care will be hindered if a patient
does not have adequate financial resources to shoulder the cost of care. Social constraints also
exist; for example, it may be difficult for women, in traditional communities, to seek care if the
service provider is not female or if she does not have an escort.

3.     EFFICIENCY

Lack of efficiency in the management and operations of the health sector is pervasive. There is
excessive centralization of resource management, e.g., control of the recurrent budget remains
highly centralized where the central MOPH retains direct control over 46 percent of the recurrent
budget. The allocation of public resources is not based on need, e.g., excessive infrastructure
investments, usually clustered in certain geographic areas, very low budgets for operations and
maintenance, and very low utilization rates. The basic inputs needed at the facility level for
providing proper care are not available. Public facilities are staffed by employees, the majority

21  There are provisions to exempt the poor from cost sharing charges, however the application of these rules tends
    to be arbitrary and therefore one would expect that even the poor are then shouldering the burden of paying for
    part of their health care.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                           Page 18


of whom have private practices in the afternoon.           Finally, the lack of coordination and
collaboration between the public and private sectors result in duplication of resources
particularly in urban areas.

4.    QUALITY

The quality of existing services is poor, particularly in the public sector, thus contributing to the
country's poor health outcomes. The poor quality is attributed to many factors. For example,
inputs for providing services are inadequate, e.g., unavailability of drugs and medical supplies.
In addition, there is lack of regulation, standards, and protocols. Moreover, there is poor
maintenance of facilities and equipment. There is also lack of continuity of care both vertical
(referral system from one level to another) and horizontal (service integration). These are
compounded by the poor management practices at the central and facility levels and low morale
of service providers. The quality of services provided by NGOs is generally better than that of
the public sector, while it varies significantly in the private sector. However, the high demand
for private services reflects the Government's inability to meet needs through public services.

5.    SUSTAINABILITY

The lack of sustainability of the public health delivery system is of concern along four
parameters. The financial parameter is exemplified by the rising costs of health care (e.g., drugs
and technology), low public spending overall, high out-of-pocket spending (59 percent of total
spending and 3 percent of household income), and the lack of formal insurance coverage. The
health transition is imposing an increasing dual burden of disease. The institutional framework
is fragmented, and the public sector capacity to plan and manage resources is poor. Finally, the
policy/regulatory framework is not well defined with respect to regulation, enforcement of
legislation, and unyielding civil service constraints.


F.    MOPH HEALTH SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM


In light of the serious challenges facing the health sector, the MOPH launched a reform program,
in 1998, with long-term goals, which takes into consideration many of the economic and social
conditions of Yemen and acknowledges the public sector's limited management capacity to
introduce and manage change.        The Bank provided some technical advice on the strategy
development, along with commitments of support. The long-term goal articulated in the MOPH
health sector reform program is to improve health status by fundamentally changing the existing
system's approach to meeting the health care needs of the Yemeni people.

Overall, the reform concentrates on greatly improved management systems, decentralization of
management functions to the level of the district, cost sharing for the users of health services,
stronger policy and management role for the MOPH, and smaller role in direct service provision.
The following provides a brief description of the key components of MOPH reform program.

1.    LONG TERM OBJECTIVES

The long-term objectives of the MOPH reform program are:

·   Adequate/universal access to health care services

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                            Page 19


·   Equity in both the delivery and eventually the financing of health care
·   Improved allocative and technical efficiency of the service delivery system
·   Improved quality of health services
·   System's long run financial sustainability

2.     ELEMENTS

The key elements of the MOPH reform program are:

·   Decentralization of planning, decision making, and financial management
·   Redefinition of the role of the public sector with a stronger emphasis on policy, regulation,
    and public health, and establishment of limits on its role as service provider
·   District health system approach
·   Community co-management of health systems
·   Cost sharing
·   Essential drugs policy, and realignment of the logistics system for drugs and medical supplies
·   Decentralized, outcome-based management system from the central to the community level
·   Hospital autonomy and eventual basic health facility autonomy
·   Encouragement of responsible participation by the private sector and NGOs through
    appropriate policy design regulation.

3.     PHASES

MOPH reform will take place in two phases: (i) an initiation phase in which all key aspects of
the reform will be initiated, lessons learned, key legislation passed, district health systems put in
place in at least 40 percent of districts, revisions of the financial system initiated, and major
actors brought on board; and (ii) a five year consolidation phase in which the lessons learned in
the initiation phase can be fashioned into long term systems, policies and regulations, and the
remainder of the districts brought into the health district system.

The proposed MOPH Health Sector Reform program is evidently very ambitious. For example,
the period of the initiation phase was completed with little achievement. The program long-term
objectives are broad, the time frame of the phases is unrealistic, and the key reform elements are
all-inclusive with lack of prioritization. In terms of feasibility, there was little consideration to
the capacity required to implement, manage, and monitor the program. As for affordability,
there was no reflection on the financial requirements and implications. The MOPH reform
program would need to be scaled down to a more realistic and feasible level that takes into
account the constraints in management capacity and financial resources within the country's
political, economic, and social context. To this effect, a preliminary analysis of the estimated
costs of the reform is provided in Annex I.


G.     HEALTH SECTOR POLICY DIALOG AND CURRENT ASSISTANCE


Since the MOPH issued its Health Sector Reform program in 1998, a sector dialog has been
initiated by the Bank with the MOPH and other donors. The purpose of this dialog is to
participate in the refinement of the program, contribute to its initiation phase through ongoing
and new projects, and coordinate Bank's activities with the other active donors.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                         Page 20



Moreover, a number of programs have been initiated and many ongoing programs have been
restructured to support preparation of the reform effort as detailed below.

1.    FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT

      ·   A team of GTZ advisors has been recruited in the areas of public health, health
          financing, manpower development, health education, and nursing to assess the situation
          and develop plans for the reform in these respective areas (interim reports submitted).
      ·   The establishment of a HSR Unit is being supported through the provision of funds for
          the recruitment of a local HSR Coordinator and an Advisor, as well as for the
          procurement of basic office equipment and supplies.
      ·   The preparation of a comprehensive survey of MOPH facilities was supported,
          including their location, availability of staff and major equipment as the first step
          towards preparation of a health facility master plan.
      ·   Strategy for a pilot hospital autonomy program was prepared.
      ·   The establishment and initial operation of the Drug Fund was supported by financing
          the preparation of the Business Plan, asset assessment, recruitment of key technical
          staff, and the initial stock of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.
      ·   A pilot health information system was developed to improve monitoring and
          surveillance of health conditions.
      ·   The health education activities were decentralized to ensure that health messages target
          local communities.

2.    CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

      ·   The District Health System (DHS) will be developed and operationalized in selected
          governorates and districts.
      ·   Resources at the community level will be mobilized by providing communities with
          training in needs definition, social mobilization, and community-based management.
      ·   An integrated approach to child development will be provided including child health
          improvement through ensuring the provision of integrated basic health services such as
          the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), IMCI, and Acute Respiratory
          Infections (ARI).
      ·   The nutritional status of children will be improved through community-based
          interventions.

3.    PUBLIC EXPENDITURES REVIEW

      ·   Public Expenditures in the health sector were analyzed to ensure the consistency of
          public resource allocation with sectoral development policies and objectives.
      ·   Technical tools and analysis for improved financial management and budgetary policy
          development were provided to MOPH.
      ·   Policies were recommended for rationalizing the allocation of public funds and
          improving the efficiency of their use.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                                         Page 21


     ·   An Operations and Maintenance Study was financed to develop a standard
         methodology for estimating operational and maintenance budget of health facilities to
         substantiate recurrent budget needs.

4.   CIVIL SERVICE REFORM PROGRAM

     ·   At the initiation of the Civil Service Reform program, it was envisaged that the MOPH
         would participate as a pilot ministry, which was not pursued by the Bank. However,
         the work initiated has sensitized the MOPH to the needs to improve the management of
         its human resources. The European Commission (EC) will support this initiative.
     ·   The framework that was developed for other ministries can be used to improve the
         MOPH's capacity in defining their manpower needs to be consistent with its new role
         as well as in planning and developing its human resources.

5.   SOCIAL FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT

     ·   Financing for basic equipment and rehabilitation was provided to NGOs and
         community organizations that define needs and are able to deliver and manage basic
         health services, which is consistent with the DHS model.
     ·   Technical assistance to NGOs and government agencies is being provided in
         management capacity building.

6.   OTHER PROGRAMS

     ·   Public Works Projects (I and II). These projects financed the construction of health
         units and health centers based on community defined needs.
     ·   The Qat Study. A study on Qat and its impact on the economy, agriculture, and health
         was completed. At the request of the Government, this strategy will be used as a basis
         for the development of a national Qat control program, which will include specific
         actions to be taken to alleviate the impact of Qat on health in Yemen, a major public
         health concern.
     ·   National Health Accounts (NHA). This initiative provided the MOPH with a tool for
         more effective policy making that takes into account the flow of funds to the health
         sector and their utilization. It is a methodology for measuring and monitoring resource
         inputs, throughputs, and outcomes for the country as a whole. By combining all the
         resources for the sector (public and private), policy makers are better equipped to
         understand the effectiveness of their financial investments in the sector and to model
         the impact of alternative policy options.22
     ·   Strategies for EPI strengthening and its integration with public health programs.23
         This study is providing a strategy for strengthening the EPI program as well as
         integrating it with other public health programs such as reproductive health, malaria,
         and nutrition.



22 Yemen is one of eight countries in the region which participated in the preparation of National Health Accounts
   (NHAs) as part of a MNSHD managed regional initiative.

23 The study is financed by the Gates Foundation and will be finalized by April 2001.

H.    DONORS SUPPORT TO THE HEALTH SECTOR


External assistance accounted for about 25 percent of total health spending in the public sector in
1998. This amounted to US$33 million, two thirds of which was in the form of technical
assistance, 26 percent investment, and 9 percent for direct budget support.

Following is a presentation of the support provided by the key health sector development
partners. Other agencies such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the
World Food Program (WFP) provide indirect support to the health sector.

The Dutch Aide program. This program supports health, water, education, and agriculture
sectors with a total of US$5 million per year. In health, the current support is directed towards
reproductive health and pharmaceuticals. The future support will be mainly provided to health
sector reform as a sector wide approach program; however, the program focus and
implementation mechanism is not yet developed but it is expected to continue in line with the
current program and proposed Bank activities.

The European Commission. The EC program is directed towards supporting health sector
reform and is primarily focused on strengthening the role of the MOPH, particularly in human
resources development, in addition to implementing the district health system. The program will
be implemented over two phases, preparatory and support, in at least six districts and the MOPH
will be provided with technical support. The total budget is 6.7 million over five years.

World Health Organization. The WHO program in Yemen is composed of more than 30
projects covering a wide scope in the health sector ranging from health sector development,
policy planning and management to malaria, tuberculosis, and water supply and sanitation. The
total budget of the current three-year program is estimated at US$3.8 that support consultants,
training, seminars, fellowships, and equipment.

United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The health and nutrition
program of UNICEF comprises five projects namely, strengthening the EPI, control of Diarrheal
Diseases, control of ARI, safe motherhood, and nutrition. The focus of UNICEF program
implementation is Area Based Approach through community participation.             UNICEF core
funding for its current program (1999 - 2001) is estimated at US$15 million in addition to
another US$12 to co-finance the Bank's supported Child Development Project.

The German Technical Cooperation (GTZ). The GTZ supports the MOPH decentralization
plans and the current program level of funding is estimated at US$5 million to provide technical
assistance and training.

Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The program supports the EPI through the
provision of vaccines and strengthening of the cold chain system with a level of funding
estimated at US$2 million. Also, it supports the tuberculosis control program with a level of
funding estimated at ¥2.5 billion.

I.     FUTURE AREAS OF WORLD BANK SUPPORT


The Bank's ongoing assistance is helping the Government to refine and launch its reform
program. The next step is to support the reform's implementation. The MOPH took the
initiative to draft the reform strategy and the implementation of the first phase is being pursued
by the Government. Participating in this reform program presents a unique opportunity for the
Bank and other donors to build upon this enthusiasm and bring about fundamental, rather than
piecemeal, change.

1.     DESIGN PRINCIPLES

In preparing the next operation, the following guiding principles need to be considered during
the design stage.

Complementarity. There are a number of development partners who are actively involved in
supporting the health sector and the HSR program in particular. It is therefore crucial to analyze
carefully the partners' programs and establish a continuous dialog to avoid duplication and
ensure complementarity and synergism.           Unlike previous projects that supported vertical
programs or focused on a particular approach or geographic area and therefore did not require
much coordination, health sector reform is influencing all programs, systems, and service
delivery levels and affecting all population groups. Close coordination and collaboration with
the other development partners is a key for success.

Prioritization. The proposed MOPH HSR program is ambitious and comprehensive and the
sector challenges are numerous.       It is not therefore possible to resolve all of the sector's
problems during a single program. Keeping the overall HSR goals in mind, it is important to
identify and select the key priority interventions that would be financed by the Bank to ensure
the greatest impact and feasibility of implementation.

Phasing-In. Ensuring complementarity with partners and prioritization of interventions will not
be sufficient for two reasons. First, while most of the challenges facing the health sector have
been identified, not all the interventions to resolve them are known, so there will be a need to
experiment with pilots and new modalities. Second, the program complexity requires high
managerial capacity to manage it, which is not the current case at the MOPH. Therefore, a
phased-in approach for implementing the program should also be considered to develop both the
learning curve and the management capacity.

2.     PROGRAM GOAL AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

It is recognized that health sector reform is a continuous, dynamic and evolving process, and that
strategies may need to be reconsidered during implementation. At the outset, however, it is
important to have consensus on the vision in terms of where the sector would eventually be and
on the model in terms of what the sector will look like at the end of the program.

Based on the ongoing sector policy dialog, it is envisaged that, in 10 - 15 years, the following
will be the characteristics of the health sector. The role of the MOPH in the sector will be
redefined and its management structure reorganized where critical functions such as financial
management and human resources are strengthened and new functions such as quality assurance

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                          Page 24


and health information systems are introduced. Resource planning will be decentralized to the
governorate level while resource management will be decentralized to the district level where a
district health system would be operational. Allocation of resources will be more rational where
infrastructure, human resources mobilization, and budget allocation will adhere to specified
norms and standards and will consider all available resources (public and private) leading to
improvement in efficiency and equity of the health systems. In terms of service delivery, the
public service delivery system will focus on strengthening the secondary level of service (district
hospitals and health centers), rationalizing and providing more autonomy to large hospitals for
eventual phase out, and increasing community participation in financing and managing the
primary care facilities (health units) where appropriate. In terms of health services, the MOPH
will strengthen its public health programs through mobilizing (adding and/or shifting) resources
to cope with the increasing needs of the growing population.

It is important to stress however that it is not envisaged to address issues such as accreditation,
certification, licensing, health insurance, privatization, or private sector development during the
life span of this reform program.

Another dimension of the policy dialog is to address the program goal(s). Much of the ongoing
discussion within the MOPH and among donors on HSR is revolving around systems
improvement and efficiency gains. Yet, one should not forget that the ultimate goal of all health
systems is to improve the health status of the population. The success of the HSR should be
primarily judged by its impact on the population health status, then secondarily by its impact on
improving sector performance along the dimensions of efficiency, equity, quality, and
sustainability.

The overall goal of health sector reform should be to improve the health status of the population,
which would be reflected by a decrease in morbidity and mortality particularly from
communicable diseases among women and children in underserved areas. However, this should
not preclude, for operational reasons, the possibility of targeting non-communicable diseases,
entire families in some communities, or piloting a program in a well served area. Towards this
end, the Bank's program will have to support health service delivery and public health programs
and its program goal indicators should be clearly linked to the health interventions and confined
to the geographic areas supported by the Bank.

The strategic objectives of health sector reform should reflect an improvement of sector
performance as demonstrated by selected qualitative and quantitative indicators for improved
efficiency, equity, quality, and sustainability. For the Bank's program such indicators may
include, but not be limited to, improved efficiency in resource utilization, improved equity in the
allocation of public resources among governorates, increased availability of inputs for basic
health services, and increased decentralization of resource planning and management of
government services including increased participation of communities, NGOs, and local
organizations at the district level in the planning and resource mobilization activities.

3.     PROGRAM COMPONENTS AND PHASES

From an operational perspective, the health sector, conceptually, can be divided into two broad
components, the service delivery structure in which health services are being provided such as
hospitals and health centers, and the health management systems that support them such as

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                            Page 25


planning, information systems, human resources development, and financial management. In
this context, it is plausible to consider the following two components for the Bank's
involvement: Improving Sector Management and Strengthening Service Delivery.

It is envisaged to support these two components during a 10-year program divided into two
phases. The first phase will be for five years, extending from 2002 until 2006. This will overlap
with the end of GOY second five-year plan (2001 ­ 2005) and the beginning of the third five-
year plan (2006 ­ 2010). Also, this time frame coincides with the implementation plan of the
Child Development Project (CDP) that will provide critical support to primary health care
services at the community level and therefore will be complemented by the proposed support of
secondary level under the HSR to ensure continuity of care. During the last year of phase I
(2006) the design of phase II (2007 ­ 2011) will be initiated and guided by the lessons learned
from implementing the second five-year plan, the CDP, and the first phase of HSR and in line
with GOY third five-year plan.

The following section will provide a brief description of the two components and their elements
that may be considered for the Bank's support in the proposed 10-year program.

3.1   Improving Sector Management

Much of the failure in ensuring availability of health services to the population is attributed to the
lack of systems and management capacity. The need to strengthen MOPH's planning and
management capacity should therefore be an overarching theme of the reform program, and is
paramount to the success of the reform and the sector's long-term sustainability. To this effect,
the focus should be geared towards reforming the MOPH role and functions and decentralizing
operational management both internal and external to the MOPH organizational structure.

3.1.1 Reforming the role of MOPH and developing its systems

The role of MOPH in the management and delivery of services will be streamlined to focus on
priority sector management areas and divest itself from the direct delivery of some health
services such as tertiary health services. As such, the role of the MOPH would shift to focus on
the following functions: (i) policy analysis and development; (ii) strategic planning; (iii) sector
regulation and quality assurance; (iv) sector coordination with other government agencies and
development partners; (v) public health management; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation.
Implementing this shift in focus will require an institutional development approach that entails
three different analyses.   The systems analysis would lead to the revision of the existing
functions and responsibilities of the different MOPH departments and divisions and the creation
of new ones. The legal/structural analysis would suggest changes in the MOPH legal framework
and organizational structure consistent with the new MOPH roles and functions. The skill-gap
analysis would suggest strategies to bridge the technical and managerial gaps. In this context,
the following are the key systems that need to be targeted under the Bank's program.

·   Financial management. Developing financial policies and ensuring discipline in their
    implementation and how finances are managed are probably the most important of all the
    systems.   In this regard, there are three aspects that need to be addressed: (i) rational and
    equitable budget allocation, (ii) efficient use of allocated budget, and (iii) effective and
    transparent financial management procedures including management of cost-sharing

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                                       Page 26


  revenues and exemption policies. The Bank's support should build on the work that was
  previously undertaken: the National Health Accounts (NHA) and the Public Expenditures
  Review (PER). NHA provided a detailed analysis on total health spending, breakdowns by
  source and user, and flow of funds. PER provided concrete recommendations to: (i) increase
  the overall budget allocation for the health sector as a percent of total government budget;
  (ii) Prioritize public investments in health towards cost-effective and priority health
  interventions by rationalizing tertiary care hospitals, strengthening secondary/first referral
  hospital system, and strengthening the primary health care infrastructure particularly in
  under-serviced areas; and (iii) Rationalize the public current expenditures by containing the
  budget for salaries and wages, developing standards to ensure efficiency and equity in
  allocating the operations and maintenance budget, and expanding and institutionalizing the
  cost-sharing program.24 An Operations and Maintenance (O&M) study was also conducted
  to assist the MOPH in determining the O&M budget required for the basic health delivery
  structure. It is plausible to assume that the Bank will further pursue the NHA framework for
  reforming the health financing and ensure the implementation of the PER and O&M
  recommendations to restructure public financing of the health sector as well as the
  institutionalization of these processes within the MOPH structure and systems.

· Human Resources Development. The reform framework for human resources management
  will be guided by the principles and guidelines developed under the Civil Service
  Modernization Program (CSMP), currently underway at the government level, which aims at
  having fewer, equitably distributed, better paid, and more qualified human capital. The EC
  may provide support to this element; however, its scope is not yet determined. In such case,
  the Bank would support human resources development in the second phase while ensuring
  very close coordination with the EC during the first phase of the program. Support will be
  needed to assist the MOPH in: i) developing staffing norms and standards for different types
  of health facilities, ii) developing short-term strategies to adjust the size and distribution of
  the workforce to ensure efficiency and equity in human resource allocation; iii) developing
  medium-term strategies to adjust the composition of the workforce to make it both
  responsive to the priority health needs and appropriate for effective health sector
  performance; iv) improving the skills of the workforce through management training and
  continued medical education, v) improving the work conditions particularly for service
  providers in remote or underserved areas; and vi) improving the information systems on
  human resources to support policy and strategic decisions.

· Health Infrastructure Planning. The health infrastructure will require the development of
  policies and institutionalization of systems to rationalize its proliferation by adopting
  investment planning based on priority population health needs.                         This will require the
  development of master plans at the national, governorate, and district levels, to map health
  infrastructure, identify duplication and gaps, and determine norms and standards for different
  types of health facilities based on available resources and population health needs. Priority,
  however, should be given to district master plans in order to support the district health


24The objectives of the cost-sharing program are to improve accountability to the community (since they will be
  making an investment in service delivery), and secure supplemental funds for improving maintenance, the
  supply of drugs, and providing appropriate incentives to health personnel. Revenues will be retained and used
  at the point of service delivery which will require an effective system to monitor the use of funds.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                       Page 27


  system. In the first couple of years of HSR program implementation, the MOPH may need to
  establish a moratorium on construction of new large hospitals and focus its capital
  investment budget on rehabilitating the existing infrastructure until the master plans are
  completed. The infrastructure development should be consistent with the new MOPH role in
  service delivery in which the district hospital will be the backbone of the public service
  delivery structure. Details on strengthening the service delivery are provided below.

· Infrastructure and Medical Equipment Maintenance.            Maintenance systems had been
  ineffective in maintaining the large investments made by the government and donors in
  infrastructure and medical equipment. On the one hand, attempts to strengthen the current
  MOPH maintenance systems were not effective and the approaches to outsource these
  services were strongly resented. However, the sustainability of capital investments will be
  always questionable unless the maintenance systems are addressed. It will be therefore
  critical to develop modalities for the maintenance systems that will balance these views.
  Outsourcing may be a plausible option, however, further assessment will be needed and its
  cost-effectiveness demonstrated on a pilot basis.

· Drug and Medical Supply. The availability of drugs and medical supplies is a key input for
  quality care. The recently established quasi-autonomous Drug Fund, partly supported by the
  Family Health Project, will be responsible for pharmaceuticals logistics management
  including procurement, storage, and distribution. Under the reform program, the Fund will
  assume responsibility for all aspects of drug and medical supply management. The Fund is
  also currently supported by the Dutch. The role of the Bank should be therefore carefully
  considered in light of the future support provided by the Dutch.

· Quality Assurance. The need for improving the quality of public and private health services
  is undeniable.    However, the development of facility accreditation system, professional
  licensing, adoption of clinical protocols, and implementing medical audits require extensive
  resources and strong management capacity which cannot be realized in the medium-term.
  The support to the MOPH will need therefore to focus on initiating a quality assurance
  program.      This may include the development of a national quality assurance strategy
  followed by piloting the development of clinical standards and protocols for essential health
  services provided at the district level.

· Health Management Information Systems. The development of an effective HMIS will be
  critical to the success of the MOPH new roles and functions. Three basic systems will need
  to be considered. The Management Information Systems will support policy development,
  strategic planning, and management decisions of the above MOPH functions such as
  financial management, human resources development, and infrastructure planning. Health
  Information Systems will support disease surveillance, collection and analysis of basic
  morbidity and mortality health indicators, and service utilization.          The Geographic
  Information System will provide a practical tool for resource planning and allocation. In this
  regard, it is important to consider simple and basic systems to ensure the feasibility of
  implementation and sustainability.

· Public Health Programs. The MOPH will need to strengthen its management of public
  health, as this is its primary role in the sector.      The focus should be on: i) priority

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                               Page 28


    communicable diseases such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, malaria, hepatitis, and
    tuberculosis; ii) public health programs such as immunization, malnutrition, family planning,
    and reproductive health; and iii) other causes of child and maternal morbidity and mortality.
    At the MOPH central level, a division for public health programs needs to be created and the
    management and technical capacity in these public health programs enhanced. At the service
    delivery level, services should be integrated into a package of basic health services to ensure
    efficiency and horizontal continuity of care. Furthermore, a strong health education program
    focusing on communication for behavior change is to be initiated to increase health
    awareness and improve health- seeking behavior.

3.1.2 Decentralizing operational management

Decentralization in the health sector is occurring within the context of the overall Government
program, which is delegating some governance functions down to the district level through a
newly passed local authority law.25 The by-laws will be issued by the end of year 2000 and will
be executed in the mid-year of 2001. Within the health sector, limited decentralization of
financial responsibility to the governorate level began in 1995. The MOPH is envisaging
expanding decentralization further down to the district level in the context of the District Health
System model and further out to service delivery structures in the context of the hospital
autonomy program. Decentralization from the MOPH central level can be made to four different
structures: the large specialized hospitals (hospital autonomy), the governorate health offices, the
district health offices, and the community organizations. Decentralization may take several
forms such as deconcentration, delegation, and devolution.                   Deconcentration entails the
decentralization of certain authorities and hence responsibilities downward within the hierarchy,
e.g., from MOPH central level to MOPH governorate level.                        Delegation denotes the
decentralization of certain management responsibilities downward within the hierarchy.
Devolution involves the decentralization of certain authorities and responsibilities downward and
outward to structures outside the hierarchy, e.g., from MOPH central level to local
municipalities.

·   Large Hospitals (Hospital Autonomy). Under a hospital autonomy program, any of the three
    forms of decentralization may be selected. Currently, the two autonomous hospitals in Sanaa
    are operating under the delegation form where only management responsibilities are
    decentralized. For these two hospitals, more control on resource allocation and utilization
    may be deconcentrated and furthermore, the governance function may be devolved to an
    overseeing hospital board. For the MOPH specialized and governorate hospitals, it is not
    envisaged to pursue a more decentralized form than delegation, given the limited
    management capacity and resources available at the level of these hospitals. In addition, the
    complexity of designing and implementing a hospital autonomy program may dictate the
    postponement of supporting such initiative to the second phase of the Bank's program.

·   Governorate Health Offices. Some of the planning, financial management, human resources,
    and information systems functions may be deconcentrated to the governorate level. The
    implementation of the new local authority law will determine the level of authority and
    responsibility decentralized to the governorate level. Until this is established, it is suggested
    to confine the Bank's support to a number of governorates where management capacity will

25  Law No. (4) of 2000 concerning the local authority issued in August 2000.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                           Page 29


    be strengthened and systems developed at the central level be replicated with adaptation at
    the governorate level, e.g., health management information systems.

·   District Health Offices. These constitute the lowest administrative level in the MOPH
    organizational structure and they are the focus of resource management in the District Health
    System model. However, this is the weakest level in terms of management capacity and
    resource availability. On the one hand, it is realistic to consider the delegation of most of the
    management responsibilities to the district level within the context of the District Health
    System. On the other, the current district level management will need to be restructured, its
    capacity extensively strengthened and adequate resources mobilized to enable the carryout of
    these management responsibilities.          The Bank's program should therefore focus on
    strengthening the management structure and capacity, possibly following the GTZ model,
    before considering systems development. Again, the support should be confined to selected
    districts within the selected governorates during the first phase of the program.

·   Community Organizations.       As many of the MOPH health units are dysfunctional, there is a
    need to develop modalities to devolve the management of these health units to local
    communities. It is expected that the CDP would develop such modalities and the Bank's
    support may not be necessary except to replicate such modalities in the districts not covered
    by the CDP.

3.2   Strengthening Service Delivery

Strengthening service delivery entails the support of a package of basic health services provided
at different health facilities by ensuring the availability of required resources such as human,
financial, equipment, supplies, and drugs to operate effectively. The long-term strategy to
strengthening the MOPH health delivery system is to focus on and shift public resources to the
district level. Specifically, the shift will be downward from the specialized and general hospitals
and upward from the rural hospitals and health units to district hospitals, so that the latter
become the backbone of the service delivery structure. This is however a long way to go, given
the small number and limited geographic distribution of the district hospitals. This long-term
strategy would therefore need to be complemented by short and medium term strategies that deal
with the inefficiencies and the lack of continuity of care while the infrastructure master plans are
being developed. Meanwhile, construction of new health facilities should be also restrained until
the master plans are completed and that the DHS model is proven to be operational.

3.2.1 Specialized and General Hospitals

There are 12 specialized and 18 general hospitals. The general strategy is to maintain the status
quo of most of these hospitals in terms of infrastructure and financial resources during the first
phase of the program and eventually to phase them out of the MOPH support to become
autonomous during the second phase. Conceptually, interventions at that level may be targeting
three selected types of hospitals. A few hospitals with diversified health services and high case-
load, that are located in densely-populated urban areas with reasonable ability to pay may be
identified to pilot different hospital autonomy models, thus reducing the management and
financial burden on the government. In governorates where many districts do not have district
hospitals, the general hospital may be considered for support.            Other hospitals that are
overstaffed, given their resource level and utilization pattern, may be targeted for shifting staff

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                             Page 30


through incentive mechanisms to district hospitals, particularly in governorates that have good
coverage with district hospitals. However, specific HSR interventions at the level of specialized
and general hospitals, in general, should be delayed to the second phase of the program until the
end of phase one to obtain some indications with regard to the operationability and impact of the
DHS model and to complete the development of the infrastructure master plans which should
include strategies for hospital rationalization.

3.2.2 District Hospitals

District hospitals exist only in 41 out of 285 districts and they vary in bed size, staffing, and
functions.    In line with the proposed HSR/DHS model, the district hospitals should be
strengthened in order to become the backbone of the MOPH service delivery structure. The
scope of health services provided at the level of district hospitals will need to be defined.
Accordingly, the district hospitals will be rehabilitated and equipped for essential health services,
which can be supported by the Bank and/or other donors.                   However, this should be
commensurate with mobilizing adequate human and financial resources from MOPH to operate
these hospitals. Failure to secure staffing and a reasonable level of O&M will defeat the purpose
of rehabilitating and equipping these hospitals and will lead to failure of the entire DHS model.

Short-term strategies can be adopted to compensate for the lack of district hospitals in many
districts by strengthening the service delivery capacity at either the general hospital or more
importantly the rural hospitals and/or health centers as detailed below.

One of the options that may be considered in selecting the district hospitals to be supported under
the HSR program is to operate in the CDP districts. The CDP health interventions are focused at
the interface between the community and the health unit level (and selected health centers). The
support to the district hospitals will complement the CDP interventions and may have a
synergistic impact on the health status in these districts.

3.2.3 Rural Hospitals and Health Centers

There are 30 rural hospitals, with an average number of 23 beds, and 517 health centers.
International experience has demonstrated that small-sized hospitals, below 40 beds, are
inefficient and provide poor quality of services. The Bank has already recommended to the
MOPH to phase-out these hospitals either by downgrading them to health centers (closing down
the inpatient facility) or upgrading them to district hospitals in selected districts, which should be
confirmed by the master plans.

The health centers should be strengthened to represent the first line of physician-provided
medical services and to complement the district hospitals. In districts where there are no district
hospitals, the health centers may be strengthened with specialty services to compensate for this
deficiency, where feasible. To this effect, the provision of some non-equipped ambulances in
selected health centers may be piloted only to transfer patients in critical conditions to the nearest
district or general hospital.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                            Page 31


3.2.4 Health Units

There exist an estimated number of 1,559 health units, mostly dysfunctional as explained earlier.
It is not feasible to rely on a continued support from the MOPH to all health units due to many
constraints. Therefore, there will be a need to develop modalities for community involvement in
the management of these units. It is expected that the CDP will develop models that will focus
primarily on the community co-management of these units, in which case, the MOPH will
continue to maintain responsibility of these units.

Further research may be needed to explore the international experience in the devolution of
health services management to the community. One would think of a model where the MOPH
would agree with a local community that the MOPH will build/rehabilitate the health unit, both
MOPH and the community will operate the facility for a period of time, then the MOPH will
transfer all resource mobilization and management responsibilities to the community with no
further or very minimal MOPH sustaining support. This is a devolution model that can be
termed "Build, Cooperate, and Transfer or Sustain".

Until concrete successful modalities are established, MOPH should be restrained from
constructing new health units to avoid further inefficiency in its service delivery structure.

4.    PRIORITIES AND RATIONALE FOR PHASE I

The above constitutes the operational framework of program interventions for Bank's support
during the proposed 10-year program. One of the lessons learned in implementing health
projects in Yemen, though, is the limited management capacity to handle many interventions. It
is therefore necessary to determine the priority elements, within the above framework, which
should be addressed during the first phase (2002 ­ 2006) of the program. The rationale for
selecting these elements is also discussed but it is largely determined by the Bank's comparative
advantage and lack of support by other donors to these elements.

Component I: Improving Sector Management

·   Element 1: Reforming the MOPH role and developing its systems. There were eight
    systems proposed for reform; the following four should be considered for the first phase:

        Financial management: this constitutes the starting point in improving efficiency and
        equity in allocation and utilization of health resources. The size and distribution of the
        work force, the operations and maintenance of health facilities, and the size and type of
        health infrastructure are all determined through the budget allocation process and
        expenditures review. This is further justified by the Bank's comparative advantage, over
        other donors, in this area and its extensive involvement with GOY in budget restructuring
        and public expenditures reviews. The Bank is therefore in a strong position to help the
        MOPH in its dialog with the MOF to streamline the budget process and improve financial
        transparency.

        Health Infrastructure Planning: much of the inequity and inefficiency in the system is
        due to the unplanned proliferation of health infrastructure resulting in "sunk investments"
        and underutilized resources. Very little can be hoped from HSR if the inefficiency of

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                         Page 32


        both the existing and planned infrastructure is not addressed.       The Bank has been
        involved in the last few years in supporting the rationalization of MOPH infrastructure in
        addition to providing extensive feedback on the MOPH capital investment program
        proposed for the second five-year plan (2001 ­ 2005). This role is highly appreciated and
        endorsed by the MOPD.

        Health Management Information Systems: information is considered the backbone of
        all other systems.      Financial management, human resources development, and
        infrastructure planning will require valid information for management decision-making.
        Similarly, to monitor the health status, one would need reliable data on morbidity and
        mortality as well as health services utilization for needs and gaps identification and
        impact evaluation. In addition, there are no other donors planning to be involved in
        supporting this area.

        Public Health programs: given the health transition stage in Yemen, reforming the
        public health programs should be a high priority because it can have a direct rapid impact
        on the health status of the population through adopting cost effective interventions. In
        Yemen, several donors support either vertical programs such as WHO, UNICEF, and
        UNFPA or health services in geographically focused areas such as the Dutch Aid and the
        EC.    There is no systematic support provided to MOPH central level, hence the
        opportunity for the Bank to develop and support a national strategy for integrated
        management of public health programs.

·   Element 2: Decentralizing operational management. The newly passed law on local
    authority and its by­laws, to be issued, will determine the type and level of decentralization
    that the Bank will support. Until the new law is actually implemented, the Bank can focus in
    the first two years (2002 ­ 2003) on supporting the central level of the MOPH in the
    development of the four systems, i.e., financial management, infrastructure planning,
    information systems, and public health programs. Meanwhile an assessment of the needs of
    the governorate and district health offices will be conducted based on the implementation of
    the new local authority law. Later in phase I, support to the governorate and district health
    offices will be provided in the four systems above. Anyway, the support will be confined
    geographically to those governorates and districts where service delivery is supported by the
    Bank.

Component II: Strengthening Service Delivery

Support during the first phase will be focused on strengthening the first referral level by
upgrading the infrastructure of district hospitals and health centers through rehabilitation and
equipment provision in support of essential/basic heath services in selected pilot districts,
preferably where CDP is active to ensure complementarity.

It is assumed that the package of basic health services (inpatient and outpatient) would be
provided at the level of district hospital and only the outpatient health services provided at the
level of health center. A fundamental prerequisite of infrastructure upgrading is therefore the
development of the basic health services package which would be addressed under the public
health program element as this will drive the infrastructure requirements at both levels.

Yemen Health Sector Strategy Note                                                           Page 33



·   Element 1: District Hospitals.         During the first phase, the Bank would support the
    rehabilitation of approximately 10 - 12 district hospitals and the provision of medical
    equipment and supplies to upgrade the level of health services and ensure the effectiveness of
    health services delivery. As indicated earlier, this support may entail the provision of
    ambulances to transport patients in critical conditions from the contiguous health centers to
    the district hospital or from the district to the governorate hospitals.

·   Element 2: Health Centers. Similarly, it is proposed to support the rehabilitation of
    approximately 15 ­ 20 health centers and the provision of medical equipment and supplies to
    upgrade the level of health services and ensure the effectiveness of health services delivery.

The above provides a framework for the Bank's strategy in supporting the Health Sector Reform
program in Yemen. The next steps would require a continuous sector dialog with GOY and
other health development partners to further refine and detail the above components to be
supported by the Bank, develop the detailed cost estimates of the different elements, and prepare
an implementation plan.

The strategy reveals the exigency for supporting the health needs of the Yemeni people, which
are undeniable.     The challenge remains however in the implementation approaches and
arrangements, which would determine the success in addressing the population health needs.
