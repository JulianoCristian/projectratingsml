For these\n            reasons, the Ministry of Health has taken initiatives to\n            address environmental issues associated with hospitals, and\n            health clinics, and, in participation among the\n            country's existing agencies, the Bank - based on its\n            environmental policy guidelines, and technical assistance\n            provisions - supports this environmental management plan\n            (EMP) and the following mitigation measures. The\n            rehabilitation design of hospitals, and health centers will\n            take into account the generation of hazardous wastes, which\n            should comply with safe collection, and disposal measures,\n            while related staff should receive training to ensure\n            compliance, as prescribed by the operations manual that sets\n            the procedures, and protocols that govern the work place.\n            Moreover, an environmental impact assessment will be\n            implemented for each hospital and clinic, to determine the\n            feasibility of either off-site or on-site disposal. This\n            entails consideration of incinerators for on-site disposal\n            of contaminated wastes, ensuring air pollution control, or,\n            disposal at existing municipal facilities. Selected waste\n            disposal sites will be located for wastes that should not\n            undergo incineration, in cooperation with the local EPA.\n            Likewise solid wastes would be disposed of at selected\n            sites, or recycled as possible. Drainage of chemical\n            substances not subject to biological degradation, will be\n            treated and disposed of separately; clear sewage will\n            undergo anaerobic treatment, to be disposed of in\n            percolation pits; and, waste management will be privately contracted."}, "docdt": "2002-01-21T14:03:03Z"}
