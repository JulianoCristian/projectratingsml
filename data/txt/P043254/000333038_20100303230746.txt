1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

1.1.1 At the time of appraisal, Yemen was at an early stage of its health system
(epidemiological and demographic) transition, with morbidity and mortality rates from
communicable diseases dominating those from non-communicable diseases and a high
total fertility rate (TFR). The most prevalent conditions were diarrheal diseases,
malnutrition, acute respiratory infections, complications of pregnancy, and malaria.
Chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and injuries, were also on the rise. Health
outcomes were extremely poor.

1.1.2 Between 1992 and 1997, TFR declined from 7.7 to 6.5 children per woman, the
infant mortality rate decreased from 103 to 75 live births, and the under-five mortality
rate went from 137 to 105 live births. Adult mortality, total fertility and maternal
mortality rates were among the highest in the Middle East and North Africa region.
Yemen was also one of the few countries in the region where under-nutrition was a major
problem, particularly among children with about 50 percent of them malnourished and
stunted. Communicable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis posed a significant
burden of disease. While limited information was available on the epidemiological
situation of HIV/AIDS in Yemen, it was of growing concern. Among Sexually
Transmitted Diseases (STD) clinic patients, HIV prevalence among patients tested
increased from 2 percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 1997. In 1998, 3 percent of STD clinic
patients tested were HIV positive. Population growth, at 3.6 percent per year (1998), was
among the highest in the world, family planning activities were minimal, and the use of
modern contraceptives was particularly low at 10 percent. The situation was compounded
by the wide regional disparities and the significant differences between urban and rural
conditions.

1.1.3 Yemen faced major challenges in improving the health status of its population,
including:

   a. Lack of efficiency in the allocation and use of public funds in the health sector,
      with excessive centralization of resource management, allocations not based on
      needs, excessive infrastructure investments mostly focused on tertiary care in
      urban areas, very low budgets for operations and maintenance, and very low
      utilization rates. The basic inputs needed at the facility level for providing proper
      care were not available.

   b. Lack of accessibility to health services, with physical access limited by lack of
      transportation, rough geographic terrain, and a dysfunctional health infrastructure,
      financial access limited by the level of fees and co-payments, and also limited
      access for women because of social constraints in traditional communities. Less

                                             1
      than half of the population, particularly those living in the rural areas, had access
      to basic health services.
   c. Lack of quality of health services: the quality of services was poor, particularly in
      the public sector, due to many factors (inadequate inputs, poor maintenance of
      facilities and equipment, lack of continuity of care, and low morale of service
      providers).

   d. Lack of institutional capacity and financial viability: the institutional framework
      of the health sector was overly centralized, poorly coordinated and weak, and the
      financial viability was uncertain because of the rising costs of health care, low
      public spending overall, high out-of-pocket spending (59 percent of total spending
      and 3 percent of household income), and the lack of risk-pooling arrangements
      such as formal social insurance coverage.

1.1.4 In response to the above challenges, in 1998, the Ministry of Public Heath and
Population (MOPHP) launched a comprehensive sector reform initiative aimed at
improving equity, quality, efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility, and long-term
sustainability of health services. The MOPHP's health reform program had nine
components: (i) decentralization of planning, decision making, and financial
management; (ii) redefinition of the role of the public sector with a stronger emphasis on
policy, regulation, and public health, and the establishment of limits on its role as service
provider; (iii) district health system approach; (iv) community co-management of health
systems; (v) cost sharing; (vi) essential drugs policy, and realignment of the logistics
system for drugs and medical supplies; (vii) decentralized, outcome-based management
system from the central to the community level; (viii) hospital autonomy and eventual
basic health facility autonomy; and (ix) encouragement of responsible participation by
the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGO) through appropriate policy
design regulation. The MOPHP's health reform program was to take place in two phases:
(i) an initiation phase in which all key aspects of the reform would be launched, lessons
would be learned, key legislation would be passed, district health systems would be put in
place in at least 40 percent of districts, revisions of the financial system would be
initiated, and major actors would be brought on board; and (ii) a consolidation phase in
which the lessons learned in the initiation phase could be fashioned into long-term
systems, policies and regulations, and the remainder of the districts could be brought into
the health district system.

1.1.5 The Health Reform Support Project (HRSP) was initially conceived and the Project
Concept Document (PCD) approved as an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) in support
of the broad-based MOPHP health reform program. But after further discussions with
Government officials, it was decided to adopt a more realistic approach and proceed with
a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) which would support the "initiation phase" of the
MOPHP health reform program. The project would constitute a transition between the
IDA-financed Family Health Project (FHP), building on lessons learned, and a more
comprehensive future project.




                                             2
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

1.2.1 According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Project Development
Objectives (PDOs) were to: (i) increase access for women and children to a package of
integrated maternal and child health services provided in district hospitals and health
centers in selected districts; and (ii) improve the effectiveness of national public health
programs and the resource allocation within the public health sector in Yemen.

1.2.2 Although there were some discrepancies between the main text and Annex 1 of the
PAD, the key outcome/impact indicators to be achieved by 2006/2007 can be listed as
follows:

   a) Improved maternal and child health as reflected by an increase of 10 percent in
      birth deliveries attended in district hospitals and health centers in intervention
      areas;
   b) Increased accessibility as reflected by an increase in utilization of health services
      in district hospitals in the selected districts;
   c) Increased health knowledge as reflected by an increase in the intention of
      currently married women to use family planning (increase of 5 percent for modern
      contraceptive methods according to Annex 1 of the PAD); and
   d) Improved resource allocation as reflected by an increase of Operations and
      Maintenance (O&M) share of total MOPHP expenditures (an increase of 6
      percent for non-salary recurrent expenditures according to Annex 1 of the PAD).

1.2.3 The baseline data for the above-mentioned indicators were not available and,
therefore, were not included in the PAD.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

1.3.1 When the Project was restructured in June 2006, the PDOs were revised to read as
follows: (i) to improve access to and quality of priority national family health and
reproductive health programs; and (ii) to develop the capacity of the Ministry of Public
Health and Population (MOPHP) to manage, plan, and deliver basic health services and
priority public health programs at the central level and in eight selected districts in the
three targeted governorates.

1.3.2 The project had to be restructured because the original project design was too
ambitious and unrealistic, overestimating the capacity of the MOPHP at the time. There
was also a lack of ownership and commitment on the part of the Ministry. The
decentralization of health services and the integration of care at the local level which
were included in the reform program could not be carried out. The restructuring
emphasized strengthening what was already working, such as the selected vertical
programs. The following key indicators were selected: (i) immunization coverage; (ii)
percentage of women using modern family planning methods; (iii) percentage of

                                            3
expenditures spent on operation and maintenance (non salary); (iv) availability of
insecticide treated nets (ITN) in malaria intervention areas; and (v) availability of priority
maternal and child health programs in the intervention areas.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

1.4 1 The project's target population or "project beneficiaries" included the following
three categories:

   a. About 1.5 million Yemenis, particularly children (under the age of 5) and women
      in reproductive age (15 - 45) who will benefit from improved health services in
      the selected districts;
   b. All Yemenis who will benefit from the national malaria and health education
      programs; and
   c. MOPHP staff who will benefit from the capacity building activities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 The original project included the following three components:

Project Component 1 - US$20.57 million - Strengthening Health Service Delivery

The objective of this component was to strengthen the operational management at the
district level and the delivery of a Package of Integrated Maternal and Child (PIMAC)
Health Services in about 8 district hospitals and approximately 16 health centers in 8
districts within 4 governorates, which will serve approximately 1.5 million Yemenis.

Sub-component 1.1: Decentralized Operational Management (US$1.03 million). The
objective of this sub-component was to improve management systems and procedures at
the level of the Governorate and District Health Offices in the selected
governorates/districts in support of decentralization of resource management in order to
have an operational District Health System (DHS) in accordance with the Local
Authority Law.

Sub-component 1.2: Provision of a Package of Integrated Maternal and Child Health
Services ­ PIMAC (US$19.54 million).The PIMAC health services would be built on the
clinical service delivery elements of Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses
(IMCI) and expanded reproductive health services including Family Planning and
Essential Obstetric Care (EmOC). This sub-component would support the effective
delivery of the PIMAC health services in 8 district hospitals and approximately 16 health
centers in 8 districts, including the development of clinical standards and upgrading the
skills of health care providers.



                                              4
Project Component 2 - US$3.74 million - Strengthening Public Health Programs

The objective of this component was to improve the effectiveness of public health
programs by strengthening two critical programs, namely, malaria and health education.

Sub-component 2.1: Malaria (US$2.20 million). The objective of this sub-component
was to strengthen the activities of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), which
are consistent with the goals of the global Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative. This sub-
component would be implemented by the NMCP and the National Center for
Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance in close collaboration with WHO.

Sub-component 2.2: Health Education (US$1.54 million). The objective of this sub-
component was to strengthen health education in order to improve the effectiveness of
public health programs by: (i) increasing the demand for PIMAC health services; (ii)
increasing public awareness about priority public health programs; and (iii) changing
selected key behaviors that can have a substantial effect on the health of the population,
especially mothers and children.

Project Component 3 - US$5.29 million - Improving Health Systems Management

The objective of this component was to improve the MOPHP's capacity in the effective
allocation and efficient use of available resources.

Sub-component 3.1: Health Finance and Management (US$1.73 million). The objective
of this sub-component was to support human resources development in the areas of
financial analysis and health systems management.

Sub-component 3.2: Health Management Information System (US$2.49 million). This
sub-component would support the development of three subsystems: (i) a Management
Decision Support System (MDSS) to improve resource allocation; (ii) a Health
Information System (HIS) to collect and analyze utilization and disease prevalence data;
and (iii) a Geographic Information System (GIS) to present the data graphically.

Sub-component 3.3: Credit Administration and Project Coordination (US$1.07 million).
This sub-component would finance the Credit Administration Unit (CAU), which would
be responsible for project financial and procurement management and for supporting the
Steering Committee (SC) and Project Coordination Committee (PCC).

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 At restructuring in June 2006, Schedule 2 of the DCA was amended in its entirety,
revising the components as follows:




                                            5
Component 1 - Improvement of National Family Health and Reproductive Health
Programs

Sub-component 1.1 - Decentralized Operational Management (DOM). Improving the
management systems and procedures of central, Governorate and district health offices in
support of the decentralization of resource management required for establishing an
operational district health system in accordance with the Local Authorities Law.

Sub-component 1.2 - Delivery of a Package of National Health Programs and Basic
Health Services. Supporting the delivery of national health programs and basic health
services in district hospitals and health centers, including: (a) upgrading the skills of
health care providers; (b) the provision of drugs, medical supplies and medical
equipment; (c) the provision of reproductive health/family planning supplies and
implementation of the vaccination program; and (d) the rehabilitation of about eight (8)
district hospitals and about ten (10) health centers in eight (8) districts within the Ibb,
Sanaa and Hodeida Governorates.

Component 2 - Capacity Building

Sub-component 2.1 ­ Malaria. (a) Strengthening the national malaria control program
activities by building the capacity of about seven referral laboratories; (b) Improving
malaria integrated vector management in high-risk and epidemic-prone areas, including:
(i) promotion of personal protection measures; (ii) residual house spraying; and (iii) use
of insecticide treated materials.

Sub-component 2.2 - Health Education: Strengthening the institutional capacity of the
national health education and information center (NHEIC) to develop and implement the
national health education program.

Sub-component 2.3 - Health Finance and Management. (a) Supporting the development
of human resources in the areas of financial analysis by: (i) conducting public
expenditures reviews to improve resource allocation; (ii) preparing national health
accounts to provide detailed analysis on total health spending in public and private sector;
and (iii) the preparation of health insurance studies to assess the feasibility of developing
a health insurance program. (b) Developing health management by supporting the
national center for health management training.

Sub-component 2.4 - Health Management Information System (HMIS). Developing a
health management information system, including: (a) a management decision support
system; (b) a health information system; and (c) a GIS.

Management Unit (PMU) of the Public Works Project (PWP) to carry out their
responsibilities under the Project.

                                             6
1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

1.7.1 When the Project was restructured in June 2006, the following key changes were
introduced: (i) the responsibility for implementing the civil works and the procurement of
medical equipment and furniture was entrusted to the Project Management Unit (PMU)
of the Bank-financed Public Works Project (PWP); (ii) the decision was made to contract
UN Agencies to procure drugs, vehicles and medical supplies; and (iii) there was a
reallocation of the proceeds of the IDA Credit between categories to reflect the foreign
exchange variations and the agreed-upon shifts between the various sub-components.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

2.1.1 At the time the Project was prepared and appraised, the Bank's HNP strategy had
evolved to include support for reform programs, which led to the financing of health
reform projects in a number of countries. The HRSP was originally designed to support
implementation of the 1998 Health Sector Reform Program which emphasized the
development of a district health system model. This model implied a strengthening of
management at the local level and decentralizing administration. However, there was a
lack of clarity about the country-wide decentralization program and its implications for
the health services. The project design was too ambitious, and turned out to be unrealistic
because it overestimated the capacity of the MOPHP at the time. Apart from the
decentralization uncertainties, a centrally-managed integration of services would have
required fundamental changes in the way the Ministry operates with respect to staffing,
incentives and the relationships between the centre, the governorates and the districts.

2.1.2 The PDOs were clear, but implementation mechanisms were not. The design
envisaged an initiation phase (to be supported by the project), to be followed by a
consolidation phase. But, even for the first year of implementation of the initiation phase,
there was no detailed implementation manual indicating clearly for each sub-component
and activity: what has to be done? How much would it cost? Who should be doing it?
And when does it have to be done?

2.1.3 At the time the Project was submitted to the Bank's Board of Directors, it was not
ready for implementation. The quality at entry is rated "Unsatisfactory."

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)




                                             7
2.2 1 With respect to the key factors affecting implementation and outcomes, one has to
distinguish between the project period before the May/June 2005 mid-term review
(MTR) and the project period after the mid-term review (MTR).

Before the mid-term review (MTR)

2.2.2 As mentioned earlier, there were problems with the Health Sector Reform Program
and decentralization, and the project itself was not prepared for implementation. In
addition, there were weaknesses in the management of some units of the MOPHP,
including the Credit Administration Unit (CAU) which was headed at the beginning by
an Administrator with a good academic background but limited experience in project
management. Also, it took some time for the financial management and procurement
specialists of the CAU to become familiar with Bank guidelines and requirements.

2.2.3 The reform program, which emphasized decentralization of health services and
integration of care at the local level, was not launched in earnest due to capacity
constraints and lack of commitment, particularly after a change in MOPHP leadership.
The district health system model which was to be applied to integrate health services at
the district level was never adopted. Instead, programs continued to be managed centrally
and implemented vertically. Because the HRSP was not ready for implementation and
probably too sophisticated for the capacity of the MOPHP at the time, implementation of
the project was difficult and slow from the beginning. In the first three years, only a few
of the smaller activities were implemented in a timely manner (e.g., malaria control and
health financing activities). However, implementation of the largest component of the
project, the provision of a package of integrated maternal and child (PIMAC) health
services, was very slow. The districts to be covered under the PIMAC program were only
selected in October 2004 ­ 18 months after the project was launched; this caused delays
in the completion of needs assessments and the contracting of consultants to manage the
civil works and the medical equipment program.

2.2.4 It should be recognized that during project implementation, the environment was
not favorable to integration of care at the local level. In 2004, the General Directorate of
Reproductive Health became a sector within the ministry with its own Deputy Minister.
Donors became more interested in financing that sector. Also, the very substantial
financing provided by the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis
reinforced the importance of vertical programs in health service delivery.

2.2.5 The project's mid-term review (MTR) in May/June 2005 was an impressive
exercise carried out jointly by the Government and the Bank. Activities which had not
progressed were downsized and detailed action plans were prepared for the activities
which remained.

After the mid-term review (MTR)

2.2.6 All the relevant Government Ministries (the MOPPH, but also the Ministry of
Finance - MOF and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation - MOPIC)

                                             8
were committed to implement the agreed findings and recommendations of the MTR.
Nevertheless, although some targets were met, implementation in general did not proceed
as planned. In response, the Government and the Bank agreed in early 2006 to accelerate
project implementation through the introduction of a Rapid Results Approach (RRA)
with workshops attended by all relevant stakeholders, and to further streamline project
activities. The risk that the Bank and donors might reduce their financing to Yemen
because of the bad performance of the portfolio (including this project) was taken
seriously by the Government. A new Administrator with the right experience and
leadership qualities was appointed to head the CAU, and changes were made in the
management of some other departments of the Ministry. Decisions were made regarding
the contracting of UN Agencies to procure drugs, vehicles, contraceptives, etc. and the
outsourcing of civil works and the procurement of equipment to the Project Management
Unit (PMU) of the Bank-financed Public Works Project (PWP). In June 2006, the project
was formally restructured; the PDOs and the program of activities were revised,
performance indicators were refined and funds were reallocated.

2.2.7 Annex 10 presents a detailed assessment of the RRA exercise1. RRA is a
methodology that empowers teams to achieve results quickly ­ in 100 days. It is also a
way of thinking about making large scale change happen incrementally. The exercise was
carried out with the full support and direct involvement of the Minister and senior staff of
the MOPHP, helping it to succeed by fostering a commitment to results from
stakeholders at all levels. The champions that led the process forward played an
important role in the overall capacity building and institutional reform within the
Ministry through the application of several rounds of RRA workshops and the activities
in between. Also, the support provided by the Bank, both in terms of the involvement of
staff with the appropriate expertise and in terms of the availability of funds, was crucial
for the success of the RRA as an approach used to foster team work, planning and
accountability to results. The RRA approach allowed for the development of clear work
plans, and it encouraged competition among the various units of the MOPHP. The RRA
put the HRSP back on track, proving that MOPHP could deliver, and building capacity
and new confidence for managing change throughout the MOPHP.

2.2.8 Under the revised program, interventions at the national level were focused on
support for priority public health interventions that have the most impact on maternal and
child health and with a proven track record of effective implementation on the ground,
such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) and the Expanded
Program of Immunization (EPI). The remaining civil works and corresponding
equipment and furniture activities were delegated to the PMU of the Public Works
Project because of their proven track record in implementing civil works programs
throughout Yemen. The second area of emphasis, capacity building, was to support some
national level programs and the training of staff so that the renovated and equipped
facilities could be operated efficiently.

2.2.9 Without minimizing the importance of the role of the overall institutional capacity
built under the project, one can state that, after the MTR, the following key factors
affected implementation and outcomes: (a) the restructuring; (b) the change in CAU
management; (c) the strong leadership of the MOPHP at the time of restructuring and
onward; (d) the application of the RRA as an approach to support implementation,
management and team building; and (e) the dedication of MOPHP staff encouraged by
joint planning and monitoring through the RRA rounds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Apart from its Annex 1 which lists some indicators (but without baseline values
and, in some cases, without quantified targets), the PAD does not deal with Monitoring
and Evaluation (M&E). This is one of the weakest points of the project design. When the
Project started, albeit at a slow pace, the Project Coordination Committee (PCC) was
supposed to monitor implementation but it was not very active. Until the introduction of
the RRA, the HRSP did not have a systematic approach to M&E.

2.3.2 The three rounds of RRA workshops begun in 2006 provided the opportunity for
some coordination at the facility level, and allowed for the exchange of information on
the status of each component. RRA workshops were used as mechanisms to review and
monitor the implementation plans, in lieu of the PCC meetings. Each component team
developed a two-year (2007-2008) target with quarterly benchmarks and corresponding
budgets, finalized and approved in March 2007. These targets were used to assess
progress and expenditures over the two-year period. The fourth- and fifth-round RRA
workshops (December 2007 and May 2008, respectively) were held to review the two-
year performance and make necessary programmatic or financial adjustments for the last
year of the Project.

2.3.3 In 2007, an M&E system was developed with the assistance of an international
consulting firm. The CAU continued to effectively monitor the implementation progress
with inputs from the HMIS, which receives its information from health facilities and
district offices trained under the HRSP. The project monitoring indicators table was
updated regularly and was used as the key tool for assessing project progress and
effectiveness.

2.3.4 The main concern at restructuring was to reverse the declining trends experienced
in some areas, so some targets were set low. The PDO indicators fell short in measuring
the quality aspect, though it is stated in the PDO. Actual utilization could be used as a
proxy for quality: if the services provided are of good quality, people will use them.
However, given the limited time remaining in the project period to undertake both
baseline and end-of-project assessments, it had been agreed with MOPHP to focus on
these intermediate output measures as proxy measures for the PDO. It is known that in
the beginning of the project, children were receiving some basic health services, but these
were being provided in a disorganized and fragmented manner. The introduction of
IMCI would minimally ensure the presence of staff trained in the algorithm and with
essential drugs being provided for the full IMCI program. While this does not guarantee

                                            10
the final outcomes in terms of reduced child morbidity and mortality, it does show that
MOPHP has made an important first step towards improved quality of care, i.e., by
introducing quality standards and integration in the training and provision of inputs on
the supply side. In the next project (under preparation), baseline surveys will be carried
out on targeted health service facilities and households to include quality of care
measures and utilization data, and greater attention will be paid to the demand-side
issues.

2.3.5 Due to the importance of the EmOC services and the investment of HRSP in this
aspect, a national consultant monitored the completion of EmOC activities and the
operation of the facilities providing basic and comprehensive EmOC services. The
consultant's findings were discussed at three governorate meetings (two governors
attended these meetings) and decisions were taken immediately. The EmOC monitoring
initiative is evolving into an initiative supporting the promotion and activation of the role
of Governorate Quality Teams in supervising and supporting the delivery of MNCH
services with a focus on RH/EmOC.

2.3.6 The Project conducted six rapid assessment studies to review the impact of different
programs supported by the Project (District Planning; IMCI; Management Training;
Malaria; EmOC; Health Education; and Infrastructure) and a project`s independent
impact evaluation that summarizes and expands on the results of the rapid assessment
studies. The studies were discussed with different stakeholders for follow-up and lessons
learned. Their quality is mixed, but they did provide some useful information for the ICR.

2.3.7 Over the project life, assessing the performance of the health sector has been a real
challenge. A well functioning M&E system with agreed, relevant indicators is very
important and should be established early in the project cycle for a systematic follow up
of PDO and component outcome indicators. The Ministry of Health should undertake
periodic national family health surveys to measure health indicators in order to inform its
programming and donor support.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Financial Management

2.4.1 The establishment of a financial management system satisfactory to IDA was a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit. The condition was met, but it took some
time for the system to function properly. There were issues with the quarterly Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and the management of the Special Account
(SA)/Designated Account (DA) and sub-accounts, as well as delays in the availability of
the government contribution. There were too many accounts which were difficult to
properly reconcile and manage, and the Bank provided the CAU with the procedures to
follow to manage them better, which helped the CAU improve the disbursement and
internal control processes. Quarterly FMRs have been automatically produced by the
project's accounting software and submitted to the Bank which identified a few areas for

                                             11
improvement. The main issues related to missing financial planning sections of the
FMRs, discrepancy between the cash balances of the FMRs and of the Trial Balance, and
missing narratives summarizing the activities and justifying variances between forecast
and actual expenditures. The FMR issues were pending for a long time, but based on the
Bank's recommendations and continued reminders, they were eventually resolved and the
project submitted satisfactory FMRs. A lesson learned is that the establishment of the
accounting software and its capacity to automatically produce financial reports should be
ready and tested during project appraisal instead of being a condition for effectiveness in
order to avoid undesirable risks and delays in the FM system during project
implementation. Additionally, intensive Bank supervision in the early years of the project
is vital in order to provide the project with the necessary support.

2.4.2 Unqualified audit reports have been submitted within the due dates in compliance
with the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The Audit Report for FY 2008 has been
received by the Bank. Escrow accounts have been opened for the last payment of the
external auditor for the review and audit of 2009.

2.4.3 The CAU successfully managed the PHRD Grant (TF054611) of about
US$200,000, which was fully disbursed and closed on December 31, 2008.

Procurement

2.4.4 An assessment of the MOPHP's procurement capacity was carried out during
appraisal; it concluded that the MOPHP would need extensive support. The original
design was that the PCC (composed of the heads of departments and programs of the
Ministry) would manage the project with the support of the CAU for procurement.
Initially, the CAU had many challenges to overcome. The project experienced capacity
shortfalls in the procurement and contract oversight of the supervision consultants for the
works component of HRSP as set out in the PAD and DCA. The CAU's role in carrying
out its procurement mandate was negatively impacted by the turnover in the CAU
leadership and its inability to productively engage with some department heads in the
Ministry for procurement of civil works and goods like bed nets, etc. These department
heads felt that their usual full control to contract was being encroached upon by the CAU
in its efforts to carry out its fiduciary function compliance mandate under the HRSP.

2.4.5 The MTR and the consequent restructuring of the project and new leadership being
put in place under the personal initiative of the Minister were also a turning point for
procurement. The transfer of the procurement of civil works and medical equipment to
the PMU of the PWP was a first for the Yemen portfolio. The strategy of moving the
responsibility for procuring and managing contracts for "bricks and mortars" from line
ministries to the PWP has since been repeated in education projects and is contributing to
implementing civil works in IDA-financed projects in a timely and effective manner.

2.4.6 In the latter half of the Project, procurement of drugs and vaccines was scaled-up
through UN agencies, which had many advantages over carrying out international
competitive bidding procurement by the CAU. The use of UN agencies expedited service

                                            12
delivery and ensured quality standards. There were serious delays, however, in the UN
agencies' compliance with Bank requirements. A lesson learned is that it is important to
agree early in the process about the Bank's accounting and reporting requirements.

2.4.7 With a decreased workload, the CAU's performance for the procurement of the
remaining categories of goods and consultant services showed considerable
improvement. Staff changes and procurement training also contributed to this positive
turn of events. It is worth noting that over time, the CAU's Procurement Officer
succeeded in developing an excellent working relationship with the PWP on matters
dealing with procurement of works and medical equipment, as well as with the WHO that
was responsible for drug procurement for the Bilharzias program.

2.4.8 An independent procurement review which was facilitated by a rather good filing
system2 was carried out in 2009 by a consultant. The review did not uncover any
misprocurement. However, the report dated March 2009 identified a number of cases
where procurement procedures that were followed were not in compliance with the
provisions of the DCA, including some shortcomings in bidding documents for civil
works with respect to bidders' eligibility and qualifications. In the case of some contracts
subject to prior review of the Bank, the lack of compliance escaped the attention of the
Bank.

Environment

2.4.9 The environmental category for the HRSP was "B". The only project sub-
components that had potential environmental impact were the rehabilitation of district
hospitals and health centers, with two types of waste management issues: waste water
collection and disposal, and solid waste (infectious waste and common household waste)
collection and disposal. A Generic Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was carried
out during project appraisal, and specific EMPs were to be undertaken for each district
hospital and health center to take into account the site specific conditions.

2.4.10 There have been problems with the management of liquid and solid waste. In
October 2008, a Health Facility Planner was recruited to carry out an assessment of
facilities being built under the project to determine the needs for possible additional small
works to ensure their adequate operations and identify any requirements for adequate
water and power supply as well as other critical items missing for effective operation of
the facilities. He suggested a number of improvements that could be made to existing
facilities: (a) improved liquid waste management, including the construction of septic
tanks; (b) the survey of all sewer sizes and slopes, with the eventual correction of
inadequate installations; and (c) the upgrading of most of the project incinerators, with
the enlarging of openings and the modification or reconstruction of garbage disposal. He

2
  Most of the procurement documents were available for review, and were filed separately for each
procurement tender/contract. The system of filing papers was reasonably orderly and hard copies of most
emails issued and received by the CAU/PMU relevant to the integrity of the procurement decision-making
were available on the files.


                                                  13
also made recommendations for the design and construction of waste management
systems of future health facilities. These recommendations include: (a) more detailed
TORs for the consulting firms in charge of design and supervision; (b) accurate and
detailed reviews of documents by environment and technical specialists; (c) better
monitoring and control of site supervisors during the construction phase; and (d)
sensitization of end users for better management of liquid and solid waste.

2.4.11 The sensitization of end users is definitely a priority. It seems that, despite Bank
efforts, the management of liquid and solid waste is still not taken seriously in many
health facilities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

2.5.1 The delivery of health services by the MOPHP is a continuous operation
independent of the duration of any project, so that there is not really a need for explicit
transition arrangements. The effective capacity building carried out under the project and
the modest institutional development gains will facilitate the future operation of health
systems. The main issue, however, is whether health facilities remain adequately
financed, and particularly whether adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are
being met. Recently, the Government has exceeded the target set for O&M as a
percentage of total MOPHP expenditure, which augurs well for the future. The financing
of some activities (especially vertical programs) should not be a problem with the
substantial resources available from many donors, such as the Global Fund for
HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, the Dutch Aid - Maternal and New Born Health,
and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), to name only a few.

2.5.2 Pending the finalization of the Health Sector Review (HSReview) and its
development into a national sector strategy and program, the Bank is responding to
Yemen's pressing health needs by supporting two projects which are follow-up
operations to the HRSP:

    a) the Schistosomiasis Control Project (SCP) to decrease the high prevalence and
        intensity of infection of schistosomiasis, to be implemented from February 1,
        2010 to December 31, 2015 in partnership with WHO and the Schistosomiasis
        Control Initiative (SCI); and

    b) the Yemen Health and Population Project (HPP) to contribute to the acceleration
        of the achievement of MDG 4 & 5 (reduction in childhood mortality and
        improvement of maternal health) through support for key initiatives targeted to
        improve access to and utilization of maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH)
        in selected governorates with poor MNCH indicators. The HPP is being prepared
        in partnership with UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO, and is expected to be



                                            14
        submitted for approval to the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors in
        December 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

3.1.1 The restructured HRSP remained relevant to current country and global priorities,
and to the Bank assistance strategy, as expressed in the Government's Development Plan
for Poverty Reduction (DPPR) and the Bank's most recent Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS).

3.1.2 The Third Socio-economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR),
currently under implementation (2006 to 2010), is built on eight pillars; one of them is
human development, including health and population. The DPPR aims to accelerate
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through a renewed focus
on the modalities of health service delivery. Health sector priorities entail improving
management and planning capacities, involving local communities and strengthening
quality of services. With regard to population, the DPPR calls for a substantial
strengthening of reproductive health services in order to reduce the annual population
growth rate to 2.75 percent.

3.1.3 The overall objective of the Bank Group's program in the FY10-FY13 IDA/IFC
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS report no. 47562-YE, April 29, 2009) is to facilitate
Yemen's further progress towards the MDGs. The CAS foresees a broad-based, yet
selective engagement across a variety of sectors. The third strategic objective is to help
foster human and social development, including health. Specifically for the health sector,
the CAS calls for strengthening capacity and efficiency for the delivery of a basic
package of health services, for improving the delivery of reproductive health services,
and for reducing the prevalence of schistosomiasis (all of which have been addressed in
one form or another under the HRSP).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

3.2.1 Annex 2 lists the project's outputs that were financed by the IDA Credit. For many
sub-components IDA provided only a percentage of the financing required to carry them
out; although there were no formal cofinancing arrangements, other development partners
filled the gaps. These partnerships are an interesting feature of the Project, and
development partners should be given credit for their important contribution to the
project outcomes. As an example, donor efforts (WHO, UNICEF, JICA, GAVI) for polio
control (following a polio outbreak in the region) should be recognized for boosting
immunization programs with micro planning and a renewed immunization agenda for
vaccination. UNFPA, the Netherlands and GTZ played a significant role in parallel
financing for reproductive health services. More generally, donor coordination ensured
                                            15
that the intervention of donors was complementary with, for example, the Bank financing
operating costs for outreach activities and another donor providing the vaccines. Other
development partners also made important contributions for malaria and schistosomiasis.
The MOPHP led the coordination of donor funding and support.

3.2.2 The Data Sheet above presents the end-of-project results for the performance
indicators that were selected to monitor the PDOs. The PDO indicators in the Data Sheet
are based on the last ISR, with some adjustments that had to be made because of the
availability of more up-to-date and/or correct information for some indicators3. When
reviewing the achievement of the performance indicators, one has to keep in mind the
attribution problem and the fact that, as mentioned earlier, the time limitation at
restructuring did not allow for considering the implementation of baseline and impact
studies. The Data Sheet shows that most of the performance indicators that were selected
to monitor the PDOs4 were achieved, and even exceeded in some cases:

    a) At 87 percent for 2008, the national coverage of fully immunized children under
       one year of age came close to the 90 percent target. Particularly noteworthy is the
       eradication of polio. On the other hand, at 60 percent the BCG immunization
       somewhat lags behind.

    b) The percentage of women using modern family planning methods continued to
       increase, with figures for 20065 (contraceptive prevalence rate of 19 percent)
       slightly above the target increase of 5 percent set for 2008.

    c) The percentage of the MOPHP recurrent expenditures spent for maintenance also
       exceeded the target increase of 10 percent. Maybe more important than the
       increase in the percentage, between 2004 and 2007, the actual amounts spent on
       maintenance showed a significant increase in real terms (about 65 percent,
       assuming that the inflation averaged 8 percent per year).

    d) The coverage of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLIN) in the targeted districts
       reached 45 percent of households, compared with the 5 percent target.




3
  Regarding the discrepancies between ISR and ICR baseline data: (i) contraceptives: the ICR figure is for
modern methods only, whereas the ISR figure is for all methods; and (ii) operation cost expenditure: the
ICR figure is for actual expenditures in 2004, whereas the ISR figure was based on the budget for 2003.

4
  (i) to improve access to and quality of priority national family health and reproductive health programs;
and (ii) to develop the capacity of the MOPHP to manage, plan and deliver basic health services and
priority public health programs at the central level and in eight selected districts in the three targeted
governorates.

5
 The next Yemen Family Health Survey, scheduled for end 2009 / early 2010, with the results available in
2010, will provide more recent information on the contraceptive prevalence.


                                                    16
   e) The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) Program is now
      available on a daily basis in the 22 targeted health facilities in the 10 project
      districts, and in many more health facilities nationwide.

   f) In the three targeted Governorates, comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care
      (EmOC) services are provided in the 3 project district hospitals, and basic EmOC
      services are provided in 11 (out of 12) health centers.

   g) District Health Plans were prepared in all 10 project districts and 20 percent of
      plans were implemented with Government's budget.

   h) One hundred and forty health management personnel (100 percent of target) were
      trained by NCHMT in health planning.

   i) Three hundred and fifty laboratory technicians (100 percent of target) were
      trained on malaria diagnosis.

   j)   Three project governorates were covered by the interactive health GIS.


3.2.3 The HRSP introduced to Yemen a useful instrument, the RRA, to facilitate
coordination and accelerate implementation of the project. The RRA approach is now
being considered for other projects in Yemen. With respect to the HRSP, the RRA
approach also supported team building and some modest institutional change. The RRA
champions led the process forward, building institutional ownership and capacity to
promote an atmosphere of change and accountability. This point is valid for IMCI,
EmOC, and initiating the quality management team, as well as for the use of integrated
family health guidelines developed under the project in the Health System Strengthening
program funded by GAVI.

3.2.4 The Project focused on implementing vertical programs and promoted specific
disease control. It clearly demonstrated that, given the country very poor health outcome
indicators, the overall shortage of funds and the rather weak implementation capacity,
vertical programs are the only realistic way to improve health outcomes and, at the same
time, to build the implementation capacity of the Ministry. A lesson learned is that
implementing vertical programs provides an opportunity to address systemic issues by
building capacity. The successful implementation of integrated services (PIMAC)
requiring a systems approach is a case in point.

Other achievements

3.2.5 The extremely ambitious reform program was not implemented, but the HRSP can
claim credit for other important achievements, including:

   a) It was the first to finance malaria and schistosomiasis activities, which had been
      neglected by Government and donors.

                                           17
    b) It was instrumental in scaling up the delivery of IMCI services.

    c) It financed the development of protocols and guidelines which are now being used
       in health facilities and appreciated by medical personnel, and which should make
       a contribution to the quality of health services.

    d) It co-financed a national facility survey for the whole country so that the Ministry
       now has information on the location and status of health facilities (co-financed
       with USAID).

    e) In the outreach activities, it filled an important gap in financing operating costs
       and training service providers.

    f) It implemented two rounds of health public expenditure reviews (PER) covering
       the period 1999-2007. The PER has proven instrumental in MOPHP lobbying for
       increasing public finance for operational costs, including maintenance. As the
       Government is moving to a Midterm Expenditure Framework for its public
       budget planning, the health PERs conducted under HRSP are very instrumental in
       providing guidance to MOPHP while preparing for its 3-year forecast for the
       budget cycle 2010 ­ 2012.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

3.3.1 The costs involved in achieving the project objectives were reasonable in
comparison with the benefits and with recognized norms. After restructuring, project
interventions were focused on support for priority public health interventions that have
the most impact on maternal and child health, including some vertical programs such as
the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), the malaria program and the
schistosomiasis control activities. Generally, these programs have a proven track record
of effective implementation on the ground. As presented in Annex 3, the economic and
financial analysis6 carried out for these three sub-components of the Project shows that
these programs were cost effective.

3.3.2 At restructuring, the implementation of civil works and the purchase of medical
equipment and furniture were delegated to the PMU of the Public Works Project because
of their proven track record in implementing civil works programs throughout Yemen7.
About half of the IDA Credit was spent on these civil works and purchases that were
carried out in a cost-effective way. It is also worth noting that the PMU of the PWP spent

  The scope of the analysis had to be narrowed to these three programs, taking into account the limited availability of
data and the fact that benefits take time to materialize.
7
  An analysis of school construction 1996-2003 (carried out by a consultant in 2003) showed that, in terms of cost of
school construction, unit costs and quality of works, the performance of the PWP compared favorably with that of the
Social Fund for Development (SFD) and the Basic Education Expansion Project (BEEP).

                                                         18
only US$126,000, out of the US$500,000 that had been allocated to them for operating
costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 To summarize: (i) the project objectives and implementation remained consistent
with Yemen's current development priorities and with the Bank's current CAS; (ii)
within the limits of what can be evaluated now, the project implementation has been cost
effective; and (iii) most of the performance indicators that were selected to monitor the
PDOs were achieved, and even exceeded in some cases.

3.4.2 Since the PDOs were formally revised (approved by the Board) when only US$5.3
million (16 percent of the IDA Credit) were disbursed, the outcome rating must take into
account both the original and the formally revised objectives or targets.8 As shown in the
Table below, the weighted value of 4.52 corresponds to a rating between "Moderately
Satisfactory" and "Satisfactory"; the overall rating is rounded to "Moderately
Satisfactory," which is the same as the PDO rating in the last ISR.

3.4.3 The achievements (fully immunized women, using family planning services,
MOPH recurrent expenditures on maintenance, the many LLIN distributed, and the
availability of IMCI services) are quite impressive, yet the shortcomings in measuring
quality and unsatisfactory rating against the original PDO justify an overall rating of
"moderately satisfactory" for the PDOs.

(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The HRSP's emphasis was on activities that are important for women and children,
who are the main beneficiaries of the project investment.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

3.5.2 As detailed in Annex 2 on "Outputs by Component", the Project financed training
aimed at improving the managerial and technical skills of MOPHP staff in planning,
management, computing, etc. The financing of studies (e.g., PER and National Health
Accounts- NHA) was also a form of on-the-job training. In the process, the HRSP
strengthened many units of the MOPHP. Particularly noteworthy is the strengthening of
the HMIS Center through training and the provision of equipment. Also, the HRSP was
instrumental in establishing the National Center for Health Management Training
(NCHMT) but, with the closing of the IDA Credit for the HRSP, the future of the
NCHMT is uncertain.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3 The Health Sector Review (HSReview) was not part of the Project but was linked to
it since it was coordinated by the Health Policy and Technical Support Unit (HPTSU).
The objective is to document what has happened since the 1998 Health Sector Reform
Strategy and provide analyses that could be used for the preparation of a new health
sector strategy. The HSReview can be considered as an unintended positive outcome of
the Project, although it will take some time before it is fully developed into a national
sector strategy and program.

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

4.1 As mentioned in Section 2.5, the issue is whether adequate operation and
maintenance (O&M) costs will be met. The substantial resources available from many
donors, including the Bank, for a variety of projects and programs should help. Also,
recently the government has exceeded the target set for O&M as a percentage of total
MOPHP expenditure.




                                           20
4.2 Nevertheless, the main threat to the development outcome is the risk that the
government commitment will weaken in the future and that the necessary budget
allocations will not be made. As discussed below, the challenge for the Government is to
ensure that the health facilities that have been renovated and equipped are well managed,
have adequate operating budgets, are staffed with qualified medical personnel, and have
adequate supplies of drugs. For the last three or four years, the government commitment
has been quite strong. But in view of the level of poverty of the country and the
competing demands on the government budget, the Government may not be able to
provide adequate operating budgets in the future. Staff availability, especially female
service providers, as well as the dependency on donors for the supply of Maternal and
Child Health drugs are issues that the Government needs to address.

4.3 The risk to development outcome is rated "Significant."

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Unsatisfactory

5.1.1 As discussed in 2.1 above, the project design was too ambitious and unrealistic. It
overestimated the capacity of the MOPHP at the time, and underestimated the difficulties
of both implementing the decentralization policy and integrating health services at the
local level. According to the PAD: (i) the engineering design documents and the
procurement documents for the first year's activities were complete and ready for the
start of project implementation; and (ii) the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) had been
appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory quality. The ICR mission could not
find any evidence that these statements were correct. Actually, there was no detailed
implementation manual. Among the shortcomings of the project design, the weakest
point was the lack of a strategy and system for M&E. When the project was submitted to
the Bank's Board of Directors, it was not ready for implementation.

5.1.2 The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated "Unsatisfactory".

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3 As discussed in 2.2 above, the project had a very slow start. It took some time for
the Bank to acknowledge that there were fundamental flaws in the project design and
implementation arrangements but, starting in 2004, both the project development
objectives (PDOs) and the implementation progress (IP) were rated "Unsatisfactory" by
the Bank. At about the same time (in 2005), the Government became very concerned
about the poor performance of the projects in its portfolio (including the HRSP) and the
                                            21
prospects of funding cuts from donors. This opened the way for a fruitful collaboration
between the Government and the Bank in order to put the project back on track. The
turning points for the project were the 2005 mid-term review (MTR) and the subsequent
formal restructuring of June 2006, and the introduction of the Rapid Results Approach
(RRA).

5.1.4 The MTR of May/June 2005 was very well prepared and carried out by the
Government and the Bank. It was informed by a number of working papers (one for each
sub-component) that summarized the achievements of the sub-component to date and
presented a plan of action for the activities that could be completed during the time
remaining under the project. The plans of action included time-bound implementation
plans for the agreed-upon remaining activities, monitoring indicators and, in some cases,
revised cost estimates and draft terms of reference for studies that might be required. All
the MTR recommendations could not be implemented in a timely manner, and there was
a need for further adjustments. Nevertheless, the MTR provided a solid basis for the
successful project restructuring of June 2006.

5.1.5 The Bank suggestion to carry out the rapid results approach (RRA) exercise was
well received by the MOPHP. The exercise was a success because of the strong support
of the Minister himself and the commitment of staff of the Ministry and the CAU, but
also because of the active involvement of Bank staff, including staff of the World Bank
Institute (WBI) in Washington. This "implementation support" provided by the Bank for
the RRA was "Bank supervision" at its best.

5.1.6 The Bank provided valuable support for the establishment and strengthening of the
M&E system. In response to the CAU's initial difficulties with financial management and
procurement, Bank supervision helped the CAU to deal with pending issues and improve
the project financial management and procurement. The Bank also provided
recommendations and many reminders to properly manage liquid and solid wastes.

5.1.7 In view of the pro-active role of the Bank to put the project back on track in
collaboration with the MOPHP management, the quality of supervision by the Bank is
rated "Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.8 The rating for the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is in the
unsatisfactory range and the rating for quality of supervision is in the satisfactory range.
Therefore, in accordance with the ICR Guidelines, the overall Bank performance is rated
"Moderately Satisfactory" because the overall project outcome is rated in the satisfactory
range.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

                                            22
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2 1 The Government shares some responsibility with the Bank for the unsatisfactory
quality at entry of the Project. The fact that the Project was not ready for implementation,
combined with some management weaknesses in many units of the MOPHP, explain why
the Project had such a slow start. In the early years of the Project, the Government's
performance was rather poor. In 2005, the HRSP and another large Bank-financed
projects became serious liabilities for the Government, raising the prospect of substantial
cuts in funding from the Bank and other development partners. In response, the
Government formulated the National Agenda for Reform and adopted a six-month action
plan. In February 2006, there was a major reshuffling of the Cabinet, replacing 15 of the
existing 35 Ministers, including the MOPHP, and creating a sense of urgency to turn
things around.

5.2.2 With respect to the HRSP, all relevant Government Ministries (the MOPHP, but
also the MOF and the MOPIC) worked closely with the Bank to carry out the MTR and,
thereafter, to implement the agreed findings and recommendations of the MTR. After
restructuring, and with strong leadership of the Minister of Health and the dedication of
the Ministry staff, including the hard work of the CAU staff, as well as the support and
commitment provided by the MOPIC and the MOF, the Project was implemented
successfully in about three and a half years, and the IDA Credit was fully disbursed. With
all the funds disbursed or committed, the total project cost is US$33.5 million9; the IDA
credit financed US$33.1 million and the Government's contribution was US$0.4 million.
This is quite an achievement for all the departments of the MOPHP and the CAU, as well
as for the PMU of the PWP.

5.2.3 Project steering and coordination. To ensure adequate coordination, the
implementation arrangements in the PAD included both a Steering Committee (SC) and a
Project Coordination Committee (PCC). Neither of the two committees met frequently at
the beginning of the project. The PCC composed of the program directors of the Ministry
was supposed to manage the Project with the support of the CAU for financial and
procurement functions; for all practical purposes, the PCC was replaced by the RRA
meetings. In later years, the SC formed by the Minister and Deputy Ministers of MOPHP
and representatives from MOF and MOPIC became very active and provided good
guidance to the CAU for project implementation. The SC has supported the project in
various ways including quick approval of activities, resolving financial/payment issues,
etc. It is worth noting that the Minister of MOPHP has been attending most of the
meetings, and has been fully informed of project activities. The MOF and MOPIC have
been also very active and supportive to facilitate project implementation.

5.2.4 Credit administration. The Credit Administration Unit (CAU) was responsible for
procurement activities, keeping project accounts, and monitoring the implementation

9
 Including US$11,000 for the repayment of the Project Preparation Advance. The above project cost does
not include the PHRD Grant of US$199,840 provided by Japan to finance technical assistance to the
MOPHP to facilitate project implementation.


                                                 23
progress. The recruitment of the CAU staff was slow. At the beginning of the project, the
CAU was not very effective. However, the situation improved considerably in the last
three and a half years. The CAU played a critical role in expediting project
implementation and providing acceptable procurement and financial management
support.

5.2.5 Project management unit (PMU) of the PWP. At project restructuring, the
implementation of civil works and the procurement of equipment were delegated to the
PWP. CAU and the PMU of PWP worked well together to ensure that deliverables under
all contracts in the procurement plan were realized prior to the revised IDA Credit closing
date of August 31, 2009. Foreign exchange fluctuations created uncertainties regarding
the funds available to complete some badly needed additional works, which complicated
the tasks of the CAU and the PMU of PWP.

The challenges ahead

5.2.6 The improvement of the health infrastructure in the selected districts is impressive,
but there are a number of shortcomings that need to be rectified. An example is the
absence of elevators in two two-story hospitals with operating rooms in the upper level.
Also, more needs to be done to sensitize end-users to the importance of better
management of liquid and solid waste in health facilities.

5.2.7 In order to operate the improved facilities to their maximum potential, the
Government needs to ensure that these facilities are well managed, have adequate
operating budgets, are staffed with properly trained and qualified medical personnel, and
have adequate supplies of drugs (particularly for IMCI and EmOC) since there is a strong
correlation between drug availability and utilization of health services. All these are
prerequisites for improving utilization and quality of priority national family health and
reproductive health programs, which is the essence of the project development objectives
(PDOs). There are positive signs that the Government is committed to ensuring that the
improved facilities are well operated and maintained. Managers have been replaced in a
number of facilities, and in early 2009, the Minister of Health formed a committee to
work towards filling the gaps of medical staff in each HRSP targeted facility. Following a
review of existing staff and staff needs, the committee was able to provide additional
medical staff and/or redistribute staff within a governorate. Also, the MOPHP pursued its
efforts to support the facilities with adequate budgets; for example, in October 2009 it
succeeded in including a running budget for Yareem Hospital ­ one of the biggest HRSP-
financed health facilities in Ibb Governorate.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: not applicable

5.2.8 The implementing agency was the Ministry of Public Health and Population
(MOPHP). Since the MOPHP is part of the Government, the assessment of its
performance is included in 5.2 (a) above.



                                            24
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.9 The Government was partly responsible for the unsatisfactory quality at entry and it
performed poorly in the early years of the project. However, in view of the rather
remarkable work done by the MOPHP in the last three and a half years to transform a
problem project into a performing and fully disbursed project, the overall Borrower
performance is rated "Moderately Satisfactory".

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

6.1 Many lessons can be drawn from the history of this project and the way it was
transformed from a problem project to a performing and fully disbursed project:

   a) In health projects where usually the public sector operates under many constraints
      (particularly the lack of incentives for civil servants), strong leadership at the
      highest level of the ministry is essential to ensure satisfactory implementation and
      operation of the projects.

   b) In an environment of weak institutional capacity, the design of a project must be
      simple, realistic and consistent with the government's capacity to implement it.

   c) The design of a health project must include the preparation of an implementation
      manual with sufficient details on implementation modalities including, at a
      minimum, for the first year of the project and for each activity, information on
      what has to be done, who is going to do what, when, and at which cost?

   d) A well functioning M&E system with agreed upon indicators is very important
      and should be established early in the project cycle for a systematic follow up of
      PDO and component outcome indicators. Key performance indicators must be
      consistent with the PDOs, focusing on outcomes rather than outputs, with realistic
      targets. Project design must include surveys/studies to evaluate outcomes and
      resources to implement them. The Ministry of Health should undertake periodic
      national family health surveys to measure health indicators in order to inform its
      programming and donor support.

   e) Even when a project is well prepared with sufficient details, and a fortiori when a
      project is not properly prepared, the use of the rapid results approach (RRA) can
      be very useful to motivate staff and ensure that the momentum is not lost. The
      RRA methodology provides a solid foundation for expediting implementation
      because of its emphasis on clear and realistic targets, assignment of responsibility
      and provision of support (e.g., a `team of champions' to provide overall
      guidance), and senior level buy-in to program activities.




                                           25
   f) Technical ministries like the Ministry of Health should concentrate their energy
      and activities on purely sectoral matters and issues and delegate the carrying out
      of civil works to agencies specialized in those activities, such as PWP. At the
      same time, agencies like PWP need to expand their capacity to respond to the
      demand for their service to ensure further quality and timeliness of their delivery.

   g) In a weak implementation capacity environment, working with UN agencies for
      the procurement of drugs and medical supplies is usually a better alternative to
      international competitive bidding by the implementing agency; it expedites
      service delivery and ensures quality standards. In order to avoid delays in UN
      agencies' compliance with Bank requirements, it is important to agree on the
      Bank's accounting and reporting requirements early on in the process.

   h) Vertical programs versus a system approach is a complex issue. In a context of
      burning need for quick health outcomes, working through vertical programs could
      achieve quick health outcomes while building implementation capacity and
      should be designed to ensure gradual building of a change management platform.

   i) Renovating and equipping health facilities and training medical staff could turn
      out to be a total loss of resources if adequate budgets are not made available for
      operation and maintenance. Ensuring a satisfactory utilization of the available
      capacity of health facilities may also require improvements in the management of
      these facilities so that the population is encouraged to use them.

   j) Special efforts must be made to ensure satisfactory design and drawings of
      utilities and waste management systems and to sensitize end-users for better
      management of liquid and solid waste, including medical waste.

   k) Building the capacity of an implementation unit takes time. At the beginning, the
      Credit Administration Unit (CAU) did not perform satisfactorily. In the last three
      and a half years, the CAU has performed well and accumulated good experience
      in project implementation. The experience and knowledge of its staff are assets
      that should be made use of to facilitate other development activities.

   l) The establishment of the accounting software and its capacity to automatically
      produce financial reports should be ready and tested during project appraisal
      instead of being a condition for effectiveness in order to avoid undesirable risks
      and delays in the FM system during project implementation. Additionally,
      intensive Bank supervision in the early years of the project is vital in order to
      provide the project with the necessary support.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component 10

With all the funds disbursed or committed, the total project cost is US$33.5 million11; the
IDA credit financed US$33.1 million and the Government's contribution was US$0.4
million.

Component 1: Improvement of National Family Health and Reproductive Health
Programs (Cost: US$26.338 million)

Sub-Component 1.1: Decentralized Operational Management (DOM)
(Cost: US$0.444 million)

1.1.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) - Improving
the management systems and procedures of central, Governorate and district health
offices in support of the decentralization of resource management required for
establishing an operational district health system in accordance with the Local
Authorities Law.

1.1.2 The HRSP financed training and some office equipment. The HRSP support to the
Decentralized Operational Management (DOM) included international training of 21
managers from MOPHP at central and governorate levels, in-country training of 692
managerial personnel from the targeted 10 District Management Teams (DMTs) and 3
Governorate health offices. The training aimed at improving the managerial and
technical skills in planning, management, English and computers. One of the main
achievements of DOM was formation and training of DMTs and overseeing the
development of ten annual district plans for 2 consecutive years (2007 and 2008). These
plans reflected adequate planning skills; they were clear, comprehensive but ambitious,
sometimes unrealistic. District plans were successful in obtaining 20 percent of their
implementation budget from Governorates, including activities at Governorate level that
benefited the districts. Health district plans were also presented to local councils that
funded some of the communications activities related to EPI outreach and campaigns.
Planned activities were implemented if they were part of programs supported by
development partners. Supervision of health facilities by district and governorate teams
was constrained by the lack of resources allocated for supervision.

1.1.3 District plans were utilized by the targeted districts. However, a pre-requisite was
missing. The districts management plans were to be prepared within the framework of
administrative as well as fiscal decentralization to the districts. The sub-component fell

   Including US$11,000 for the repayment of the Project Preparation Advance. The above project cost does
not include the PHRD Grant of US$199,840 provided by Japan to finance technical assistance to the
MOPHP to facilitate project implementation.

short of establishing an operational district health system (DHS) in accordance with the
Local Authorities Law, as was envisaged at the restructuring (see amendment to the
Development Credit Agreement ­ DCA ­ dated June 30, 2006 ­ page 7).

Sub-Component 1.2: Delivery of a Package of National Health Programs and Basic
Health Services (Cost: US$25.894 million)

1.2.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) -
Supporting the delivery of national health programs and basic health services in district
hospitals and health centers, including: (a) upgrading the skills of health care providers;
(b) the provision of drugs, medical supplies and medical equipment; (c) the provision of
reproductive health/family planning supplies and implementation of the vaccination
program; and (d) the rehabilitation of about eight (8) district hospitals and about ten
(10) health centers in eight (8) districts within Ibb, Sanaa and Hodeida.

1.2.2 Reproductive Health - Maternal and Neonatal Health ­ Emergency Obstetrical
Care (EmOC) (Cost: US$17.015 million, including the renovation and equipment of
health facilities, the training of medics and paramedics, and the provision of
comprehensive and basic emergency obstetric care - EmOC ­ in the selected health
facilities).

Civil works and equipment

1.2.3 The PMU of the Public Works Project (PWP) implemented the rehabilitation and
extension of five district hospitals and 17 health centers (total: US$5.535 million) and
procured and delivered the equipment (total: US$9.915 million) for these facilities. Since
some facilities received similar equipment and furniture through other sources of funding,
some items of equipment and furniture could be redistributed to facilities (other than the
project targeted 22 facilities) which deliver RH services including EmOC. Staff was
trained on the use of equipment for most, but not all items of equipment.

1.2.4 The project was not able to provide elevators to two 2-story hospitals with operating
rooms on the upper level (Manakah and Yareem) due to budget constraints. The elevators
are essential to operate these hospitals, and the MOPHP is exploring other sources of
finance to install the elevators as soon as possible.

1.2.5 Training of medics and paramedics for EmOC services (total: US$0.403 million)

1.2.6 The project provided support to upgrade 117 health staff to improve the skills of
EmOC services providers. The training included 4 staff categories, namely: 45
Community Midwives (CMWs) with 2 years training; 45 Supervisors Community
Midwives (SCMWs) with 1 year training; 13 Anesthetists Assistants with 2 years
training; and 14 Obstetric Doctors with 1 year training. Doctors were awarded diplomas
in gynecology and obstetrics. Most of the graduates are deployed in the facilities that
nominated them. The 45 SCMWs are playing a very positive role in the delivery of



                                            33
EmOC and MCH/FP services; most of them are volunteering in health facilities, and
MOPHP, governorates and local councils are working to enroll them starting in 2010.

1.2.7 EmOC protocols and guidelines were developed and endorsed by the Population
Sector/MOPHP in December 2007, with the technical assistance from an international
consultant in coordination with WHO Consultants.


1.2.8 Training of 14 EmOC high caliber doctors and midwives as trainers (TOT) took
place in June 2009, and training of 24 EmOC staff /midwives in August 2009. This
training, with developed protocols and guidelines, will furnish the way towards a unified
and systematic approach to EmOC service provision which can be duplicated in other
Yemen governorates.

1.2.9 HRSP provided support to train 35 middle RH Managers at governorate and district
levels at the National Centre for Health Management Training.

1.2.10 EmOC drugs. The HRSP has funded EmOC drugs that were distributed
nationwide.

Operation of the facilities

1.2.11 Out of the 15 health facilities targeted for EmOC, 3 districts hospitals provide
comprehensive EmOC with 24/7 availability of service and 11 health centers provide
basic EmOC services (as of October 2009, one health center did not have the required
staff to provide basic EmOC).

1.2.12 There are several constraints to the provision of Health services: (i) insufficient
operating budget; (ii) lack of critical cadres such as obstetricians, anesthesiologists and
female doctors and nurses; (iii) insufficient training of staff to use the equipment and to
make facilities operational; (iv) and shortages of drugs. These are areas of concern that
the MOPHP is trying to address. Another issue is the apparent lack of understanding and
concern about environmental matters since the disposal of medical and other waste is not
taken seriously by many health facilities.

Expanded Program of Immunization ­ EPI (Cost: US$5.147 million)

1.2.13 The HRSP has funded mainly operating costs (US$4.221 million) of EPI
campaigns and outreach activities over the past three years, plus some vehicles and
training. The Government is financing vaccines and related supplies. The procurement
and delivery up to the central warehouse are outsourced to UNICEF.

1.2. 14 The EPI program has steadily maintained its yearly outcomes. For the year 2008,
the national coverage was 87 percent for Penta 3 (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis
B & Haemophilus Influenza type b). The polio campaigns have been particularly
successful (87 percent coverage in 2008). On May 15, 2009, WHO declared Yemen a
polio free country (although the official certificate has not been issued yet). The next
                                            34
objective is to eradicate measles (73 percent coverage in 2008). On the other hand, the
yearly vaccination for BCG remained around 60 percent, pointing to deficiencies either in
demand or in supply of services.

1.2.15 The HRSP also financed an Immunization Tracking Study.

Schistosomiasis (Cost: US$1.914 million)

1.2.16 Before the HRSP, no one focused on schistosomiasis, which was neglected by
donors and government for lack of funds. The HRSP financed drugs, operating costs and
training.

1.2.17 Funded by HRSP, three campaigns of mass treatment of school age children (6 ­
18 years old, including those who did not attend schools) were completed in 92 districts
in 16 governorates from 2005 to 2008; they treated over 1.7 million school age children.
The last and fourth campaign was partially funded (20 percent) by HRSP for 17 districts
and treated 352,000 children. After the training of health workers, teachers and
volunteers, information campaigns on Schistosomiasis origins, transmission, symptoms,
treatment and possible side effects and their treatment were shortly followed by mass
treatment with Praziquantel and Mebendazole. The vector control activities were
conducted in collaboration with another World Bank funded project: Sana'a Basin
Project. Prevention sessions conducted by volunteers were found to be weaker than the
ones implemented by health workers. The Schistosomiasis Control Campaigns are
ongoing operations, and a new IDA funded project has been approved recently.

IMCI (Cost: US$0.519 million)

1.2.18 The baseline was zero availability in 2004. Since the 2006 restructuring, HRSP
has substantially contributed to the national roll-out of the IMCI strategy in the targeted
districts, achieving remarkable outputs: (i) the adaptation of curriculums and their
production; (ii) training of trainers at central level; (iii) IMCI training courses conducted
for 86 doctors and 689 other medical providers; (iv) 400 health facilities (74 percent of
541 facilities) in 41 districts are implementing IMCI; and (v) the provision of quarterly
outreach services by integrated multidisciplinary mobile teams. The HRSP has funded the
procurement of two batches of IMCI drugs with assistance from UNICEF using the
essential drug lists per level of facility developed in collaboration with WHO.

1.2 19 Nationwide, all 22 Governorates now have districts implementing IMCI, and 199
districts (60 percent of all districts in the country) have PHC facilities implementing
IMCI. In the whole country, 1,790 PHC facilities (50 percent coverage) are implementing
IMCI. IMCI training courses were conducted for 3,716 medical staff (578 physicians and
3,138 paramedical staff). One and a half million children under age five have access to
IMCI services.

1.2 20 An independent rapid assessment of IMCI services showed that the utilization rate
of IMCI services increased after the project interventions, but is also function of the

                                             35
availability of drugs. Both providers and clients are generally satisfied with the provision
of IMCI services. However, systematic follow­up after training is needed, and it is
important that the MOPHP ensures regular and sustainable drug supply.

Disease Surveillance (Cost: US$0.345 million)

1.2.21 The HRSP investments in equipment, clinical and laboratory supplies were critical
to the improvements of permanent communication with districts and governorates for the
purpose of disease surveillance. HRSP funding provided inputs and improved processes
to the increase of completeness (70 percent) and timeliness of reporting of the seven
diseases from the 21 Governorate coordinators and 609 focal persons. However, 244
districts are yet to be equipped and covered, and there is a need for more long-term
training (epidemiologist).

Family Health (Cost: US$0.078 million)

1.2.22 Since the 2006 restructuring, HRSP has funded the pilot implementation of the
integrated primary health care-reproductive health (IPHC-RH) curriculum in targeted
governorates, including curriculum development and pre-testing. With joint funding from
HRSP and GAVI­HSS, the training of trainers on IPHC­RH in 26 districts and training
of providers in 17 districts were completed in early 2009. However, as HRSP funding has
ended, the supervision of trained providers in 250 facilities and training of the same in
integrated outreach services were completed only in some of the HSS funded districts.
Since the training and first supervision took place only few months ago, outputs and
outcomes remain to be seen.

Others (Costs: US$0.877 million)

1.2.23 The HRSP financed equipment and consultancy services for the Engineering
Affairs and the Medical equipment and Maintenance Departments.

Component 2: Capacity Building (Cost: US$5.604 million)

Sub-Component 2.1: Malaria (Cost: US$2.410 million)

2.1.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) - (a)
Strengthening the national malaria control program activities by building the capacity of
about seven referral laboratories; (b) Improving malaria integrated vector management
in high-risk and epidemic-prone areas, including: (i) promotion of personal protection
measures; (ii) residual house spraying; and (iii) use of insecticide treated materials.

2.1.2 Before the HRSP, no one focused on malaria: the Global Fund became involved at a
later date. By supporting the malaria program, the HRSP aimed to improve malaria
integrated vector management in high risk and epidemic prone areas, including: (i)
promotion of personal protection measure; (ii) residual spraying; and (iii) use of
insecticide treated materials. The project financed 14 four-wheel drive vehicles to

                                            36
strengthen the governorate supervision system, and 50 motorcycles for malaria control
field workers. In 2006/2007, it procured and delivered 175,000 Long Lasting Insecticide
Nets (LLINs) for pregnant women and under-5 children and 350 hand sprayers. The
Project also trained 530 doctors, technicians, and community volunteers (women who
distribute LLINs in the villages) as part of integral actions to synergize protective,
preventive and diagnostic malaria rollback strategies.

2.1.3 The malaria baseline was zero, and the end-of-project target was that 5 percent of
households in targeted districts have at least one insecticide treated net (ITN). A rapid
assessment conducted on a small sample of the targeted districts and households showed
that the coverage of the targeted group varied between 23 percent and 61 percent (an
unweighted coverage of 45 percent) and that, among the households who received LLIN,
14 percent received more than one.

2.1.4 Other findings are: (i) not all endemic areas were covered; (ii) children constitute 90
percent of the users; (iii) while communities are aware that LLINs are used for protection
from Malaria, 68 percent of the interviewed households misuse the nets, indicating
further need to educate households on the adequate use of LLINs; (iv) nearly 28 percent
of the visited households paid between 100 and 2,000 Rials for LLINs; and (v)
inefficiency in delivering LLINs was dominant where non-health workers were involved
in the distribution activities.

Sub-Component 2.2: Health Education (Cost: US$1.139 million)

2.2.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) -
Strengthening the institutional capacity of the national health education and information
center (NHEIC) to develop and implement the national health education program.

2.2.2 The HRSP was the main funding source for the Health Education Department. The
Project funded the construction and equipping the National Center for Health Education;
development of awareness raising messages on newspapers and radio for several health
themes, including: RH, EPI, Malaria and Schistosomiasis; installing TV/Video sets in 60
health facilities for HE activities; external training in media production for key staff;
production of TV spots and sketches with participation of TV celebrities; TOT on
communication techniques; training of health providers, community volunteers; and
implementation of HE campaigns using mobile cinema. All 333 districts were helped by
the project which trained 333 district health education coordinators and about 500 health
educators at the facility level. The Project helped establish a nationwide health education
network which emphasized the inter personnel health education channel, and assisted in
running campaigns through the district coordinators.

Sub-Component 2.3: Health Finance and Management (Cost: US$0.869 million)

2.3.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) - (a)
Supporting the development of human resources in the areas of financial analysis by: (i)
conducting public expenditures reviews to improve resource allocation; (ii) preparing
national health accounts to provide detailed analysis on total health spending in public
and private sector; and (iii) the preparation of health insurance studies to assess the
feasibility of developing a health insurance program. (b) Developing health management
by supporting the national center for health management training.

Health Finance

2.3.2 Activities implemented by the Health Policy and Technical Support Unit (HPTSU)
under the health finance theme included: (i) a study on Health Insurance, co financed by
local funds and WHO, completed in 2004 ; (ii) development of the 2007 National Health
Accounts (NHAs), and a PER covering the years 2004-2007 and analyzing the trend in
health finance over 2003-2007; (iii) a comparative analysis on operational costs and
maintenance; (iv) development of a training manual on governorate accounts; (v) a study
on cost sharing in public health services; (vi) mapping health sector donors' support to
inform donors' coordination efforts; and (vii) supporting the health sector review process
and national conference to launch the updated sector strategy. Some activities under this
theme were delayed so that the results and findings of these studies have been available
only recently. The MOPHP must see to it that the findings of these studies are
disseminated to properly influence health finance policies.

Health Management

2.3.3 The National Center for Health Management Training (NCHMT) was established
under the HRSP. The Project funded the construction of a third floor in the building
increasing the center's capacity and funded the development of management training
modules and the training of participants. The complete theoretical and practical 36-week
health management training consists of the following 10 modules: (i) health sector reform
policy: (ii) management of health services; (iii) medical supplies; (iv) health planning; (v)
health information systems; (vi) manpower development; (vii) quality management of
health services; (viii) budgeting; (ix) monitoring and evaluation; and (x) research. The
Project funded: (a) the training of 225 participants from all governorates in management,
planning, leadership, etc; (b) a diploma course for 20 managers; (c) a 5-month course for
20 hospital directors; (d) the development of 20 management training modules; and (e)
advance training (abroad) to five of the center's main trainers. Upon completion of
training, district plans were developed with expert assistance from the Decentralized
Operational Management (DOM), Planning Sector of the MOPHP and the Governorates.

2.3.4 An evaluation study was conducted on a sample of 24 graduates. Participants
expressed satisfaction with their training which contributed to improving their
management skills. However, they faced institutional challenges to apply the knowledge

                                             38
and skills gained. The centralization of the resource allocation process and the centralized
decision making prevented them from making full use of their planning skills. Planned
activities that were implemented were those supported by donors (RH services, malaria,
bilharzias and immunization). Improvements in health services in targeted districts were
due more to the support of donors than to improvement in planning or in following the
implementation of plans.

2.3.5 The HRSP support to the National Center for Health Management Training
(NCHMT) provided a substantial lift to the role of the center in supporting the health
system. The NCHMT continues to provide some training with the financing of other
donors but, with the closing of the IDA Credit for the HRSP, the future of the NCHMT is
uncertain.

Health Sector Review (HSReview)

2.3.6 The MOPHP started a Health Sector Review with the aim of developing a set of
realistic and comprehensive objectives, which are shared by the many different actors at
all levels of the health system including the users (be it in the private or in the public
sector), all national organizations whose activities impact on health (mainly the
Ministries of Finance, Local Authorities, and Planning and International Cooperation)
and development partners. The Health Sector Review documents what has happened
since the 1998 Health Sector Reform Strategy and provides analyses that could be used
for the preparation of a new strategy. The review was coordinated by the HPTSU.

2.3.7 The impulse to do so was given by a larger group of Yemeni health officials from
the MOPHP, many of them holding key leadership positions today. The idea was to
develop a strategy, as concrete as possible, in order to agree on medium term guidelines
for MOPHP actions. Of course, these guidelines should also serve as a basis for
negotiation with development partners on Yemen's priorities in health.

2.3.8 Conceptually two key elements were given high importance:

   a) The improvement of health services should be the main concern, the "leitmotiv"
      of the health sector review. Health services are provided in Yemen through the
      public sector (in health posts and centers owned by local authorities, as well as in
      autonomous, general and specialized hospitals) as well as through a growing
      private sector, with all levels of complexity. However, all the specialized
      institutions supporting this service provision, such as the Central Laboratory,
      Blood Bank, Higher Institute of Health Science, the MOPHP administration
      should also be taken into account.
   b) To dare a broader participatory process, which by gathering the views and
      worries of all stakeholders and transforming them into meaningful action, would
      create more than a simple planning document, but also a movement towards
      improving the sector. Instead of a plan based merely on a technical logic, with
      pre- designed strategies, often driven by the inertia of already existing national or


                                            39
       international programs, the challenge was to dare to listen, understand and
       negotiate with all stakeholders for solid Yemeni solutions.

2.3.9 The work was designed in two phases: a "status quo" analysis phase, planned as a
very participatory process in which all stakeholders were allowed to express their ideas
about the existing situation in the sector and a "benchmarking" phase, in which national
experts, in key positions in the Government of Yemen, negotiated among them realistic
"marks" or objectives to reach by the year 2015.

2.3.10 As a continuation of all previous efforts and as a practical issue towards
transferring all technical work into implementation, the MOPHP is working on a new
national strategy for the health sector with clear vision and mission. This strategy will
provide a realistic, solid base for formulating future strategic plans, in particular for the
preparation of the 4th 5-year health development plan. However, it will take some time
before the HSReview is fully developed into a national sector strategy and program.

Sub-Component 2.4: Health Management Information System ­ HMIS (Cost:
US$1.186 million)

2.4.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) -
Developing a health management information system, including: (a) a management
decision support system; (b) a health information system; and (c) a geographic
information system (GIS).

2.4.2 The Project financed mostly equipment but also some consultancies, training and
very minor civil works. The central level HMIS is now adequately equipped. The HMIS
Center is functional and producing data and maps of health facilities.

2.4.3 The Project funded: (i) a well equipped GIS Unit; (ii) construction and equipping of
a computer training lab (10 workstations and a server) which up to June 30, 2009 had
conducted 11 courses for 183 governorate staff on different IT related aspects such as
GIS, Health Analyzer, information system, and research through the internet; (iii)
equipping a videoconference room; (iv) printing and delivery of 20,000 health registers
and 2,000 copies of medical journal; and (v) equipping targeted Governorate's health
offices with computers and software.

Component 3: Credit Administration and Project Coordination (Cost: US$1.548
million)

3.1 Revised description at restructuring (amendment to DCA of June 2006) - Providing
support to the CAU and the PMU for carrying out their responsibilities under the
Project.

3.2 The project was administered through the Credit Administration Unit (CAU) which
was composed of seven core staff: Administrator, Procurement Specialist, Technical
Coordinator, Financial Manager, Accountant, Monitoring Officer and Executive

                                             40
Secretary. In addition, a Procurement Advisor was financed by the PHRD Grant
(TF054611). One year prior to the close of the Project, the Technical Coordinator and the
Monitoring Officer resigned for personal reasons and the CAU administered the project
with only five core staff; also, the contract of the Procurement Advisor was terminated
when the PHRD Grant closed at the end of December 2008.

3.3 The CAU was responsible for procurement activities, keeping the project accounts
and monitoring the project implementation progress. It took some time to recruit the
CAU staff, and at the beginning of the project the CAU was not very effective. The
situation improved considerably in the last three and a half years. The IDA Credit was
fully disbursed; there has been no misprocurement; audit reports have been unqualified;
and audit reports and FMR/IFR have been submitted on time. After an M&E system was
developed in 2007 with the assistance of an international consulting firm, the project
monitoring indicators table was updated regularly and was used as the key tool for
assessing project progress and effectiveness.

3.4 The CAU also managed the PHRD Grant (TF054611) of about US$200,000 which
was fully disbursed and closed on December 31, 2008.

3.5 At project restructuring, the implementation of civil works and the procurement of
furniture and medical equipment were delegated to the PMU of the PWP. The CAU and
the PMU worked well together to ensure that deliverables under all contracts in the
procurement plan be realized prior to the revised IDA Credit closing date of August 31,
2009. Foreign exchange fluctuations created uncertainties regarding the funds available
to complete some badly needed additional works, which complicated the tasks of the
CAU and PMU.

3.6 To ensure adequate coordination, the implementation arrangements in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) included both a Steering Committee (SC) and a Project
Coordination Committee (PCC). It seems that there was no need for two committees
which, in any event, did not meet very frequently at the beginning of the project. After
the MTR, the PCC was in effect replaced by the RRA meetings. In recent years, the
Steering Committee (SC) has been very active and provided good guidance to the CAU
for project implementation. The SC has supported the project in various ways, including
quick approval of project activities, resolving financial/payment issues, etc. It is worth
noting that the Minister of MOPHP has been attending most of the meetings, and has
been fully informed of project activities. The MOF and MOPIC have been also very
supportive of and facilitated project implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)
I. Introduction
1.1 In an effort of improving health care service delivery in Yemen, the MOPHP has
initiated the Health Sector Reform Strategy in 1998 which attempted to address
improvement of the management system through decentralization. Although the strategy
tried to improve critical issues in health sector such as improvement of efficiency, equity,
and access to health care, it has faced political and administrative challenges in its
implementation process in the last ten years. In order to support this reform strategy, the
Health Reform Support Project (HRSP) financed by an IDA credit was implemented and
became effective in 2003. However, due to the limitation of capacity and lack of political
commitment, there was a delay in project implementation in the first three years (malaria
control and health financing were the only activities implemented in a timely manner). In
2005, during the mid-term review, some components were down sized, and in the
following year, the Government and the World Bank Team agreed to utilize the RRA to
accelerate implementation.
1.2 In 2006, the project was restructured, program activities were revised, and funds were
reallocated. The revised project development objectives are: (i) to improve access to and
quality of priority national family health and reproductive health programs; and (ii) to
develop the capacity of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP) to
manage, plan and deliver basic health services and priority public health programs at the
central level and in eight selected districts in the three targeted governorates. Under the
revised program activities, interventions at the national level were focused on supporting
maternal and child health such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
(IMCI), the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), renovating and improving
hospital facilities with new equipment in rural areas, and training programs for medical
practitioners and health workers for their capacity building. Although in the initial stage
there was a delay in fully implementing this project, the project made tremendous
achievements. Table 3.1 presents a summary of selected project performance indicators
and how successful each of them was at the completion stage.

1.3 This Annex presents the summary results of the cost and benefit/effectiveness
analysis of the Health Reform Support Project. Due to the implementation delay, it would
take more time for beneficiaries to benefit fully from the project. Because of the limited
availability of data at this stage, the analysis will focus on three sub-
components/activities: malaria prevention, child immunization and chistosomiasis
control.

II. Malaria Prevention

2.1 Malaria is considered as one of the most important problems affecting the health of
the population in Yemen, especially among small children under ten. In the peak malaria
season, around 40 percent of pediatric admissions were for clinically diagnosed malaria,
and more than half of the cases satisfied the current WHO criteria for severe falciparum
malaria. This proportion of admissions is comparable to many sites in Africa during the
peak season; and therefore malaria prevention is one of public health priorities in Yemen.
(Abdullah Al-Taiar, et al, 2006).

                     Figure 3.1: Age and Prevalence of Malaria in Yemen




Source: Abdullah al-Taiar et al. 2009

2.2 It is estimated that 60% of the population live in areas at risk of malaria, with 95
percent of cases due to P. falciparum. The endemicity of the disease varies considerably
by the diversity of the topography and the climate of the country, from areas that are
believed to be malaria-free to areas where the disease is highly endemic. In some settings,
it is estimated that up to 40 percent of severe pediatric admissions can be due to malaria
during the malaria transmission season, with appreciable mortality (Abdullah al-Taiar et
al. 2009).



                                                 43
2.3 HRSP supported the country's Malaria prevention program to be further expanded
and sustainable by financing the purchases of goods and capacity building activities in 6
targeted districts. Initially, it was planned to distribute 15,000 nets to mothers and
children under 5; however, it ended up to offer 175,000 nets. The coverage of long lasting
insecticides nets (LLIN) currently in these targeted areas has reached 45 percent of the
households while initial target was only 5 percent of the households. Since one net was
distributed to be utilized by two persons, the coverage extended to 350,000 individuals in
the targeted districts.

Costs

2.4 The project cost for this component therefore, included cost for LLIN, sprays,
vehicles, training and campaign costs, consultation service fees, and operation and
maintenance costs. Table 3.2 below presents the summary of breakdown costs for
Malaria component. This Malaria control activity is one of the few items that have been
implemented since the initial years of the project. US$2,409,985 was disbursed mainly in
the first two years. Since the activity was able to reach a much larger number of mothers
and children under 5 years old than expected in the targeted districts, per capita cost for
the targeted population is calculated as low as US$7.

Benefits

2.5 The direct benefit comes from reduced cases of morbidity and mortality, and saving
of average medical treatment costs including doctors' consultation fee, medication, x-ray,
lab-tests and hospitalization. Moreover, there is positive externality in this intervention.
This sub-component of HRSP distributed 175,000 LLIN that affects 350,000 mothers and
children under 5 directly. With the combination of utilization of LLIN, large scale
spraying in the most endemic areas, and campaigns and training for information
dissemination, the intervention affects individuals indirectly through community based
sustained vector control intervention. There is indirect benefit among those who were not
granted LLIN. There is a great chance that the intervention reduce the disease burden,
minimize the risk of epidemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of people living in the

                                                44
intervention areas even though they were not granted LLIN. Thus, it is assumed that the
actual benefit is much greater than it was estimated.




                                          45
Cost Effectiveness

2.6 Using "with" and "without" intervention scenarios, an analysis was conducted. Flows
were discounted at 10 percent to estimate the NPV and ERR only for this sub-component.
Sub-components were expected to provide benefits for at least 7 years for both malaria
and immunization programs. Benefits come from saving of medical treatment cost by
reduced morbidity. Average cost for the medical care patients receive for 3 days of a
medical attention for treatment of Malaria in Ibb and Taiz Governorates, and the highest
morbidity rate among the targeted district provided from the National Malaria Control
Program in Yemen were used for the calculation. This sub-component of HRSP is
economically viable, with NPV of US$1,048,188 and ERR, 27 percent which is largely
exceeding the social discount rate of 10 percent. Supposing 2/3 of the target population is
children under 5 and 1/3 is mother, expected number of years of healthy life gained from
reductions in mortality and morbidity of children under 5 are 28,215 and 2,823,315 years
respectively. Total life years gained was divided by 2/3 of the cost of this component to
estimate cost-effectiveness ratio. It was estimated that the cost to gain one year of child
healthy life is only US$1.80. The analysis concluded that this sub-component of HRSP is
cost effective.

III. Immunization Program

3.1 Yemen's immunization program has achieved significant successes since the mid-
1990s; however, an outbreak of polio occurred in 2004, and this outbreak motivated
policymakers and international donors to make further progress. Upholding the two
strategies for enhance immunization coverage: (i) National campaigns to eradicate polio
and measles until reaching international standards; and (ii) Provision of safe and
complete immunization coverage for targeted groups through the routine immunization
services that include mobile and outreach activities, the government of Yemen with
supports from international donors, took plunge to scale up the increase of the coverage.

3.2 The funds from WHO, HRSP, UNICEF and GAVI are concentrated on specific
activities. WHO funds are for the polio campaign activities and training, while HRSP
funds were focused on measles activities as well as training activities. The HRSP funds
were not allocated for specific governorates, but used for national level.

3.3 The figure above presents the national trend of immunization coverage of children
under one year old between 1999 and 2007. HepB3 shows dramatic increase since the
year 2000, and again there is another jump after the outbreak in 2004. The latest data
from EPI program indicate that BCG coverage is 73% in 2008, and that the coverage for
measles, polio and HepB3 is 87 percent in 2008. As it is shown in Figure 3.3, the
coverage shifted from 2002 (before project implementation) to 2007, the year closer to
end of the project. All the coverages have increased except BCG.

Costs/Benefits

3.4 Table 3.4 presents the summary costs for immunization sub-component of project. 82
percent of fund for this sub-component was spent for operational cost, 13 percent was for
the purchase of goods (a large portion is for vehicles used for campaign transportation),
and the rest was used for consultancy services and training.

       3.5 As a part of the project, survey was conducted for 60 health facilities which served
       for EPI program to evaluate the outcome and impact of the program. The following table
       presents the unit expenditure analysis of immunization services: (i) routine and
       outreach/mobile service delivery; and (ii) types of facilities, based on the expenditure
       information obtained from the facility survey. In order to conceptualize the unit cost,
       2006 demographic data, and input variables such as number of hours, vaccination/routine,
       and mobile sessions were used. Table 3.5 summarizes the unit cost by service delivery
       and types of health facilities.

        3.6 Hospitals had the highest target population and generate the highest number of
        outputs, and the operation costs are lower compared to other types of facilities. Cost per
        penta 3child in facilities is almost the same for hospital (YR 22, which is equivalent to
        US$0.11) and health centers (YR18, US$0.09) compared to health units (YR39,
        US$0.20). On average, cost per Penta3 was YR 235 (US$1.18) at health centers and YR
        286 (US$1.43) at health units whereas it was as low as YR 85(US$0.43) in hospitals.
        With such low unit costs at all types of health facility, the analysis concluded that this
        sub-component is cost effective.

        IV. Fiscal Sustainability

        4.1 HRSP was financed mainly by the IDA credit (US$33.1 million), and the
        Government of Yemen (US$0.4 million). Calculations of the project sustainability are
        based on an analysis of the recurrent costs of the project, plus the annual maintenance
        costs, and consultancy services to the extended health care coverage of the reproductive
        health, maternal and child health care, as well as family health. The results of the analysis
        are summarized in the following Table. As it is shown in Table 3.6, the cost of the project
        has been fully absorbed into the national budget and has had no affect on fiscal policy
        sustainability.

   V. Schistosomiasis Control

   5.1 The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the new Schistosomiasis Control
   Project12 (SCP) includes a detailed cost effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of the
   SCP. The analysis applied the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) methodology. The
   analysis is based in part on the average cost per child for the four campaigns conducted
   under the HRSP. The average total cost per targeted child is US$0.70. The cost of the
   interventions is estimated at US$38.5 per DALY gained, so that the interventions can be
   considered as highly cost effective (US$25 to US$100 per DALY is generally accepted
   as cost effective in poor countries).

   5.2 For further details, see paragraph 68 on page 21 and Annex 9 of the PAD for the SCP.

Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)

1.     INTRODUCTION

The Government of Yemen received a credit of US$27.5 million from the International
Development Association (IDA) to finance the implementation of its Health Reform
Support Project (HRSP). The project was declared effective in January 2003 and was
implemented by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOPHP). The
implementation of specific subcomponents was conducted by relevant MOPHP
departments.

For a number of reasons, implementation of HRSP activities was initially extremely slow
when the project became effective. In order to accelerate project implementation, the
project underwent a restructuring process in June 2006. Through the restructuring, the
Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were changed to ones that could be more
realistically achieved before the end of the revised closing date of the credit (31 August
2009).

The implementation experience of the HRSP was evaluated from 27 July ­ 31 August
2009. In the evaluation, a mix of techniques were used (evaluation of outcome studies
and financial progress reports, semi-structured interviews with representatives of the
MOPHP and of bi- and multilateral organizations, Focus Group Discussions, use of
Likert questionnaires and field visits) Please see Annex. Impact Study.

1.1 PROJECT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

The HRSP was designed to provide a basic package of cost-effective integrated health
services to address the high infant and maternal mortality rates in Yemen.

The project started in 2003, had its mid-term review in 2005, was restructured in 2006
and was completed in August 2009.
The PDOs of the project (2003 ­ 2005) were to:

1) Increase accessibility of women and children to a package of integrated maternal and
   child health services provided in district hospitals and health centers in selected
   districts, and
2) Improve the effectiveness of national public health programs and the resource
   allocation within the public health sector in Yemen.

The PDOs of the restructured HRSP (2005 to 2009) were to:


                                           56
1) Improve access to and quality of priority national family health and reproductive
   health programs, and
2) Develop the capacity of the MOPHP to manage, plan, and deliver basic health
   services and priority public health programs at the central level and in ten selected
   districts in the three targeted governorates.

1.2 PROJECT COMPONENTS

The revised project comprised the following (sub-) components:

Component 1    Improvement of National Health Programs and Basic Health Services
Sub-Component 1.1   Decentralized Operational Management
Sub-Component 1.2   A Package of National Programs and Basic Health Services
                    supporting the following programs:
                    a) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)
                    b) Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)
                    c) Emergency Obstetrical Care (EmOC)
                    d) Family Health
                    e) Disease Surveillance (equipment and supplies)
                    f) Civil Works and Equipment for selected health facilities

Component 2            Capacity Building in the following areas:
Sub-Component 2.1      Malaria
Sub-Component 2.2      Health Education
Sub-Component 2.3      Health Finance and Health Management Training
Sub-Component 2.4      Health Management Information System (HMIS)

Component 3            Credit Administration and Project Coordination

1.3 FINANCING

The project was financed by a credit of SDR 22.2 million (US$27.53 million equivalent)
from the IDA (CR 3625 ­ YEM), and a contribution of US$2.07 million from the
Government of Yemen. Due to fluctuations in the value of the US dollar, the credit value
reached around US$36 million at the end of 2007/early 2008, and then dropped down to
around US$33 million in late 2008 and reached US$34.7 million in August 2009.

2. QUALITY AT ENTRY

The overall quality at entry was satisfactory.
The development objective was relevant and appropriate to Yemen's needs at that time
and the specific objectives were consistent with the identified needs of Yemen's Health
Sector and the sectoral development strategy being pursued by the Government and
development partners.




                                          57
The project components were also generally consistent with the identified priorities and
needs of the health sector. However, the project was originally designed to support
implementation of the 1998 Health Sector Reform Program which emphasized the
development of a district health system model which relied in large part on strengthening
management at the local level and decentralizing administration. While the principles
remained valid, full implantation of the reform program was hampered by the slow pace
of implementation of the government­wide decentralization program that is still in
transition as the decentralization concept has yet to be supported by different regulations,
infrastructure training and bylaws to ensure proper practices of resource management.
There was an overall lack of clarity about decentralization and its implications for the
health services or the essential components of strengthening district health systems.

Furthermore, the project's major component was designed to provide a package of
Integrated Maternal and Child Health services, against a context of largely vertical donor-
supported programs.

While the project was designed and prepared with full collaboration between the
government and World Bank missions, and involved different MOPHP departments,
there was dependency on one sector in particular, which lead to weakening the ownership
among other departments of other sectors during implementation; Furthermore
implementation was weakened and slowed as a result of the high turnover of the MOPHP
officials/staff. Finally, the initial Project Administrator of the Credit Administration Unit
was a new manager and therefore less acquainted with the policies and procedures for
management of IDA-financed credits.

Given the project's overall poor performance and slow pace of project implementation
during the first three years of project implementation, the Mid Term Review (MTR)
(concluded in October 2005) maintained the rating of the project as unsatisfactory and
several fundamental and strategic approach changes were proposed to the government,
the most important of which applied to the PIMAC component (shifting to focus on
strengthening what was working (outreach and selected vertical programs) and
minimizing what was not (facility-based care)), proposing the application of the Rapid
Result Approach (RRA); and out-sourcing civil works to the Public Works Project and
procurement to UN agencies where applicable.

3.     IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

After applying RRA and restructuring the project, the judgment of the implementation
was more positive and the implementation status rating was increased from unsatisfactory
to moderately satisfactory and then to satisfactory. The rating for achievement of the
PDOs changed from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory to satisfactory in mid 2007.
The rating was subsequently downgraded to moderately satisfactory in December 2007 as
"The project has not progressed in assessing the achievement of outputs and outcomes.
The mission advised the CAU to follow up with the component managers the
implementation of follow up visits to assess and collect data on service provision and



                                             58
utilization, as well as to consider the preparation for an independent end-of-project
evaluation study" (Mission Aide Memoire December 2007).

The commitment of the government to apply RRA was remarkably successful. Applying
several rounds of RRA helped provide clear work plans, and encouraged competition
among the various program stakeholders (see attached Sourcebook ­ Yemen RRA Case
Study). The improved management and stability of HRSP since 2006 can also be
attributed to the support of the leadership of the MOPHP, MOF and MOPIC, and the
World Bank continued to provide active support from headquarters and even more so
from the Country Office.

Most of the activities targeted through the different project components were started and
completed, and most of measurable indicators were met (some were exceeded) - please
see the attached HRSP Monitoring Table. The HRSP supported the implementation of
six outcome studies which covered key project interventions (Integrated Management of
Child Illness (IMCI), Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC), Malaria, Health Education,
District Planning and National Centre for Health Management Training). The outcome
studies concluded achievement of certain outcomes, including the availability of trained
staff in IMCI in all targeted districts (and other districts beyond the targeted districts).
This training and the availability of IMCI drugs procured through HRSP helped to
increase public health services credibility and utilization of IMCI services. HRSP helped
to establish and support a favorable environment for providing EmOC services by
renovating, expanding, equipping and training available staff from 15 health facilities
targeted to provide EmOC (basic and comprehensive) services and helped to establish a
Training of Trainers (TOT) program for EmOC.

During the last two years of project implementation, the MOPHP issued several decrees,
some of which were as a result of World Bank mission field visit findings related to the
poor performance of management of targeted health facilities which were jeopardizing
achievement of the HRSP PDOs. These decrees were targeted to health offices and local
councils in coordination with their related Governors to ensure good management of the
upgraded health facilities. This effort resulted in changing management in the health
office in Ibb governorate, Bajel Hospital, Biet Alfaqieh Hospital and Alqutie health
center in Hodieda governorate, and changing the manger of Alghres health centre in
Sana'a Governorate.

In early 2009, H.E the Minister of Health formed a committee composed of members of
MOPHP Planning Sector and Medical Sector, and headed by the head of the MOPHP
Personnel Department to work towards filling the gaps of health staff in each HRSP
targeted facility. Efforts were done through this committee to explore existing technical
and administrative staff available in the three targeted governorates from available
ministry statistical data and field visit reports. The committee achieved remarkable work
by assessing existing staff and needs and recommended redistribution of existing staff
and identified additional required staff. The committee managed to support some of the
health facilities with some new required staff such as in Yareem hospital/Ibb, and
redistributed staff in Sana'a governorate that enabled Almnar hospital to have some

                                            59
midwives to provide RH/FP services. Work is ongoing to enroll some of the qualified
staff working in a volunteering capacity in Alhodiedah and Ibb.

The Government, represented by the MOPHP, is pursuing its efforts to support the
facilities with more staff to fill the gaps in service provision and make use of the new
equipment procured through the HRSP. The government succeeded this month (October
2009) to include a running budget for Yareem Hospital - one of the biggest financed
projects of HRSP in Ibb governorate - including 50 new health staff posts which are to
commence in 2010; the hospital started to work in August 2009 - immediately after hand
over from the Public Works.

Project investment by year and component provides an indication of project success
and/or failure during the project's life time. As previously noted, until 2005 the project
demonstrated slow progress (12 percent disbursement of total credit in the first three
years). The project's second "start" was in 2006 with a 32 percent disbursement rate,
explained by a number of positive factors, notably administrative changes, human
resource inputs, prioritizing of activities, RRA approach, etc. Over the 2006-2009 period,
the remainder of the Credit amount was disbursed (100% of the total credit).

3.1 Project Implementation by Component

Component 1: Improvement of National Health Programs and Basic Health
Services

Sub-Component 1.1: Decentralized Operational Management (DOM)

1.1.   The HRSP support to DOM activities included international training of 21
managers from MOPHP at central and governorate levels, and in-country training of 692
managerial personnel from the targeted 10 District Management Teams (DMTs) and 3
Governorate health offices. The training aimed at improving the managerial and
technical skills in planning, management, English and computers. One of the main
achievements of DOM was formation and training of District Management Teams
(DMTs) and overseeing the development of annual district plans for two consecutive
years (2007 and 2008). These plans reflected adequate planning skills. The
implementation of the district plans was supported by the Local Councils at district and
governorate levels. However, supervision of health facilities by district and governorate
teams was constrained by the lack of resources allocated for supervision.

Sub-Component 1.2: Delivery of a Package of National Programs and Basic Health
Services

1.2    EPI. With the HRSP funding for the implementation of the vaccination program,
the EPI program steadily maintained its yearly outcomes with national coverage per
antigen above 85% and thereby was successful in preventing every year any outbreak.
Funding for EPI implementation is secured until the end of 2010 with 50­60% of



                                           60
Government funds and support from the GAVI ISS and HSS as well as from UNICEF
and WHO.

1.3      IMCI. Since the 2006 restructuring, HRSP has substantially contributed to the
national roll-out of the IMCI strategy achieving remarkable outputs: (i) the adaptation of
curriculums and their production, (ii) training of trainers at central level, (iii) for 180
districts, more than 2000 facility-based providers trained in 11-day course, 458
community-based promoters trained in IMCI family practices, and three semi-annual
supervisions carried out which started in July 2007, and (iv) the provision of quarterly
outreach services by integrated multidisciplinary mobile teams. Over the previous six
months, the program succeeded in maintaining its current outcome of 54% national
coverage and related beneficiaries of 1.5 million under five year old children that have
access to IMCI services.



1.4     Reproductive Health: Maternal and Neonatal Health ­ Emergency
Obstetrical Care (EmOC). The EmOC 15 targeted health facilities and some related
accommodations supported by HRSP funding were all completed by April 2009. All
equipment was delivered and the training of staff in their use was completed in August
2009.The project provided support to upgrade 117 health cadres to improve the skills of
EmOC services providers. The training included 4 staff categories (Community
Midwives (CMWs); Supervisors Community Midwives (SCMWs); Anesthetists
Assistants; and Obstetric Doctors). The latter category were awarded diploma in
gynecology and obstetrics. Most of the graduates are deployed to the original facilities
they were nominated from; the 45 SCMWs are playing an active and positive role in the
delivery of EmOC and MCH/FP services; and most of the 45 CMWs are volunteering in
health facilities, MOPHP, governorates and local councils are working to enroll them as
of the year 2010.



1.5    EmOC protocols and guidelines were developed and endorsed by the Population
Sector/MOPHP in December 2007 with the technical assistance from an international
consultant from Colombia University and in coordination with WHO Consultants.


Training of 14 EmOC high caliber doctors and midwives as trainers (TOT) in June 2009
and training of 24 EmOC staff /midwives took place in August 2009. This training, with
developed protocols and guidelines, will furnish the way towards a unified and
systematic approach to EmOC service provision which can be duplicated in other Yemen
governorates.

HRSP provided support to train 35 middle RH Managers at governorate and district
levels at the National Centre for Health Management Training.




                                            61
1.6      Family Health since the 2006 restructuring, HRSP has funded the pilot
implementation of the integrated primary health care-reproductive health (IPHC-RH)
curriculum in targeted governorates, including curriculum development and pre-testing.
With joint funding from HRSP and GAVI­HSS, the training of trainers on IPHC­RH in
26 districts and training of providers in 17 districts were completed in early 2009.
However, as HRSP funding has ended, the supervision of trained providers in 250
facilities and training of the same in integrated outreach services were completed only in
some of the HSS funded districts. Since the training and first supervision took place only
few months ago, outputs and outcomes remain to be seen.


1.7      Disease Surveillance. The HRSP investments in equipment, clinical and
laboratory supplies were critical to the improvement of permanent communication with
districts and governorates for the purpose of disease surveillance. HRSP funding
provided inputs and improved processes to increase of completeness (70%) and
timeliness of reporting of the seven diseases from the 21 Governorate coordinators and
609 focal persons.

1.8     Schistosomiasis. Over the life of the restructured HRSP, three campaigns of
mass treatment of school-age children were completed in 92 districts in 16 governorates,
and treated over 1.7 million school-age children. The last and fourth campaign was
partially funded by HRSP for 17 districts. The Schistosomiasis Control Campaign is
ongoing, and has been taken up under a new IDA funded project, the Yemen
Schistosomiasis Control Project, with technical assistance from WHO.

1.9      Civil Works and Equipment. HRSP out-sourced the completion of the civil
work program to the Public Works Project (PWP) to do the rehabilitation and extension
of five district hospitals and 17 health centers, and equipping the facilities rehabilitated.
It is also financed minor rehabilitation of the MOPHP offices. Civil works at all 22
facilities (total US$5,192,430) as well as rehabilitation works at the MOPHP offices
(US$289,560) have been completed and handed over. Medical equipment and furniture
have been delivered to all facilities.

Component 2: Capacity Building

Sub-Component 2.1: Malaria

The program received various support from the HRSP including 14 four-wheel drive
vehicles to strengthen the governorate supervision system, and 50 motorcycles for
malaria control field workers. The project procured and delivered 175000 LLINs for
pregnant women and under 5 children and 350 hand sprayers. The Project also trained
530 doctors, technicians, and community volunteers as part of integral actions to
synergize protective, preventive and diagnostic malaria rollback strategies.

Sub-Component 2.2: Health Education



                                             62
The HRSP was the main funding source for the Health Education Department. The
Project funded the construction and equipping the National Centre for Health Education;
development of awareness raising messages on newspapers and radio for several health
themes, including: RH, EPI, Malaria and Schistosomiasis; installed TV/Video sets in 60
health facilities for HE activities; trained 333 health education coordinators at district
level; helped to establish a Health education Nationwide Network which emphasized the
inter personnel health education channel; and assisted in running campaigns through
these districts coordinators.

The project also supported external training in media production for key staff; production
of TV spots and sketches with participation of TV celebrities; TOT on communication
techniques; training of health providers, community volunteers; and implementation of
HE campaigns using mobile cinema.

Sub-Component 2.3: Health Finance and Management

Health Finance. HRSP support to health finance themes included financing for a Study
on Health Insurance (co-financed by local funds and WHO; completed in 2004); two
PERs covering the years 1999­2000 and 2004-2007; Comparative Analysis on
Operational Cost and Maintenance; Development Training Manual on Governorates
Accounts; Development of National Health Accounts 2007; Study on Cost Sharing in
Public Health Services; and Survey on Development Partners Contribution to Health
Sector. All these contributions provide valuable references for the government to better
plan and work with the donors to finalize the National Health program.

Health Management. The HRSP support to the Health Management Training Center
(NCHMT) provided a substantial lift to the role of the center in supporting the health
system. The project funded the construction of a second floor in the building which
increased the center's capacity; funded the training of 225 trainees from all governorates
in management, planning, leadership, etc; funded a diploma course for 20 managers, a 5-
month course for 20 hospital directors; the development of 20 management training
modules; and provided advance training (abroad) for five of the center's main trainers.
During the World Banks last mission in May 2009, the mission reported in the Aide
Memoire that managers expressed satisfaction with the training received and confirmed
that the training has contributed to improving their management skills. However, they
faced institutional challenges to apply the knowledge and skills gained. The NCHMT is
continuing to conduct training for different levels of health personnel on different health
aspects - mainly supported by health partners.
Sub-Component 2.4: Health Management Information System (HMIS)

The project supported the HIMS Department to procure different office technical tools
which the HMIS Department is to use to produce data and maps of health facilities.
HRSP also supported the HMIS Department by investing in the computer training lab
(constructed and equipped by the project) which provides training to different levels of
health staff. The computer lab has conducted 11 courses (up to June 30, 2009 ) trained


                                            63
183 staff from different governorates on different IT related aspects such as GIS, Health
Analyzer, Information System, and research through the internet .

The project funded: a well equipped GIS Unit; construction and equipping of a computer
training lab (10 workstations and a server); equipped a videoconference room; printing
and delivery of health registers; training for staff at the centre and targeted Governorates
on information tools, information monitoring system, and GIS; equipped targeted
Governorate health offices with computers and software; and provided hardware and
software for the Personnel Department to automate some of their national personnel
management systems, especially between the centre and governorate levels.

Project Management

The Credit Administration Unit (CAU). The Project was administered through the
CAU which was composed of seven core staff (Administrator, Procurement Specialist,
Technical Coordinator, Financial Manger, and Accountant. Monitoring Officer and
Executive Secretary). A Procurement Advisor was supported from the PHRD grant.

One year prior to the close of the project, the CAU administered the project with only
five core staff (the technical coordinator and the monitoring officer resigned for personal
reasons) and the Procurement Advisor contract was completed with the end of the PHRD
grant in 2008.

Steering Committee (SC). The SC has been very active and provided good support to
the CAU for project implementation. The committee has supported the project in various
ways including quick approval of project activities, resolving financial/payment issues,
etc. It is worthwhile to note that H.E. the Minister of MOPHP has been attending most of
the meetings, and has been fully informed of project activities. The MOF and MOPIC
has been also very supportive of and facilitated project implementation.

Monitoring and Evaluation.           The CAU continued to effectively monitor the
implementation progress with inputs from the General Department of Research and
Statistics (HMIS), which receives its information from health facilities and district offices
trained under the HRSP. The project monitoring indicators table used to be updated
regularly and is used as the key tool for assessing project progress and effectiveness. The
CAU, with the support and commitment of different MOPHP sector leaders, managed to
keep proper utilization of the Project Monitoring and Evaluation system designed and
supported by an international consultancy firm in 2007. Due to the importance of the
EmOC services and the investment of HRSP in this aspect, the Project has assigned a
national consultant to monitor the completion of EmOC activities and the
operationalization of the facilities providing basic and comprehensive EmOC services.
Based on consultant findings, the CAU organized three governorate meetings to report on
issues and shortcomings observed during the monitoring visits to Governorate health
offices. Governors of two governorates were keen to attend these meetings and provided
support and decisions were taken immediately. The EmOC monitoring initiative, lead by
a well experienced and respected national consultant contracted by the Project, is

                                             64
evolving to an initiative supporting the promotion and activation of the role of
Governorate Quality Teams in supervising and supporting the delivery of MNCH
services with a focus on RH/EmOC.

The project conducted six rapid assessment studies to review the impact of different
programs supported by the Project, including: District Planning; IMCI; Management
Training; Malaria; EmOC; Health Education; and Infrastructure. All studies were
completed and their findings were presented and discussed with different stakeholders for
follow-up and lessons learned. These studies provided valuable inputs to the project
evaluation and the ICR.

The project's Independent Impact Evaluation was finalized and report was submitted and
discussed on August 26, 2009. This report is also a key source of information for the
ICR.

4. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE

The Government of Yemen fulfilled most of its responsibilities as required by the project
in a satisfactory manner, including the provision of the local commitments of
US$410,000 to offset some of the cost overruns.

The government of Yemen fulfilled its responsibilities throughout the project period, and
showed full concern and cooperation with the World Bank missions to assess and
evaluate the slow pace of the project's implementation at the first three years. The
Government of Yemen, represented by the MOPIC, MOF and MOPHP studied
respectfully the project MTR review findings and recommendations and worked firmly
and steadily towards the implementation of those recommendations and the opportunities
provided (such as the adoption of RRA) to give a new and strong take off to the project in
2006.

The MOPHP in early 2006 took the challenge to elevate the project status and committed
to all the recommendations, included contracting with UN Agencies working in the
health sector to procure drugs, vehicles, Contraceptives Disease Surveillance related
items, out-sourcing the civil work to the Public Works Project, and changing the
management of the CAU - with close follow up to project different component and
implementation by the CAU and other different health departments directors general
including those of the HMIS, Malaria, and Health Finance at the ministry level.

The Project Coordination Committee (PCC) was one of the original implementation tools
of the project, but due to lack of ownership and dependency on one sector with the initial
design of the project at its early stages, irregular meetings were held but with no follow
up and with only ad hoc commitments. In early 2006, the project replaced the PCC with
the RRA meetings and the Steering Committee continued to convene every 4-6 months.
SC meetings were given high priority at the ministry leadership level and by other
government's partners. The SC was always headed by H.E the Minister of Health and



                                           65
was always effective and provided decisions on time to facilitate project implementation,
approving plans and problem solving.

5. FINANCIER'S PERFORMANCE

The Financier fulfilled most of its responsibilities in a timely manner and was very
flexible in its approach to project implementation as evidenced by decisions to
recommend the RRA, providing technical assistance from the World Bank Institute to
facilitate the implementation of this tool/technique and continued technical assistance for
five rounds of the RRA. Each RRA round assisted in the development and finalizing of
the procurement plan for the project and for the first time in the project life, these plans
were included in the financial system that produced reports based on actuals. Since early
2007 and based on the RRA developed plans, the CAU began to produce FMRs which
included both planed and actual disbursements.

More evidence of the Financier's flexibility was the approval of out-sourcing the civil
work to the Public Work Project, which contributed to effectively completing the
rehabilitation of the 22 health facility and some of MOPHP offices in a timely and cost
effective manner. Procurement through UN agencies helped to speed up procurement
procedures with keeping the quality required.

The Financier was diligent in the monitoring of project implementation with all half­
yearly visits being done on schedule. This proved to be a very important component of
project implementation and is probably one of the major factors that influenced the
ability of the project to achieve as much as it has. In each supervision activity, the
mission worked closely with the CAU and the project component managers to update the
project indicators/monitoring table and to provide recommendations and tasks to assist
the government to implement the project and achieve the project PDOs. The Aide
Memoires prepared at the end of each visit were very useful in identifying tasks to be
accomplished to facilitate smooth project implementation. They proved very useful in
assisting the Borrower to plan priority activities for the upcoming periods.

The impact of this monitoring activity has in different stages of project implantation
proved very effective. During the initial stage of the project, a decision was made to do
the MTR six months earlier than originally planned which provided findings and
recommendations to help the government to implement the project effectively and in a
timely manner. The impact of the monitoring activities during the second stage and after
restructuring, with the commitment of the government, lead to full utilization of the credit
with different good outcomes by the end of the project in August 2009.

The Financier Country Office was always good at providing timely help, open
communication and on-the- spot consultations. This provided continuous support to
expedite CAU procedures. The availability of the Task Team leader in the country office
was also an added value for timely technical advice and implementation support and
provided on time clarification for letters of no objections.



                                            66
Finally, it worth mentioning that the CCPP Committee and the role of the Financier in
this committee with government members proved to be of good support for CAU
management institutionalization, solving problems for CAU staff and clarifying
different roles and responsibilities of different administration problems.

6.       FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

Factor within the control of the Borrower and Implementation Agencies

A number of factors affected project implementation and outcome. Those within the
control of Borrower included:

     ·   Ambitious project design. The original project design was too ambitious. In
         retrospect, it was unrealistic to expect that centrally­managed integration of
         services could be developed without a corresponding fundamental shift in the way
         in which the MOPHP operates the rules which govern staffing of the MOPHP and
         its incentive structures, and the relationship with the centre, governorate and
         district management systems. Moreover, several key national strategies were
         missing, such as an overall human resource development plan, national
         surveillance system and disease monitoring and reporting, and a national quality
         improvement strategy.

     ·   There was insufficient involvement of Governorates Health Offices in project
         preparation and implementation.
     ·   There were considerable delays in selecting the targeted districts (the selection
         was only completed in September 2004). This caused corresponding delays in the
         completion of the baseline surveys and needs assessment, as well as contracting
         consultants to manage the civil works and medical equipment program, which
         was reflected in the delayed project implementation and lack of progress towards
         achievement of the PDOs before restructuring.
     ·   High turnover among managers of components and sector leaders, inactive
         coordination across departments and lack of ownership (decentralization &
         verticality).


Factors within the Control of the CAU

Project implementation plan (PIP) prepared during project preparation were never
transferred to the Planning departments when implementation began. There was
therefore no strategic guide for use by the component mangers. In August 2003, there
was another effort to to prepare a PIP but it was unadequate.

Lack of experience and skills in managing World Bank projects was evidenced in the
selection of the first two CAU managers.
Low effort of CAU at early stages of project implementation to improve communication
and coordination between project components and the CAU.

7. LESSONS LEARNED



                                            68
·   New projects should focus on a sector-oriented approach with a clear
    development agenda by all partners.
·   The involvement of the Ministry in designing the project should be based on all
    sectors collaboration and ownership, including infrastructure.
·   Structures supporting better coordination between the MOPHP sectors are to be
    strengthened.
·   The design of the project should be simple, clear and consistent with
    organizational needs and capacities.
·   District Health System development could be piloted based on the National
    Model of District in 1-2 Governorates.
·   Selection of targeted project governorates and districts should be selected during
    the design of the project period.
·   M&E system should be in place during the preparation phase of the new projects.
·   Financial and human resources management should be included in any new
    program.
·   It is important to strengthen supervision of individual health workers and health
    facilities alike in order to enhance the quality of care for the population.
·   Involve targeted governorates and districts in project planning and
    implementation.
·   New projects should be planned within the context of the Health National
    Program.
·   The cost of implementation and sustainability should be carefully considered.

Population
By Stephan Pahls and Dr. Fowzia Jaffer

(Third Edition - 2008)

   ·   As Yemen's new Minister of Health, Dr. Rasea gave strong support to the
       implementation of the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) methodology, helping it to
       succeed by fostering a commitment to results from stakeholders at all levels.

   ·   The development of results and benchmarking for each project through the RRA
       methodology paved the road for good implementation and valid monitoring.

   ·   The success of the RRA in Yemen has led to the suggestion of scaling up and
       institutionalizing the RRA in other projects and in the planning and execution of
       other donor programs, many of which suffer from similar implementation
       problems.


1. Introduction

1.1 Yemen's Health Reform Support Project (HRSP) was launched in 2002 to (a)
increase access for women and children to a package of integrated maternal and child
health services, provided in district hospitals and health centers in selected districts; and
(b) improve the effectiveness of national public health programs and resource allocation
within the public health sector in Yemen. Project development objectives were clear, but
the project indicators, inputs, and implementation mechanisms were vague, with few key
performance indicators.

1.2 During the early stages of implementation, this lack of detail, combined with low
capacity in the Ministry of Health and Population (MOPHP), created major obstacles to
implementation.

1.3 The project's Midterm Review in May/June 2005 concluded that little progress had
been achieved on the objectives because of the slow pace of implementation, which led to
discussions about canceling the project. During 2005, the slow implementation of the
HRSP and another large Bank project became serious liabilities for the government of
Yemen, culminating in an announcement by the World Bank in December 2005 that it
would cut funding to the government by 34 percent because of unsatisfactory progress in
the national reform agenda, governance issues, and lack of progress in a few "problem
projects." Other donors also expressed their dissatisfaction. In addition, the United States


                                             73
dropped Yemen as a candidate for its highly publicized Millennium Challenge Account
for similar reasons.

1.4 In response to the situation, the Government of Yemen formulated the National
Agenda for Reform, a six-month action plan adopted by the Cabinet in January 2006; and
on February 11, 2006, the Government announced a major reshuffling of the Cabinet,
replacing 15 of the existing 35 ministers, including the MOPHP. A sense of urgency ran
high as the President sought to turn things around. New leadership within the MOPHP
introduced the Rapid Results Approach (RRA), putting the HRSP back on track, proving
that MOPHP could deliver, and building capacity and new confidence for managing
change throughout the MOPHP.

2. Leadership and Efforts to Strengthen Results-Based Management

2.1 The RRA was introduced at a five-day workshop in February 2006 attended by all
relevant stakeholders--minister, deputy ministers, component managers, and
representatives of the Ministries of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) and
Finance (MOF). The RRA takes the approach of setting short-term goals as a step toward
achieving the overall objectives, and the workshop prioritized nine targets to be achieved
within the next 100 days. The new Minister of MOPHP, Dr. Abdoul Kareem Yehia
Rasea, took up his post on the first day of the workshop. Conscious that adopting the
RRA was vital to save HRSP project funds and ensure the success of the project, Dr.
Rasea not only immediately supported the process, but also led it. He attended the entire
workshop, which was an unprecedented assertion of leadership and high-level support,
sending a message to the deputy ministerial level and throughout the MOPHP that the
success of the HRSP was a priority. Four RRA workshops took place between February
2006 and May 2007. The RRA improved access to information, enabling the Ministry
and donors to better see the problems and their underlying causes, instead of simply
reacting to and then treating the symptoms. By opening a dialogue with MOPIC and
MOF, Dr. Rasea promoted practical problem solving and the removal of bureaucratic
hurdles. A few weeks after taking office, he also changed the head of the Credit
Administration Unit (CAU), bringing in someone with a track record as an effective
manager and communicator. The Minister also offered the necessary support to CAU to
keep the project moving in the right direction.

2.2 During the Midterm Review the project had been restructured, and subsequent RRA
workshops were used to operationalize the changes. While the restructuring faced
considerable resistance at the beginning (with managers of underperforming
subcomponents refusing to scale back their activities), the introduction of targets and
participatory processes with the RRA made the whole process more transparent and
logical, winning over the opposition. The application of the RRA had an effect on the
roles and expectation of leadership, and on the emergence of teamwork, leading to
changes in the way traditional hierarchies engaged in the decision-making process with
other stakeholders in project implementation. A growing sense of ownership and
accountability for results was described by Dr. Majad Alijunaid, Deputy Minister of the
Health Care Sector, as follows:

                                           74
       "In implementation, leaders find themselves accountable to implementers at
       higher and lower levels, and they are accountable at the community level. The
       leader becomes more results-oriented, as the process is taken on by the team,
       holding the leader accountable in terms that are defined by indicators at the
       outcome level. Teams, not leaders, decide what the targets will be, so the leaders
       have to delegate some of the decisions about how the work gets done. RRA team
       members report to the team, and they are all on a first-name basis. The RRA has
       brought an approach to teamwork that is less hierarchical, with improved working
       relationships."

3. Results Achieved

3.1 After the first two RRA workshops, results were already emerging. The project
implementation rating improved from unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory. This
improvement gave the project new life and brought about an agreement to restructure it
by modifying goals to be more consistent with the timeframe. A one-year extension of
the program was also granted. By May 2008, disbursements of the project credit had
increased by nearly 87 percent. After four rounds of applying the RRA, the teams
achieved almost all planned activities and developed a two-year results framework to
cover the remaining life of the project. From June 2006 onward, project implementation
improved and significant progress was made on achieving project objectives.

3.2 A New Results Culture. In addition to increased disbursements and improved
implementation, there were learning gains from capacity building. By helping MOPHP
staff meet and exceed their targets, the RRA strengthened their confidence, motivation,
and leadership skills. After some initial success increasing disbursements, the RRA teams
shifted their focus to contributing to the emergence of a results-based culture in the
MOPHP. During the December 2006 workshop, when the action plan (and monitoring
plan) for the remainder of the project were developed, the development objectives were
put at the center of the planning exercise and the component targets were aligned with the
project indicators. This exercise helped the RRA teams develop new skills and capacities
in results management. The fact that RRA activities were assessed and monitored by
Minister Rasea and other stakeholders at the end of each 100 days in a workshop also
fostered a healthy sense of competition and responsibility to achieve targets at the project
component level.

3.3 Increased Accountability. Another positive achievement was improved cooperation
between the MOPHP and outside stakeholders, especially MOPIC and MOF. Long-
standing tensions with the MOF were set aside in favor of a better working relationship.
For example, the MOF used to take weeks to release funds for implementation because
activities were unclear and there were no implementation plans. Once the RRA initiative
was put in place the MOF became actively involved, processing CAU requests in a
matter of hours instead of weeks. Mentioning "100-day goals" when submitting a request
to the MOF is said to open doors and ensure prompt staff attention to the project! There is
a very similar relationship with MOPIC, whose staff are responsible for approving

                                            75
activities and targets and ensuring that credit funds are used properly, and who now feel
personally committed to the success of the project.

3.4 Improvements in M&E. At the time the RRA was introduced, the HRSP did not
have a systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation (M&E). In the absence of an
active project coordination committee, the three rounds of RRA workshops begun in
2006 provided the opportunity for some coordination at the facility level, and allowed for
the exchange of information on the status of each component. It was proposed that RRA
workshops continue to be used as mechanisms to review and monitor the implementation
plans, in lieu of the coordination committee meetings. Each component team developed a
two-year (2007-2008) target with quarterly benchmarks and draft corresponding budgets,
finalized and approved in March 2007, which was used to assess progress and
expenditures over the two-year period. The fourth- and fifth-round RRA workshops
(December 2007 and May 2008, respectively) were held to review the two-year
performance and make necessary programmatic or financial adjustments for the last year
of the program.

4. Lessons Learned and Challenges Overcome

   ·   Strong senior-level leadership is vital to the success of results-oriented
       reforms. Dr. Rasea's leadership as the new Minister of Health was instrumental
       to the success of the RRA. His dedication to improving the impact and
       accountability of health projects fostered a new results culture across ministries.

   ·   The RRA is a way of making large-scale change happen incrementally. The
       approach was introduced gradually, with gradual expansion of number of targets;
       only during the third round was full emphasis put on the fact that all activities
       must directly support the project's development objectives. The approach was
       simple, with clear guidelines, and introduced by competent facilitators.

   ·   Linking leadership with results clarifies roles, fosters transparency, and
       builds ownership. Because clear responsibilities were assigned to component
       managers, accountability was greater, progress was measurable, and the sense of
       ownership was increased. The methodology helped component managers to know
       what was expected, partners to know where the issues/bottlenecks were, and the
       ministry leadership to monitor effectively and follow up/intervene where
       necessary.

   ·   RRA led to a reorientation away from inputs towards results. Competition
       increased pressure on component teams to perform, but also allowed for
       recognition of people who were doing well.

   ·   With crisis comes opportunity. The crisis played an important role in mobilizing
       support for the RRA within the MOPHP leadership and among the deputy
       ministers. This resulted in strong ownership of the RRA from the top and from the
       beginning. Since donor dissatisfaction and threats of funding cuts put the

                                           76
       performance of the HRSP high on the agenda for the whole government, all three
       new ministers (MOPHP, MOF, and MOPIC) had strong incentives to turn it
       around.


   ·   The RRA contributed to the successful restructuring of the project by moving
       it from a narrow focus on an overambitious package of integrated services at the
       district level to more tangible and realistic evidence-based interventions
       supporting the development objectives.

   ·   There is no one-size-fits-all approach. What matters most is that the results
       achieved are in line with the country's objectives and mechanisms that make
       sense in the country context. Leadership, ownership, and partnership, the
       application of the RRA as an appropriate methodology, and the enabling
       environment (timing) were all important factors for achieving rapid results.

5. Conclusion

5.1 The success of the RRA in Yemen has led to the suggestion of scaling up and
institutionalizing the RRA in other projects and in the planning and execution of other
donor programs, many of which suffer from similar implementation problems. There are
two entry points for scaling up: (a) MOPIC, with its mandate for donor harmonization
and alignment, is the natural entry point for broadening the approach into other sectors;
and (b) the ongoing Health Sector Review (HSRev) could be an entry point for scaling up
in the MOPHP and among the MOPHP's partners. The HSRev could evaluate the
potential for scaling up the RRA while at the same time applying it to some of the HSRev
components, particularly where there are multiple stakeholders. However, there are
challenges to scalability; at present there is no sector wide approach under which Yemen
can pool donor resources, and government funds constitute the majority of resources in
the public health sector.

5.2 Beyond bringing a single project back on track, it seems that the RRA has
strengthened leadership and confidence in the MOPHP on different levels, including (a)
the position of the Minister of Health and Population in the Cabinet, (b) the
implementation capacity and confidence of component managers, and (c) the confidence
of deputy ministers to manage change more successfully. The Minister of Health would
like to expand this approach to other projects and programs throughout the ministry, and
has also said that there is a need to eventually expand it to encompass the entire
institution. MOPIC is another promising entry point for moving forward. There is still a
need for training and raising awareness, and for support and planning for
institutionalizing the RRA.

5.3 The availability of coaches is critically important for scaling up. A team of senior
ministry staff was selected for RRA training. The training should be delivered soon,
should be intensive, and should be followed by immediate application of the
methodology--for example, in the context of the HSRev. Delays in the process would

likely result in a loss of momentum. Building the capacity of a team of MOPHP staff
(potentially to be complemented by local consultants) is very important for reducing
dependence on the staff of international donor organizations. This will increase
sustainability and lower the threshold for other partners to buy in and make use of the
process.
