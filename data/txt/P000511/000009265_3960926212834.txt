FINANCIAL RENABn-UT ION CREDIT
CREDIT AND PROGRUM StNEARY
Borrower:           Republic of Chad
Benef_ciaries:      Republic of Chad and COTONTCHAD
Credit Amounts:
IDA:              SDR 11.9 million (US$16.2 million equivalent)
African Facilitys SDR 15.7 million (US$21.3 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity
Standard SFA terms with 50 years maturity
Descriptions        The proposed credit would support the first phase of
the Government's adjustment program outlined in the
Policy Framework  Paper  (1987-90).   The  principal
objectives of this phase of the program are to
improve resource use in two important areas of the
economy: public finance and the cotton sector.   The
measures in public finance are designed to increase
budgetary  .evenues,  augment   development-oriented
current   expenditures,   and   improve   investment
programming. The economic and financial viability
of  the  cotton  sector will be  improved  through
measures to reduce costs of the cotton parastatal,
improve  extension  and  research,  strengthen   the
sector's institutional set-up, and reform pricing
policy.   The  program  also  aims  to  resolve  the
problem  of  COTONTCHAD's  arrears  to  the  banking
system.  In addition,  the program includes  studies
to prepare future adjustment measures in public
finance/administration,   the   public    enterprise
sector, and agriculture.
Benefits
and Risks:          The main benefits of the financial rehabilitation
program would be improvements in government revenues
and expenditures, increased viability of the cotton
sector in economic and financial terms, and an
improved financial position of the public sector.
The program would also strengthen the basis for
higher economic growth in the medium term. As other
operations in Chad, the program is subject to risks
resulting from external factors (drought and renewed
border conflicts) which could delay policy actions
and absorb substantial government resources. Risks



(ti)
inherent in the program are that the Government
might not be able to implement policy actions cue to
internal  political  resistance  or  that   farmers'
responses to cotton reform measures are not as
anticipated. Efforts to reduce these risks to an
acceptable  level   have   been  taken,   e.g.,   by
implementing the reforms gradually.

TO THE EXECUTI   DIECTORS ON A  PROOSD         V        CREDIT
AND A PROPOSED ARCAN FACILITY CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ClAD FOR A
FINANCIAL REHAIILITAON PROGRUM
1.        I submit the following report and recomendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad in the amount of SDR 11.9
million (US$16.2 million equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help
finance  a  financial  rehabilitation   program.   It  is  proposed   to
supplement this credit with a credit of SDR 15.7 million (US$21.3
million equivalent) from the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa
(the African Facility) established by resolution No. IDA 85-1, of May
21, 1985. and with special joint financing of SR17 million (US$4.5
million  equivalent)  from  the  Saudi  Fund.   The  program  would   be
cofinanced by the African  Develo-ment Fund through a  credit of FUA  30
million (US$38.3 million equivalent).
I.  TEE ECONY
2.        The following assessment  of the Chadian  economy is based  on
the Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 6785-CD) distributed to the
Executive Directors in October 1987 and on missions that visited Chad in
1987 and 1988 to help the Government prepare its adjustment program.
Annex I contains economic indicators.
A. Backaround
3.        Although Chad has considerable  agricultural and some  mineral
potential, its economic development has been hampered by a landlocked
location, volatile climatic conditions, as well as periods of conflict
for most of the time since its independence in 1960. Crop production
and livestock account for nearly half of Chad's GDP and provide a living
for 90S of its population of 5.2 million. Population growth is only
2.4Z, and the balance of population to arable land remains quite
favorable compared  to  other  Sabelian countries.   During  periods  of
normal rainfall, Chad has been self-sufficient in cereals. Cotton and
livestock are the main export products. Industry contributes about
one-fifth of GDP and is dominated by a few large enterprises producing,
apart from cotton, consumer goods for the domestic market.
4.        Economic activity  in  the last  10  years has  been  severely
disrupted by exogenous factors. In 1979-82, unrest escalated into a war
during which GDP shrank by 302. During the conflict, industries reduced
or suspended operations, the banks closed down, public administration
ceased to function, and much of the country's infrastructure was
destroyed  or  deteriorated  due  to  lack  of  maintenance.    Economic
recovery, which began with the establishment of the current Government
in 1982, was again disrupted by a drought of unprecedented severity in
1984, followed by a sharp decline of the world market price for cotton.
The border conflict with Libya continues and it absorbing substantial



- 2 -
resources of the country. Although, by 1986, real GDP had recovered to
its 1977 level,  it must be  shared with one  million more people.   Per
capita income, which has declined by 2Z p.a. during the last 20 years,
was only US$140 in 1986. Socioeconomic indicators as well confirm that
Chad is one of the world's poorest countries.
B. Recent Economic DeveloDm'nts
5.        Performance of the Chadian economy  in the last few years  was
deeply affected by the crisis in the cotton sector. The price of cotton
in CFAF fell by 67Z from mid-1984 to mid-1986 due to a decline in the
world market price and the depreciation of the US dollar. Moreover, the
-price decline coincided with a sharp increase in the expenditures of
COTONTCHAD (the cotton parastatal), caused by inefficient management.
As a result, the company sustained huge losses and accumulated arrears
of CFAF 43 billion to the banking system. Despite the downturn in the
cotton industry, Chad's remarkable rebound from the drought, with
cereals production doubling,  caused GDP  to grow  by 302  in 1985.   In
1986, however, real GDP declined by 22 as the effects of the cotton
crisis were felt more fully.
6.        In response to the cotton crisis, the Government implemented a
rigorous Emergency Program which aimed at reducing the sector's deficit.
The program covered the 1986187 and 1987/88 crop seasons and included
the following measures: reducing input subsidies from 50Z to zero over
two years, limiting cotton production to 100,000 tons, closing redundant
ginneries, exempting COTONTCHAD from payment of export taxes, and
substantially  reducing  the   staffs  of  COTONTCHAD   and  ONDR,   the
agricultural extension agency.   The two-year program  has achieved  its
objective; COTONTCHAD's costs were reduced from CFAF 913 per kg fibe.
in 1985/86, prior to the emergency program, to CFAF 544 per kg fiber in
1987/88. Cotton fiber is now being produced at about the same cost as
in 1983/84, prior to the period of lax management, when COTONTCHAD's
costs were roughly at the same level as those of other West African
cotton companies. Its operating losses have been reduced from CFAF 19
billion in 1985/86 to approximately CFAF 5 billion in 1987/88. In 1986,
the Central Bank of the Central African Monetary Union, of which Chad is
a member, agreed to reschedule COTONTCHAD's arrears over a period of 10
years with 5 years grace and a two-year moratorium on the payment of
interest.
7.        Chad's already precarious public finances have been aggravated
by the cotton crisis. The loss of export taxes on cotton, which was a
major source of government revenue, contributed to a decline of nearly
20Z in budgetary receipts in 1986. As a result, domestic resource
mobilization through the government budget is now a very low 6Z of GDP.
To partially offset the loss of cotton revenue, the Government increased
various consumer taxes. It also reduced current expenditures, which
were already  at  a  critically low  level.   Nevertheless,  the  fiscal
deficit on current expenditures (commitment basis) increased from 1.6Z
of GDP in 1985 to 2.7Z in 1986. The deficit was financed through
budgetary aid and the accumulation of domestic and external arrears.
The Government recognized the need to generate additional revenues
through broadening the  tax base and  improving tax administration.   In
July 1987, as a first step, the cumbersome and complex system of taxing
imports of petroleum products was replaced with a unitary consumption
tax levied by the Customs services at entrv points. Additional measures



- 3 -
were taken in November 1987 to improve collection of the new tax, and
its yields are increasing.
8.        Chad's external current account deficit increased sharply  due
mainly to the decline of world cotton prices and the weakening of the US
dollar. With export earnings declining by 402 between 1984 and 1986,
Chad's current account deficit almost doubled to 252 of GDP in 1985 and
1986. The deficit was financed by an increase of both capital grants
and concessional lending. Over this period, the focus of aid also
changed from emergency food aid to development assistance, which tripled
between 1985 and 1987. Budget support also increased in response to the
impact of the cotton crisis on public finances.
9.        Although, by  conventional  measures, Chad  has  a  relatively
small external debt and a low debt service ratio, it has experienced
serious  debt-servicing  problems.   The  country's  external  debt   is
equivalent to 25Z of GDP; most of it is contracted by the public sector
on concessional terms. In 1985 and 1986, Chad's scheduled debt service
was only 7? of export earnings. Actual payments, however, covered only
about half the debt service due, and arrears were accumulated which
amounted ti about  US$80 million  by end-1986.   The Chadian  Government
repaid arreers to most multilateral creditors and rescheduled arrears to
bilateral creditors  through negotiations.   Scheduled debt  service  in
1987 and 1988 is in the order of US$8-10 million, i.e., about 72 of
export earnings. The servicing of the debt is constrained by inadequate
public sector resource mobilization.    In 1987, scheduled debt  service
amounted to nearly one-fifth of budget revenues and, thus, represented a
heavy burden for Chad's public finances.
C. Adiustment Policy Issues
10.       Chad's econortic growth in the next few years is hampered by  a
number of structural issues which mostly result from the country's low
level of development. Among the most important adjustment issues are:
(i)  inefficiencies   in  public   sector  resource   mobilization   and
expenditures as well as in public administration; (ii) restoring the
competitiveness of the cotton sector; (iii) a pegged exchange rate which
has increased the volatility of export earnings in local currency terms;
(iv) an inefficient public enterprise sector; and (v) the rehabilitation
of the banking sector.
11.       Public Finance.   Chad's  public  finances  suffer  from weak
domestic  resource  mobilization,  insufficient  current   expenditures,
inadequate administration, and a severe debt service problem. The share
of government revenue in GDP which already was very small has been
further reduced by the cotton crisis. The challenge for the Government
is to generate additional budgetary revenues and to raise civil
administration expenditures to a level compatible with the requirements
of the country's development strategy. In recent years, the Government
has financed only current expenditures, with military spending and civil
service salaries as the two biggest items; operating expenditures of
development-oriented ministries have been slashed to the point where the
Government is unable to carry out basic functions. Inadequacies exisit
in tax administration, and budget execution is characterized by much
discretionary decision-making.   Due  to  low  budget  revenues,  Chad's
public sector debt service is too high to be sustainable over the medium
term, especially if the Government has to also ensure debt service on
COTONTCHAD's arrears.



-4 -
12.       Future   growth   will    require   massive   investment    in
infrastructure  and  human  capital  development.   The  Government   is
completely reliant on concessional external financing for its public
investment program, as well as for  a large portion  of the  associated
recurrent costs.  In  recent years, public  fixed capital formation  has
equaled about 8Z of GDP. Domestic savings are highly negative, and the
country has extremely limited access to private capital markets abroad.
To use the available external resources effectively, the Government
needs to define sectoral strategies and investment criteria, while
emphasizing domestic resource mobilization through cost recovery schemes
as well.
13.       Cotton Sector.   The Chadian  economy depends  heavily on  the
cotton sector for export earniz.gs, government revenues, and farmers'
cash income. Fmndamental policy reforms are needed in the cotton sector
in order to restore its competitiveness and to reduce the financial
risks that  result from  fluctuations in  the world  market price.   The
efficiency of the cotton parastatal needs to be improved; measures are
required to strengthen extension and research in the sector and to
improve productivity at the farm level; and the pricing policy needs to
be reformed to contribute to reestablish the financial viability of the
sector. In addition, further study is needed to formulate a strategy
for  agricultural   diversification  with   a view   to  reducing   the
predominance of the cotton sector.
14.       Exchange Rate.  As  a member of  the Central African  Monetary
Union, Chad cannot use the exchange rate to restore financial viability
in the cotton sector and to improve the country's overall balance of
payments position. The common currency of the Union, the CFA franc, is
fully convertible into French francs at the rate of 50CFAF = lF,
guaranteed by France.   The Union  also operates a  common Central  Bank
(BEAC).  In the last 15 years, exchange rate fluctuations vis-a-vis  the
US dollar played a larger role in destabilizing Chad's export earnings
than changes in the world price of cotton. Under the Cotton Emergency
Program, the donor community pr-'ided a de facto export subsidy by
financing COTONTCHAD's operating deficits. In the absence of a flexible
exchanSe rate policy, the need to step up efforts to improve the
efficiency of the cotton sector is even stronger.
15.       Public Enterorise Sector.    The Chadian  Government's use  of
public *"terprises and market regulations to control economic activities
has beet fairly limited in the past. Many of the country's 40 public
enterprises are plagued with inefficient operations and investments and
have poor financial and administrative management. The accumulation of
cross-arrears, particularly between the Government and the public
utilities, has also become a major problem. The Chadian Government has
no clearly-defined policy, legal framework, or institutional mechanism
for evaluating and monitoring public enterprises. In addition, the
Government has established a number of monopolies, mostly for public
enterprises, and price controls on  local production and imports.   They
have proven largely ineffective given the permeability of Chad's border
and the existence of large informal markets. To the extent that these
de jure controls do create distortions and inefficiencies, they will
need to be progressively eliminated.
16.       Rehabilitation of  the  Bankina  Sector.    Since  it  resumed
operations  after  the  1979-82  war,   the  banking  sector  has   been
constrained in its activities by two factors. First, a large share of



bank assets have been frozen since 1983 under a general bank moratorium.
The moratorium was the result of the forced closing of the banking
system in 1980 when the war prevented further operations; it is
scheduled to  expire at  the end  of 1988.   Second, more  than half  of
domestic credit has been absorbed by COTONTCHAD and is in arrears. The
banking system, thus, has been unable to revolve funds lent previously
and, under the rules of the Monetary Union, is constrained in expanding
credit. The Government needs to assess the impact which the lifting of
the moratorium in late 1988 will have on the banking system, and, as a
priority measure to improve Chad's access to Central Bank credit, find a
solution to COTONTCHAD's arrears.
It.  UR ADJUSTMT
17.       Obiectives.  In close cooperation with the Fund and the  Bank,
the Government prepared a Policy Framework Paper 1987-90 (SecM87-547),
which the Executive Directors discussed on June 2, 1987. The overall
objective of Chad's adjustment program, as described in the PFP, is to
alleviate  the  economy's   structural  constraints   on  grnwth   while
containing the external  and internal imbalances.   The program aims  at
restoring modest economic growth and laying the foundation for more
rapid growth in the l990s by improving resource use in the public and
private sectors through appropriate policy design and strengthened
economic management. Policy improvements are needed in public finance,
agriculture, livestock, the public enterprise sector, the banking
system, and the industrial sector, to mention only the sectors that have
the most immediate impact on growth. The principal quantitative targets
of the adjustment program for the 1987-90 period are to: (i) achieve an
average GDP growth of 2Z in real terms per annum; (ii) keep the rate of
inflation below 5t; (iii) contain the current account deficit (including
grants) to 10? of GDP; and (iv) limit the overall balance of payments
deficit to an average of SDR v million per annum, i.e., 102 of the
1985-86 deficits.
18.       Adiustment Program for 1987188.  The PFP objectives in  prblic
finance have been translated into specific policy measures which are
supported through a first-year IMP Structural Adjustment Facility (July
1987-June  1988).   The  program  includes  measutes  tot  (i)  increase
revenues by introducing the new system for taxing petroleum consumption
mentioned above; (ii) restrain the growth of expenditures through the
application of strict budgetary controls, the integration of certain
extra-budgetary  revenues   and  expenditures   into  general   Treasury
accounting and limiting recruitment of civil servants; (iii) reduce
domestic arrears and prevent the accumulation of new ones; and (iv)
improve external debt management with respect to both borrowing and debt
service   payment.    The   Government's   financial   operations   were
consolidated by incorporating, for the first time, both current and
capital expenditures  in the  1988 budget.   The program  also  includes
measures aimed at the financial rehabilitation of COTONTCHAD and
measures to pursue cautious credit policies.
19.       Sectoral adiustment.  In addition to reforms in public finance
and in the cotton sector, the Government has also introduced policy
reforms in two  other important  sectors, transport  and livestock.   In
transportation, the Government has formulated a sector strategy and an
investment program for 1988-93 wLich were presented at a sectoral donor
meeting held in N'Djamena  in February 1988.   The new strategy  focuses
on: (i) the completion   of rehabilitation and maintenance of the  high



- 6-
priority  road   networks  (ii)   continued  strengthening   of   sector
institutions, in particular their planning and management capacity;
(iii) continued improvement of road maintenance financing; (iv) basic
air transport services, and (v) promotion of private participation in
the transport sector. In the livestock sector, a policy reform program
has been adopted which, together with rehabilitation of infrastructure
and institution building, aims at increasing the national livestock
production on a sustainable basis and improving livestock marketing.
The export regime is being reformed through the elimination of export
quotas and of the export monopoly of a parastatal, SOTERA; cost recovery
for veterinary services will be introduced, and the imuportation and
distribution of veterinary products will be liberalized.
II1. THE FINANCIAL RERABILITATION PROGRAM 1988-89
20.       Within the framework of the PFP, the next phase of the  reform
program, whUch the proposed IDA credit would support, aims at further
improving resource use in two important areas of the economy: public
finance and the cotton sector.   The program would also include  studies
to deepen the reform process and to extend it to other sectors of the
economy in  subsequent phases  of adjustment.   Such a  phased  approach
allows the Government to address the most urgent structural problems
rapidly while reform measures in other areas are under preparation. The
program takes into account the limited capability of the Chadian
administration to prepare and implement policy reform programs as well
as the  need to  identify  measures in  other areas.   A  UNDP-financed,
Bank-executed Technical Assistance Project, provides assistance to the
Government for the preparation and implementation of the reform program;
an IDA-financed Economic and Financia' Management Project (Credit
1872-CD) will provide additional support. The content of the financial
rehabilitation program is described in the Government's Statement of
Development Policy in    Annex III and is discussed below.  The specific
actions to be supported by the proposed credit and their timing are
summarized in Annex IV.
A. Public Sector Resource Nanaa1ent
21.       Public sector resource management is one of the key tools  for
influencing economic  act_:ity in  Chad.  Increasing  efficiency in  the
mobilization and use of public sector resources is therefore a central
component of the Financial Rehabilitation Program. To this end, the
Government's program includes: (i) reforms of the tax system; (ii)
initial   steps   to   restructure   current   expenditures;   (iii)   a
rationalization  of  the  public   investment  program;  and  (iv)   the
formulation of a public sector financing plan which reflects all these
measures as well as the cotton sector reform program described below.
This program aims at making more efficient use of public sector
resources, thereby allowing the Government to extend the provision of
basic services to the population.
Tax System
22.       Chad's tax base is small relative to the size of the  economy.
In 1987, tax revenues accounted for only 6S of GDP, compared with 12S in
the pre-war period (1973-75) and an average of 18S for other low-income
African countries.    Chad's  low  level of  development  and  extremely
narrow industrial base largely explain  the low tax yields.   Inadequate



tax administration compounds the problem. The bulk of tax revenues are
generated  through  import  duties  and  *unitary   taxes  on   domestic
production, but this has jeopardized the viability of the few existing
industries and has often increased  smuggling rather than revenues.   In
recent years, the crisis in the cotton sector has aggravated Chad's
fiscal problems. Historically, export duties on cotton have made up
about 20 of tax revenues. In 1986, as part of the Cotton Emergency
Program, COTONTCHAD was exempt from paying export duties; this put
increased pressure on an already weak fiscal system.
23.       The reform program includes short- and medium-term measures to
increase tax yields  and strengthen  tax administration.   To offset  at
least partially the loss of cotton export revenues, additional taxes
were introduced in October 1986 on selected manufactured imported goods.
Their yield, however, was small due to the inability of the tax
administration to ensure adequate coverage of the tax base. In the
short run, a reform of the cumbersome and complex system of taxing
petroleum imports was the only source which could yield substantial
additional revenue. In July 1987, a unitary consumption tax, which is
levied by the  customs service  at entry points,  replaced the  existing
petroleum tax system.  In November 1987, the Government took  additional
measures to strengthen administration of the new system. Figures for
the first five  months of  the new  system indicate  that the  potential
yield (tax assessment) of the new petroleum tax is close to the target
(CFAF 4.5 billion over twelve months) set under the IMF's SFA program.
It is expected that tax revenues from petroleum products, which made up
7.5% of tax revenues in 1987, will account for 19? of 1988 tax revenues.
24.       While the measures described  above are important,  government
expenditure needs and the limited scope for taxing the cotton sector
during the adjustment period make it imperative to find new sources of
revenue,-. The Government has decided to conduct a wide-ranging tax
policy review  and has  requested IMF  assistance.   The  review would
include: (i) the tax administration system; (ii) extra-budgetary funds;
and (iii! the scope for expanding the tax base. The study is scheduled
for 1988, and the Government plans to start implementing reforms
recommended by the study with its 1989 budget.
Public Investment Program
25.       In the last  two years,  the Government  has made  significant
progress in preparing a public investment program that reflects the
economic priorities of the country. The progress to date is all the
more remarkable since Chad has not had a formal public investment
program since 1975. In 1986, the Government prepared an inventory of
externally funded projects, which served as a basis for the preparation
of the 1987  public investment program.   The public investment  program
for 1988, which includes all donor-financed projects, for the first time
has been incorporated in the government budget. The Government is
committed to preparing a three-year rolling public investment program
for 1989-91.   This program will be  reviewed by  IDA, and  it will  be
updated and extended annually.
26.       Overall, the 1988  public investment program  conforms to  the
Government's development priorities. The size of the investment program
seems appropriate in view of the continued large reconstruction needs of
the country. Assuming an implementation rate of 80?, the investment
program is equivalent to 17.4Z of GDP; fixed investment equals about 8Z



- 8 -
of GDP; the difference is accounted for by external funding for
operating expenditures of development projects, technical assistance,
and training. The sectoral allocation emphasizes agriculturellivestock
and transport infrastructure which each account for 29X of the total;
industry/energy account for 24S, human resources for 122 and general
development support for 6%. The public investment program is almost
fully funded  by  external assistance.   About  two-thirds of  the  1988
investment  program  is   financed  from  grants   and  one-third   from
concessional loans on IDA-comparable terms.
27.       The Government  also  has  taken steps  to  strengthen  public
investment programming. It has issued a set of criteria for evaluating
project proposals. In addition, the Government is formulating sectoral
strategies which will serve as the basis for preparing future projects.
Strategies for agriculture, livestock, and transport have already been
formulated; a strategy for the education sector will be completed in
late 1988, and work on a  health strategy is  envisaged for 1989.   The
Government will continue to use the strategies as a basis for aid
coordination; an education sector donor meeting is planned in 1989.
Current Expenditures
28.       The Government  recognizes  the  need to  reform  its  current
expenditure system. The level of current expenditures is low, and their
structure is flawed by serious imbalances. Personnel expenditures show
the Government's resource constraints; most civil servants receive only
602 of their  1967 salary base.   The most pronounced  imbalance in  the
budget  is  reflected  in  the   exceedingly  small  share  dev3ted   to
non-personnel operating  expenditures.  In  addition, budgetary  control
procedures are heavy. Under the financial rehabilitation program, the
Government is starting to address these issues. As a priority, it is
increasing  operating  expenditures   of  key  development   ministries;
streamlining of budgetiry procedures has been initiated, and a study of
the civil service system will be undertaken to prepare future reforms.
29.       Non-personnel Operating Expenditures.   The Government's  non-
personnel  operating  budget,  i.e.,  expenditures  for materials   and
supplies, has been particularly constrained in recent years. It has
been shrinking steadily both in absolute amount and as a proportion of
the total budget. In 1987, the non-personnel operating budget showed a
54? reduction over the previous year; in 1988. it was reduced by a
further 35?. Its share in the total government budget declined from 41Z
in 1986 to 202 in 1988.
30.       These cuts have hit  especially hard eight ministries  central
to development, i.e., the Ministries of Education, Public Health, Social
Affairs, Agriculture, Livestock, Transport,  Public Works, and  .ourism/
Environment. Their non-personnel operating budgets were reduced by 27Z
in 1986 and  a further 63?  in 1987.    In  1988, allocations for  these
ministries make up only 112 of the total non-personnel operating budget.
Moreover, actual expenditures are much lower than budget figures
indicate, as military expenditures have been given priority reflecting
continued security problems. Since 1985, only 20-502 of the allocations
for non-personnel operating expenditures for these ministries have been
authorized for payment; and the approved amounts represent only 3? of
the total non-personnel  operating budget.   Actual expenditures,  which
are not broken down by ministry, are even lower.   They are now so  low
that administrators lack basic office supplies, extension agents have no



-9-
means of transportation, health workers have no medicine to distribute,
and teachers lack pedagogic materials. The Government urgently needs to
raise these expenditures in order to restore administrative functions
and to deliver basic services in agriculture and t'e social sectors.
31.       Under the adjustment program,  the Government is committed  to
increasing the expenditures for materials and supplies of these eight
ministries. In 1988, budget execution for these ministries will follow
more closely the initial budget allocation, and their non-personnel
expenditures will be increased by CFAF 1.5 billion, thus restoring them
to their level before the recent cuts. Revised budgets for the eight
ministries have been prepared for the second half of 1988  incorporating
the supplemental expenditures. The allocations for the social sectors
have been increased as a priority. The revisions will be consolidated
into an amendment to  the 1988 budget  to be adopted  in July 1988.   In
1989. operating expenditures for seven of the eight ministries will be
maintained at  that level  and  financed under  the program.   The  1989
increment for the Ministry of Livestock will be financed by the National
Livestock Project, approved by the Executive Directors in May 1988. The
detailed programming of the 1989 budget increase will be undertaken
within the normal budget preparation process.
32.       Expenditure    Procedures.      The    existing      expenditure
authorization procedures do provide most of the information needed for
monitoring the implementation of the operating expenditure increase.
The Government will prepare, twice per year, detailed progress reports
on the  implementation  of  the  operating  expenditure  increase.   The
reports will be countersigned by the Central Treasury, the Budget
Director and by the technical Ministry concerned. They will include,
for each of the eight ministries, the following information: the
augmented budget allocation (i.e., the initial allocation plus the
operating expenditure increase) cumulative commitments, disbursements,
and the balance between budget allocation and disbursements (i.e., the
implementation rate).   Execution of  the operating  budget by  end-1988
will be reviewed with IDA.
33.       The existing budget execution procedure is complex because  of
the number of steps involved in the strict control of expenditures.   To
simplify budget execution, the Government has begun streamlining the
expenditure authorization procedure by eliminating steps and reducing
the documentation required.   The Government intends  to further  review
the scope for improvements in the expenditure authorization process in
agreement with the IMF.
34.       Civil Service Study.   The  Government recognizes the need  to
address the issue of personnel expenditure on the basis of an overall
public administration  study.   In  the  period  following  the war,  a
substantial number of civil servants returned to their positions, which
led to an increase in the overall size of the civil service. Due to
budgetary  resource   constraints   and   the   priority   of   military
expenditnres, the Government has contained the level of the wage bill.
The issues for the future are to improve the efficiency of the civil
service by matching skills with tasks and to identify ways of increasing
salaries within the budgetary constraints. The Government will conduct,
with  IDA  assistance,  a  study   on  the  civil  service  and   public
administration as a basis for preparing future policy reform in this
area.

Public Sector PinancinA Plan
35.       Under the adjustment  program, the Government  has prepared  a
public sector financing plan, covering the period 1988-1989. The plan,
presented  in  Table  1,  provides  an  overview  of  the   Government's
expenditure priorities and the resources available to finance those
expenditures. The numbers for 1988 reflect the Government budget and
are consistent with the targets established under the SPA program for
June 1987-July 1988. The Government has confirmed that it intends to
implement the financial program which was established with the staff of
the IMF through December 1988. This program, which is presented in
Table 1, includes objectives for revenues, expenditures, and the
consolidated budget deficit. Implementation of the 1988 budget program
will be reviewed with the staffs of the Fund and the Bank. The 1989
projections in the financing plan are tentative at this stage and will
be firmed up with the preparation of the budget for next year.
36.       This first  public sector  financing  plan includes  only  the
government budget and the financing requirements of the largest public
enterprise, COTONTCHAD. While the plan covers the most important public
sector   expenditures,   it   underestimates   the   overall   financing
requirements of the Chadian public sector since data are lacking for
several items.   First,  the  financing  requirements  of  other  public
enterprises will be assessed through several studies and incorporated
into the plan at a later stage. Second, counterpart funds required for
externally-financed investment projects are currently estimated at CFAF
800 million in 1988 and CFAF 1800 million in 1989. A detailed review is
underway and may yield higher financing needs for 1989.
37.       Public sector expenditures are fully  financed in 1988, but  a
gap of CFAF 4.6 billion would still exist in 1989 after the adjustment
measures  have  been  taken.   In  June  1988,  donors  indicated   that
additional non-project assistance may be forthcoming which would be
sufficient  to  cover  the  1989  financing  gap.   The  Government  has
established the following expenditure priorities: highest priority is
given to  adequately funding  the  Government's current  budget;  second
priority is to make adequate provisions for covering the operating
deficit of COTONTCHAD; the third expenditure priority consists of
reducing COTONTCHAD's  arrears vis-&-vis  the  banking system.   In  the
event of insufficient resources, expenditures would be adjusted by
reducing the amount currently envisaged for repayment of COTONTCHAD's
arrears.

S. Cotton Sector
Rostrmucturin of the Cotton Sector
38.       The financial rehabilitation program includes a  comprehensive
plan for restructuring the cotton sector and restoring its financial
viability. Building on the achievements of the Emergency Program which
reduced costs and losses within the existing incentives system and
institutional    framework,    the    restructuring    plan,    covering
1988189-1990I91,  would  introduce  fundamental  reforms  in  order   to
increase efficiency and reduce the financial risks of the cotton
industry. The plan has three componentst (i) a program to increase
COTONTCHAD's efficiency, (ii) a cotton development program at the farm
level, and (iii) a reform of the producer pricing system.
39.       Program to increase COTONTCHAD's efficiency.  The  restructur-
ing  plan  contains   an  ambitious  set   of measures  for   improving
COTONTCHAD's efficiency. These measures aim at reducing unit costs by
about 30S so that by 1990191 COTONTCHAD would be performing at a level
comparable  to  the most  efficient West African  cotton   producers.
Measures have been adopted to reduce variable costs by 16? and fixed
costs by 38?. COTONTCHAD's technical performance is good. The primary
source of its inefficiency is high fixed costs which account for 25S of
its cost price and which are three times higher than in the most
efficient West African companies. A key measure to reduce these costs
and to improve COTONTCHAD's management is the transfer of its financial
and administrative services from the capital city to Houndou, the site
of its operations, 480 kilometers away by road. A detailed plan for the
transfer has been prepared, and the transfer should be completed by May
1989. The consolidation of COTONTCHAD's activities at Moundou will
permit a reorganization of the company as well as a reduction of
administrative staff and overhead costs.
40.       COTONTCHAD has adopted other measures to increase  efficiency
Including a staff reduction and training program, actions to improve
management, and a modest investment program. COTONTCHAD will reduce its
staff by 102 (109 positions) over the next three years and undertake a
training program which will enable Chadians to fill 15 of the current 29
technical assistant positions. The salary scale and benefits will be
modified to reduce the disparity between professional staff and workers
as w311 as between COTONTCHAD and other employers. Actions to improve
COTONTCHAD's management will also be undertaken% the recently created
management and budget office will be strengthened; a unit will be set
up to monitor the import, storage, and distribution of agricultural
inputs; management of the varehouse and purchasing service will be
improved; and a study will prepare a coherent management system and
computerization plan.   COTONTCHAD  has  potential  for  increasing  the
profitability of its oil and soap production. By November 1988, it will
prepare an action plan for reducing costs of the oil and soap factory
and, by March 1989, it will define a commercial strategy appropriate for
the rapidly changing oil and soap market. COTONTCHAD's modernization
program will permit the expansion of the capacity of two of its six
ginneries and the purchase of other new equipment. These investments
are needed to accommodate the expected increase in production, to reduce
costs  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  cotton  fiber.   COTONTCHeAD's
commitments under the restructuring program are formalized in a contrat
glan with  Government  which will  be  signed   by  August  1988.   The



- 13 -
achievement of cost reductions will be closely monitored and external
audits will be done annually.
41.       Cotton DeveloPment  program at  the  farm level.   The  second
component of the restructuring plan includes measures to: (i) increase
cotton production, (ii)   raise productivity at  the farm level,   (iii)
reorient the work programs of the extension (ONDR) and research (IRCT)
agencies, (iv) strengthen coordination between COTONTCHAD, ONDR and
IRCT, and  (iv)  introduce a  more  reliable financing  mechanism.   The
cotton development program aims at increasing farmers' income from
cotton production over the medium term through a combination of measures
to expand production and reduce costs. Farmers were negatively affected
by the Emergency Program. which limited cotton production to 100,000
tons through administrative means (control of cotton seed and other
inputs distributed); maintained the producer price at 100 CFAF/kg, a
decline in real terms; and reduced input subsidies from 502 in 1985/86
to  zero  in  1987/88.    Despite  these  unfavorable  factors,   cotton
production increased from 90,000 tons in 1986/87 to 127,000 tons in
1987188 in part due to favorable climatic conditions and the depressed
market for cereals. Interviews with farmers and government agencies
indicate that Chadian farmers want to grow more cotton and use more
inputs than were made available to them under the Emergency Program.
42.       The couton  development program  provides for  an increase  in
cotton production to 145,000 tons by 1990/91, a level which has been
surpassed in 5 out of the last 20 seasons. The expansion would favor
the western part of the cotton zone where processing and export costs
are lowest and where cotton fiber quality is highest. It is expected
that farmers will increase production despite a lowering of the floor
price based on evidence in Chad and elsewhere that the producer price is
not necessarily the key determinant of the level of cotton production.
The following other factors are important as well: (i) a guaranteed
market outlet for cotton at a price known in advance which is not the
case for alternative crops; (ii) returns to farmer's labor; (iii)
relative returns to ^:otton and food crop production; and (iv) climatic
conditions and incidence of pests.
43.       Measures to increase  productivity at  the farm  level aim  at
maintaining and, eventually, increasing the profitability of cotton
production. These measures include increased availability of purchased
inputs, a reduction in their cost, and the introduction of new technical
packages. COTONTCHAD will increase the availability of inputs starting
with the 1989/90 season.  The plan aims at increasing the area on which
inputs are used from 50Z in 1987/88 to 72Z of the cotton area by
1990/91.  This would permit farmers who did not have access to inputs in
1988/89, to double their net income in 1989/90 by using the standard
input package. Measures are also being taken to reduce input costs.
For the 1988/89 season, inputs cost 202 less than in 1987/88 because of
favorable world market conditions. In 1989/90, farmers will be able to
choose among four technical packages, two of which are less expensive
than the standard package currently offered. In order to identify other
means of reducing costs, IRCT is testing less expensive, non-patented
fertilizers and insecticides. Input costs would be further reduced if
COTONTCHAD succeeds in lowering transport costs which account for up to
half the  cost of  imported inputs.   In support  of these  measures  to
increase productivity, ONDR is promoting the use of animal traction
through farmer training and a credit scheme for equipment.

44.       To support the cotton  development program, ONDR's and  IRCT's
objectives  and work  programs  have  been  redefined.   The   research
institute IRCT will pay more attention to developing techniques which
provide good economic and financial returns to farmers. The extension
agency. ONDR, will train farmers groups to take over from village level
extension agents and COTONTCHAD administrative tasks such ast estimating
quantities of inputs needed, distributing inputs, managing credit,
organizing and doing primary marketing of cotton. There is excellent
potential for the development of these groups in Chad, because there are
many literate, young farmers in the villages. ONDR's village level
extension staff will be reduced from 585 to 360 during the three-year
program, and staff will be retrained to assume their new role of advisor
of village groups. In order to improve their coordination, ONDR, IRCT,
and  COTONTCHAD  have  signed   a  formal  agreement  clarifying   their
respective responsibilities, in April 1988.
45.       Under the program,  adequate financing for  ONDR's and  IRCT's
current operations would be provided out of the Government's budget. In
the ksst, both agencies received substantial support from external
donors, and, prior to the cotton crisis, COTONTCHAD paid them a levy
based on the quantity of cotton produced. Currently, ONDR's and IRCT's
operating expenditures are partly funded from external assistance, but
ONDR's budget  in  particular has  not  been adequately  financed.   The
Government has given its assurance that adequate provisions will be made
in  the  1988  and  1989   budgets  for  ONDR's  and  IRCT's   financing
requirements.
46.       Reform of the producer pricing system.  A new producer pricing
policy is an essential feature of the adjustment program. Under the
existing pricing system, cotton is purchased from farmers at a fixed
price which is not linked to international market conditions and which,
according to custom, can only be increased. Farmers are fully protected
from world price decreases; on the other hand, they do not reap the
financial benefits from up-swings in world prices. Since the producer
price currently accounts for close to 502 of COTONTCHAD's total average
production costs and 602 of its average variable costs, COTONTCHAD's
ability to reduce costs to adjust to low world prices is severely
limited at the current producer price of 100 CFAFIkg for the best
quality cotton, and the risk of large deficits is high.
47.       In the  past,  COTONTCHAD's  operating  deficits  were  to  be
financed by an independently managed cotton price stabilization fund
(CAISTAB) which got its resources from transfers of 80? of COTONTCHAD's
net profits. However, as in other African countries, the fund did not
support the sector in times of collapsing international prices. It
instead served as an instrument to tax the sector, and the accumulated
resources were used to finance a variety of activities largely unrelated
to the cotton industry. In addition, the past stabilization system did
not provide incentives to COTONTCHAD to be efficient since its deficits
were to be fully covered whether they stemmed from producer price
supports or from high costs due to poor management. The weaknesses of
the system were exposed in the cottcn crisis when the increased
volatility of world cotton and financial markets, combined with the high
producer price, which had been increased from 60 OFAF/kg in 1980181 to
100 CFAF/kg in 1984/85, resulted in large deficits. Due to the failure
of CAISTAB, these deficits were financed by arrears to the banking
system and by the donor community in the context of the Emergency
Program.

/   An assumed world price of 860 CAF/kg fiber has been Increased by 20

CFAF/kg within which cotton prices have oscillated over the last 1S
years. Under this hypothesis, COTONTCHAD'e deficits would be
equivalent to its fixed costs In 1989/90 and lower than fixed coats In
1990/91. However, world price are expected to be higher than 880
CFAF/kg in thes  two years, maning COTONTCHAD io likely to break even
or gen-rate a surplus.



- 16 -
48.       The reform  of producer pricing policy  aims  at minimizing
financial risks of the Government and COTONTCHAD in the faece of
considerable uncertaint, about world market prices, while protecting
farmers' incomes and assuring that they benefit when world prices are
high.   The  new  pricing  policy   contains  four  elements:  a   price
differential according to cotton quality, a floor price, a purchase
price announced to farmers at planting time, and a price support fund.
The price differential according to quality aims at encouraging farmers
to sort their cotton by grade; this would improve the quality of ginned
cotton. In 1988189, a third quality will be introduced which is
intermediate between the existing two grades.
49.       In the new  pricing system,  the floor  price would  guarantee
farmers a minimum return to cotton production irrespective of the
short-term fluctuation of world prices. The floor price will be reduced
from 100 CFAF/kg for the first grade cotton to a maximum of 90 CFAF/kg
for  the  1989/90  and  1990/91  seasons.   Combined  with  other   cost
reductions mentioned above, this would lower COTONTCHAD's variable costs
to about 380 CFAF/kg fiber. This reduction in variable costs under the
adjustment program would justify an expansion of cotton production which
would, in turn, result in lower unit fixed costs. Since even in years
of low world prices revenues would be sufficient to cover variable
costs, COTONTCHAD's deficits would be limited to its fixed costs (CFAF 2
billion CFAF  in  1990191).   Hence, by  reducing  financial  risks  for
COTONTCHAD and the Government, the new policy pricing policy would
permit a sustainable increase in cotton production.
50.       The element of flexibility in  the new system is the  purchase
price which will be calculated in April of each year and announced to
farmers in May/June, which  is planting time.   As mentioned above,  the
purchase price cannot be set lower than the floor price. However, if
the world market price was more than sufficient to cover COTONTCHAD's
variable and fixed costs (excluding depreciation) in the previous
season, then a proportion of this surplus would be passed on to farmers
through a higher purchase price in the season for which the price is
being set.   The  balance of  the  surplus would  be  allocated  between
COTONTCHAD's depreciation allowance, the price support fund, and taxes.
The detailed method for setting the purchase price and allocating the
remaining surplus will be agreed upon with Government before November
1988. Farmers' reactions to the new policy will be closely monitored.
51.       Under the  reform  program,  a price  support  fund would  be
created within COTONTCHAD to finance the deficit arising from supporting
the floor price.   The new pricing  system would substantially  decrease
the amount needed in the fund, and its joint management by COTONTCHAD
and a representative of donors should improve accountability and provide
the necessary incentive to use the resources for their intended purpose.
The fund would be constituted from external financing under the
adjustment program and would be replenished from a portion of the
surplus between the world price and COTONTCHAD's cost. Clear guidelines
will be developed for the constitution and operation of the fund before
November 1988.
Settlement of CITOUTCHAD's Arrears
52.       COTONTCHAD accumulated CFAF 43  billion in arrears during  the
war and the cotton crisis; CFAF 42 billion have been rediscounted by the
Central Bank, and the balance is held directly by the primary banks.



- 17 -
The arrears not only jeopardize COTONTCHAD's financial viability, they
also present a problem for Chad's public finances and, under the rules
of the monetary union, affect the availability of new credit to the
economy.  As mentioned in para 6,  in 1986 the Central Bank  rescheduled
the CFAF 42 billion arrears over a ten-year period, with 5 years grace
and a  two-year  moratorium  on  interest  payments.   This  arrangement
provided some time for the Government to seek a more sustainable
solution for settling the arrears, before having to face service
payments which substantially exceed the payment capacity of COTONTCHAD
and the Government.
53.       Under the terms of the reacheduling agreement with the Central
Bank, COTONTCHAD is obliged to reduce its arrears by CFAF 11.1 billion
before  October  31,   1988.   In  accordance   with  the   Government's
commitments, COTONTCHAD repaid CFAF 7.7 billion by October 1987, and has
made provisions to repay another CFAF 7.4 billion before October 31,
1988; this would bring the total arrears repayment to CFAF 15.1 billion
by the end of October 1988, or CFAF 4 billion more than envisaged under
the agreement  with  the  Central  Bank.   These  repayments  were  made
possible by savings and receipts in excess of those anticipated in the
financing plan of the Cotton Emergency Program. Taking into account the
CFAF 3.8 billion interest accumulated during the moratorium, the total
amount due to BEAC on October 31, 1988, is CFAF 30.6 billion.
54.       Following a request  of the Chadian  authorities in May  1988,
the Central Bank has proposed a freezing of CFAF 14.2 billion of
COTONTCHAD's remaining arrears. The freeze would be in effect for at
least five years, and no new interest charges would accumulate on these
arrears. As part of this proposal, the Central Bank has asked the
Government to repay CFAF 14.2 billion, which corresponds to the balance
of principal,  within  a maximum  period  of  two  years.   Discussions
regarding the remaining interest due of CFAF 2.1 billion will take place
later. This proposal was confirmed with representatives of the Central
Bank during negotiations of the FRC.
55.       The Government  has  confirmed  its commitment  to  repay  the
Central Bank on the basis of such an arrears settlement program, on the
condition that the other priority needs, (i.e., current expenditures of
the Central Government and COTONTCHAD's operating expenditures) are met
first. The public sector financing plan provides for the repayment in
1988 of CPAF 3.6 billion in addition to the CFAF 7.4 billion already
scheduled under the Cotton Emergency Program. In 1989, CFAF 8.2 billion
will be repaid, CFAF 7 billion of it to the Central Bank. In addition,
CFAF 1.2 billion will be repaid to the commercial banks that extended
loans to COTONTCHAD in 1985; this repayment will be funded through a
special credit from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique.   The
financing plan shows a deficit of CFAF 4.6 billion in 1989, which, in
the absence of additional resources, would reduce repayment to the
Central Bank from CFAF 7 billion to CFAF 2.4 billion.
C. Preparation of Future Reforms
56.       Reform measures  under  the financial  relabilitation  program
have been limited to the two areas in which changes are needed most
urgently, while studies are being undertaken for preparing future phases
of Chad's adjustment program.  Studies identified thus far will  address
additional issues in public finance/administration and extend the
preparation of adjustment measures to another important area of the



- 18 _
public sector, paraetatals, as well as agricultural issues outside the
cotton sector.
57.       Public  Enterprises.   In  the  Policy  Framework  Paper,  the
Government indicated that it intends to initiate a public enterprise
sector reform program. As preparatory steps for future policy reform,
diagnostic studies of the most important public enterprises will be
undertaken with financing from the Economic and Financial Management
Project. These studies will provide the basis for deciding whether
individual public enterpriseslagencies should stay in the public sector
because they provide an essential public service or are of strategic
importance to Chad; be privatized, if they are basically viable; or be
liquidated, if they  are not viable.   A first set  of studies for  five
enterprises will be completed in- 1988. Additional enterprises will be
studied in a second phase. Another six enterprises are already being
studied under other Bank operations or by other donors.
58.       Reform of  the  public enterprise  sector  will also  have  to
include the settlement of cross arrears among the parastatals, between
them and the Government, and with the private sector. A study will be
undertaken in 1988 to determine the extent of these cross arrears and to
prepare proposals for  eliminating them.   In addition, a  study of  the
banking sector is envisaged to prepare the lifting of the banking sector
moratorium in late 1988 and to assess the need for policy reform.  Terms
of reference for the diagnostic studies and the cross arrearb study were
finalized during the FRC appraisal mission, and terms of reference for
the banking sector study are under preparation. These studies will be
funded  available  under   the  IDA-financed   Economic  and   Financial
Management Project.
59.       Public Administration/Civil Service.  As mentioned above,  the
Government  will  undertake   a  study  of   the  civil   service/public
administration. Building on a civil service census which was completed
in December 1987, the study should determine what functions are
essential for the Government to perform within its resource constraints
and how best to perform these functions, and should analyze the present
administrative structure and government staffing. It would also make
recommendations for changes in these areas and develop a public
administration in-service training program. The study will be financed
by the Economic and Financial Management Project. Implementation of the
civil service/public administration reforms will take place in future
phases of the adjustment program.
60.       Agriculture.   The  Government   has  defined  a   development
strategy for the agricultural sector, including livestock, fisheries and
forestry, which was presented at a donors meeting in December 1986.   In
many areas, however, the existing knowledge was insufficient to define a
detailed strategy and action plan. Two priority issues which require
more  analysis  are  food  security  and  irrigation  development.   The
Government is addressing them in collaboration with IDA and other
donors. The need to collect new data and do in-depth analysis of
specific areas and policy questions is also being addressed by the
IDA-financed  Agriculture  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  (Credit  No.
1775-CD). The project will assist in the design of detailed strategies
and  implementation  programs  for  agricultural  extension,   training,
research,  and  seed  production.   It  also  finances  studies  on  the
diversification  of  agricultural  production, marketing  of  livestock
products, resource  conservation,  and agricultural  credit.   They  are



- 19 -
expected to provide elements for extending the agricultural reform
program in future phases of adjustment.
61.       Social Dimensions of Adiustment.  The financial rehabilitation
program provides for an increase in current expenditures of development-
oriented ministries and, thus, aims at improving basic public services
in Chad. It also includes the formulation of sectoral strategies as a
basis for rationalizing government expenditure programs in the medium
term. While these elements of the adjustment program would improve
social services, Chad still faces a decline in per capita income during
the adjustment period. It therefore is desirable to introduce, in the
short run, programs that aim at protecting the most vulnerable groups
and at attenuating possible negative effects of the adjustment program.
To this end, Chad is participating in the Social Dimensions of
Adjustment Project. In addition to studies which would evaluate social
welfare, an action program will be prepared to protect the most
vulnerable groups.   It will be  developed  in cooperation with  other
donors and will assess the possibility of relying on non-governmental
organizations for its implementation. An IDA credit would be proposed
later in FY90 to support this action program.
IV. THE PROPOSED OPEUTION
A. History
62.       The  proposed  Financial  Rehabilitation  Credit  (FRC)  would
support the first phase of the Chadian Government's adjustment program.
It would also provide fast-disbursing budget support to a Government
which has experienced severe resource constraints due to political
conflicts of recent years and to the serious decline in cotton revenues.
The preparation of the credit builds on the Policy Framework Paper
1987-90 and on the 1987 Country Econo$c Memorandum. The content of the
proposed  credit was  first  discussed  with  the  Government  in   an
identification mission in July 1987, which was followed in October/
November 1987 by a preparation/pre-appraisal mission; appraisal took
place in February 1988.   Negotiations were held  in Washington in  June
1988; the Chadian delegation was headed by H. E. Soumalla Mahamat,
Minister of Planning. Preparation of the program was facilitated by a
UNDP-financed, Bank-executed technical assistance project to strengthen
the capacity of the Ministry of Planning. Technical assistance to
implement the program and prepare future phases of adjustment will, in
addition to the UNDP-project, also be provided through the Economic and
Financial Management Project. Supplementary data on the proposed credit
and program are presented in Annex II.
B. Economic and Social ImDact of the Adiustment Pro&ram
63.       The adjustment  program aims  at strengthening  the basis  for
future economic growth and, thus, reversing the declining trend in per
capita income.   Increasing efficiency  of resource  use in  the  public
sector and in the cotton sector would allow the country to make better
use of its existing investments and to orient expenditures under the
program into productive uses. To achieve these objectives, substantial
capital inflows, mainly in the public sector, are required to finance
continued high current account and budget deficits. The anticipated
impact of the adjustment program is presented in Table 3 and contrasted
with a scenario without adjustment.



- 20 -
64.       Public Finance.   Under  the  adjustment  program,  reform  of
petroleum  product  taxation  would   permit  a  one-time  increase   in
government revenues, of about 251, from CFAF 18.2 billion in 1987 to
CFAF 22.2  billion  in  1988.   Thereafter,  implementation  of  reforms
prescribed in the upcoming fiscal study should permit growth of tax
revenues  at  a  rate  equaling   or  surpassing  nominal  GDP   growth.
Restructuring of the cotton sector may also make it possible to
reintroduce cotton sector taxation during a later phase of adjustment,
if cotton profitability increases.
65.       The  adjustment  program  provides  for  a  higher  level   of
government spending, including an increase in operating expenditures in
key development ministries. Increased fiscal revenues combined with
non-project aid would allow government current expenditures to rise to
8.6Z of GDP in the 1988-90 period and 9.12 ir 1991-95. This would,
however, result in a widening budget deficit, reaching an average of
2.0S of GDP in the 1991-95 period. In the absence of an adjustment
program, the much lower revenue level combined with a lack of external
budget  support  would   force  the  Government   to  severely   curtail
expenditures; while this would bring down the budget deficit. it would
also limit government operations essential for growth and meeting the
basic needs of the population.
66.       Balance of Payments.  Reforms in the cotton sector would allow
cotton fiber exports to expand, thus boosting exports in constant prices
by 6.2X per annum during 1988-90, decelerating to about 2.52 per annum
in later years. Increased export earnings plus a high level of capital
inflows would permit  a higher  level of imports.   The current  account
deficit would decline modestly as a share of GDP while import growth is
maintained. In contrast, without adjustment in the cotton sector, the
expansion in cotton export volume would not be feasible since the
operating losses of COTONTCHAD would increase with higher production
levels. The resulting lower growth in export earnings combined with
external funding constraints would, thus, limit import growth.
67.       External Debt.  The  rapid increase in  capital inflow  during
the adjustment period would increase external debt outstanding and
disbursed from 232 of GDP  at end-1987 to 42?  of GDP at end-1995.   The
Government is committed to borrowing only on highly concessional terms,
so that Chad's debt service ratio would remain a relatively low 9-16?
throughout the  1988-95 period.   Without adjustment,  the debt  service
ratio would be lower, reflecting lower capital inflows.

/1 Total public investment comprises all foreign-funded projects
included in the investment program; public fixed investment refers
to fixed capital formation only.
68.       Growth and Social Welfare.  The adjustment program focuses  on
measures to improve the efficiency of the public sector and the cotton
sector. Improvements in Investment programuing would, in the medium
term, strengthen the basis for economic growth. The increase in cotton
production under the program combined with a reduction of input cost
would result in higher cash incomes In the principal agricultural zones
of the country. Since the measures are being introduced gradually and
their impact will  be felt with some  lags, the  adjustment program  is
unlikely to result in an increase in real per capita income in the short
term. It is expected that, starting in the early 1990s, the effect of
the adjustment program, combined with the beginning of petroleum
production, would increase economic growth to 3.91 p.a. which would
reverse the current downward trend in per capita incom. In the absence
of an adjustment program, real per capita income growth would remain
below the projected 2.61 population growth rate.



- 22 -
69.       The adjustment program  would have  mainly positive  distribu-
tional effects. In public finance, it would increase and rationalize
current expenditures in the social sectors as well as the delivery of
agricultural services.   In  addition,  sectoral  strategies  are  being
prepared to further strengthen the provision of basic services to larger
parts of the population.  In  the cotton sector too, the. distributional
impact of the adjustment program is expected on balance to be positive.
As mentioned above, the Govermn.'t is also addressing social development
issues  affecting  particularly  vulnerable  groups  through  a   social
development project.
C. Benefits and Risks
Benefits
70.       Seen in the  context of Chad's  reconstruction efforts,  there
are three main benefits of the financial rehabilitation program. First,
it would contribute to improvements in public finance, including
increased resource mobilization, a focused public investment program,
and an increase in current expenditures in development-oriented sectors.
Second, it would result in a fundamental restructuring of the country's
main export sector, cotton, and third, it would lead to an improved
financial  position  of  the  public  sector,  especially  through   the
settlement of arrears. The overall contribution of the program to the
Chadian economy will be a strengthening of the foundations for higher
growth in the 19909. The adjustment program also provides a framework
for aid-coordination and for obtaining higher levels of external
assistance in the appropriate form and on very concessional terms.
Risks
71.       The   financial   rehabilitation   program   is   subject   to
considerable risk. As other operations in Chad, it would be adversely
affected by external risks, such as drought and increased border
conflicts which may divert public sector resources and delay the
implementation of policy reform measures. There are also risks inherent
to the financial rehabilitation program. First, the Chadian Government
has to demonstrate its ability to implement and sustain the reform
program. Second, it is possible that farmers will not increase their
productivity  to  the  extent   anticipated  under  the  program,   thus
diminishing the anticipated benefits. Efforts have been made in the
design of the program to reduce these risks, through, e.g. a phased
implementation of the reforms and technical assistance being provided to
the Government for the preparation and implementation of the r^form
program.
D. Provosed Financing
72.       The proposed  financing  of  US$42  million  for  the  PRC  is
composed of US$16.2 million from IDA, US$21.3 million from the Special
Facility for Africa, and US$4.5 million equivalent in joint parallel
financing from the  Saudi Fund.   The IDA  share was  determined on  the
basis of IDA's lending program for Chad and in view of the country's
other priority needs for which IDA assistance has been requested.
73.       The proposed PRC would finance about 112 of Chad's merchandise
imports in the period July 1988 through December 1989 and meet about 72



- 23 -
of the country's gross external capital requirements for the same
period. The counterpart funds of the credit are equivalent to 22Z of
Chad's current budget in these 18 months.
74.       Significant cofinancing has  been arranged  for the  financial
rehabilitation program from the African Development Bank and the
Government of France. The African Development Fund will contribute
FUA30 million in cofinancing of the FRC. France is providing US$26
million equivalent in budgetary assistance in 1988 and has announced
that  the  Caisse  Centrale  will   also make  available  a  loan,   on
concessional terms, of US$25 million equivalent to be disbursed during
the  three  years  of  the  program.   Of  this  amount,  US$16  million
equivalent could  be  disbursed in  1989.   The 1988-89  financing  plan
includes substantial amounts of non-projects funding forthcoming from
other donors  as  well.   USAID  is providing  US$7  million  p.a.,  the
European Community is providing about US$11 million in STABEX funding
for the cotton program in 1988, and the Netherlands is providing a total
of about US$12 million. There is, thus, considerable burden sharing
among donors.
E. Disbursement. Procurement. Administration and Auditing
75.       The proposed credit would be disbursed in two equal  tranches.
The first tranche would disburse entirely the SJF funds as well as
US$12.5 million equivalent of the SFA funds and US$4 million equivalent
of the IDA funds. The second tranche would consist of the remaining
US$8.8 million equivalent of SFA funds and US$12.2 million equivalent of
IDA funds. It would be disbursed following a tranche review in early
1989, six to nine months after Board presentation.
76.       The credit would reimburse 100Z of the foreign exchange  costs
of eligible imports on the basis of evidence that they were imported and
paid for after credit signing. Due to Chad's acute funding shortage for
the 1988 budget and to ensure that adequate funding is available to
increase recurrent expenditures in the second half of 1988, retroactive
financing of imports during the four months preceding the month of
credit signing would also be permitted up to a maximum of 20S of the
respective credit  amounts.   Eligibility  for  reimbursement  from  the
African Facility Credit would be limited to imports from Part II members
of  IDA  and  from  other  countries  designated  as  eligible  by   the
Administrator under the African Facility. All arrangements for disburse-
ment of the Saudi Fund contribution would be made in accordance with an
Aide-M4moire between IDA and the Saudi Fund for Development dated July
3, 1986. Expenditures for goods procured under invoices for US$10,000
equivalent or less would not be eligible for financing out of credit
proceeds. Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing. Imports by private entities would follow normal commercial
practices. For public sector imports, procurement would be made through
international competitive bidding for contracts of US$1 million or more,
while for lesser amounts the purchaser's normal procurement procedures
which are acceptable to IDA, would apply.
77.       To  facilitate  disbursement  and  procurement,  two   special
accounts would be established at the Central Bank on behalf of the
Treasury, one  each  for  the  IDA  credit  and  the  SFA  credit.   The
Government of Chad would  be the borrower.   The regional Central  Bank,
BEAC, would be responsible for maintaining the credit accounts and
supporting expenditures on the basis of eligible imports (negative list)



- 24 -
for submission to IDA. After effectiveness, initial deposits of US$1.5
million each would be made by IDA and the SPA into the respective
special accounts. These accounts would be replenished regularly and up
to the limit of the First Tranche on the basis of fully documented
reimbursement applications for amounts in excess of US$1 million and on
the basis of statements of expenditures under that amount. The minimum
amount of replenishment applications would be US$300,000. The Central
Bank would indicate on the statements of expenditures the nature and
origin of the goods, as well as the payment date, and would maintain all
relevant supporting documentation (invoices. import certificates and
evidence of payment) for  review by supervision missions.   Expenditures
covered by the IDA credit would be in accordance with normal IDA rules
while expenditures covered by the SFA credit would be in accordance with
the resolution establishing the SFA.
78.       Within six months  after the completion  of disbursements,  an
external audit report, conforming to internationally accepted standards
prepared by Bank approved auditors, would be submitted to IDA.
F. Monitorina and Tranche Release
79.       Responsibility for monitoring the implementation and impact of
the structural adjustment program would be with the Interministerial
Committee that the Government has set up for this purpose, under the
chairmanship of the Ministry of Planning. It would evaluate the need
for additional adjustment measures and work closely with the Bank, the
African Development Bank, the IMF and other donors in reviewing progress
in implementing the adjustment program.
80.       Release of the second tranche of the credit would be  preceded
by a review, by IDA and the co-financiers, of progress in the
implementation of  the adjustment  program.   Tranche release  would  be
based on a review of general progress in implementing the program and,
in particular,  on  the  following  measures  having  been  taken:   (i)
implementation of the supplementary budget for 1988; (ii) adoption of
the three-year rolling investment program for 1989-91; (iii) adoption of
the 1989 current budget including an increase in non-personnel operating
expenditures  of  development-oriented  ministries;  (iv)   satisfactory
completion of the review of COTONTCHAD's performance in reducing costs,
and a decision on lowering the floor price for the 1989/90 cotton crop
year; (v) e3tablishment of a Fund to support the cotton producer floor
price and a mechanism for distributing the cotton sector surplus; and
(vi) significant progress in the public enterprise studies. The African
Development Bank has indicated that it would apply the same tranching
conditionality as IDA.
81.       The Interministerial Committee would submit to IDA a  progress
report on the adjustment program in time for the tranche review. This
report would serve as a basis for the continuing dialogue with IDA and
the other donors. The Government of Chad would submit to IDA a final
report on the implementation of the financial rehabilitation program
upon full disbursement of the credit.
V.  UK OPERATIONS STRATEGY
82.       Twenty IDA credits totalling US$144.2 million equivalent  have
been approved for Chad as of March 31, 1988. Twelve of these credits



- 25 -
(US$43.6 million equivalent) have been fully disbursed, and two (US$19.1
million equivalent) were cancelled before becoming effective because of
the 1979-82 war. All Bank Group operations in Chad were suspended in
July 1979 because of accumulated arrears on IDA credits, although
escalating hostilities had already halted project activities and led to
considerable damage to project assets. The Bank resumed its activities
in Chad in mid-1985 and four operations (US$65.2 million equivalent)
have been approved as of March 31, 1988. Of the 18 credits (excluding
the cancelled ones), nine were for agricultural or rural development,
five for education, three for highways, and one for economic and
financial management.  In addition,   credits for a Road  Reconstruction
Project and a National Livestock Project were approved by the Board in
April and May 1988 respectively.   Annex I contains a sunmary  Statement
of Bank-Group Operations in Chad.
83.       IDA's assistance strategy for  Chad supports the  Government's
strategy outlined in its Interim Development Plan 1986-88 and its
adjustment  program  described  above.   The  strategy  is more   fully
described in the Country Brief distributed to the Executive Directors in
May 1988. The strategy supports investments in the productive sectors
(agriculture,   livestock,   and   energy)   as   well   as    transport
infrastructure, and begins to emphasize development of human resources.
IDA also aims at strengthening economic management, begins to support
macro-economic policy reform, and places increased emphasis on aid
coordination. This strategy supports urgently needed reconstruction and
rehabilitation works, and moves progressively towards macro-economic and
sectoral reforms.
84.       The Bank's strategy  for the agricultural  sector is  shifting
from emergency assistance through the Emergency Cotton Sector Program in
FY86 (Credit No. 1716) and the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project
(Credit No. 177') in FY87 to subsector operations supporting investments
and policy refoxzq. A National Livestock Development Credit, approved
by the Executive Diroctors in May 1988, would support the Government's
efforts to increase livestock production, improve livestock health, and
reform marketing. Additional sector work is underway to help define the
objectives and content of the Bank's future agricultural lending in
Chad. An agricultural services project (FY91) to strengthen extension
and research is being prepared. An agricultural sector adjustment
credit (FY92S) would support policy reforms in the following areas: (i)
the cotton sector, by pursuing the adjustment measures supported under
the proposed Financial Rehabilitation Credit; (ii) the irrigation
sector, by implementing a cost effective strategy for the development of
irrigated agriculture; and (iii) food security.
85.       In transport,  the  Bank supports  the  Government's  strategy
which is presented in a sector strategy paper and a six-year investment
program, both prepared with IDA assistance. They were presented to the
donor community in February 1988. The strategy focuses on completing
the rehabilitation and maintenance of the high priority road network,
strengthening  the   planning   and management   capacity   of   sector
institutions, improving road maintenance financing and air transport
services, and promoting private participation in the sector. The Road
Reconstruction   Credit   (Credit   No.   1728)   would   complete   the
rehabilitation of high priority roads. A Transport Sector Project
(FY90)  would  assist with  the   implementation  of  the  policy   and
institutional elements of Chad's sector strategy including strengthening



- 26 -
of sectoral planning and management, private sector development, and
ensuring adequate financing for maintenance.
86.       In the eneray sector, the Bank would support the  Government's
efforts to  reduce its  dependence on  petroleum imports.   A  petroleum
project (FY91) would include well development, a pipeline, a micro
refinery, and modifications to the power stations in N'Djamena and other
major cities. A technical assistance project (FY91) would strengthen
the Ministry of Hines and Energy in petroleum matters and assist with
the promotion of petroleum exploration.
87.       In   human   resources,   the   Government   has   begun   the
reconstruction of the country's social infrastructure dismantled by the
recent  period  of war.   In  the  education  sector,  the  Bank   will
participate in the reconstruction effort first through an Education
Rehabilitation Project (FY89). It will concentrate on primary schools,
providing  assistance  to  low-cost  community-based  construction   and
learning  materials.  and  on   teacher  training   and   institutional
strengthening.  In the health sector, the Bank also envisages  assisting
in the rehabilitation of the basic health care system and the management
capabilities of the Ministry, based on a sector survey scheduled for
FY89. Policy options for addressing the most pressing human resources
issues will be identified in a series of studies and discussed at a
Round Table on education, scheduled for 1989. Further analytical work
is planned through a manpower assessment survey in 1990.
88.       In  addition  to  institution-building  efforts  included   in
investment  operations,  IDA  is  providing  assistance  to   ministries
concerned with macro-economic management through free-standing technical
assistance projects. IDA is the implementing agency for a UNDP-financed
Technical Assistance Project that is providing a team of experts to the
Ministry of Planning. An Economic and Financial Management Project,
approved by the Executive Directors in January 1988, will complement the
UNDP project.   It includes  studies to  prepare policy  reforms in  the
areas of public enterprises, public administration, and fiscal policy.
The project also finances a demographic survey.
89.       IDA expects  to continue  adjustment lendinX to Chad  through
structural and sectoral adjustment operations. A follow-up adjustment
operation in 18-24 months is expected to deepen the adjustment effort,
especially in public finance, and to extend it to the parastatal sector.
The sector operations mentioned above for agriculture, transport, and
education  will  also  support   sectoral  policy  reforms.   A   Social
Development Program (FY90) is under preparation to address the social
impact of adjustment and explore new approaches to social development.
VI. COLLABORATION WITH THE IDF
90.       Since 1985, when the Bank resumed lending operations in  Chad,
the Bank  and the  Fund have  closely coordinated  their activities  and
assisted the Government with the preparation of the Policy Framework
Paper for 1987-90. A first-year SFA program, approved on October 30,
1987, is currently underway in Chad. IMF staff worked with the FRC
preappraisal and appraisal missions, and cooperation on the adjustment
program continues.  In particular, Bank and Fund staff worked closely in
the area of petroleum taxation, and the Government has requested Fund
assistance for the upcoming fiscal study.

91.       I am satisfied that the proposed IDA credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomnend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
92.       I am satisfied that the proposed African Facility Credit would
comply with the provision of Resolution No. IDA 85-1 of May 21, 1985,
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed African

Gentlemen:
I am pleased to send you this statement of development policy,
which builds on the Policy Framework Paper for 1987-90, adopted in 1987.
The Statement describes the first phase of the adjustment program  being
undertaken by the Government of Chad, and contains a request from the
Government to the World Bank and the African Development Fund for a
Financial Rehabilitation Credit  (FRC) to support  this first phase.   I
would therefore like to restate briefly the objectives of our adjustment
program  and  the  reforms  already  undertaken,  and  to  describe  the
remaining actions that the Government intends to take during this first
phase of adjustment of the Chadian economy.
Yours faithfully,
The Minister of Planning and
Cooperation

GOVERNEN  OF CHAD
Statement of Develooment Policy
1.        Recent  Chanses  in  Chad's  EconomI.   Chad  has  experienced
serious economic and financial difficulties over the past 20 years; per
capita income (US$150 in 1986) is one of the lowest in the world. These
difficulties are largely attributable to Chad's low level of development
and to the impact of successive droughts, factors that were aggravated
by a long conflict of external origin which absorbed a significant
proportion of Chad's  already limited resources.   Since 1983,  however,
Chad has made considerable progress toward political stability and
economic  reconstruction.   Real  GDP,  which  had  fallen  almost  202,
increased by 3? per year on average from 1983 to 1987 as a result of
record cotton production in 1983/84 and the recovery in the agriculture
and livestock  sectors following  the drought.   Nevertheless,  economic
growth in 1986 and 1987 remained below the 2.4 2 population growth rate,
due to the cotton crisis, which adversely affected government revenues,
exports, and rural incomes. In the face of this new crisis, the
Government of Chad took urgent action to improve the performance of the
cotton sector and austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit.
2.        Develoument Plan.  At the same time, the Government took steps
to tackle Chad's fundamental development problems and the structural
constraints  in  the  economy.   It  defined  the  main  lines  of   its
development strategy in an Interim Development Plan 1986-88, which
outlines major objectives and specific project proposals and was
presented to the Round Table Donors' Conference in Geneva in December
1985. The Government's long-term development objectives are to ensure
food self-sufficiency, diversify the base of the economy by reducing its
dependence on cotton, restore and maintain the transportation network
and accelerate the development of human resources. Work is in progress
to establish the strategies and measures needed to achieve these
objectives in priority sectors and at the macro-economic level.
3.        Policy Framework Paser 1987-90.  It is against this background
that  the  Government,   in  conjunction   with  the   World  Bank   and
International Monetary Fund, prepared a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for
the period 1987-90. T  "FP outlines the principal structural problems
in the Chadian economy including: over-dependence on the cotton sector,
the low level of physical, human and institutional infrastructure, the
imbalances in public finances, inadequate performance by the public
enterprises  and  constraints  on  credit  to  the  economy.   The  main
quantitative targets for the 1987-90 adjustment program are to: achieve
an average annual economic growth rate of 22 in real terms, keep the
rate of inflation to S a year, reduce the current account deficit
(including official transfers) from 13.52 of GDP in 1985186 to 102, and
contain the overall balance of paymeiits deficit at an average of SDR 6
million (or about 252  of the average deficit  for 1985 and 1986).   The
policy document contains a series of measures to be taken to achieve
these targets. We have already received support from the International



ANNEX III
34                            Page 3 of 13
Monetary Fund for the first year of this program in the form of an
agreement under the Structural Adjustment Facility, reached in October
1987, and a first loan tranche for the period 1987188. We itend to
pursue this program.
Adjustment Prostrs 1988-1 89
4.        On the basis of the PFP, the Government of Chad has drawn up a
detailed reform program for 1988-1989. The aim during this phase of the
adjustment program is to prepare the ground for reform of two sectors
that are crucial for improving the utilization of economic resources:
public finances and the cotton sector. These are also the sectors that
require iumediate and substantial financial support to maintain and
strengthen their development. We have also embarked on a number of
studies covering the public enterprise sector. public administration,
and the social dimenaions of adjustment, the results of which will serve
to prepare later phases of the adjustment process. The Government of
Chad has therefore initiated a process of economic policy reform which
will be pursued in several stages and is designed to improve the
effectiveness of our economic management and strengthen the base for
Chad's long-term development. The 1988/1989 Action Plan appears in
Attachment 1 of this letter.
A.  Public Sector Resource Nanaeen_ t
5.        The  1988-1989  phase  of   the  public  resource   management
component covers the following five areass sectoral strategies, the
public investment program, current expenditures, fiscal reform and the
public sector financing plan.
6.        The Government intends to  achieve the objectives outlined  in
the Interim Development Plan by implementing strategies prepared for the
main sectors of the economy. These strategies will comprise analyses of
sectoral problems, the identification of objectives and priorities, the
development  of   sectoral criteria   for  selecting   investments,   a
medium-torm investment program, and analysis of the implications for the
structure and volume of current expenditure, and cost recovery measures.
The institutional aspects and the need to strengthen the administrative
structure will also be addressed in these strategies. In conjunction
with the World Bank, a strategy document for the transportation sector
has already been prepared and was submitted to a donors' meeting held in
N'Djamena in February 1988. Formulation of a development strategy for
the rural sector and the irrigation subsector is underway. We intend to
prepare strategies for the education and health sectors before the end
of 1988  and  1989  respectively.   Given  the  importance  of  external
assistance for our development programs in each of these sectors, we
plan to present these strategies to the donors. Moreover, preparation
of a planning document began in May 1988. This exercise will allow us
to analyze Chad's economic and social situation, to determine the
country's strengths and weaknesses, to define sectoral strategies and to
prepare action programs. The sectors for which development strategies
have not been formulated will therefore be included in this exercise.
7.        To ensure effective utilization  of financing, the  Government
resumed the preparation of a public investment program in 1987 after an
interval of 12 years. This effort has been intensified for preparation
of the  1988 investment  program.  The program,  amounting to  CFA?  81
billion, emphasizes the development of the agriculture sector and the



ANNEX III
- 35 -                         Page 4 of 13
rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network, and also launches a
rebuilding of  the  social  sectors.   To improve  the  quality  of  the
investment program we are undertaking  additional studies, in the  areas
of irrigation, public enterprises and education; the conclusions of
these studies will be incorporated into the final decisions on project
implementation.   The  Government  intends  to  introduce  a  three-year
rolling public investment program. With this purpose, we prepared a
public investment program for the years 1988-90 in December 1987.   Thie
program will be updated annually and reviewed with the World Bank and
other interested donors. This program will be updated annually. We are
well aware of the problem of recurrent charges arising from investments.
Some 60Z of the assistance provided by donors is beinS used to meet
Government  operating  expenditures  and  the  costs  of  training   and
technical assistance relating to investment projects. Given the present
low debt servicing potential of Cnad's economy, we are continuing to
seek external financing in the form of grants and loans on highly
concessional  terms.   We  are  in  the  process  of  strengthening  the
preparation and monitoring of the investment program with the support of
UNDP and the World Bank. In April 1988, selection criteria for public
investments were adopted by the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation.
Finally, as regards the social sectors, we are studying ways of
maximizing use of available resources by encouraging the financial
participation of benEficiaries.
8.        The adjustment  program  also  includes  an  augmentation  and
restructuring of current expenditures under the support of the Financial
Rehabilitation Credit (FRC). The restructuring is aimed at increasing
the real operating expenditures of key development ministries whose
budget allocations have been shrinking in recent years as a result of
severe financial constraints. The curreLt level of real expenditures in
these ministries is inadequate to carry out even the most basic
operations and  leads to  the inefficient  use of  our resources.   From
mid-1988  onward,   the   Government will   increase   real   operating
expenditures in the following ministries: Agriculture; Livestock and
Rural Water Supply; Public Works, Housing and Urbanism; Transport and
Civil Aviation: Education; Public Health; Social Affairs and the
Advancement of Women; and  Tourism and  Environmental Protection.   For
1988 total expenditure by these ministries will be CFAF 2 billion. Part
of the necessary resources will come from budget assistance on terms
equivalent to those of  IDA, in the amount  of CFAF 1,500 million.   The
remaining resources will come from the budget as agreed with the DMF.
To the extent necessary, budget allocations as a whole will be adjusted
through supplementary allocations  to be introduced  in July 1988.   The
new allocations will be implemented as fully as circumstances permit so
that actual and planned expenditures coincide as closely as possible.
The overall increase in current expenditures and in the current deficit
in relation to the totals agreed with the IMF under the structural
adjustment facility will not exceed the additional amount provided for
in the  Financial Rehabilitation  Program.   We are  in the  process  of
strengthening the procedures for preparing, executing and monitoring
operating expenditures within the Ministry of Finance and Technology and
the Ministry to the Presidency in charge of General Inspection and State
Control. The Government is currently taking measures to streamline
expenditure authorization procedures (described in Attachment 2) s0 as
to  render  the  system  more  efficient  without  impairing   necessary
Government control. In 1989, we will ensure that the growth of real
expenditures in the ministries mentioned above is in line with the
growth of government revenues and with budget policy objectives to be

_36                            Page 5 of 13
agreed with the 114F. the World Bank. the African Development Bank, and
France.
9.        The Government is  concerned with  the current  status of  the
civil service and recognizes the need for reform. With the support of
USAID, we have already embarked on a census of civil servants. As part
of the first phase of adjustment, a study of the civil serviceladminis-
tration will be conducted in order better to identify the personnel
needs of the various departments and the qualifications required, and to
compare these with current numbers. The Chadian Government has already
undertaken a similar study in the Ministry of Education with French
assistance. The results of these studies and the projections for
government revenues will be factored into any reform of the civil
service.  As well, civil service reform must deal with the question  of
the remuneration of civil servants. who for the most part are receiving
only 60S of their 1967 salary base. Reforms resulting from these
studies will be undertaken during the second phase of the program.   The
Government is currently taking measures to pay the salary arrears of
National Education personnel as determined on July 1, 1988; no new
arrears will be allowed to accumulate with respect to this group.
10.       Given the  gradual  normalization  of  payroll  and  operating
costs, as well as the increase in recurrent costs associated with new
investments, the Government is aware of the need to raise consolidated
budget revenue in relation to GD?. In 1988, revenue growth will depend
largely on the results of the new system of taxing petroleum products
that came into effect in August 1987. Initial difficulties encountered
in implementing the new system are being overcome: since November,
various steps have been taken to improve the way it is administered and
to speed up the collection process. Measures will also be introduced in
1988 to expand the taxation of oil importing companies and limit their
exemptions. On the basis of current inport duty assessments, we are
already able to set our budget revenue target in this area at CFAP 4.5
billion for 1988.   However, a  sustainable increase  in budget  revenue
cannot depend  solely on  the taxation  of petroleum  products.   Other,
supplementary sources of revenue will be tapped as far as allowed by the
degree of overall fiscal pressure the economy can sustain. To this end,
a general study of the whole field of tazation will be undertaken in
conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and the World Lank. On
the basis of this study and other pertinent data, new taxation measures
will be introduced to the extent possible with the 1989 budget.
11.       The  Government  confirmed  its   intention  to  respect   the
financial program established with the staff of the International
Monetary Fund for 1988. This program sets out the objectives mentioned
above  for  taxation  of   petroleum  products,  overall  revenues   and
expenditures, as well as the consolidated budget deficit presented in
Attachment 3 of this statement of development policy. Implementation of
the 1988 budget will be examined in collaboration with the staffs of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
12.       The public sector financing plan (Attachment 3), covering both
the general budget and the cotton sector, takes the form of a sueaarized
statement of our goals for 1988 and 1989. It incorporates current
expenditures, revenues and capital investment, and provides an estimate
of our overall financing needs, including those relating to the
settlement of COTONTCHAD's arrears. Although the figures on external
financing for 1989 should be taken as indicative, it is apparent --



ANNEX III
37                         Page 6 of 13
given the order of magnitude of the country's external financing
requirements -- that significant and sustained non-project support will
be needed. Moreover, the constraint represented by possible settlement
of the arrears of COTONTCHAD will allow no progress toward an effective
solution unless agreement can be reached with the Central Bank on
lowering the charges that now apply. The Government is determined to
set up a plan, designed in conjunction with donors, for settling these
arrears within a reasonable period, and to see to it that the plan is
carried out.
S.   Cotton Sector
13.       The Government  introduced an  emergency  program in  1986  to
respond to the crisis in the cotton sector. The crisis was precipitated
by the sharp fall in the world price of cotton in 1985, and coincided
with a period of lax financial management in COTONTCHAD which resulted
in accumulated operating losses of CFAP 41 billion. With the support of
the World Bank and other donors, the Government undertook an emergency
program covering  the 1986187  and  1987/88 agricultural  seasons.   The
emergency program has succeeded in cutting COTONTCHAD's costs by around
4O0 and reducing its operating losses from CFAP 23 billion in 1985/86 to
CFAP 5 billion in 1987/88.
14.       After this initial phase, the Government began to implement  a
program  of  basic  reforms  covering  the  period  1988/89-1990191   to
re-establish the medium-term economic and financial viability of the
cotton sector. This program has four componentst
(a) a program to increase the efficiency of COTONTCHAD. A number
of measures have been identified to improve the efficiency of
COTONTCHAD. In order to reduce administrative costs and
improve management, most services and personnel will be
transfered from the N'Djamena headquarters to the production
site (Moundou) by May 1989.   This will be accompanied by  the
following actionst   revision  of  the  organizational  chart,
clarification of the division of responsibilities among the
top managers, as well as a management support and training
program;
(b) a program which aims to improve cotton production which
includes support  to extension  and research  services.   This
component aims to:
-    increase cotton production;
-    raise farmers' productivity;
-    reorient the work  programs of the  extension (ONDR)  and
research (IRCT) agencies to respond to farmers' needs;
-    strengthen  coordination  between  COTONTCHAD,  ONDR  and
IRCT; and
-    allocate funds for  IRCT and ONDR's expenditures in  the
government's  budget   to  the   extent possible   given
available resources.



ANNEX III
-38 -                        Page 7 of 13
(c) the establishment of a flexible producer pricing system and a
new price  support mechanism.   The Government  has adopted  a
more flexible producer pricing policy designed to take into
account fluctuations in world cotton prices and to reduce and
eventually eliminate the sector's deficit. To this end, the
Government has introduced a price differential for three
qualities of seed cotton and will reduce the floor producer
price to a maximum of 90 CFAP per kilogramme -for first quality
seed cotton for the 1989/90 and 1990/91 seasons. By November
1938, the Government will also establish a fund to support the
floor producer price   and develop  guidelines for  allocating
surpluses that arise from high world prices; such guidelines
will give top priority to farmers.
(d) a plan for settlement of COTONTCHAD's arrears. In order to
reduce  COTONTCHAD's  arrears  to  the  banking  system,   the
Government has begun discussions with the Central Bank which
appears to be favorably disposed to the idea of freezing the
arrears falling under the 1984 moratorium, for a period which
has not yet been determined. Negotiations are underway with
other donors to settle the balance of the arrears.
15.       A contrat-plan, which is to be adopted by August 1988, defines
the environment within which the objectives of the restructuring program
will be achieved, the means for achieving these objectives, the schedule
for  the  program's   execution,  as well   as  the  Government's   and
COTONTCHAD's respective commitments under the program.
C. Preparation of Future Reforms
16.       As indicated above, this first phase of our adjustment program
includes studies to prepare for reforms that will be undertaken during
later stages of the program. We have already referred to studies of the
tax system and the civil service, which will provide a basis for further
reforms in the area of public finances. We also envisage studies on
public enterprises, the agriculture sector, education and training, and
the social dimensions of adjustment.
17.       We are preparing a reform program to improve the  performance
of public enterprises and to rationalize the economic environment in
which they operate.   We have already  initiated a first  batch of  five
diagnostic studies of public enterprises, which will be completed before
the end of 1988; we intend to begin studies on a second batch of
enterprises by the end of 1988. A study of cross arrears among
parastatals is also underway. The restructuring of the cotton sector
described above is an important part of this reform. We have also taken
measures in two other sectorst in livestock, we have decided to
deregulate the distribution of veterinary products in mid-1988 and their
importation as of January 1, 1991; we have also decided to eliminate
export restrictions on livestock and to rationalize administrative
procedures in April 1988. A complete system of cost recovery for
veterinary services was introduced in April 1988. In the transportation
sector we initiated a study in November-1987 of the functions of the CTT
(Coopdration des Transporteurs Tchad'ens) and a study of the possibility
of privatizing quarrying operations currently undertaken by OPCA.



ANNEX III
- 39 -                     Page 8 of 13
18.       In the area of rural development, we plan to conduct two major
studies. The first we envisage as a master plan for development of the
Sudanese zone, where the principal income-producing activity until now
has been cotton-growing. Uhile taking current development programs and
existing studies into account, it will incorporate all possible avenues
of development (diversification of output, upgrading and/or building of
roads,  storage  facilities,   reorganization  of  extension   services,
intensification  of   research,  means   of  transportation,   marketing
organization, processing of products, ..ransportation of products to
deficit areas, etc.), the final goal is a well-balanced development of
this zone and its integration with the rest of the country. The second
major study proposed, which will prepare the way for reforms in the
agricultural sector, is concerned with the problem of food security.
19.       As regards the  education/training sector, over  the next  two
years we intend, on the basis of studies supported in IDA, ADB and the
French Government, to prepare a sectoral policy framework that will
enable us to avoid major structural distortions in this important sector
and to achieve balanced development of the different levels of education
in innovative ways, while taking into account priority training needs,
our budgetary constraints and changes in our employment market.
20.       With  regard  to  the  social  dimensions  of  the  adjustment
program, we have begun the work of collecting statistics on population
and living standards; we have also begun to prepare complementary
measures. In particular, we will take account of the social dimensions
of adjustment in formulating strategies for the social sectors and in
the allocation  of current  expenditures.   We envisage  a  sociological
study, a medium-term demographic study and a mini-survey of incomes and
consumption. We also hope to study the potential impact of reductions
in the civil service and in the staff of public enterprises before
implementing reforms in these areas. We intend, with donor assistance,
to create a fund to provide support and start-up help to new small
holders in marginal cotton-growing areas and COTONTCHAD personnel
dismissed as a result of measures taken as part of the emergency program
and the adjustment program.   This Fund will  also support projects  and
programs in urban and rural small-scale enterprises, the improvement of
urban and rural living conditions, as well as nutrition and health.
