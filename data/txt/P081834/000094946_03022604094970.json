The expansion of services under the additional\n            finance will incorporate the experience of the project\n            implementation to date, and that from international\n            experiences in the design of water and sanitation projects\n            for low income communities. This additional finance is\n            justified due to a funding shortfall beyond the\n            Borrower's control - bankruptcy of the financing agency\n            for secondary networks - where only 60 percent of the\n            project's original expansion targets for water and\n            sanitation services have been achieved, thus risking to\n            substantially under-utilize a significant proportion of the\n            Bank resources already been devoted to the expansion of\n            primary networks, due to the absence of secondary networks\n            to connect with households of intended beneficiaries.
