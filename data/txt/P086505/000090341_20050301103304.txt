A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Country and sector issues

Approximately 95% of the urban population in China i s served by a municipal water supply
system, and 68% have access to improved sanitation. Seasonal water shortages, however, affect
more than 400 o f China's 669 cities, and around 110cities are facing serious shortages requiring
severe water use restrictions. Water shortages cause an average of US$36 billion in economic
loss per year in China. The lack of adequate wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure
results in severe water pollution, with an estimated 88% of rivers and 70% of coastal seas
classified as moderately to highly polluted. The lothFive Year Plan (2001-2005) called
for increasingthe percentage of urban wastewater treated from 15% to 45%, and all cities with
populations greater than 5 million should have treatment coverage of over 60%. The Government
has also mandated new policy directions, including integrated water resource management,
commercialization of the water and wastewater sector, setting tariffs at full cost-recovery levels,
and attracting private investment. Although the ambitious targets of the lothFive Year Plan will
probably not be met, the more affluent coastal cities, such as Ningbo Municipality, are taking the
lead in constructing new infrastructure and experimenting with policy reforms.

Ningbo Municipality i s located approximately 150 k m s south of Shanghai on the edge of
Hangzhou Bay. Ningbo i s the primary deep-water port for the Yangzte Deltaregion, andhas a
thriving industrial sector focused on the export of manufacturedgoods. Although part of
Zhejiang Province, the Municipality i s a separate economic planning unit and i s not
administratively controlled by the provincial government. The primary city inthe Municipality
i s "Ningbo City" which extends over six urban districts and covers one quarter of the
Municipality. The Municipality also includes three rural counties, and two city-level counties,
one of which i s called "Cixi City." The Project finances investments in Ningbo City and Cixi
City.

A key element inNingbo's economic success has been the development of a vibrant private
sector. Ningbo's entrepreneurial trading heritage, and the relative absence of large state-owned
enterprises, has given local businesses an opportunity to take advantage of their favorable
location on international shippinglanes and close proximity to the economically vibrant Yangtze
Delta. The Municipal Government's policy i s to foster private sector investment, promote
education and science, and provide high-quality infrastructure for the region. Investments in
water infrastructure, however, have lagged behind rapid economic development.

Ningbo i s addressing water issues through a regional approach, with the establishment of a
multi-sector "Water and Environment Leading Group," chaired by the Executive Municipal Vice
Mayor and headed b y the MunicipalDevelopment Planning Commission. The Leading Group i s
facilitating investments and management systems which cut across administrative boundaries to
resolve Ningbo's serious water and wastewater problems, including those inNingbo and Cixi
Cities.

Ningbo City i s facing a two dimensional water crisis common to many Chinese cities: frequent
shortages andpoor water quality. Water supply deficiencies pose a drag on economic growth and
endanger public health. The core urban area of Ningbo City i s served by the Ningbo Water



                                                  1

Supply Company (NWSC), and around 30 small companies provide water to towns located
within Ningbo City. The companies draw water primarily from highly polluted local rivers and
use outdated treatment technology, rendering the quality of piped water questionable. Due to the
lack of storage reservoirs and a reliance on local rivers, Ningbo City often experiences water
shortages duringthe dry season. The City's rapid economic expansion has increased demand on
the order of 5-10% per year, and in spite of an aggressive water conservation program, the
duration and intensity of droughts have been increasing. The Ningbo Municipal Government has
started implementation of an ambitious program to develop highquality water supplies, transfer
the water to Ningbo City, and upgrade water treatment and distribution infrastructure. NWSC i s
a well established company serving the core urban area, but there i s scope for improving its
operational and financial performance. The NWSC service area will be expanded to include all
2.5 million residents of Ningbo City, incorporating the surrounding town water supply systems,
and thereby obtaining economies of scale and professional management.

Cixi City, located north of Ningbo City on the shore of Hangzhou Bay, has a population of
around one million people and a dynamic economy. Currently, only 10% o f the wastewater in
Cixi i s treated, and the lack of an adequate wastewater management system i s inhibitingpotential
investors, increasing pollution to HangzhouBay, and creating public health concerns. Cixi City
plans to provide coverage to all urban areas and industries by 2010. A new company, the Cixi
Municipal Sewage Company (CMSC) was established inmid-2004 to be responsible for all
wastewater collection andtreatment facilities. The CMSC management i s facing the dual
challenge of starting up a new company and managing a large capital works program.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The World Bank has been a close partner inNingbo's water sector over the past decade. The
Zhejiang Multi-Cities Development Project (Ln.24750 closed 12/31/01) financed critical water
supply infrastructure for Ningbo City, and the Zhejiang Urban Environment Project (Ln47240,
FY04) i s financing a significant portion of Ningbo City's wastewater program. The Ningbo
Water and Environment Project (NWEP) will finance additional investments for water supply in
Ningbo City, and will support the first comprehensive wastewater management system outside of
Ningbo City in neighboring Cixi City.

With its strong economy, Ningbo has many financing options. The decision to seek World Bank
financing i s motivated primarily by the desire of municipal authorities to employ international
methodologies, standards, and techniques to improve water and wastewater planning,
construction, and service. In addition to the physical infrastructure, NWEP will finance technical
assistance activities in water supply strategic planning, utility price and regulatory reforms, and
operational improvements for both NWSC and CMSC.

The proposed Ningbo Water andEnvironment Project will address two key themes from the
China Country Assistance Strategy: (i)   accelerating the transition to a market economy through
improving public sector management and delivery of services; and (ii)     facilitating an
environmentally sustainable development process, through better management of water



                                                  2

resources. Two strategic issues for the Bank's urban development program in China are
incorporated into the Project design:

>    A focus on urban waterplanning and resource management,where problems are reaching
     a crisis level inmany cities, including Ningbo. The Project will be the first major Bank-
     financed urban water supply operation since the mid-1990s.

P A concentrationonregionalintegration,by providing water andwastewater infrastructure,
     and management systems that transcend administrative boundaries.

Recent World Bank analytical work has highlighted the importance of addressing the pressing
needs of urban water and wastewater management. Three key reports are: (i)       China Water
Resources Strategy (2002); (ii)   China: Air, Land, and Water (2001); and (iii) Agenda for
                                                                                 China:
Water Sector Strategy for North China (2002), all of which point to the development importance
of Bank engagement inthe water sector.

The Project will facilitate the expansion and quality of water and wastewater services inNingbo
City and Cixi City in an economically efficient and environmentally sustainable manner, thereby
protecting public health, improving the environment, and supporting economic growth. The key
indicators are:

9 Increase inthe percentage of water suppliedfrom highquality andreliable water sources and
     treatment plants inNingbo City from 10% to 75%; and

9 Increaseinthe percentage of wastewater collected andtreated inCixi City from 10%to 65%.

4. Projectcomponents

Component 1: Ningbo Water Supply (US$157.9 million; IBRD-US$67.3 million): The
component includes: (i)     raw water supply line consisting of an intake tower inJiaokou reservoir
and a 9.6 kmtunnel; (ii)    500,000 m3/d Maojiaping water treatment plant; and (iii) water
                                                                                       treated
transmission pipes, including a new 47 kmring main around Ningbo City, and 29 k m s of
transmission pipes from Maojiaping water treatment plant to the new ring main. The component
i s a significant part of Ningbo's overall plan to service the entire city, improve water quality b y
accessing new water sources and upgrade water treatment, and enhance distribution system



                                                   3

reliability and flexibility. The ringmain will be the first of its kindinChina and will be one of
the major technical innovations under the Project.

Component 2: Cixi Wastewater (US$128.4 million; IBRD-US$57.9 million): The component
includes: (i) two wastewater treatment plants, one located in the north of Cixi (100,000 m3/d)
and one in the east (50,000 m3/d); and (ii)  associated collection system mains and link sewers
(230 km of pipe and 58 pumpstations). The component will provide comprehensive wastewater
services for all urban areas in Cixi City, and help protect Hangzhou Bay.

Component 3: InstitutionalDevelopment (US$4.5 million; IBRD-US$4.1 million): Technical
assistance will be provided to improve water planning, utility price and service regulation, and
enhance NWSC and CMSC operational andbusinessmanagement capacities. Design review and
construction management technical assistance will also be provided to ensure smooth
implementation of the infrastructure works.

5. Lessons learned and reflected inthe Project design

Coastal cities in China, and particularly Ningbo City, are growing at a rapidpace which makes
planning for utility services such as water and wastewater very challenging. Past experience in
China has shown that demand i s typically over-estimated, mainly due to lack o f sophisticated
planning techniques and inadequate consideration of price elasticity o f demand. Original water
demand estimates prepared by NWSC domestic consultants were not realistic. NWSC changed
domestic consultants and prepared revised and reduced estimates, which were verified by
independent international consultants. The short-term forecasts up to 2010 are acceptable to the
Bank for project planning purposes. Long-term demand forecasts up to 2040, however, shouldbe
adjusted over time to reflect changing conditions and the capital investment programs should be
modified accordingly. The Project will therefore assist Ningbo City with its long-term water
supply planning, and prepare the basis for the next five year capital investment program from
2010-2015.

Both Cixi and Ningbo City are embarking on simultaneous large capital investment programs in
water supply and wastewater. Water users receive a consolidated water and wastewater bill
(although the two services are separated in the bill), and thus will experience a significant
increase in overall water costs. Tariff increases inNingbo, as throughout China, generally take
considerable time to process, and lack of timely approval can increase company financial risk.
The Project design takes this into account by requiring tariff increases in 2006 and 2008, and
including a technical assistance component to upgrade the analytical tools and procedures used
to determine appropriate tariff adjustments.

Advanced technologies for water and wastewater treatment are often used in China without
considering the financial or operational implications. Carbon-activated-filtration was originally
proposed for the Maojiaoping water treatment plant, but was subsequently dropped when water
quality tests showed that it was not necessary. Tertiary treatment consisting of chemical
coagulation and filtration was originally proposedfor the Cixi wastewater treatment plant
(WWTP), but was subsequently replacedwith an engineered wetland which will reduce
operating cost and complexity.



                                                  4

6. Alternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection

A comprehensive analysis was undertaken for the optimal location of the treatment plants. Three
alternatives were considered for the Maojiaoping site, and the site with the lowest cost and least
resettlement issues was selected. For the Cixi WWTP, consideration was given according to
having one, two, or three new plants. An engineering-economic analysis indicated that two new
plants provided the optimal balance of capital and operating costs.

Different alternatives for the layout of the Ningbo City water distribution system were examined.
Since the city i s essentially divided into three areas by rivers, consideration was given to
maintaining the three essentially independent distribution systems and upgrading the three
associated water treatment plants. This alternative was rejectedin favor of a ring main and two
large treatment plants. The ring main-two plant option provides more flexibility and reliability,
and the two new treatment plants are located outside of the core urban area in locations more
suitable for receiving new raw water supplies. The long-term plan is to decommission the
existing water treatment plants in the city, and release the land for higher value uses.

There are approximately 30 towns surroundingthe core urban area inNingbo City. Currently,
these towns have their own water supply systems which rely on low quality local surface water
sources and rudimentary treatment plants. One alternative would be to upgrade the existing town
water systems and supply highquality raw water. This alternative was rejectedin favor of
extending the NWSC service area to all towns. The NWSC option was chosen because it would
ensure highquality water supplies for all city residents, lower costs due to NWSC's economies
of scale, and help equalize water supply tariffs throughout the city.

Private sector participation for both the Ningbo and Cixi components were considered. Given the
urgency of the water supply situation inNingbo City, the Government requested NWSC to
construct the new facilities, although there i s some consideration of inviting strategic investors to
support NWSC inthe future. NWSC i s developing a separate water supply systemfor a large
industrial estate and i s actively seeking private investors to support the project. The Bank task
team discussed the option of a management contract for the Cixi plants, but the Cixi government
prefers the recently established CMSC to be responsible for all aspects of wastewater
management.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements (ifapplicable)

The Project i s free-standing and does not have any other international co-financiers. Ningbo
Municipality, however, i s seeking a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant to support wetland
conservation in Cixi City. The potential GEF funded activities are closely associated with the
NWEPcomponent in Cixi.




                                                    5

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements

The Ningbo MunicipalDevelopment Planning Commission (MDPC) is the executing agency for
the Project. The Project Management Office (PMO) i s located under MDPC and is fully
mobilized with sufficient and adequately qualified staff. The PMO i s the Bank's primary liaison
inthe implementation of the Project, andtakes responsibility for project monitoring and
reporting. There will be one special account locatedin and managed b y the Ningbo Municipal
Finance Bureau. The PMO will authorize reimbursements to the two implementing entities,
NWSC and CMSC.

Policy direction for the Project will be provided by the Water and Environment Leading Group.
The Leading Group i s headed by the Executive Vice Mayor of the Municipality and i s composed
of Directors from the MDRC, Environmental Protection Bureau, Water Resources Bureau,
Construction Bureau, andFinance Bureau. The Leading Group's mandate i s to provide policy
direction and planning support for integratedwater and environmental management throughout
the Municipality.

NWSC i s the implementing organization for Component 1.The company was legally established
in 1982, butcan trace its operating history back to 1926 with the city's original water supply.
The NWSC has created a Project Management Unit (PMU) under the direction of an Assistant
Chief Engineer. The PMUi s staffed with qualified procurement, financial management,
environmental, and resettlement staff. NWSC i s experienced in managing large capital
investment projects, and i s also familiar with Bank procedures, as the company received
financing under the Zhejiang Multi-Cities Development Project.

CMSC i s the implementing organization for Component 2. The company was legally established
inmid-2004. Staff andexisting assets were transferred from the Cixi DrainageDepartment to the
CMSC shortly afterwards. Since the NWEP represents essentially all of CMSC's capital
investment program, there i s no distinct project management unit; rather the project i s under the
direct supervision of the CMSC General Manager, with the relevant departments providing
procurement, financial management, environmental, and resettlement support. The CMSC has
limitedexperience inmanaging large capital projects and is not familiar with Bank procedures.
These constraints will be addressedthrough project financed technical assistance programs for
Project and company management.

Component 3 i s aimed at a variety of government agencies and the two companies, NWSC and
CMSC. The PMO will responsible for general implementation of the component, but most
activity will take place at the company or agency level. Government agencies involved in the
component include the Cixi and Ningbo price bureaus, construction commissions, and the Water
and Environment Leading Group.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

Annex 3 lists the main outcome indicators for the Project, as well as the principle results
indicators for each component. The PMO, NWSC, and CMSC will regularly collect the data



                                                  6

required for monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results. The Water and Environment
Leading Group will review results on the basis of progress reports, andtake corrective action
when needed.

4. Sustainability

Ningbo Municipality i s committed to the success of the Project as the future economic
development of Ningbo City and Cixi City partly depends on successful Project implementation.
The degree of importance attached to the Project i s reflected inthe active participation of high-
level government officials in the Leading Group. The PMO has been established as a permanent
government agency, and thus i s able to attract qualified individuals who are offered.job security
and promotion potential. NWSC and CMSC have invested significant amounts of their own
funds inProject preparationand have prepared highquality feasibility studies, environmental
assessments, and resettlement action plans.

Financial sustainability of the companies i s the key to Project success. Ningbo City and Cixi City
have demonstrated their commitment to ensuring adequate revenues for the companies by
significantly increasing tariffs in 2004. Legal covenants for increasing tariffs in2006 and 2008
have also been agreed upon by the Municipal Government. Both NWSC and CMSC have well
qualified technical staff that can ensure efficient operation of the facilities.

5. Critical risks and possiblecontroversialaspects

The Project design assumes that the rapid economic development inNingbo will continue for at
least another decade. An unexpected economic slow down could significantly alter projected
water (and wastewater) demand, reduce expected company revenue, and result in underutilized
infrastructure. This systemic risk i s partly mitigated by the phasing of infrastructure investments,
to the extent possible, to respond to changes. Providing adequate water and wastewater services
i s a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for sustaining economic growth.

Annex 10 (Safeguards) and Sections D.4, D.5,and D.6 below discuss the due diligence activities
taken by the Bank task team to ensure that there are no major reputational risks, and the
measures which will be taken duringimplementationto ensure compliance with the Bank's
safeguard policies. Risks associated more directly with the Project are summarized as follows:

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

Projected Tariffs: Financial projections have been prepared for NWSC and CMSC on an annual
basis over the 2004 - 2015 period. A price elasticity of demand of -25% was used in Ningbo
and all categories in Cixi except for industries. The industrial base in Cixi i s modernand has
generally already adopted water saving technologies and thus no price impact on demand i s
expected. The projections are based on the requirement of each company to comply with the
proposed project financial covenants. The projectedtariff requirements are summarized below:

NWSC Financial Analysis: As of January 2004 the average water supply tariff was increased by
17% to 1.42 RMB/m3. This represents a 17% increase relative to the previous tariff, which had
been implementedin August 1999. Ningbo appears to have had difficulty implementing regular
and timely tariff increases, which suggests a need for improvements inunderlying regulatory
mechanisms. The recent tariff increases had been under review by the Municipal Government for
at least 30 months. Duringthis period, NWSC incurrednet losses andneeded to rely heavily on


                                                  9

relatively short-term commercial bank loans to finance much needed capital works. The project
will provide technical assistance to those agencies within the Ningbo Municipal Government
responsible for price and service regulation for strengthening these mechanisms.

Projections preparedfor NWSC indicate that ongoing and plannedcapital investments will place
a significant financial burden on the company over the next decade. Actual and plannedcapital
expenditures over the 10 year period from 2002 to 2011 are estimated as RMB 4.1 billion, of
which 70% i s concentrated in the 2004 - 2008 period. Over this five year period, the company's
proposed NWEP component accounts for just under half of total planned investment. Assuming
that NWSC can successfully implement the required tariff increases, the company i s projectedto
be able to operate on a financially sustainable basis, but due to its very large capital investment
program, cash flow and debt service will need to be carefully managed. Net income i s projected
to be positive in all years enabling the company to comply with the project revenue covenant,
with the possible exception of 2006.

A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact of potential changes in
the key variables. Of the single variable events, a one year delay intariff increases, has the
greatest impact. A delay in tariff increases, and a 5% reduction in water demand i s projected to
result cash shortfalls of about RMB 140million and RMB 200 million in 2006 and 2008
respectively. While this might also be addressedthrough debt deferments and new borrowings,
repaying this additional debt could require up to 10years.

CMSC Financial Analysis: UntilApril 2004, the city government applied wastewater charges
only to commercial and special use groups. However, as of M a y 2004, new wastewater tariffs
were introduced that apply to all customer groups. The average wastewater tariff in Cixi i s now
RMB 0.37/m3 comparedto RMB 0.49/m3inthe Ningbo urban core. CMSC, incontrast to
NWSC, will depend heavily on equity contributions to fund its capital investment program. Cixi
City will contribute approximately 350 million RMB to CMSC, about one-third of the total
project cost. An analysis o f the fiscal impact indicates that the project counterpart contributions
to be allocated b y the Cixi Government are well within its financial capacity.

The financial projections prepared for CMSC indicate that very significant tariff increases will
be required to enable it to operate on a financially viable basis. The average tariff will need to be
increased by about 130% as o f 2006, and then by a further 66%, to RMB 1.43/m3,by the
beginning of 2008. The increase in 2008 i s designed to fully recover NWEP operating and
maintenance costs and to meet debt service on the NWEPproject loans. Additional, but smaller
increases are projected to be required in 2010 and 2012, of 18% and 15% respectively, which
would bring the average tariff to just under RMB 2/m3.Even with these very large tariff
increases, debt service will place a considerable strain on CMSC, particularly over the 2010 -
2014 period. Assuming that the requiredtariff increases are successfully implemented beginning
in2006, the company shouldbe able to comply with the cost recovery covenant inall years.
However, the projections indicate that CMSC might experience some difficulty inmeeting the
debt service covenant inthose years inwhich debt service is greatest.

Changes in key variables have been assessedinterms of their potential impact on the financial
position of CMSC. A one year delay inimplementing the required tariff increases would have
the greatest adverse impact on the company. A delay inthe implementation of the first two

increases now planned for the beginning of 2006 and 2008 could constrain CMSC's capacity to
provide its share of project counterpart funding. The estimated shortfall i s about RMB 20
million, which could be addressedthrough an increase inthe city government's contribution. The
city government has agreed to meet all counterpart requirements not met by CMSC.

Ability to Pay. An affordability analysis has been undertaken and two representative household
groups were considered: (i)    the average income group; and, (ii) low-income group, which i s
                                                                   the
defined as the household earningthe average of the lowest 10thpercentile of income
distribution. The proposed tariff increases are affordable for both groups, with the
watedwastewater bills accounting for less than 1% of the average family income and 1.5% of the
low income households. For the very poorest households, the municipal government extends low
income protection under which a minimumincome of RMB 280 -RMB 320 per person,
depending on the number of persons in the household, i s guaranteed. This amount includes a
provision for lifeline utility services. With increases inboth water and wastewater tariffs in
2004, an additional direct subsidy amount has been provided to all households qualifying for the
social assistance. InNingbo, the entire increase in water and wastewater tariffs i s refundedon
the first 10m3of water consumed. InCixi, the increase i s refunded for all water consumed by
qualifying low income households.

NWSC Economic Analysis: A benefit-cost analysis was undertaken for the Ningbo water supply
component which yielded an economic internal rate of return of 15.6%. Three benefits were
incorporatedinto the analysis: i)value of the incremental supply of water; ii)improved water
quality; and iii)reduction inbottled water usage. A least cost engineering-economic analysis was
undertaken for the Cixi wastewater component. Details are provided in Annex 10.

2. Technical

The technical viability of both the Ningbo water component and Cixi wastewater component has
been confirmed by the Bank task team. Independent international consultants have also reviewed
the respective feasibility studies and provided design advice.

For the Ningbo component, the Maojiaping plant uses proven and appropriate treatment
technology, The ring main i s an innovative measure to increase water service reliability and
flexibility, and will be the first of its kind in China. An important issue in design o f the treatment
plant and ring main i s the accuracy of the water demand forecasts. Inthe short-term, Ningbo City
has considerable flexibility in the pace at which it downgrades and decommissions existing
plants in the city center which rely on low quality raw water from local rivers. If the 2010 water
demand i s lower than forecast, the existing plants inthe City center can be decommissioned or
downgradedmore quickly; alternatively, if demand i s higher than anticipated, the plants can be
kept in service longer. The ring main i s designed with a 40 year design horizon and conservative
long-term forecasts were used to ensure adequate capacity. Hydraulic modeling was undertaken
to confirm ring main size and distribution system layout.

A number of technical issues were reviewed for the Cixi wastewater component. Cixi City, like
Ningbo City, i s growing rapidly and there i s considerable uncertainty in the wastewater
forecasts, and thus a phased approach i s taken for the development of the wastewater treatment
plants. The collection system pipes are conservatively designed for the long-term flows. The


                                                    11

long conveyance distance and retention time inthe collection system makes septicity a potential
concern, and appropriate measures will be taken to reduce this risk.The wastewater will be
treated to Class I A standards for discharge into the large Cixi canal network. In order to meet
this stringent standard, tertiary treatment is necessary, and an engineered wetland has been
chosen as the preferred form of tertiary treatment. Water quality modeling was undertaken to
determine the preferred location of discharge points, and the water quality impacts on the canal
network.

3. Fiduciary

The financial management assessmentconcludedthat the Project meets minimumBank financial
management requirements, as stipulated in OPBP 10.2. The Project will have in place an
adequate financial management systemthat can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and
timely information on the status of the Project in the reporting format agreed with the Bank.

An assessmentof the procurementcapacity of the implementing agencies has been carried out in
accordance with standard Bank procedures. The key procurement risk under the Project i s the
lack of CMSC experience with World Bank procedures. The corrective measures which have
been agreed are: i)the Project will include a designreview and management consultancy to
assist both CMSC and NWSC; and ii)an experienced design institute and tendering company
will be recruited for Project preparation and procurement assistance. The overall project risk for
procurement i s averape.


4. Social

A resettlement action plan (RAP) meeting the World Bank's OPBP 4.12 has been prepared for
the Ningbo Water Supply and Cixi Wastewater components. The resettlement impacts are
relatively small given the scope of the Project with 60 ha of permanent land acquisition affecting
519 people; and 371 ha of temporary land acquisition affecting around 5,000 people, primarily
for the laying of undergroundpipes along roads. The detailed socio-economic survey indicates
the project will not affect any minority ethnic groups. A resettlement policy framework has also
beenprepared in the event there are minor unanticipatedadditional resettlement activities. The
task team conducted a due diligence review of past Zhougongzhai resettlement activities and has
determined that those activities were conducted largely in accordance with Bank policies and
standards.

A survey of towns was undertaken to assess the demand for expanding NWSC service. The
overwhelming majority of towns strongly support the concept of NWSC service, although some
towns would like to operate their own water system and purchase bulk treated water while others
would like to transfer ownership and operation responsibility to NWSC. Currently, the Yinzhou
government, Ningbo Municipal Government, and NWSC are in discussion on how best to
provide NWSC service to the towns.

5. Environment

The Project i s classified as a "Category A" project, and a full Environmental Impact Assessment
has been prepared. The Project as a whole will have significant net positive impact as it will
improve the water supply, reduce water pollution, and promote the sustainable development of
Ningbo Municipality. The environmental issues associated with each component are discussed
below.

Ningbo Water Supply Component: There are two reservoirs on the Zhangzi River which supply
water for the Project: Jiaokou reservoir andthe Zhougongzhai reservoir which i s located 8 k m s
upstream of Jiaokou and i s currently under construction. The raw water intake for the
Maojiaping water treatment plant will be located at Jiaokou reservoir. The Zhangxi River flows
into the western Yinzhou plain and i s a medium-sized tributary to the Fenghua River-one of the
largest rivers in Ningbo Municipality. The analysis conducted duringproject preparation
indicates that a significant percentage of the annual inflow into Jiaokou reservoir will be diverted
to Ningbo City. The water balance calculations indicate that this will not have an adverse impact
on other water users such as irrigation, animal husbandry, village water supplies, etc. The reason
for the lack of impacts i s the additional storage provided by the upstream Zhougongzhai
reservoir. Duringthe critical dry season months of April-May, the JiaokodZhougongzhai
reservoir system will release sufficient water to meet downstream demands, while still satisfying
the demand from Ningbo City. Wet season flows, however, will be reduced and the altering of
the hydrological cycle may adversely impact the eco-system along a 20 kilometer stretch,
although there are no identified rare species or important commercial fisheries in Zhangzi River.
A comprehensive environmental flows assessment will be undertaken duringproject
implementation to determine minimumflow requirements and adjust reservoir operations
appropriately. In addition, there will be close monitoring of impacts during operations, and a
process will be established for addressing any complaints.

Cixi Wastewater Component: Two alternative treated effluent disposal options for the Cixi
wastewater treatment plants were analyzed duringproject preparation - disposal to Hangzhou
Bay, and disposal to the Cixi canal network. Due to the shallow depth o f Hangzhou Bay off the
coast of Cixi and the large tidal fluctuations, disposal through an outfall i s technically complex
and prohibitively expensive. Since water i s scarce in Cixi and the treated effluent can be
considered a resource, the preferred alternative i s to discharge to the Cixi canal network and
reuse the water for irrigation. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) indicates that this
proposal i s acceptable as the canal network has a large storage capacity and the wastewater will
be treated to the highest national standards.

The wastewater will be treated to Class 1A standards, which i s essentially tertiary treatment with
nutrient removal, for discharge into the large Cixi canal network. Tertiary treatment will be
provided through an engineered wetland. The sludge from the treatment plants will be
mechanically dewatered and disposed of innearby municipal landfills. The capacity and quality
of the landfill sites i s confirmed inthe EIA.A sludge monitoring program i s outlined in the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and CMSC will consider options for beneficially
reusingthe treated sludge.

Inaddition to the Environmental Assessment andInvoluntary Resettlementpolicies discussed in
the preceding sections, two other Safeguardpolicies are triggered:

Dam Safety: The DamSafety SafeguardPolicy (OP4.36) i s triggered by the Project because the
Project relies directly on water provided by Jiaokou and Zhougongzhai reservoirs. Inaddition,
three other dams also provide water for Ningbo City. The task team has reviewedthe safety of
the four existing dams, andprogresson the construction of the Zhougongzhai, and has found
them satisfactory. EmergencyPreparationPlansfor Zhougongzhai andJiaokou dams will be
preparedduring project implementation. The Banktask team will also review anddocument for
the Project files the construction progress, commissioning, and the first filling of Zhougongzhai
dam.

Cultural Property: Surveys indicate that project activities would not affect any above ground
artifacts with archeological, paleontological, historical, religious, or unique natural values as
definedunder OPN 11.03.Most of the construction activity will involve excavation work and
thus all contractswill include standardclauses which follow Chinese law andregulations
regarding chance finds during construction. One important cultural relic i s Tashan Weir, which
i s located downstream of Jiaokou reserrvoir on the Zhangxi River. Built in 833 AD, it i s now an
old cultural site undernational preservation. The diversion of water from the Zhangxi River i s
not expectedto have an impact on the structural integrity nor functioning of the Tashan Weir.

Ningbo Municipality i s a repeat borrower for the Bank with a high capacity to implement
safeguards policies. The ongoing Zhejiang UrbanEnvironmental Project includes four
components inNingbo City. Ningbo has developed a good understanding andexperience in
implementing World Bank safeguardpolicies. Specific measuresto address safeguard issues of
this Project during implementation are:

Environmental Management Plan (EMP): The EMP specifies the appropriate environmental
management and supervision mechanisms, mitigation measures, environmental monitoring

* By supporting theproposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice thefinal determination of theparties' claims on the
disputed areas


                                                             14

plans, training plans and budget allocation necessary to implement the mitigation measures and
to strengthen the borrower's capacity. There will be an environmental officer inthe PMO to
supervise the implementation of the EMP, and both NWSC and CWSC will have environmental
officers responsible for their components. The PMO, CMSC, and NWSC have sufficient
capacity and funds to implement the EMP.

ResettlementAction Plan: A resettlement action plan (RAP) has been preparedfor the Ningbo
and the Cixi components, which meet the World Bank's OPBP 4.12. The PMO will establish a
resettlement office, staffed with specialists from NWSC and CMSC, to manage and supervise
resettlement. The capacity of the implementing agencies and the PMO i s considered adequate.

EA Disclosure and Consultation: A detailedPublic Consultation Plan inaccordance with Bank's
policies, was prepared for each of the two components. Consultations were conducted intwo
rounds for the Ningbo component duringMarch to October 2004, and inthree rounds for Cixi
component from January to September 2004. EIA reports were disclosed in local libraries on
September and October 2004 with notices posted inlocal newspapers. The draft EIA reports
were also disclosedin the Infoshop in August 2004, the updated EIA inNovember 2004, and the
final EIA in January 2005.

RAP Disclosure and Consultation: DuringProject preparation, consultation has taken place
through resettlement surveys, and meetings with government officials and project-affected
people. These consultations influencedthe design of the RAP. An information handbook which
outlines the Project, and the resettlement policies and procedures, was preparedfor all project-
affected people. In addition, "land acquisition and buildingdemolition" announcements have
been provided to all affected parties. The full RAP was disclosed inNingbo and Cixi libraries
and government websites in October 2004. The draft RAP was disclosed inthe World Bank
Infoshop in August 2004, and the final RAP was submitted inNovember 2004.

7. Policy ExceptionsandReadiness

N o exceptions are required from Bank policies. The Project meets all key regional readiness
criteria. The Bank has authorized the use of retroactive financing of US$12 million, which i s
below 10% of total project loan. Disbursements inFY06 are expected to be between US$lO-$15
million.

                           Annex 1:Sector and ProgramBackground
                       CHINA: Ningbo Water and Environment Project

Approximately 95% of the urban population in China i s served by a municipal water supply
system, and 68% have access to improved sanitation. Seasonal water shortages, however, affect
more than 400 of China's 672 cities and around 160 cities are forced to impose water use
restrictions. The lack of adequate wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure results in
severe water pollution, with an estimated 88% of rivers and 70% of coastal seas classified as
moderately to highly polluted. The lothFive Year Plan (2001-2005) calls
for increasing the percentage of urban wastewater treated from 15% to 45%, and all cities with
populations greater than 5 million should have treatment coverage of over 60%. The Government
has also mandatednew policy directions, including integratedwater resource management,
commercialization of the water and wastewater sector, setting tariffs at full cost-recovery levels,
and attracting private investment. The more affluent coastal cities, such as Ningbo Municipality,
are taking the lead in constructing new infrastructure and experimenting with policy reforms.

Ningbo Municipality i s located on the East China Sea, approximately 150 k m s south of Shanghai
on the southern edge o f HangzhouBay. Ningbo Municipality i s part of Zhejiang Province, but i s
classified as a "sub-provincial municipality" which means it i s a separate economic planning unit
and i s not administratively controlled by the provincial government. The Municipality belongs to
the economically dynamic Yangtze Economic Zone, which covers Shanghai Municipality,
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, and includes over 200 million people. With its excellent
deep water harbor, Ningbo boasts the second busiest port in China and has a thriving industrial
sector focused on the export of manufactured goods. The development and integration of Ningbo
with the larger Shanghai megalopolis will be accelerated with the completion of a 36 kmbridge
spanningHangzhou Bay, which i s currently under construction and will halve the travel time
from the port of Ningbo to Shanghai.

The Municipality has approximately 6 million residents, including an estimated 1.2 million
migrants, and covers 9,365 km2.There are six urban districts inNingbo which together are
termed "Ningbo City," with a total population of 2.4 million people and a land area o f 2,486
km2.In addition, there are two city-level counties, Cixi andYuyao, andthree rural counties. The
2002 per-capita median disposable income of urban residents was RMB 12,970 (US$1,562),
whereas rural residents reached only half that level.

Resolvingthe Water CrisisinNingbo City

Ningbo, like many cities throughout China, i s facing a two dimensional water crisis:frequent
shortages and poor water quality. Although situated ina temperate climate, water supply
development inNingbo has laggedbehind its rapid economic growth. Water companies draw
water primarily from highly polluted local surface water sources and use outdatedtreatment
technology, rendering the piped water of questionable quality. Water supply deficiencies pose a
drag on economic growth and endanger public health, while hindering Ningbo's aspiration to
become a world-class port city.




                                                 16

Ningbo, in contrast to most Chinese cities, has taken the initiative to address water issues
through a regional approach with the establishment of a multi-sector "Water and Environment
Leading Group,'' chairedby the Executive Municipal Vice Mayor and headed by the Municipal
Planning Commission. The Leading Group has a dynamic Secretariat, and i s facilitating
infrastructure investments and management systems which cut across administrative boundaries
to resolve Ningbo's serious water and wastewater problems.

A cornerstone of Leading Group's program i s to provide reliable, highquality drinking water to
all City residents through the government-ownedNingbo Water Supply Company (NWSC). The
Company currently serves 1.26 million people inthe core urban area with a total treatment
capacity of 820,000 m3/d. The remaining 1.3 million people obtain water from 29 small town
water supply systems with an estimated treatment capacity of 610,000 m3/d, or are self-supplied.
Most large industries independently draw water from local surface water sources, and the total
estimated self-supply capacity i s 460,000 m3/d. The Municipal Government has directed the
NWSC to incorporate the small town systems, supply water to all industries, and dramatically
improve service quality. To meet these targets, the Water Conservancy Bureau has recently
finished construction of one medium-sized reservoir (Baixi-168 mcm of storage, supplying
500,000 m3/dof raw drinkingwater) and will complete the Zhougonzhai reservoir (111mcm of
storage, supplying 250,000 m3/dof raw drinking water). These reservoirs will provide high
quality raw water supplies, and NWSC i s investing in associated conveyance lines, two new
water treatment plants, the first regional water distribution ring main in China, and an expanded
distribution system. The following paragraphs provide more detailed information on the current
situation and future expansion plans.

Current Situation: Ningbo Water Supply Company (NWSC) currently has five water treatment
works (WTW) supplying a population of about 1,200,000. The supply covers the three `old
districts' of Haishu, Jiangdong and Jiangbei, together with parts of Zhenhai and Beilun.

For the current NWSC area, demand for treated water has been rising steadily for the last four
years reflecting the regions rapideconomic development:

At present each WTW is operating at or above design capacity. The 2002/3 year on year rates of
increase (average and peak) were 16% and 21% respectively, and the peak factor in the years
2000 to 2003 varied between 10 and 17% (2003 was 17%). Currently water quality does not
consistently meet Chinese drinking water standards.The first objective of Component 1i s to
improve the quality andreliability of water service within the existing NWSC service.

The secondobjective of Component 1is to expandNWSC's service area into the suburban
districts of Yinzhou, Zhenhai, andBeilun and to improve water quality and supply reliability.
Most parts of Yinzhou District are suppliedby 24 town water supply systems with a capacity of
265,000 m3/d.Inaddition there are 14town water supply systems in Zhenhai andBeilinDistricts
with a capacity of 70,000 m3/d.These town water systems rely on highly polluted
surface water sources, rudimentary and often poorly performing water treatment plants, and
distribution systems with high levels of leakage.Most of the development inNingbo City i s
taking place inthe suburban districts, andprovision of an adequate water supply i s critical to
sustainingeconomic development.

Ningbo City 2020 Water Supply Master Plan: Ningbo City has prepareda Water Supply Master
Plan up to the year 2020. Although the five year investment program (2005-2010) andthe
proposedProject investment, are sound given the urgency of the situation, the current plan does
not use sophisticatedwater supply planning techniques, and inparticular does not explicitly deal
with uncertainty or maximizing flexibility. During project preparation, a more detailedwater
demandforecast was generatedto help size the ringmainto meet the forecast 2040 demand and
confirm near-term needs up to 2008. During implementation of NWEP, however, Ningbo City
will revise its Plan using state-of-the-art planning techniques.

The objective of the current Master Plan i s to extend the supply area of NWSC to cover all six
districts of Ningbo and apply a single tariff structure. According to `Ningbo UrbanOverall
Planning 2001-2020' the supply population i s forecast to increase from 2.5 million in2005 to 2.8
million in2010 and 3.3 million 2010. Average (and maximum) daily gross water demandis

The Master Plan aims to provide high quality potable water for the whole area by 2012. The
objective in the short term is to consistently meet national standards, with a long term aimof
meetingEUstandards.There is also a program to reduce unaccountedfor water from the present
level (about 21%) to 15% by 2020. Inaddition, it i s proposedto provide separate industrial water
supplies, with dedicated water treatment plants drawing from local surface water sources (Class
111-V) and distribution system, to supply new key industrial sites. These would be funded
separatelyfrom NWSC, but managedby NWSC through a managementcontract. The details of
how the industrial water supply systems will be financed andmanagedare still uncertain.
Other industrial consumers within the NWSC area will be suppliedby the NWSC and self supply
will be prohibited.

Inorder to providethe high quality supply proposedfor the NWSC system, it is proposedto use
raw water from six reservoirs (Class 1-11) only, and no local rivers. These are Hengshan, Baixi,
Jiaokou with Zhougongzhai (under construction), andTingxia with Qinchun (proposed)
reservoirs. Use of groundwater has beenruledout because its exploitation is strictly controlled.

To achieve these objectives by 2020, it i s proposedto construct six new WTWs (three for
potable water, three for industrialwater) andclose three existing NWSC works. Two existing
potable water works will be downrated in capacity to improve the quality of the water supplied
(one of which will be closed by 2020). It i s proposed to phase out the existing town water
treatment plants. An extensive programme of complementary raw andtreated water conveyor
and distribution pipework construction, extension andrehabilitation is planned.

Financial Challenges: The City faces financial challenges on two fronts. First, the large capital
investments and corresponding increases in operating costs and debt service will significantly
increase revenue needs for both NWSC and the Ningbo Sewage Company Limited, which i s a
subsidiary of NWSC. Under the Zhejiang Urban Environment Project, Ningbo will construct two
new wastewater treatment plants and associated trunk sewers which will serve approximately
half of the City. The necessary steep increases in water and sewage tariffs-which    are collected
inone bill-will   be politically challenging. Second, the NWSC relies heavily on short-term debt
from commercial banks, much of which i s periodically rolled over on the request of the
municipal government. As the Chinese banking system reforms in the coming years, easy access
to bank credit may become more difficult, thus increasing financial risk.The Project proposes to
adopt a more comprehensive and sophisticated price and service regulatory regime through a
technical assistanceprogram under the Project to ensure tariffs are raised in a timely manner to
ensure financial sustainability of the water and wastewater companies inNingbo City.

Facilitating Economic Development and Protecting Hangzhou Bay in Cixi

The suburban counties surrounding the Ninbgo City are experiencing rapidpopulation and
economic growth due to their relatively low cost o f business and abundance o f under-developed
land. Cixi City, located north of Ningbo City and bordering on Hangzhou Bay, i s an affluent and
rapidly developing area, covering 1154 sq. kmwith a coastal line of 78.5 km and a population of
1.O million. The total urbadtownpopulation in2005 is around720,000 and i s expected to grow
to around 1.3 million by 2020. The average urban per capita income i s RMB 10,500 (US$
1,265), making its residents among the most affluent in China.


                                                 20

The driving force behind this growth i s the development of industrial estates along the Cixi
coast. The close proximity to the Ningbo harbor and the Shanghai market, and the starting point
for the Ningbo-Shanghaibridge, make Cixi an ideal location for foreign anddomestic investors.
There are approximately 200 foreign-invest enterprises inCixi, with estimated annual revenues
of US$500 million. The Cixi Economic Development Zone, which i s located along the coast
line, i s planned as a comprehensive development area with industry, science, businessservices,
and housing. The first phase of the Zone covers 500 ha and i s close to completion. Planning i s
now under way to expand the area by another 2000 ha, and interest from investors appears to be
strong.

Careful planning and large investments inwater supply and water pollution control are necessary
to support Cixi's rapid economic development. Cixi i s located on a flat coastal plain and the
scope for constructing reservoirs i s very limited. Cixi i s addressing this constraint through two
measures: i)importing large quantities of water from the Caoerjiang basin inEastern Zhejiang;
and ii)constructing a network of canals in Cixi to collect run-off for agricultural and landscape
uses. Proper treatment and disposal of wastewater are essential to attract new industries and
maintain the ecological balance. Fortunately, most of the industries in Cixi are modern and
profitable enterprises which are able to afford proper industrial pre-treatment. Disposal of treated
wastewater poses a major challenge in Cixi because of the shallow shoreline along Hangzhou
Bay. The shoreline in Cixi i s constantly expanding due to the natural accumulation of sediment,
creating reclaimed land at a rate of approximately 100 meters per year in some places. This
natural phenomenon creates opportunities for land development, but also places constraints on
disposal of effluent into the Bay. The shallow Bay, combined with large diurnal tides, makes an
outfall impractical and thus the treated effluent will be disposed into the canal network.

Drainage services inCixi have historically been provided by the Drainage Department, which i s
an agency under the Construction Commission. The Department provides drainage services in
Cixi City, and operates one wastewater treatment plant (20,000 m3/, day to be expanded to
45,000 m3in 2006). A new company, the Cixi Municipal Sewage Company (CMSC) was
established in mid-2004 to be responsible for all wastewater collection and treatment facilities in
Cixi City. The CMSC management i s facing the dual challenge of starting up a new company
and managing a large capital works program. To mitigate this risk, the Project will provide
significant technical assistance, including design review, business management and operations
support.

CMSC also faces significant financial risk under the Project. Like Ningbo City, Cixi i s also
investing simultaneously in water supply and wastewater infrastructure, implying a significant
increase in combined tariffs-which     are collected by the Cixi Water Company with the drainage
revenue being directly transferred to CMSC. Wastewater infrastructure in Cixi i s also relatively
expensive due to the low-density of development and the long distances needed for conveyance.

                        CHINA: NingboWater andEnvironmentProject

The Project development objective i s to facilitate the expansion of water and wastewater services
in Ningbo City and Cixi City inan economically efficient and environmentally sustainable
manner, and thereby protect public health, improve the environment, and sustain the area's rapid
economic growth. The key indicators are: (i)     increase in percentage of domestic water supply
from high quality and reliable water sources in Ningbo City; and (ii)    increases inpercentage of
municipal and industrial wastewater treated in Cixi City. Project duration i s estimated at five
years, starting in March2005, although some activities will start inlate 2004 with retroactive
financing. The three project components are described below.

Component1:NingboWater Supply

The World Bank loan will finance the following activities under Component 1:

l . A Raw Water Intake andTunnel: The existing Jiaokou reservoir, in conjunction with the new
upstream Zhougongzhai reservoir (currently under construction - completion by 2007), will be
used as the raw water source. A new water intake tower will be provided on the left bank of
Jiaokou reservoir about 1kmupstream of the dam. The intake tower will feed into a 9580 meter
long tunnel which discharges into the Maojiaping water treatment plant. The route i s dividedinto
four tunnel sections, with three short, intervening steel pipe sections where the tunnel line
crosses valleys. The tunnel i s designed on the basis of a flow of 6.13m3/s, with an excavated bore
of 3.6m. It i s concrete lined, with an internal diameter of 2.8m. The steel pipe sections are 2.5m
in diameter.

l.B Maoiiaping;WTW: The capacity is 500,000m3/d. The site is locatedon a hillside, plantedin
an orchard, and considerable earthworks will be required to level the site for construction. Both
Zhougonghai and Jiaokou reservoirs are Class 1-11sources, with no organic pollution and low silt
contents. Process parameters are based on previous experience of the designers and should be
generally acceptable. Bench-scale water tests were carried out on the raw water to optimize the
detailed process design. Water will flow by gravity from the reservoir intake works, via the
tunnel, to the inlet works unless the reservoir level i s less than 55m, in which case five raw water
dutyhtandby pumps provided will be used. A conventional treatment process will be usedwith a
horizontal flow settling tank, sand filtration, and chlorine disinfection. Space will be reserved for
advanced treatment consisting of activated carbon filtration. Thickened sludge will be dosed with
alum and PAM, before being dried infilter presses.Dry sludge will be recycled as backfill
material, or for brick manufacture. A 1kmlong 6 m wide access road from the existing road to
the plant i s specified.

1,C Transmission Convevance Main: A single main with a diameter of 2.6 meters will convey
the treated water by gravity (approximately 7.9 k m s ) to a bifurcation point, where two slightly
smaller mains follow different alignments to the ring main. The bifurcation will provide water to
different parts of Yinzhou district in the most cost-effective manner. The total length of each
main after the bifurcation point i s approximately 11kms, with a diameter of 2 meters for the first




                                                   25

4 (3.5) kms, and then reducing to 1.8 meters. The pipes will be buried to a depth of
approximately 2m, and will follow existing roads.

l.DTransmission RingMain: The total lengthis about 47 kmand will consist of 2 mand 1.8 m
diameter steel pipeline with a cover of about 2m. The ring main will significantly improve water
supply reliability and flexibility. The current network in Ningbo i s divided into approximately
three zones (although there are some interconnections) and the ringmain will link all three zones
together. The new water treatment plants (Maojiaoping and Dongqianhu) are located in the south
of the City and the ring main will allow easy transmission from both plants to the north.
"Distribution pipe spokes" coming off the ring main which will serve the suburban districts. The
ring main i s sized for the estimated 2040 demand, based on extensive hydraulic modeling and
spatial water demand forecasts. the ring main size. The choice of either steel pipe or PCCP (pre-
stressedconcrete cylinder pipe) will be finalized during appraisal. The ring main will be buried
and run along the existing ringroad. The water pressure inthe ring main will be supplied by
gravity from the Maojiaping WTP.

Distribution systems: NWSC has already carried out significant rehabilitation and renovation of
older pipes within the current supply area. However, with the addition of the town systems, this
task will continue to require the allocation of resources from NWSC. The potential for drinking
water contamination inthis project evidently comes more from the distribution system (and
customers own pipes and fittings) than from the treated water as it leaves the various WTWs.
The highinvestmentingood quality water sources and moderntreatment techniques makes
water quality management within the distribution system more necessary. NWSC has a long-
term program to rehabilitate the distribution system (redundant with long-term).

Component 2: Cixi WastewaterManagement:

Current Situation: Cixi City i s composed of the central city with around 300,000 inhabitants,
seven small cities with populations ranging from 25,000 to 100,000, and ten towns with around
25,000 or less residents. In addition, there are areas of recently developed and rapidly expanding
industrial estates along the coastline. Only 10% of the wastewater generated inCixi City
currently receives wastewater treatment, which i s provided by the Jiaochangshan central city
wastewater treatment plant. The WWTP collects wastewater from an area o f around l o b 2 ,
comprising only one third of the central city area. The current capacity o f the WWTP i s 20,000
m3/d, but there are plans to expand the plant to 45,000 m3/d by 2010. Municipal sewerage from
the central city and each town i s discharged directly into the river and canal network, with the
result that most of the canals and main river networks are polluted to class V standards or worse.
Inadditionto causing environmental problems, the lack of comprehensive wastewater
management i s inhibitingeconomic development as industries are reluctant to move into estates
without proper environmental management. The project will finance the following components,
which are essentially the entire five year investment program for the Cixi Municipal Sewerage
Company (CMSC).

Wastewater Treatment Plants: The CMSC service area i s divided into three zones, each of which
will have a wastewater treatment plant: (i)  existing Jiaochangshan WWTP in the central city
(45,000 m3/d);ii)the NWEP-financedNorthern WWTP which will have a Phase 1capacity of



                                                  26

100,000 m3/d;and iii)the NWEP-financed Eastern WWTP which will have a Phase 1capacity of
50,000 m3/d.The WWTPs will discharge into the inland canal network, and thus require a high
level of treatment to minimize eutrophication and other water quality problems as the canals
have a relatively low assimilative capacity. Dischargeinto Hangzhou Bay through an outfall i s
not an economically viable option given the large tidal variation and shallow water along the
Cixi coastline. The WWTPs are designed to meet Class 1A discharge standards, which are
essentially 10 mg/lBOD and SS, with removal of nutrientsto 15 mg/l total-nitrogen and 0.5 mg/l
of phosphorus.

The proposed treatment process i s a modified reverse A20process, with tertiary treatment. Inthe
reserve A20process, the anoxic stage i s placed ahead of the anerobic stage, to remove nitrates
first and achieve the anaerobic conditions necessary to remove phosphorous in the second stage.
The project will fund a technical assistanceprogram for CMSC to buildupits operational
capacity to tackle the operationally complex A process. Tertiary treatment will be through an
engineered wetland. The preliminary design for the engineered wetland will be finalized after
loan effectiveness.

Sludge from the treatment plants will be dewatered through gravity thickening followed by
centrifuges. A total 67,000 m3 of sludge, with a moisture content of 78%, will be generated per
year from the two plants. The sludge will be transported to nearby municipal landfill sites in
trucks with air-tight tanks. The sludge from the Northern plant will be disposed in the Cixi West
landfill, and the sludge from the Eastern plant will be disposed in the Eastern landfill. The
Western landfill was expanded and upgraded in2002, and currently has 10 empty cells which
will use impermeable liners and leachate treatment systems. Cixi City plans to upgrade the
Eastern landfill in2005 and utilize impermeable liners and leachate treatment systems for the
four remaining cells. Upgrading o f the Eastern landfill i s included in the EMP.The Western
landfill i s forecast to reach full capacity around 2012, and Eastern landfill will reach capacity in
2015. Since the two landfills will be full after only 5-7 years of wastewater treatment plant
operation, the EMPcalls for the Cixi Municipal Sewerage Company to develop a sludge
management plan to consider alternative long-term options for sludge management. Monitoring
of sludge quality i s also included in the EMPto ensure that the sludge can be safely disposed in a
municipal landfill.

Trunk Sewers: There are two trunk systems inCixi: the 77 kmcentral-western trunk system
conveys wastewater to the Northern WWTP. The 30 kmeastern trunk system conveys water to
the EasternWWTP.Trunk diameters range from 400-1800 111111, laying depths of 2.5-7.0
                                                                    with
meters. There are 15 pump stations intotal for both trunk systems; PCCPi s usedfor all force
mains. Appropriate remedial measures for septicity have been incorporatedinto the design.

Secondary Sewers: CWSC will service approximately 15 distinct areas, composed of towns or
industrial estates. Each town or city i s responsible for constructing its own collection system.
Existing developments use a combined storm-water and wastewater collection system, which
will be maintained. According to Cixi City regulations, new developments must have separated
wastewater and stormwater collection systems. The project will finance approximately 133 k m s
of secondary trunk sewers which go from the town to the trunk mains (with 42 small pump-
stations).

                        CHINA: NingboWater andEnvironmentProject

There are a variety of government agencies and companies involved in the implementation of
NWEP: NWSC and CMSC are the two main implementing entities, while the government
agencies will play an oversight and coordination role.

GovernmentAgencies:

Water and Environment Leading Group: Ningbo Government recently established a Leading
Group to deal with the complex regional water supply and water quality issues confronting the
Municipality. The Leading Group i s headed by an Executive Vice Mayor and i s composed of
Directors from the Municipal Development Planning Commission (MDPC), Environmental
Protection Bureau, Water Resources Bureau, Construction Bureau, and Finance Bureau. The
Leading Group's mandate i s to provide policy direction and planning support for integrated
water and environmental management throughout the Municipality. The Leading Group i s
supported by an active Office. Both the Leading Group and its Office were actively involved in
NWEPpreparationand will play a guidingrole inimplementation. The Leading Group will also
be the lead agency for the Ningbo City IntegratedWater Supply Plan in Component 3.

NWEP Project Management OfSlce(PMO): The PMO i s locatedunder MDPC, and i s composed
of a qualified project manager, an experienced chief engineer, and a procurement specialist
seconded from NWSC, a project accountant, an environmental specialist, a resettlement unit, and
a translator. The PMO has been established as a permanent government agency, and thus i s able
to attract qualified individuals who are offeredjob security and promotion potential. The PMO
will be responsible for overall project coordination and implementation and will be the primary
liaison with the Bank (project monitoring and reporting. Because the various technical
assistance assignments in Component 3 cut across NWSC and CMSC, as well as various
government agencies, the PMO will be responsible for contracting some consultants. Such
consultants will work directly with the companies and government agencies, but under the
general supervision of the PMO.

MDPC Foreign Capital Utilization Department: The department serves as a liaison with
international development agencies. It will be an important bridge between the PMO andFinance
Bureau, and the Bank duringproject implementation.

Ningbo StateAsset Management Commission, Price Bureau, and Urban Management Bureau:
The Asset Management Commission i s the primary management supervising body for the
NWSC. The Price Bureau i s the leadeconomic regulatory agency, and the Urban Management
Bureaui s the lead service regulatory agency for NWSC andother public utilities inNingbo. All
three bodies will be involved in the "Utility Price and Service Regulatory Study" under
Component 3.




                                                 30

PublicUtilities:

Ningbo Water Supply Company (NWSC): NWSC has been operating for decades and i s
experienced in implementing large capital projects. The NWSC has created a Project
Management Unit (PMU) under the direction of an Assistant Chief Engineer. The PMU i s
staffed with dedicated procurement, financial management, environmental, and resettlement
staff. Under Component 3, the NWSC will receive technical assistance support for design review
and advisory services, business management, and the development of an NWSC Strategic
BusinessPlan. The NWSC will also receive technical assistancefor the development of the state-
of-the-art central control system.

Cixi Municipal Sewerage Company (CMSC): CMSC was legally established inmid-2004, and
staff and existing assets have been transferred from the Cixi Drainage Department to CMSC.
Since the NWEP represents essentially all of CMSC's capital investment program, the project
will be under the direct supervision of the CMSC General Manager, with the relevant
departments providing procurement, financial management, environmental, and resettlement
support. Under Component 3, CMSC will receive technical assistance support for design review
and advisory services and business management. CMSC will also receive technical assistance for
the operations of the new wastewater treatment plants financed under the project.

                        CHINA: NingboWater and EnvironmentProject

The Financial Management Specialist (FMS) has conducted an assessment of the adequacy of
the project financial management system of the Project. The assessment, based on guidelines
issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on October 15, 2003, concluded that the
project meets minimumBank financial management requirements, as stipulated inBP/OP 10.02.
Inthe FMS's opinion, the project will have inplace an adequateproject financial management
system that can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status
of the project, in the reporting format agreed with the project and as required by the Bank.

Fundingsources for the project include the Bank loan andcounterpart funds. The Bank loan
proceeds will flow from the Bank into the project special account, to be set up at and managed
by the Ningbo Municipal Finance Bureau (NMFB). There are two implementing entities: the
Ningbo Water Supply Company (NWSC) and the Cixi Municipal Sewerage Company (CMSC).
The NWEPPMO, established inthe Ningbo Municipal Planning Commission, will provide
overall coordination and oversight for the project. The PMO will authorize the Ningbo Finance
Bureau to reimburse NWSC and CMSC for eligible expenditures. For consultant contracts which
are managed by the PMO, there are two general payment options: (i)      the NMFB pays consultants
for the Bank share and the PMO pays counterpart share; (ii)   PMO will pay consultants directly
and then request NMFB reimbursement for the Bank share. The costs will be allocated as
appropriate to the respective companies.

The Bank loan will be signed with the People's Republic of China, through the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), which will then enter into an on-lending agreement with Ningbo Municipality.
The NMFB will have subsidiary loan agreements with NWSC and Cixi City Government. The
Cixi Finance Bureau will then have an on-lending agreement with the CMSC. The project will
use traditional disbursement techniques, and will not be usingPMR-based disbursements, in

   9.      Expenditures exceeding the above limits will be made in accordance with respective
   procurement guidelines and signed contracts.

   SpecialAccount (SA)

   10.     One special account (SA) will be established in the NMFB. The authorized allocation
   will be US$S.O million, with an initial deposit amount of US$5.5 until a cumulative
   disbursement of US$35 million i s reached. Bank funds would be disbursed from the SA set up at
   the Finance Bureau to the project implementing entities and/or supplier and contractors.

   11,     N h E B will be directly responsible for the management, monitoring, maintenance, and
   reconciliation of the SA activities of the project. Supporting documents required for Bank
   disbursements will be prepared and submitted by respective project implementing entities to
   NMFB for final verification and consolidation before submission to the Bank. The flow of the
   withdrawal application i s as follows:

   FinancialManagement and ReportingArrangements

   12.     ImplementingEntity. A PMO has been established under the Ningbo Municipal
   Planning Commission. NWSC will be the implementing entity for the water supply component,
   and CMSC will be the implementing entity for the wastewater component. The institutional
   development component includes contracts which support both companies, as well the municipal
   government, and thus will be managed by the PMO, however the costs will be allocated to the
   respective companies.

   13.     FundsFlow. Funds flow for Bank loan will follow the Bank and MOFrequirements, as
   follows:




                                                     34

The above diagram assumes that the NMFB will make payments directly to consultants who
have signed contracts with the PMO. Another alternative i s for the PMO to make payments to
the consultant directly and then request reimbursement from NMFB for eligible expenditures.
The preferred option will be determined duringimplementation.

Accounting Organization and Staffing. Adequate project accounting staff, with educational
background and work experience commensurate with their work i s one o f the factors critical to
successful implementation of project financial management. Based on discussions, observation
and review of educational background and work experience of staff identified for financial and
accounting positions in implementing entities (both "project" and "entity"), the F M S noted that
staff are qualified and appropriate for their work.

To strengthen financial management capacity and achieve consistent quality o f accounting work,
a project financial management manual (the Manual) will be prepared. The ,Manualwill provide
detailed guidelines on financial management, internal controls, accounting procedures, fund and
asset management and withdrawal application procedures. The final version of the Manual will
be finalized and distributedto all the financial staff before loan effectiveness.

Accounting Procedures. The administration, accounting, and reporting of the project will be set
up in accordance with Circular #13: "Accounting Regulations for World Bank Financed
Projects" issuedinJanuary 2000 by MOF. The circular provides in-depth instructions of
accounting treatment of project activities and covers the following: chart o f account, detailed
accounting instructions for each project account, standardset o f project financial statements, and
instructions on the preparation of project financial statements.

The standard set of project financial statements mentioned above has been agreed to between the
Bank and MOF and applies to all Bank projects appraised after July 1, 1998 and includes the



                                                 35

following: Balance sheet, Statement of source and use of fund, Statement of implementation of
loan agreement, and Statement of special account.

Each of the implementing entities will be managing, monitoring, and maintaining the respective
project accounting records. Original supporting documents for project activities will be retained
by originating implementing entities. In addition, each implementing entity will prepare
financial statements, which will be submittedto the municipal PMO for review and approval.
The MunicipalPMO will furnishthe consolidated project financial statements to the Bank on a
regular basis.

InternalAudit. There is no formal independent InternalAudit department for the project.
However, this will not impact the project's financial management as PMO management and
monitoring, and yearly external audits, will ensure that financial management controls are
functioning appropriately.

InformationSystem. The water supply company i s usingan accounting software called
"Xinzhongda" to process their transactions. After reviewing the software, it may be possible to
integrate the project activities into their current accounting software system. Since this software
i s a well-known accounting software in Zhejiang province, the newly established sewerage
company will also use this accounting software. The Bank will review the adequacy of their
financial accounting and reporting systemprior to project effectiveness.

FinancialManagementActionPlan. The following proposedtime-bound actions were agreed
with the PMO:

                              Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
                        CHINA: NingboWater andEnvironmentProject

A. General

Procurement would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:
Procurement Under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions
stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are
described in general below. For each contract to be financed b y the Loan, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame have been agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank, andi s part of the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan for the project was prepared by
Ningbo Municipal PMO, and will be updated at least annually or as required, to reflect the actual
project implementation needs, and improvements in institutional capacity.

Procurementof Works: Works procuredunderthis project wouldinclude: raw water intake
facilities, raw water tunnels, water treatment plant, water supply pipelines, wastewater collection
pipelines, wastewater pump stations, wastewater treatment plants, etc. Procurement will be done
usingthe Chinese Model BiddingDocuments (MBDs);andBank Standard BiddingDocuments
(SBD) would be usedwhen an appropriate MBD i s not available.

Goods:Goods procured under this project would include laboratory instruments, maintenance
tools, and vehicles. Procurement will be done usingthe Chinese Model BiddingDocuments
(MBDs)for ICB. For contracts with estimated value below US$lOO,OOO, shopping procedures
may apply*

CombinedWorks andGoodsProcurement: CivilWorks andEquipmentSupply,
Installationand Commissioning:To enhance implementationefficiency, some large contracts
have been packged to include both works and goods, including the Maojiaping Water Treatment
Plant, the two wastewater treatment plants inCixi, and the pump stations. Either standard
biddingdocuments or modified biddingdocuments for Civil Works, or for Supply and
Installation of Plant and Equipment, will be used for preparing the biddingdocuments for these
contracts, subject to the agreement of the Bank on a case by case basis.

Selectionof Consultants: Consulting services will include design review and construction
management, business management, utility regulatory study, water planning study, and water
and wastewater operational support. All consulting services will be provided by consulting
firms. Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $300,000 equivalent per
contract may be composed entirely of national consultants, in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

B. Assessmentof the agency'scapacityto implementprocurement

Procurement activities for Component 1will be carried out by the NWSC, where CMSC will be
responsible for Component 2. Procurement for Component 3 will be carried out primarily by the


                                                   37

Ningbo PMO in collaboration with CMSC and NWSC. The PMO will provide overall
coordination and instruction for all procurement activities.

The PMO has designated a well qualified Chief Engineerto be responsible for overall
management of project procurement. NWSC has established a dedicated Project Management
Unit (PMU), which is headedby an NWSC assistantchief engineer andhas four full-time staff.
NWSC has experience with World Bank procurement procedures under the Zhejiang Multi-
Cities Project which closed in 2001. CMSC's Technical Department, under the direct
supervision of the Managing Director, will be responsible for implementation of the project. Five
staff from the technical department will be working on project-relatedprocurement issues.
CMSC i s a new organization and has limited procurement experience.

For ICB procurement, a qualified international tendering company China Minemetal
International Tendering Company, to be confirmed has been recruited as procurement agent.
This tendering company will also be the procurement agent for NCB procurement of the Cixi
Wastewater Component.
An assessmentof the capacity of the ImplementingAgency to implement procurement actions
for the project was carried out by the Bank project procurement specialists in September 2004.
The ProcurementAssessment is contained inthe Project Files. The key procurementriskunder
the project i s CMSC' lack of experience with World Bank procedures. Corrective measures
which have been agreed are:(i) the project will include a design review and management
consultancy to assist both CMSC and NWSC; and (ii)     an experienced design institute and
tendering company will be recruitedfor project preparation and procurement assistance. The
overall project risk for procurement i s average.


C. Procurement Plan

At appraisal, the Borrower, ,developed a procurement plan for project implementation. This plan
has been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank inDecember 2004 and i s available at the
Ningbo Municipal PMO and through the World Bank Internet Site. The ProcurementPlan will
be updated annually, in agreement with the Bank to reflect actual project implementation needs,
and improvements in institutional capacity. The ProcurementPlan i s provided inTable B below.

D.Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing

Retroactive financing would be applied for expenditures incurred after September 1,2004 for
civil works and employment of consulting firms. Advance contracting will be in accordance with
Bank and project guidelines. Proposed advance contracting and retroacting financing are
summarized in the Table B below. The estimated expenditures are around US$20 million, with a
conservative estimate of US$12 million inretroactive financing required, which i s below the
threshold of 10% of the total loan amount (US$13 million) under inWorld Bank Operational
Policy 12.10. The Ningbo Municipal Government has been made aware that payments made in
expectation of retroactive financing are at the Borrower's risk, and do not commit the Bank to
making a loan for the project or the financing of such payments.

 E. Frequency ofProcurement Supervision

 Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carriedout by the Bank, the capacity assessment
 recommends procurement supervision missions every six months to carry out post reviews of
 procurement actions.

                           Annex 9: Economicand Financial Analysis
                         CHINA: Ningbo Water and Environment Project

                                      A. Financial Analysis

Project Level Analysis:

Ningbo Wuter Supply Component.The after-tax financial internal rate of return (FRR) is
calculated as 8.7%, which indicates that the project component i s financially viable, as it
exceeds the 3.0% weighted average cost of capital. This i s equivalent to an NPV of RMB 901
million over the project component's estimated 35 year economic life.

Cixi Wastewater Component. Wastewater tariffs are presently applied to all properties receiving
a water bill regardless of whether they are connected to the public sewer system. Consequently,
while the wastewater system expansion will significantly increase the proportionof the
population receiving service, the increase inthe revenue base will be much more limited. For
this reason, the concept of incremental revenue underlyingFRR is not fully applicable and,
therefore, an FRR was not calculatedfor this component. The average incremental financial cost
(AIFC) of the component i s estimated at RMB 2.33/m3. This i s higher than the projected average
tariff needed to meet the financial requirements of the project wastewater company, estimated to
be Y1.65/m3, indicating the presence of financial subsidies. This subsidy i s inthe form of
contributions from Cixi City Government toward the capital cost of project component. The
AIFC i s also higher than those estimated for the Ningbo wastewater components of the recent
Zhejiang UrbanEnvironment Project (Zhenhai: Y1.99/m3,Dongqian Lake: Y1.27/m3,Cicheng:
Y0.86/m3, Jiangdongnan: Y0.84/m3). However, while those project components largely involved
an expansion of existing facilities, entirely new treatment facilities and collection systems are
beingconstructedinCixi.

Entity Level Analysis:

Financial projections have been prepared for the NWSC and CMSC on an annual basis over the
2004 - 2015 period. These projections are based on the requirement of each company to comply
with the proposedproject financial covenants on cost recovery and debt service coverage, as
well as the need for internally generated contributions toward project counterpart funding. The
key financial covenant for each company relating to cost recovery. NWSC i s to generate annual
operatingrevenues that are sufficient to cover total operating expenses, any loss on non-
operating activities, increases in working capital other than cash, debt service requirements, and
20% of the annual average of its capital expenditures incurred (excluding developers'
contributions), or expected to be incurred, for the current year, the previous year, and the
following year. CMSC i s to generate annual operating revenues that are sufficient to cover total
operating expenses, any loss on non-operatingactivities, increases inworking capital other than
cash, and debt service requirements.

Inbothcases, the ratioof operatingrevenues to costs is expressed as the cost recovery ratio,
which, therefore, must be at least 1.O in each year. Inaddition, a debt service coverage ratio and
asset debt equity ratio covenant will also be applied under which the companies' ability to incur
additional debt will be conditional on their maintaining these ratios at a minimumof 1.3 and
maximum of 0.7 respectively.

Ningbo Water Supply Company:

NWSC i s a stateowned enterprise that was established inits present legal form in 1982, but can
trace its operating history back to 1926 with the establishment of the city's original piped water
system. Presently, the company provides piped water supplies to a population of approximately
1.3 million through 295,000 customer connections inthe three core urban districts (Haishu,
Jiangdong, Jiangbei), the newer urban districts of Zhenhai and Beilun, and part of the urban core
of Yinzhou District. With very rapid economic andpopulation growth in and around Ningbo
over the past decade, NWSC has struggledto meet the resulting growth inwater demand. Over
the past five years, water sales have increased by 44%, from an average of 417,000 m3/d in 1999
tojust under 600,000 m3/d in 2003. This has placed considerable strain on the productive
capacity of the company's supply, treatment and distribution systems. By 2003, peak day
production actually exceeded its design treatment capacity of 820,000 m3/d. In order to meet
this increasingdemand, as well as to expand its service coverage innewly urbanizing areas
around the city core and improve water quality, NWSC has embarked on a major capital works
program. Capital expenditures between2001 and 2003 totaled RMB 630 million and are
projected to be about RMB 3.2 billion over the 2004 - 2008 period. Key operating and financial
indicators are given inTable 1,as well as inTable 6.

Sector Funding& Cost Recovery.Operation andmaintenancecosts are internally fundedby
NWSC through the application of tariffs to all customers. Capital expenditures have been
financed by a mix of loans, internally generated revenues, and allocations from the Ningbo
Municipal Government (NMG),primarily from the proceeds of the Water Plant Construction
Fee (WCF), which hadbeen applied as a surcharge on the water bill up to the end of 2003. As of
January 2004, the WCF was incorporated into the water tariff. Inaddition, developers are
responsible for funding distribution systems within their developments. These systems are
generally constructedby the developers and, upon completion, are transferred to NWSC.

Water Tariffs.As of January 2004, the average water tariff, including the WCF, was increased
by 17% relative to the previous tariffs, which hadbeen implemented inAugust 1999. This
brought the average tariff to Y1.42/m3 from Yl.21/m3in 2003. Ningbo appears to have had
difficulty implementingregular and timely tariff increases, which suggests a need for
improvements inunderlying regulatory mechanisms. The recent tariff increases hadbeen under
review by the NMGfor at least 30 months. Duringthis period, NWSC incurred net losses and



                                                    44

needed to rely heavily on relatively short-term commercial bank loans to finance much needed
capital works. The project will incorporate technical assistance to those agencies within NMG
responsible for price and service regulation for strengthening these mechanisms.

Recent Financial Performance. NWSC reported annual net losses over the past three years
(Table 6). The net loss doubled between 2001 and 2002 primarilybecause tariffs remained
unchangedwhile there were significant increases ina number of operating expense items.
Between 2001 and 2003, net operating revenue increased by 22%, due entirely to increased
sales, while operating expenses increased by 51%. The disproportionate increase in operating
expenses was due to a number of factors including: (i)  real increases in average salary and wage
levels; (ii)large increases incompany contributions to government mandatedsocial insurance
and staff welfare funds; (iii)major upgrades to the company's information technology systems
that were deemed to be administration expense, rather than capital investment; and, (iv) higher
unitexpenditures onchemicals and other operatinginputsneeded to meet peak demands.

The company's net losses over the past three years were partly offset by the transfer of the entire
proceeds of the WCF from NMGto NWSC. As a municipal transfer, the WCF i s not recognized
as operating revenue but rather as an equity infusionby NMGinto NWSC. As such, it i s not
included inthe calculation of net income. The proceeds of the WCF are have ranged from about
RMB 26 millionin2001 to RMB 32 million in2003, almost double the net loss in2001and
about equal to the 2003 loss.

Financial Projections & Tariff Requirements. Projections preparedfor NWSC indicate that
ongoing and plannedcapital investments will place a significant financial burden on the
company over the next decade (Table 6). Actual and plannedcapital expenditures over the 10
year period from 2002 to 2011are estimated as RMB 4.1 billion, of which 70% i s concentrated
inthe 2004 -2008 period. Over this five year period, the company's proposedNWEP
component accounts for just under half of total planned investment. Almost 75% of the cost of
its overall investment program i s to be funded from internally generated revenues and debt. To
provide the revenue for the funding of these investments, it i s estimated that tariffs will need to
be increased by 52% over the next five years (Table 2). This would include a 32% increase at
the beginning of 2006, from an average of RMB 1.42/m3 to RMB 1.88/m3,and a 15% increase
at the beginning of 2008, which would bring the average tariff to RMB 2.16/m3. NMG i s now
working toward the approval of the required 2006 increase. Over the remainder of the forecast
period, which extends to 2016, the requirement for additional tariff adjustments i s projected to
be limited to those needed to offset normal inflationary increases inoperating and maintenance
expenses.

Assumingthat NWSC can successfully implement the requiredtariff increases, the company is
projected to be able to operate on a financially sustainable basis, but due to its very large capital
investment program, cash flow and debt service will needto be carefully managed. Net income
i s projected to be positive in all years enabling the company to comply with the project covenant
relating to cost recovery, with the possible exception of 2006. In2006, the cost recovery ratio i s
estimatedto be slightly below the minimumrequiredlevel of 1.O. Over the remainder of the
forecast period, this ratio i s anticipatedto gradually improve, from 1.1in2007 to 1.8 by 2015.
Virtually all of the cash generated from this net income will be needed to fund capital works and
service debt on these works. Total debt outstanding i s projected to increase rapidly, from RMB
387 million at the end of 2003 to a highof RMB 1.9 billion by the end of 2007. Between 2004
and 2011, annual debt service i s projected to increase from RMB 36 million to RMB 352
million. The impact of debt service on the company will be greatest over the 2008 - 2012
period, when annual debt service i s estimated to average RMB 335 million. Although the
company i s projected to be able to service this debt, the debt service coverage ratio may decline
below 1.3, the minimumlevel needed to achieve full compliance with the project financial
covenants. This ratio i s projectedto be 1.2 between 2007 and 2011, with the exception of 2008

improve rapidly to levels well above 1.3 as annual debt service declines. The debt - asset ratio
inwhich the ratio is projectedto be 1.1. However, beginningin2012, this ratio is expected to

should remain well below 0.7 in all years, peaking at 0.4 over the 2006 - 2008 period.

Sensitivity Analysis. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to assess the
impact of potential changes in the key variables underlying the base case financial projections.
These include: (i)  a one year delay in the implementation of the tariff increases, from the
beginning of 2006 and 2008 to the beginning of 2007 and 2009; (ii)      a 5% reduction inwater
sales; (iii)a combination of a 5% reduction in water sales and one year delay intariff increases;
and, (iv) a two percentage point increase inthe cost of all NWSC debt as of 2008. All of these
events would have a significant adverse impact on the cash flow position of NWSC. Of the
single variable events, scenario (i),  a one year delay intariff increases, has the greatest impact.
This would leave the company with a large cash shortfalls in2006 and 2008, of about RMB 90
million and RMB 140millionrespectively. Inorder to cover this shortfall while maintaining its
capital investment program, the company would have to defer repayments of existing short-term
debt as well as taking out new short-term loans. Scenario (iii),   which combines scenarios (i)  and
(ii)sprojectedtoresultcashshortfallsofaboutRMB140millionandRMB200millionin
     i
2006 and 2008 respectively. While this might also be addressed through debt deferments and
new borrowings, repaying this additional debt could require up to 10 years. This would incur
substantial interest charges, estimated to be almost RMB 140million, at current interest rates.

Cixi Municipal Sewage Company Limited:

Company Overview. Cixi i s a rapidly urbanizing county level city within Ningbo Municipality
that i s well outside the coverage area of the Ningbo Municipal Sewage Company, which serves
Ningbo's urban core and two adjacent districts. InCixi, urban wastewater treatment has been
limited to a relatively small system serving the Cixi urban core. This system has been directly
managed and operated by agencies of the city government. Additionally, a new wastewater
collection network has recently been constructedto serve the new Hangzhou Bay Development
Zone. Wastewater collected here will be treated at the Northern WWTP to be constructedunder
NWEP. InApril 2004, the city government established CMSC to assume responsibility for the
implementation, ownership and operation of the NWEPfunded wastewater component in Cixi
as well as those existing systems in the Cixi urban core and Hangzhou Bay. Within its service
area, CMSC will take ownership and operating responsibility for all trunk sewers, the separate



                                                   46

sanitary sewer network, as well as all combined sewers that are presently under the ownership of
the city government.

Sector Funding & Cost Recovery. Sector fundinghas largely reliedon government budgetary
transfers but as a result of recent reforms, user fees are beginning to contribute a much larger
share of these fundingrequirements. Up untilApril 2004, the city government applied
wastewater charges only to the commercial and special use groups. The charge was included on
the water bill, collectedby Cixi Water Supply Company (CWSC) and then remitted to the Cixi
Finance Bureau. However, as of May 2004, new wastewater tariffs were introduced that apply to
all customer groups (Table 3). The average tariff i s now estimated to be RMB 0.37/m3compared
to RMB 0.49/m3in the Ningbo urban core. As was previously the case, these tariffs are billed
and collected by CWSC. However, consistent with state policy for the reform of the wastewater
sector, the wastewater tariff revenues are now being directly remitted by CWSC to CMSC.

Financial Projections & Tariff Requirements. The financial projections prepared for CMSC
indicate that very significant tariff increases will be required to enable it to operate on a
financially viable and sustainable basis (Table 3). Despite the recent application of tariffs to all
customer groups, tariff levels remain low relative to the operational costs of the existing
wastewater system, andparticularly the new NWEP wastewater system. The average tariff will
need to be increased by about 130% as of 2006, from RMB 0.37/m3 to RMB 0.86/m3, and then
by a further 66%, to RMB 1.43/m3,by the beginning of 2008. The 2006 increase i s required to
fully recover the operating costs of the existing Jiaochangshan WWTP and sewer network, to
cover a portion of the initial operating costs of the new NWEP system, and to provide a limited
contribution toward NWEP counterpart fundingneeds. The increase in 2008 i s designed to fully
recover NWEPoperating and maintenance costs and to meet debt service on the NWEPproject
loans. Additional, but smaller increases are projected to be required in 2010 and 2012, of 18%
and 15% respectively, which would bringthe average tariff tojust under RMB 2/m3.

Even with these very large tariff increases, debt service will place a considerable strain on
CMSC, particularly over the 2010 - 2014 period (Table 7). Beginningin2008, principal
repayment begins on the domestic bank loan used to finance about 10% of the cost of the
company's NWEPcomponent. In2010, repayments on the proceeds of the Bank loan onlent to
CMSC begin. Annual debt service i s projected to peak in 2014 at Y86 million, but then drop by
over RMB 20 millionbeginning in2015, as total debt levels decline. Assumingthat the required
tariffincreases are successfully implementedbeginning in2006, the company shouldbe able to
comply with the cost recovery covenant in all years. This ratio i s projected to range between 1.O


                                                         47

and 1.3 and average'1.2 over the 2006 - 2015 period. The company should also be able to
comply with the debt - asset covenant, which i s projected to peak at 0.5 in2008 and 2009, but
remain well below the covenant maximum of 0.7. However, the projections do indicate that
CMSC might experience some difficulty inmeeting the debt service covenant inthose years in
which debt service i s greatest. The debt service ratio i s projectedto be slightly below 1.3, the
minimumlevelneededfor full compliance, inanumber of years over the forecast period. The
ratio i s projected to be as low as 1.0, in 2006, and then again in2011, the first full year of
principalrepayment on the proceeds of the Bank loan. However, over the entire 2006 - 2015
period, the ratio i s projectedto average 1.4, above the covenant minimum.

Sensitivity Analysis. Changes inkey variables have been assessedinterms of their potential
impact on the financial position of CMSC. These include: (i)     a one year delay in the
implementation of the tariff increases now plannedfor the beginning of 2006, 2008,2010 and
2012; (ii)  a 5% reduction inwater sales, and therefore wastewater flows, in 2007 - 2010 and
10% lower beginning in 2011; (iii)    a combination of reducedwater sales and one year delay in
tariff increases; and, (iv) a two percentage point increase in the cost of CMSC debt as of 2008. A
one year delay inimplementing the required tariff increases would have the greatest adverse
impact on the company. A delay in the implementation of the first two increases now planned
for the beginning of 2006 and 2008 could constrain CMSC's capacity to provide its share of
project counterpart funding.The estimated shortfall i s about RMB 20 million, which could be
addressed through an increase in the city government's contribution. The city government has
agreed to meet all counterpart requirementsnot met by CMSC.

A delay intariff increases now plannedfor 2010 and 2012 would leave the company with a
temporary cash shortfall of about RMB 30 -RMB 35 million. This could be addressed through
borrowing or a modest delay inplannedcapital investments over this period. If scenarios (i)      and
(ii) combined,thelonger-termimpactismoresignificantthanunderscenario(i) The
    are                                                                                  alone.
shortfall arising in 2008 would be relatively similar to that under scenario (i)  and could be
addressed through an increase in government contributions toward counterpart funding.
However, a larger shortfall, of at least RMB 100millionwould arise in.2012and 2013. It i s less
likely that this shortfall couldbe couldbe covered through borrowing. With the lower
wastewater flows under scenario (ii),    a delay in the expansion of the company's treatment plants,
which i s now planned to begin in2011could reduce, but not eliminate the shortfall. Instead,
either larger tariff increases would have to be implemented, increased contributions by
government for capital investments over this period, or a combination of the two would probably
be required.

                                 B.Ability and Willingnessto Pay

Ability to Pay. An affordability analysis has been undertakenin order to ensure that domestic
customers, particularly those in the lower income group, can afford the water tariffs in Ningbo
and wastewater tariffs in Cixi. Two representative household groups are considered inthe
affordability analysis: (i) the average income group; and, (ii) low-income group, which i s
                                                                 the
defined as the household earning the average of the lowest 10thpercentile of income
distribution. InNingbo, the low income householdearns an estimatedY605/person/year, while
inCixi the incomeis slightly higher. InbothNingbo and Cixi, incomes are conservatively
projectedto increase at an annual realrate of 2% for the average income household and 1%for
the low-income household over the 2004 - 2010 period, well below that actually achieved over
the past decade. Affordability i s assessed by comparing incomes to the total cost of water
supply, wastewater and other municipal charges included on the water bill. The results of this

For the very poorest households, the municipal government extends low income protection
under which a minimumincome of RMB 280 -RMB 320 per person, depending on the number
of persons in the household, i s guaranteed. This amount includes a provision for lifeline utility
services. With increases inboth water and wastewater tariffs in 2004, an additional direct
subsidy amount has beenprovided to all households qualifying for the social assistance. In
Ningbo, the entire increase inwater and wastewater tariffs i s refunded on the first 10m3of water
consumed. InCixi, the increase i s refundedfor all water consumed by qualifying low income
households.

Willingness to Pay.Willingness to pay for water and wastewater services i s relatively highin
both Ningbo and Cix. A willingness to pay survey undertaken duringproject preparation found
that 88% of households responding inNingbo were willing to pay 10% - 30% more for water,
provided the existing quantity and quality of supply i s maintained. A further 3% were willing to
pay 30% - 50% more. In Cixi, the survey assessed combined willingness to pay for water and
wastewater, which i s billed together and i s typically regarded by consumers as single charge.
Almost 92% of respondents were willing to pay 10% - 30% more, if existing services are
maintainedor improved. An additional 5% were willing to pay 30% - 50% more.

                                  C. FiscalImpactand Sustainability

An analysis of the fiscal impact of the Cixi wastewater component indicates that the project
counterpart contributions to be allocated by the Cixi City Government are projected to be well
within its financial capacity to provide these contributions. The Cixi City Government will
allocate RMB 370 million to the component, equivalent to 67% of total counterpart funding
requirements and 32% of the total cost of the component. The ability of the city to provide this
fundingwas assessedby reviewing municipal revenues and expenditures relative to project
counterpart funding requirements (Table 5). The data analyzedrefer to what i s referred to in
Chinese government accounting as on-budget and extra-budget funds. On-budget funds include
revenues from statutory taxes and levies, such as the urban construction maintenancefund. Their
allocations are subject to approval by higher levels of government. Extra-budgetary funds are
derived from non-tax off-budget revenues such as some types of user charges collected by
administrative departments. There i s less control by higher levels of government on these
revenue sources. The most important off-budget source of funds for Cixi i s the proceeds from
long-term leases of municipal land, a significant portion of which i s allocated to the public
infrastructure construction.

As a result of strong economic growth, there have been very large increases inmunicipal
revenue and expenditures inCixi inrecent years. Between 2000 and 2003, total municipal
revenue increased byjust under 200%, while municipalrevenue allocated to urban construction
increased by about 470%. This extremely large increase in capital fundingreflects the strong
commitment of the Cixi City Government to accelerate urban infrastructure construction to
improve people's living standards and provide the enabling environment for sustainable
economic growth. Relative to these actual rates of growth, the financial projections prepared to
assess the capacity of Cixi City to provide the necessary counterpart funding for its project
component are based on much more conservative assumptions. Over the 2005 - 2009 project
implementation period, both municipal revenue and capital investment capacity are assumed to
increase at an average annualrate of 12.5%. This i s less than one-third the actual average
growth inrevenue, and less than one-sixth the actual growth incapital investment capacity,
between 2000 and 2003.

Based on the very conservative assumptions regarding future revenue growth, the analysis

counterpart funds from Cixi City Government as a proportion of its total revenue i s only 0.4 -
indicates that the project component i s affordable by Cixi City. Requirements for project

1.1%. When considering only revenues that can be allocatedto the infrastructure investment,
which i s an approximation of financial capacity to contribute to the project, counterpart
contributions as a proportion of the capital budget averages 3.8% (5.0% inthe peak year, 2007),
well within the range considered to be affordable.




                                                       50

While the impact of counterpart fundingon the capital budget i s within the range considered to
be affordable, there i s uncertainty regarding actual revenues available to fund these budgets over
the project implementation period. This uncertainty arises becauseover 90% of the city's capital
investment capacity i s projected to be generated from long-term leases of municipal land. The
annual revenues from land leasescould vary significantly from year to year inresponse to
changes in government policy, the overall rate of economic growth, and the demand for land.
These factors have been considered in the base case analysis. For example, only half of the
quantity of suburban land plannedfor development i s included inprojected capital investment
capacity because the progress of development and leasing of these lands mightpotentially be
affected by government policy controlling the conversion of farmland into urban land uses.
However, a significant proportion of the landto be developed in Cixi i s exempt from this policy
because it i s being created from infilling along the coast and, therefore, does not involve
farmland. Furthermore, the supply of land available for leasing i s projected on the conservative
side. It i s based on the average area of land leased over the last seven years, and there i s a four
year lagbefore any newly developedlandi s assumedto be leased out. However, both the
demand and price of coastal land are increasing dramatically, due inlarge part to the
construction of the Ningbo - Shanghai cross-bay expressway bridge in Cixi, which has not been
taken into account in the projections. Therefore, the projectedrevenues from land leases are
based on very conservative assumptions over the project implementation period.

To evaluate the sensitivity of project affordability to reducedrevenues from land leases, a worst-
case scenario for the project was also projected. Under this worst-case scenario, the city's capital
investment capacity (mainly from the revenue from land leases) i s assumed to be only half that
projectedunder the base case scenario, which inturn was based on leasing only half the land
actually plannedby the Cixi Government. This scenario would reflect a major decline indemand
for land in Cixi, which i s not likely to occur. However, even under this extreme scenario, the
project remains affordable. Project contributions as a proportion of the capital budget would be
7.7% (10.0% in the peak year, 2007). Although this i s still affordable, Cixi would need to more
carefully manage its capital budget in order to ensure the counterpart funds are made available in
a timely manner.

                                        D.EconomicAnalysis

For the Ningbo water supply component, benefit-cost analysis has been employed. For the Cixi
wastewater component, its benefits are substantial but cannot be adequately quantified. For this
reason, the choice for priority interventions for this component has been guided by cost
effectiveness and least cost analyses.

NingboWater Supply Component

BenefitCostAnalysis. Basedon very conservativeestimates of project benefits, the economic
internal rate of return (ERR)i s calculated as 15.6%, which indicates the project component i s
economically viable as it exceeds the 12%economic cost of capital. This i s equivalent to an
economic net present value of RMB 236 million over the project component's estimated 35 year
useful life. Three types of benefits have been incorporatedinto the analysis. First,the
incremental supply of water to be provided by the project component has been valued at the
average water tariff, which i s taken as a proxy for willingness to pay. Second, in addition to
providingadditional supply capacity, the project will improve water quality, as well as a secure
supply. A survey undertakenduringproject preparationfound that over 90% of households
would be willing to pay more for water if the existing quantity and quality of supply are at least
maintained. This incremental willingness to pay has been estimated and incorporated into the


                                                  51

analysis as a project benefit. Third, with improved water quality, households are projected to
slightly reduce their per capita consumption of bottledwater, which i s muchmore expensive
than piped water. Basedon usage patterns, it i s estimated that per capita consumption of bottled
water will decline by 5%. The savings resulting from this reducedconsumption has been
incorporated into the analysis as a project benefit.

The calculated ERR represents a lower bound estimate of the economic viability of the project
component. Due to rapid economic and population growth, the existing water supply system i s
now operating inexcess of its design capacity on peak days. Inthe absence of the project, supply
shortages would worsen considerably, which has the potential to significantly constrain
economic growth. The critical role that the project plays in enabling continued growth of the
Ningbo economy has not been fully incorporated into the benefit cost analysis. The share of the
city's GDP generated from secondary industry, which depends on a reliable and adequate supply
of water, i s over RMB 90 billion, and i s growing by more than 10% per year. The annualized
cost of the project component over its useful life i s equivalent to less than 0.04% of the annual
value of secondary industry. Therefore, if water supply shortages reduce growth even slightly,
for example by only half of one percentage point, the value of this lost growth would be more
than 10 times the cost of the project component.

Cixi Wastewater Component

Least Cost Analysis. The project design incorporates the least cost option of two wastewater
collection and treatment systems; one serving north and central Cixi, and the other serving
eastern Cixi. A least cost analysis was undertakenin which three main wastewater system
configurations were assessed: (i)  the two system configuration; (ii)single centralized system
                                                                        a
serving the north, east and central areas; and (iii) three separate facilities, with three treatment
plants locatedinthe north, east and northeast. The two system configuration was found to be the
least cost; about 5% lower than the single system, and 3% - 5% lower than the three system
configuration. The selection of the treatment process has also been based on least cost analysis.
Two alternative process options were considered: (i)     anaerobic, anoxic, aerobic with biological
denitrification and phosphorus removal (A20); and (ii)      anoxic, aerobic with chemical
phosphorus removal (A0 with chemical phosphorus removal). The average incremental
economic cost (AIEC) for the A 2 0 process i s estimatedto be RMB 0.41/m3,compared to RMB
0.48/m3for the A0 process. On this basis, the least cost alternative, A20, has been selected and
incorporated into the project design.

Cost EffectivenessAnalysis.The marginal cost of pollutant removal provides an indication of
the relative cost effectiveness of the Cixi wastewater component. Based on the treatment
facilities alone, the AIEC per ton of COD removed i s RMB 3,820. This i s comparable to other
recent Bank funded projects even though the Cixi component includes the construction of
entirely new treatment plants while most other projects involve expanding existing facilities,
which i s generally less costly. For example, the AIEC per ton of COD removed for the two
wastewater components of the Tai Basin UrbanEnvironment Project (Ln. 4748-CHA, 2005) that
involve only WWTP expansion i s estimated at RMB 2,510 and RMB 3,875. Based on the entire
cost of the Cixi component, the AIEC per ton of COD removed i s estimated at RMB 13,020 per
ton of COD removed. This i s highbecause, in addition to the new treatment plants, complete
collection systems also need to be constructedunder this project component. As a result, the
capital cost of the collection system i s particularly significant, representing 75% of the total cost
of the component.

                        CHINA: Ningbo Water and Environment Project


The project i s classified as a Category A project and the following safeguard policies are
triggered: (i)environmental assessment; (ii) safety; (iii) heritage; and (iv)
                                               dam             cultural
resettlement. Ningbo Municipality i s a repeat borrower, with experience of a completed project
(Zhejiang Multi-Cities Project), and the ongoing Zhejiang Urban Environmental Project which
includes four components inNingbo City. The Ningbo authorities have developed a good
understanding and experience in implementing World Bank safeguard policies.

EnvironmentalAssessment (OP4.01)

The project as a whole will have a significant net positive impact, as it will improve water supply
quality inNingbo City and ambient water quality inCixi City, and promote sustainable
development of Ningbo Municipality. The China Academy of Environmental Sciencemingbo
Environmental Science Institute prepared the EIA for the Ningbo Water Supply component, and
the BeijingNovel Environmental ProtectionCo. Ltd. prepared the EIA for the Cixi Wastewater
component. Both EIAs have been approved by the State Environmental Protection Agency
(SEPA).An international consulting firm, SOGREAH, prepared a consolidatedProject EIA and
EMPaccording to the Bank's operational policies, andbased on the Chinese EIAs.A
comprehensive EIA was also carried out by Ningbo Municipality before the commencement of
the Zhougongzhai reservoir project in2001, andthis was approvedby SEPA and reviewed by
the Bank task team during project preparation. The summaryresults from the Zhougongzhai
reservoir were also incorporatedinto the Project EIA.The Project EIA report addressed relevant
environmental issues and developed necessary mitigation measures in the EMP.Key
environmental issues follows.

Ningbo Water Supply Component

Impacts on Zhangxi River Downstream of Jiaokou Reservoir: There are two reservoirs on the
Zhangzi River which supply water for the project--Jiaokou reservoir, and the Zhougongzhai
reservoir which i s located eight k m s upstream of Jiaokou, and i s currently under construction.
The raw water intake for the Maojiaping water treatment plant will be located at Jiaokou
reservoir. The Zhangxi River flows into the western Yinzhou plain and i s a secondary tributary
to the Fenghua River, via the larger Yingjiang River. The combined storage capacity of the two
reservoirs i s approximately 240 million cubic meters, and the median annual inflow into Jiaokou
reservoir i s estimated at 280 million cubic meters.

Analysis duringproject preparation indicates that, when fully utilized, around half of the annual
average inflow into Jiaokou reservoir will be diverted to Ningbo City. The water balance
calculations indicate that this will not have an adverse impact on other water users such as
irrigation, animal husbandry, village water supplies,etc. The reason for the lack of impacts i s the
additional storage provided by Zhougongzhai reservoir. Duringthe critical dry season months of
April-May, Jiaokou reservoir will release sufficient water to meet downstream demands, while
still satisfying the demand from Ningbo City. The rapid conversion of land from agricultural to



                                                 55

urban, and industrialuse, i s expected to reduce the irrigation demand over the next ten to twenty
years, although the conservative water balance calculations assumed that the amount of
agricultural land would remain unchanged, and would be used for highwater consuming rice
cultivation.

The annual hydrograph of the Zhangxi River will be modified due to the Zhougongzhai reservoir
and the diversion of water to Ningbo City, with reduced wet seasonflows, and moderately
reduced dry season flows. The estimated flow variations on an average year before the diversion
are 3.9 m3/s (January)-20 m3/s (August), whereas after the diversion, the flow range i s estimated
to be within the range of 3-5 m3/s throughout the year. Duringa drought year (P=90%), the low
flow in January i s only 0.4 m3/s, whereas after the diversion a minimumflow of 0.8 m3/s will be
maintained under all conditions.

While the reduction in high seasonflows i s likely to have some impact on the river benthic fauna
and fishery communities, the actual impact i s difficult to predict in advance. An analysis of the
Zhangxi River shows that it does not have any identified rare species or important commercial
fisheries, although there may be an impact on some sedentary fishes which are usedby local
residents, such as the snakehead fish. The EIA concludes that the planned flow releases from the
Jiaokou reservoir, after the diversion, can meet the water and ecological demands without
causing significant environmental impact.

The analysis presented inthe EIA is appropriate at this stage of the planning process. However,
environmental flow assessmenti s a complex issue, and thus a more comprehensive study will be
conducted during implementation and prior to the start of water diversions to further optimize the
operation of Jiaokou reservoir. Inparticular, it might be useful to have occasional larger flows to
preserve an element of natural variability. Although no adverse impacts are expected from the
water diversion, Ningbo will establish a monitoring and "Grievance Redress System" to identify
and rectify any unexpected impacts. The Redress System will include notifyinglocal authorities,
posting signs along the river, and other appropriate notification methods, as well as establishing a
system for recording, investigating, and where necessary, rectifying any adverse impacts. The
Environmental Flow Assessment and Grievance Redress System are included in the EMP.

NingboCity Wastewater; Ningbo City has recently prepared a Wastewater Master Plan, the
first phase of which includes US$140million of wastewater infrastructure i s being financed by
the World Bank under the existing Zhejiang Urban Environment Project. The Ningbo Water
Supply component of the proposed Project would not result in large additional increases in
percapita water use; rather it would provide Ningbo City water users with higher quality water,
and more reliable service. Therefore, the incremental impact of the Project on wastewater
generation i s expected to be moderate, and the investments planned under the Zhejiang Urban
Environment Project are sufficient to meet current wastewater needs inNingbo.

Cixi City Wastewater Component

Wastewater Treatment:Both the Northern andEasternwastewater treatment plants are
designed to meet discharge standard Class lA, with limits of 10mg/l BOD and SS, and removal
of nutrients to 15 mg/ltotal-nitrogen and0.5 mg/l of phosphorus. The proposed treatment



                                                 56

process i s a modifiedN O (anaerobic followed by aerobic) with tertiary treatment. Two options
were considered for the tertiary treatment process: i)engineered wetland; and ii)conventional
filtration. Since the land in the vicinity of the plants i s recently reclaimed coastal land with no
development and i s owned by the Cixi City government, there are no land acquisition costs or
resettlement issues. The engineered wetland was therefore chosen as the preferred alternative
because it helps to create an ecological habitat, and provides robust treatment with considerable
buffering capacity.

EffluentDisposal:Two alternative treated effluent disposal options for the Cixi wastewater
treatment plants were analyzed duringproject preparation: (i)       disposal to Hangzhou Bay, and (ii)
disposal to the Cixi canal network. Key factors influencing the selection include: the shalloy
depth of Hangzhou Bay off the coast of Cixi; the large tidal fluctuations; and the potential for re-
use of the treated effluent in water-scarce Cixi. The preferred alternative i s to discharge to the
Cixi canal network, and to reuse this effluent for agricultural and landscape irrigation.

Water quality modeling was conducted for both the canal network and the marine near-shore
areas. Various scenarios were simulated, and the modeling results confirmed that the project will
significantly improve the water quality of the overall Cixi canal network. There will be a
moderate deterioration of water quality inthe vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant
discharge points, but the overall water quality i s considered acceptable by SEPA.Modeling was
also conducted for different treatment plant discharge location options. A multi-point discharge
option was selected for the northern wastewater treatment plant to minimize water quality
impacts. For the eastern wastewater treatment plant, a site on the Shitangheng river between two
canal-sea sluice gates, was chosen as the optimal discharge location. The feasibility of including
an additional discharge point(s) for the eastern plant will be considered during the operations
stage, and i s included in the EMP.

Duringfloodperiods, the canal-sea gates inthe vicinity of the two treatment plants will be
opened to release flood waters to Hangzhou Bay. Floodwaters will be mixed with treated
effluent and thus the impact of these occasional releases on near-shore areas was modeled under
different scenarios. The scenarios considered various tidal regimes, and flood season and dry
season flows. The modeling indicated that the mixing zone during discharge periods i s within 2
k m s from the shoreline, and the resulting water quality would be in compliance with the national
ocean function zone requirements. The task team noted that there i s still potential for minor
adverse impacts along the shoreline, which supports considerable fishing and aquaculture
activities. This impact might be reducedif the mixing and retention of the treated wastewater in       .
the canals were improved, and short-circuiting to the sea gates avoided. The EMP includes a
program to evaluate various options during the operational phase.

SludgeManagement: Sludge from the treatment plants will be dewatered through gravity
thickening, followed by centrifuges. A total of 67,000 m3 sludge, with a moisture content of
78%, will be generated per year from the two plants. The sludge will be transported to nearby
municipal landfill sites intrucks with air-tight tanks. The sludge from the northern plant will be
disposed of in the Cixi West landfill, and the sludge from the eastern plant will be disposed of in
the eastem landfill. The western landfill was expanded and upgraded in 2002, and currently has
10 empty cells, which will use impermeable liners and leachate treatment systems. Cixi City

plans to upgrade the eastern landfill in 2005, and utilize impermeable liners and leachate
treatment systems for the four remaining cells. Upgrading the eastern landfill i s included inthe
EMP.The western landfillis forecast to reach full capacity around 2012, andthe eastern landfill
will reach capacity in 2015. Since the two landfills will be full after only five to seven years of
wastewater treatment plant operation, the EMFcalls for the Cixi Municipal Sewerage Company
to develop a sludge management plan to consider alternative long-term options for sludge
management. Monitoring of sludge quality i s also included in the EMPto ensure that the sludge
can be safely disposed of in a municipal landfill.

IndustrialPollution Control: Control of industrial discharges to both the canal and sewerage
systems by the Cixi City Environmental Protection Bureau appears to be effective and a high
level of compliance i s reported. Industries account for approximately half of the wastewater
discharges in Cixi, and a rapid pace of industrial growth i s planned for Cixi City over the next
decade. It i s expected, however, that the new industries will take the form of modern and more
efficient plants with relatively reduced levels of pollution, and more efficient use of resources in
general.

EnvironmentalTechnical Assistance; Cixi will use the Bank loan for technical assistance in
the following areas: wastewater treatment plant operations; sludge management; industrial
pollution control (for both CMSC and the EPB), canal water quality management; and building
business management capacity in CMSC.

Cixi Coastline Development: The high suspended solids concentrationin Hangzhou Bay,
combined with the hydrological and tidal currents, results insediment accretion along the
northern Ningbo coastline, with accretion rates of the order of 50-100 meters per year. According
to Cixi City's Plan for IntegratedBeach Development (1997-2010), approximately 130 km2of
land will be enclosed by sea-dikes from 2000-2010. The reclaimed land will be carefully
planned and developedwith agricultural and aquaculture areas, industrial estates, coastal
tourism, and wetland conservation zones. The area outside of the sea dike i s called the "beach-
area" and the width of the beach area varies depending on the tide but can extend hundreds of
meters at low tide. The areas inside and outside of the sea dike have rich benthos resources and
vegetation, and provides an excellent habitat for migratory and indigenous water birds.In
addition, there i s considerable aquaculture in the near shore area &e., just outside the sea dikes)
including snails, crabs, and fish. In contrast to most situations, wetland areas are being created in
Cixi due to the sediment accretion along the coastline.

Cixi Government understands the importance of the coastal habitat and intends to conserve
significant wetland areas and promote eco-tourism. A conceptual design for the wetland
conservation program has already been developed, and Cixi Government intends to apply for
GEFfunds underthe World BanWGEFEast Asia Seas PollutionReductionProgram (scheduled
for FY06) to undertake more sophisticated eco-system planning.

Dam Safety (OP4.37)

There are two dams whose reservoirs supply water to the Maojiaping water treatment plant, and
thus are directly associated with the NWEP: (i) dam which was commissioned in 1975
                                                  Jiaokou

(stone-masonary dam, 67 meters high and407 meters long, and 120million m3 storage); and ii)
Zhonggongzhai which started construction in 2003, and will be completed in2006 (concrete arch
dam, 126 meters high, 240 meters long, and 112 million m3 storage). There are an additional
three dams which will supply water to the ringmain to be constructed under this project: (i)
Baixi Dam completed in 2001 (rock-fill dam, 124meters high and 398 meters long, 168 million
m3 storage); (ii)  Hengshan Dam, completed in 1995 (rock-fill dam, 70 meters high, 123 meters
long, and 111million m3 storage); and iii)Tingxia Dam, completed in 1985 (concrete gravity
dam, 76 meters high, 317 meters long, and 150million m3 storage). An independent dam safety
expert contracted by the World Bank reviewed the safety of the four existing dams and progress
on the construction of the Zhougongzhai, and has found them to be satisfactory. The Zhejiang
Provincial Bureau of Water Resources also conducts periodic Dam Safety Panel reviews of all
major dams inthe province. Because of the direct connection with the Project, Emergency
Preparation Plans for Zhougongzhai and Jiaokou dams, acceptable to Bank, will be prepared and
implemented. The Bank will review and document constructionprogress, commissioning, and
the first filling of Zhougongzhai dam, usinga qualified dam safety expert.

CulturalProperty(OPN11.03)

Surveys indicate that project activities would not affect any above ground artifacts with
archeological, paleontological, historical, religious, or unique natural values as defined under
OPN 11.03. However, most of the construction activity will involve excavation work, and thus
all contracts will include standard clauses which follow Chinese law and regulations regarding
chance finds during construction.

On important cultural relic i s Tashan Weir, which i s located downstream of Jiaokou dam on the
Zhangxi River. Built in the year 833, it i s now an old cultural site under national preservation. It
i s 134.4 meters long, 10 meters high, and 4.8 meters wide. I t s surface i s made of stones, and its
body made of wood and stones. Tashan Weir remains intact and i s functioning to prevent salt
water, store fresh water, channel water into the fields, and sluice water elsewhere. The diversion
of water from the Zhangxi River i s not expected to have an impact on either the structural
integrity or the functioning of the Tashan Weir. The weir was reinforced in 1995, and the Bank
team confirmed that the weir appears to be in good structural condition. The cultural property
safeguard i s triggered inthis instance as a recognition of the cultural importance of the Tashan
Weir, andnot becauseof any expected negative impacts caused by the project.

Resettlement

A resettlement action plan (RAP) meeting the World Bank's OP/BP 4.12 has been preparedfor
the Ningbo Water Supply and Cixi Wastewater components. Detailed surveys for all known
resettlement and land acquisition have been completed. Inthe event there are additional
resettlement needs, a resettlement policy framework has been prepared. The surveys indicate that
resettlement impacts are relatively small given the scope of the project. The following table
summarizes the impacts.

                          Temporary Land Occupation        5030

The most significant impact is the temporary use of landduringconstruction of the water supply
pipes inNingbo and the sewerage pipes in Cixi. The major permanent acquisition of land i s for
the Maojiaping water treatment plant. The detailed social-economic survey indicated there are no
minority ethnic groups affectedb y land acquisition and house demolition.

NWSC and CMSC will be responsible for fundingresettlement activities incoordination with
local government officials. The PMO will establish a resettlement office, staffed with specialists
from NWSC and CMSC, to manage and supervise resettlement. Resettlement funds will be
channeled through the PMO-resettlement office directly to households and villages, thus
reducing opportunities for delay or unauthorizedcommissions. Affected farmers (inparticular
affected women and surplus rural labor) will be encouraged to participate inthe land restoration
through broad consultation. Village committees will play an important role in monitoring
resettlement and land acquisition activities. An independent monitoring institute will supervise
resettlement activities twice a year as required by the Bank.

Duringpreparation, attention was paid to the completedresettlement activities at the
Zhougongzhai multipurpose reservoir, which i s being constructedunder Ningbo' s municipal
waster resources development plan. The reservoir, although not included in NWEP, will
indirectly supply water to Jiaokou reservoir. Approximately, 967 households with 2381people
were relocated from a poor, mountainous area to a developed area in Yinzhou District. It was
determined that Bank OP 4.12 didnot apply to the resettlement, because it was completed in
May 2003, approximately one year before the Bank's identification mission for NWEP and the
reservoir i s being constructed, under the muncipality's water resources master plan to serve
multiple purposes, including hydropower, flood control, and water storage. Nevertheless, the
World Bank team carried out due diligence on the completed resettlement activities and prepared
a comprehensive report on the subject. The report concluded that all significant adverse impacts
have been mitigated in a manner consistent with the World Bank resettlement policy objectives
and to the satisfaction of the displacedpersons. The due diligence report i s contained inthe
project files.

EnvironmentalManagement Plan

The EMP specifies the appropriate environmental management and supervision mechanisms,
mitigation measures, environmental monitoring plans, training plans andbudget allocation
necessary to implement the mitigation measures and strengthen the Borrower's capacity. There
will be an environmental officer in the PMO to supervise the implementation of the EMP, and
both NWSC and CWSC will have environmental officers responsible for their components. The
PMO, CMSC, and NWSC have sufficient capacity and funds to implement the EMP.

Key environmental construction management issues include spoil reuse andor proper planning
of spoil disposal sites re-vegetation; usinglow noise equipmentltechniques; restrictions on
working hours, and temporary sound barriers for sensitive sites; timely reclamatiodre-vegetation
of temporarily occupied land; use of coffer-dam and slope protection measures; and proper
operational procedures of the contractors concerned for construction.

Consultation and Disclosure

The key project stakeholders are the Ningbo and Cixi City governments, NingboWater Supply
Company, Cixi Municipal Sewage Company, and local people who may lose land and
livelihoods, villagers and communities that may be impacted because of the construction and
operation of the project.

EA Disclosure and Consultation:For each of the two components, a detailed Public
Consultation Plan has been prepared which outlines the overall consultation and information
disclosure plan duringEA preparation in accordance with Bank's policies. Consultations were
conducted intwo rounds for the Water Supply Component from Marchto October 2004 and in
three rounds for Cixi Wastewater Component from January to September 2004. More than 400
people were consulted, including project affected people and communities, local government
agencies andexperts, and the relevant information and documents were provided during the
consultations. EIA reports were disclosed in local libraries in September 3 and October 15,2004
with notice announced via local newspapers. The draft EIA reports were also disclosed in the
Infoshop on August 5, inNovember 2004, and January 2005. The EA Summary was sent to the
World Bank Board of Executive Directions inJanuary, 2005.

RAPDisclosureand Consultation: Duringproject preparationconsultation has taken place
through resettlement surveys and meetings with government officials and project-affected
people. These consultations influenced the design of the RAP. An information handbook was
prepared for all project-affectedpeople, outlining the project, resettlement policies and
procedures. Inaddition, "land acquisition and buildingdemolition" announcements have been
provided to all affected parties. The full RAP was disclosed inNingbo and Cixi libraries and
government websites in October 2004. The draft RAPwas disclosedinthe World Bank Infoshop
on August 5 and the updated RAP was submitted in November, 2004.

Town Survey: Incorporation of the towns surrounding the core urban area inNingbo City i s one
of the main objectives of the overall Ningbo City Water Supply Master Plan. Most parts of



                                                61

Yinzhou District are supplied by 24 town water supply systems with a capacity of 265,000 m3/d.
Inaddition there are 14town water supply systemsinZhenhai andBeilinDistricts with a
capacity of 70,000 m3/d.Western Yinzhou District i s facing the most critical water supply
problems and seven towns are scheduledfor rapidincorporation into NWSC. Surveys of these
towns were undertaken to assess the demandfor NWSC service, andthe terms and conditions
under which the towns would like to be incorporated. The survey includedconsultations with
town and district officials, town water companies, and water users.

The total population inthe seven towns i s 232,000. Of the six towns, four have severe water
quality problems, while the other three have acceptable water supplies.All seven towns have
high levels of unaccountedfor water (UFW), with an average of 40% UFW. Water tariffs are
somewhat lower than NWSC, with a weighted average of around 1.2 Y/m3 while the NWSC
tariffs are 1.4Y/m3. Six of the seven towns would like to associatewith NWSC as follows:

P Two towns would like to transfer all assets, debts, ownership andmanagementfunctions to
>   NWSC;
    One town would like transfer managementresponsibility to NWSC but retain ownership of

>   assets;
    Three towns would like to purchasestreatedwater from NWSC and maintain ownership and

>   operation of the distribution system; and
    All six towns expressedan interest to protect the employment rights of the town water supply
    company staff.

Although all six towns strongly support the NWEP, views diverge on how best to incorporate
into NWSC. It should be noted that the primary unit of government for the towns i s the Yinzhou
District Government, and the towns are considered a "branch" of the district government. The
Yinzhou District government i s thus the primary decision maker for the towns. Currently, the
Yinzhou District government, Ningbo MunicipalGovernment, and NWSC are discussing how
best to provide NWSC service to Yinzhou. The Project will provide technical assistance support
to NWSC to assist inprovidingservice under appropriate terms to the out-lying towns.
