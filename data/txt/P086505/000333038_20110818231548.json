"loan_no": "4770", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Ningbo Water and\n            Environment Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the adoption of the ring main concept for\n            balancing water pressure throughout the system is an\n            innovation worth replicating in other cities. Many water\n            supply systems in developed cities, including London, rely\n            on the ring main design for its efficiency and balancing\n            pressures. A computer-aided network design was adopted for\n            Ningbo's trunk water supply network, which is also long\n            overdue in China. Optimization software provides a modern\n            tool for design of economically efficient distribution\n            networks, which makes computations simple, and provides\n            optimal pipe sizes to accommodate varying site conditions.\n            This approach is a good example of efficiencies that can be\n            achieved with the use of a large diameter ring main and can\n            be replicated in other cities in China. This project was\n            successful and was completed on time without restructuring\n            because its design was straight-forward and well within the\n            capacity of the implementing agencies. The project involved\n            only two geographical areas within the same municipality,\n            and the two second-level borrowers (NWSC - Ningbo Water and\n            Environment Project and CMSC - Cixi Municipal Sewerage\n            Company) had strong technical capacity, particularly NWSC,\n            and was well funded; and the design of the project was built\n            around high priority policies and objectives. The project\n            included financial performance covenants for both NWSC and\n            CMSC, and compliance by the utility companies was possible\n            only through the provision in the legal agreements for\n            'non operating income' (subsidies). Under\n            prevailing practice in China, higher priority is given to\n            service quality over tariff increases, which are introduced\n            over a longer period. In projects where this provision was\n            not made, the implementing agencies remained in a state of\n            noncompliance throughout the project period."}, "docdt": "2011-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
