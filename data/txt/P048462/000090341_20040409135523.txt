About     this Report
       The Operations       Evaluation      Department      assesses the programs         and activities of the World Bank for two
 purposes:    first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation              process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producing     the expected      results, and second, to help develop             improved    directions,   policies, and procedures         through
the dissemination       of lessons drawn from experience.             As part of this work, OED annually           assesses      about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending        operations.     In selecting   operations    for assessment,       preference    is given to those that are
 innovative,    large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming                 studies or country evaluations;         those for which
 Executive    Directors or Bank management               have requested       assessments;      and those that are likely to generate
important    lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical             approaches       selected for assessment         support targer evaluation
studies.
       A Project Performance           Assessment       Report (PPAR)        is based on a review of the implementation                Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation         by the responsible       Bank department)         and fieldwork     conducted      by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine              project files and other documents,            interview   operational     staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing       country   for onsite discussions         with project staff and beneficiaries.         The PPAR thereby           seeks to
validate   and augment        the information       provided     in the ICR, as well as examine          issues of special       interest to broader
OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process                   and OED management             approval.     Once cleared       internally,  the
PPAR is reviewed          by the responsible        Bank department        and amended        as necessary.      The completed         PPAR is then
sent to the borrower        for review; the borrowers'          comments       are attached    to the document        that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive         Directors.    After an assessment          report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed               to the public.


About     the OED Rating         System
       The time-tested      evaluation       methods    used by OED are suited to the broad              range of the World         Bank's work.
The methods        offer both rigor and a necessary            level of flexibility  to adapt to lending      instrument,      project design,    or
sectoral    approach.     OED evaluators         all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings.                   Following    is
the definition     and rating scale used for each evaluation               criterion  (more information       is available     on the OED website:
http://wortdbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.htmt).

       Efficiency:     The extent to which the project achieved'               or is expected     to achieve,    a return higher than the
opportunity     cost of capital and benefits          at least cost compared        to alternatives.    Possible    ratings:    High, Substantial,
Modest,     Negligible.    This rating is not generally         applied   to adjustment     operations.
       Sustainability:      The resilience       to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible            ratings:    Highly Likely, Likely,

Preface

        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for five post-conflict
projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH):


    l   Emergency Recovery Project (BA-SF-44389), for which the World Bank
        contribution of US$30 million equivalent from the Trust Fund for BiH and US$lS
        million equivalent in grant funds, was approved on February 29, 1996. The credit
        and grant were fully disbursed and closed on June 30, 1998, six months later than
       planned.

    l   Emergency Landmines Clearance Project (Cr.2905), for which the World
       Bank contribution of US$7.5 million equivalent was approved on July 30, 1996.
        The credit was fully disbursed and closed on December 3 1, 1998, as planned.

    l  Emergency Demobilization       and Reintegration Project (Cr.2906), for which
       the World Bank contribution of US$7.5 million equivalent was approved on July
        30, 1996. The credit was fully disbursed and closed on September 30, 1999, eight
       months later than planned.
    a  Local Initiatives   Project (Cr.N002), for which the World Bank contribution of
       US$7 million equivalent was approved on December 13, 1996. The credit was
       fully disbursed and closed on June 30,2000, twelve months later than planned.

    l  Republika Srpska Reconstruction Assistance Project (Cr.3028), for which the
       World Bank contribution of US$17 million equivalent was approved on
       December 23, 1997. The credit was fully disbursed and closed on March 31,
       2001, three months later than planned.

       This report is based on the Implementation Completion Reports for the projects,
legal documents and project files, and discussions with Bank staff involved in the
projects. OED fielded a mission to BiH in June-July 2003 to review project results. The
mission met with State, Entity, and Local officials of government departments and
agencies responsible for the projects, visited project sites in both the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, and met with beneficiaries of the projects as well
as other donors and nongovernmental organizations active in BiH. The mission
appreciates the courtesies and attention given by these interlocutors and the support
provided by the Bank's country office in Sarajevo and the satellite office in Banja Luka.

       Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PPAR was sent to relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments received are included
as annex B to this report.

         The attached PPAR assessesthe performance of five projects completed in Bosnia
and Herzegovina (BiH) as the country was emerging from the devastating 1992-95 war.
The Bank respondedvery quickly to demands to assist BiH after the Dayton-Paris peace
accords of December 1995, approving the first operation, the Emergency Recovery Project
(ERP), just three months later. This and later projects were channeledthrough one or both
of the two Entity governments into which BiH was partitioned. The projects bypassed
postwar BiH administrative complexities and weaknessesby working through autonomous
project implementation units (PIUS). A total of US$82.9 million was disbursed against the
five projects.

         Project objectives were most relevant when they respondedto key BiH demands
and drew upon the Bank's core competencies, particularly rehabilitating infrastructure
and restarting business credit. Relevance was lost when the Bank strayed beyond its core
competence. Still, 15 of the 19 objectives pursued by these projects were substantially
relevant to BiH's post-conflict recovery needs.

         Control of project disbursements during implementation became a major issue in
BiH. There were allegations in the international press of widespread corruption in the
BiH aid program as these projects were under implementation. As previously reported,
the Landmine Clearance Project did encounter fraud and conflicts of interest that led to
several arrests of demining contractors and the dismissal of the BiH Demining
Commissioners.

         The Emergency Recovery Project, operating for the most part in a classic mold of
Bank emergency reconstruction, succeededin restoring key infrastructure through the
"critical imports" component (for economic recovery) and through restarting business
credit. The component of emergency cash payouts to needy war victims was the least
relevant to the project's overall recovery objective and to IDA's purpose of promoting
economic development. There were mixed results as far as restoring government capacity
was concerned. OED rates the project's overall outcome as satisfactory, its sustainability
as likely and institutional development impact as modest. OED rates Bank performance
as satisfactory and borrower performance, too, as satisfactory.

         The Emergency L~~drni~es Clearance Project not only failed to achieve its most
relevant objective, but even helped make BiH's vulnerability to landmines worse, by
contributing to a system that inflates the landmine problem through reporting minefields
that no longer exist and failing to report progressmade. Instead of the project contributing
to the substantial cofinancing expected,most donor funding for demining bypassedit
altogether. Fraud and other corrupt practices during implementation led to several arrests
and dismissals. Bank inexperience in this field contributed to the failures experienced. OED
ratesthe project's ~ve~~~loutcome as highly unsatisfactory, s~st~i~~bili~      as highly
unlikely, given the lack of technical and financial resilience of the project's approach,and
i~stit~ti~~~l development irnp~~t as negligible, for failing to find ways of effectively using
resourcesto protect vulnerable groups and help recovery. B~~kpe~fu~rn~~ce is rated
highly unsatisfactory; a flawed basic design concept was followed by supervision that lost

                                                X



sight of the project's objectives. B~rr~werperf~rmance      is also rated hig
unsatisfactory, especially due to the many problems that aroseduring implementation.

         The Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project did help the
reintegration of demobilized soldiers and others through training and counseling. The
project's relevance was undermined by its pursuit of economic and political stability
objectives beyond its scope and others that were not applicable to BiH's post-conflict
emergency. For these reasons, OED rates over&l outcome as moderately satisfactory.
Sustainability is rated as likely, institutiunal development impact as modest. Bank
performance and borrowerperformance           are both rated satisfactory.

         The Local Initiatives Project was the best performing of the five, successfully
assisting economically disadvantaged and underserved groups throughout BiH to resume
economic activities, while helping to establish a sustainable institutional framework for
micro-credit. Hence, OED rates overall outcome as highly satisfactory, sustainability
as likely and institutional  development as high. At the same time Bank performance and
borrower performance are both rated highly satisfactory.

         The Republika Srpska Reconstruction Assistance Project achieved its best
results in restoring electricity and water services in the Entity, while also helping war-
affected farmers resume their activities and fixing some war-damaged housing. OED
rates overall outcome as satisfactory, sustainability as likely and institutional
development impact as modest. OED rates both Bankperformance                and borrower
performance as satisfactory.

    Experience with these projects confirms the following OED lessons:

    0   Even in very complex post-conflict situations, traditional Bank assistancein
        rehabilitating infrastructure and restarting business credit can yield very
        worthwhile results for the recovery of the war-affected borrower.

    l   The Bank should avoid involvement in activities beyond its core competence.
        Inexperience and lack of familiarity -     with landmines clearance, for example -
        are ingredients for failure.

    l   Designs of projects that rely on PIUS for implementation can make for speedy
        disbursements, but should always include exit strategies to help governments
        move toward normal operations.

1*                                              erzegovina's Recovery

An Extraordinary         Challenge and an Expeditious World Bank Response

11        Even with long experiencein post-conflict reconstructionworldwide' through
assistingthe restorationof key infrastructure and productive capacity, World Bank supportto
Bosnia andHerzegovina (BiH) at the end of the war in 1995was unusually challenging. It
followed a conflict whose scale,fury, duration and involvement of nearly everybody were
unlike anything since World War II, at leastin Europe. The conflict was extraordinarily
complex, involving three national combatant groups,neighboring countries, greaterand
lesserpowers in the region and beyond, andthe United Nations. All this was in the context of
the disintegration of the Former Socialist FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia (FSFRY). In its
first four years asa (nominally) independentnation during 1992-95,BiH had beenat war 95
percentof the time. There were even doubts among warring parties during 1996-97that the
conflict had really ended.

12        Despite the enormous uncertainties,the Bank got to work quickly and boldly in
assisting BiH. Its observer statusat the peacenegotiations meant that an understandingof
BiH's reconstruction needsdevelopedbefore the signing of the Dayton-Paris peace
settlement in December 1995.The Bank also took a lead role in the first BiH donor
conferenceconvenedin Brussels in the samemonth. The Bank respondedto key BiH
demandsfor recovery and focused assistanceprimarily on areaswithin its core competence
-   above all the postwar repair and reconstruction of infrastructure. As soon as security
conditions allowed, Bank missions enteredBiH territory from early 1996 when the Bank's
resident mission was establishedin Sarajevo.The first operation, the Emergency Recovery
Project (ERP) -      reviewed in this report -        was approvedin February 1996,three months
after the peaceagreementwas signed,with the first disbursementtwo months later. Bank
President JamesWolfensohn himself visited BiH in April 1996-                  a clear demonstration of
the Bank's commitment to BiH's recovery.

13        The Bank told the December 1995 BiH donor conferencethat the repair of the
   l


country's devastatedinfrastructure would cost US$S.1billion over three to four years.
Donors were ready to make much-neededinjections of foreign aid into a devastatedeconomy
whose GNP per capita had sunk to US$500, from a pre-war US$2,430, making BiH only the
secondEuropeancountry (after Albania) to be eligible for concessionalInternational
Development Association (IDA) funding. BiH's most difficult recovery of all, though, had
no ready price tag. It was from the traumas of the 200,000 war dead, 175,000injured. and
1,300,OOOdisplaced from their homes. Not a single family or businessin BiH was left
unaffected by the conflict. Humanitarian issues-            understoodhere asphilanthropic concerns
about alleviating human suffering -          arising from the aftermath of war would inevitably
influence B         work in BiH, even if they descended IDA's own founding purposeof
promoting economic development, asper its first Article of Agreement.


I. The Bank's first post-conflict reconstruction assistance was to France in 1947, befitting the newly
denominated IBRD -      International Bank for ~~c~~~~~~c~~~~and Development. In the past five years
alone, it has invested in reconstruction support in eight countries worldwide.

 14     Bank and other aid for r~~onst~~tion had to be channeledto one or both of the two
  l


"Entities"' -  the Federation of BiH (Fed-BiH) and Republika Sprska(RS) -        into which BiH
was partitioned by the peaceagreement.Entity governmentshave their own armed forces and
full rangeof ministries. The central government of the Stateof BiH hasonly residual powers
(not assignedto the Entities) that cover monetary policies and foreign affairs, including
foreign aid. The Bank made formal credit agreementswith BiH Stateauthorities who,
through previously approvedsubsidiary agreements,would on-lend Bank and other donor
resourcesto the Entities who were responsiblefor implementation. Until late 1997,the Office
of the High Representative(OHR), the top international authority in BiH, stalled most aid to
RS asthe Serb Entity was deemednot to be in compliance with peaceagreementterms
requiring the return of refugeesto their former homes and the active pursuit of indicted war
criminals. The Bank itself was not party to such decisions,but did follow the policy laid
down by them. Aid delivery to BiH was thus (literally) Balkanized to the Entities asmini-
stateseach covering an areaof 25,000 squarekilometers and inhabited by 1S-2.5 million
people. There was further division below the Entity level, notably into cantonsin the
(Muslim) Bosniak and (Catholic) Croat sharedFed-BiH Entity, aswas particularly clear in
the divided city of Mostar. Both entities were further subdivided into municipalities. The
dialectics, complexity, small scale,andpolitical dimensions of postwar BiH did not
contribute to an efficient framework for providing assistance,but it was the only one
available.

15      Against theseodds and after a preliminary needsassessmentin 1995,the Bank
successfully mobilized a major program of post-conflict assistanceto BiH, committing,

cost -  including cofmancing and parallel funding -    was in excessof US$1.6 billion. All      .
sectorswere covered.In the first 12 months, 13 out of 16of the approvedoperationswere
emergency operationsfinanced through Emergency Recovery Loans (ERLs) the Bank's
instrument of choice for funding urgent assistanceunder Operational Policy (OP) 8.50. As
BiH's emergency recededin the second 12months, only one out of eight projects were
financed in this way. BIH's first Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), in July 1997,
called for strengtheningmacro-economic management,first stepsin transition to a market
economy and more physical reconstruction.The five projects reviewed in this report were
chosento representa cross-sectionof early Bank supportto economic and social recovery of
BiH.

16      The implementation of eachproject was expeditedthrough a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) specially setup and staffed with qualified personnelto overseeprocurement and
disbursement. BiH government institutions, some devastatedby war, othersbarely
established,were not yet capableof performing thesetasks in 1996. Given at least one per
project, PIUS inevitably proliferated in BiH. Most worked well, being good interlocutors for
Bank supervision missions. But project designs      ically lacked exit strategiesfor normal
operationsto take over after the PIUS were wound up. Without a plan to transferPIU
knowledge, regular BiH government departmentsbenefited little from the PIUS. Fully
absorbing PIU experienceremains cashed         businessin BiH today. As for the PIUS
themselves, at project completion some simply vanished (togetherwith project records),their
former staff transferredto occupationsthat do not usePIU knowledge, while other PIUS
remain, but are eyed with envy by their (usually lower-paid) colleaguesin government.

17        Whatever longer-term drawbacksit had, the PIU implementation arrangement
enabledBank disbursementsto peak at US$l67 million during the first 12months of Bank
assistance(July 1996.June1997). In the subsequent12 months (July 1997-June1998),
disbursementsfell back to US$87 million, an annual level around which they have since.
oscillated. With theseamounts, Bank assistanceto BiH was intense,at a higher level per
capita than any other post-conflict country worldwide before or since. For eachBiH citizen,
the Bank disbursedUS$62.5 in the first two post-conflict years.By contrastit disbursedjust
US$4.6 per capita in Cambodia, US$7.2 in Guatemala,US$10.8 in Ethiopia and US$20.3 in
West BatiGaza       over thoseplaces' respectivetwo-year periods of post-conflict assistance.
Despite the intensity of supportto BiH, the Bank accountedfor just one-fifth of all aid to that
country. Many other parties were involved.


Along with a Legion of Other Donors

18        More than 14 multilateral development agencies,60 bilateral donors,and 400 NGOs
pledged support to and became active in BiH's post-conflict recovery and reconstruction. The
war had attractedthe world's attention and the world engagedintensively in the postwar
recovery. At the first donor conferencein Brussels,the international community pledged
US$Z.Obillion in assistanceover five years,one-fifth of which was committed by the Bank
itself. If donor generositywas not to translateinto too much money chasing too few projects
in a very small country, the design and implementation of an aid program had to be
expeditious, on a large scale,and well coordinated.

19        The Bank rightly interesteditself in the coordination of so many players and so much
aid. Insufficient donor coordination risked duplication of efforts and funding, national
rivalries, conflicting agendas,and bureaucraticlogjams. To avoid that, the Bank first
demonstrateda commitment to a coordinatedeffort through its own example. Jointly with the
EuropeanUnion (EU), the Bank coordinatedpreparationfor donor conferences.The first
Bank mission to BiH in late 1995was fielded jointly with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the EU, the EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and
USAID. Once establishedin Sarajevofrom January 1996,the Bank's residentrepresentative
would regularly meet with donor counterpartslocated in the city. Suchjoint efforts helped
coordination in practical ways, but no particular accorduniquely assignedthis responsibility
to the Bank or to anyone else.Inevitably, some duplication and conflict did arise within the
crowded field of donors.

1.10      The widely applied practice of donor cofinancing2 of Bank supportedprojects in
BiH preempted many potential problems of coordination. Cofinancing meant that donor
contributions were directly managed by the Bank through a trust fund agreement signed
with the donor. For its potential leverage of extra funds, cofinancing was an attractive
option, although. Bank task managersreported that preparing thesetrust fund agreements

2. Cofinancing signaled a donor's commitment to the objectives of the project it supported. This is distinct
from donors' "parallel financing" which, outside the project, could fund similar components, but
sometimes for quite different purposes. This OED evaluation follows standard Bank practice of treating
cofinancing as part of project expenditures, while excluding parallel financing.

                                                       4


 significantly slowed project preparation. Nevertheless, Bank hopes for cofmancing were
 high, but mostly unmet. For each Bank dollar invested in the five projects evaluated here, 3
 donor cofinanced dollars were expectedby project designers at appraisal, but only 1.3
 dollars were actually paid in. Despite the shortfall, donors still financed 30 percent more of
 theseprojects than the Bank itself. The shortfall did not expressa lack of donor interest,
 however. It arosebecauseappraisal estimates of likely cofinancing were basedupon less-
 than-rigorous assessmentsby the Bank of less-than-Ml commitments by donors. The
 resulting financial uncertainties did, however, lead to friction with some donors and
 inevitably disrupted the best-laid plans for implementation. Follow-on projects have been
 much more cautious in their expectations of donor cofinancing.


 A Panoply of Post-Conflict            Goals and Objectives

 1.11     With many donors and NGOs in BiH came varied and sometimes conflicting
 agendasgoing well beyond the Bank's own pursuit of reconstruction and development.
 These agendasfall into three groups: humanitarian, reconciliation, and political. In different
 ways, briefly considered here, each of these affected the Bank's work on the five projects
 under review.

 1.12     BiH's humanitarian disaster-           its war widows, orphans, disabled, and displaced
persons-       rightly triggered a massive relief effort focused upon restoring human welfare
 and dignity irrespective of the immediate economic benefits in ways that embodied UN
 humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality in alleviating human suffering. This
 was not the business of the Bank, however. Agencies such as the UN High Commission for
 Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and others
 specialize in the rapid deployment of such relief, usually before reconstruction itself is
underway. Humanitarian concernsaffected two operations, the ERP (just one component)
 and the Demining project. The actual results of Bank project incursions into these
humanitarian concernswere particularly disappointing in the caseof the Demining Project.
Later, the Bank appropriately refocused its attention more exclusively upon its core
reconstruction and development priorities.

 1.13     Reconciliation to consolidate peacewas obviously another key goal for the
international community and BiH, too. Like humanitarian work, reconciliation and peace-
making have not been core activities for the Bank. During the BiH war itself, they were
pursued by UN peacekeepers.After war's end, the OHR and some bilateral donors actively
promoted peaceand reconciliation, principally, they believed, through enforcing the right
of return of refugees and the pursuit of indicted war criminals. While the Bank was not
party to the formulation of such policies, it did neverthelesscollaborate with their
implementation, even if it sometimes meant undermining a project's development results.
Thus, the Bank would not bring assistanceto some municipalities in RS -                     such as Prijedor



5. Reconciliation is understood here to refer to the renewal of a friendly relationship between disputing
people or groups. According to the OECD, reconciliation requires the recognition of the suffering of
victims, the identification of atrocities and human rights violations, and the guaranteed ability to bring to
justice those who are individually and institutionally responsible for crimes (OECD 2001).

and Foca -    that had been blacklisted by the OHR for allegedly harboring war criminals.
Proactively, and with great dedication, Bank staff made every effort to bring Bosniak,
Croat, and Serb representativesto sit at the same table during project implementation, in
the hope that contact would foster reconciliation. Specifically in the divided city of Mostar,
the Bank pleaded intensely, but ultimately unsuccessfully, with the town's Bosniak and
Croat officials to unify their municipal administrations, in offices to be repaired by a Bank
financed project. In another project's design, the Bank believed that a BiH State-wide labor
market information system would break down ethnic barriers, leading to job offers across
former enemy jurisdictions. How Bank initiatives such as thesemight contribute to
practical results of reconciliation and peacewas not spelled out, nor monitored.
Reconciliation necessarily and always remains a key post-conflict goal, but the Bank's
contribution to it should be carefully circumscribed, and focused primarily upon rebuilding
institutions and infrastructure, activities within its core competence.

1.14     The legion of foreign donors brought diverse political aims with them to BiH. Most
agreed,however, that BiH's democratization as a sovereign nation and candidate for
eventual EU membership was a central goal. But parliamentary and electoral processes
characteristic of democracy had already been establishedin the BiH context. In March
1991, a majority decision by the elected pre-independenceNational Assembly of BiH
called for a plebiscite on independencefrom FSFRY, that resulted in a large majority -
boycotted by BiH's Serbs-       in favor. War rapidly ensued.After war's end, electoral
politics were quickly restored. September 1996 democratic elections returned to power
leaderswho had waged the war, and subsequentelections failed to break the mold of voting
along ethnic lines. Other key components of democracy, local community participation, an
active civil society, and a free press,were also well established in post-conflict BiH.
International dissatisfaction with BiH's politics led to more frequent OHR interventions in
day-to-day political affairs, making BiH look like a foreign-governed protectorate in the
eyes of some (Knaus and Martin 2003). One casualty has beenthe already feeble institution
of the BiH State. At the beginning, the Bank helped consolidate key BiH State agencies
such asthe Central Bank and Customs Administration, but very little assistancecame
thereafter. Three of the five projects reviewed here invested nothing at the BiH Statelevel.
One that did, the ERP, incurred only 2.7 percent of its expenditures to assist the BiH State.

21.      The great majority of the 19 objectives of the five operations reviewed here (Box
1)     some 15 or 16-     were relevant to BiH's post-conflict recovery aims in three main
ways. First, they had a clear focus upon the repair and recovery of war-damaged and neg-
lected infrastructure. Second, some were directly aimed at restarting the local economy
and generating jobs, especially through the provision of credit. Third, others focused
upon institution building necessary for recovery and for sustained development. The 3 or
4 less relevant objectives were those that did not directly addresseconomic and social

recovery. None of the project objectives explicitly addressedprivatization and market
reforms. In the immediate post-conflict devastation of BiH in 1996, such reticence was
wise and relevant. Conditionalities of a substantive reform agendamight have prevented
the immediate implementation of the recovery effort that BiH's situation demanded.

22        Without doubt, of the five-Bank financed operations reviewed here, the most
relevant to BiH's recovery and reconstruction had two key characteristics. First, their
main objectives responded to a strong effective demand. Second, their design and
implementation drew directly from core Bank knowledge and experience. Both the ERP
and the RS Reconstruction Project fit the bill exactly. Citizens in both war-ravaged
Entities wanted and were prepared to pay for restored (and improved) water and electrical
energy services in particular. Both projects provided them. Repair and rehabilitation of
damaged infrastructure was something the Bank had helped with many times before in
many countries worldwide, and, most important, with some considerable success.Less
relevant components of these projects were either those that did not draw upon Bank
experience, such as the cash payouts to needy war victims in ERP, or those for which
there was a need, but no effective demand. This included RS Reconstruction's assistance
that impoverished RS farmers neededbut could not afford.

23.       After the war there was, and remains, a strong demand for credit by small firms
and the self-employed wanting to restart and expand their businesses. This demand
provided a firm foundation for business lines of credit of the ERP and the Local
Initiatives Project (LIP). To help design a responseto this demand, the Bank could draw
upon more than 50 years of experience of Bank support for lines of credit -                    albeit with
mixed results -       that started in Ethiopia as far back as 1950. More immediately in the
BiH context, LIP itself effectively used the experience of a completed pilot project in the
city of Tuzla, that was financed by the U.K. Department for International Development
(DfI D).


Loss of Relevance When Core Competence and Demand are Missing

24.       Other projects or parts of them that did not draw from a pool of Bank knowledge
or which misread demand fared differently. This particularly affected the Demining pro-
ject, the first of its kind for the Bank. Inexperience led to a serious design flaw of the pro-
ject's "demining-first/recovery-afterwards"           premise, expressedby the MOP as "the need
for demining preceding the need for infrastructure reconstruction" (MOP 1996 Annex p.
2) and by the current BiH Mine Action Plan, which affirms that "demining is a pre-condi-
tion for the reconstruction of the country" (BH-MAC                2002, p.4). Empirical evidence does
not support this contention, however. BiH's highest ever GDP growth -                     an extraordi-
nary annual 79.1 percent -          was in 1996, before any significant demining had occurred.6

6. Demining-~rs~recovery-a~erwards       was not a premise of the recovery strategy for BiH as a whole. That
strategy correctly called for urgent reconstruction that should not wait for demining for which only 4
percent of all resources were earmarked. Bank operational guidelines (drafted after the design of the BiH
demining project) now make clear that demining should be an integral part of a development project, and
not a stand-alone effort, as it was in BiH (World Bank 1997). Incorporating demining into a transport
project yielded a somewhat better result in Croatia (Loan 4104) as a parallel OED PPAR of that project
demonstrated.

                                                     8


25        Implementation of the Demining project -            the only BiH operation rated with
unsatisfactory supervision ratings, according to the 1997 CAS -                was also undermined
by Bank inexperience. OED's earlier country study of BiH correctly affirmed that `there
are major technical and military aspects(of demining) that are not within the Bank's
competence (OED 2000 p. 89). The borrower ICR itself criticizes the Bank for its lack of
know-how. A Bank mission in January 1997 was candid about the lack of Bank
experience in the sector and consequent uncertainties about best practice and costs
standardsfor commercial demining. Earlier missions had introduced specifications-such
as payment per mine lifted-that          made contracts unworkable, according to demining
contractors themselves. Furthermore, supervision missions' undue focus upon lowering
the unit costs (per squaremeter) of demining -             not an outcome indicator -     led the Bank
to lose sight of the original development objectives that the project, too, was losing sight
of. Difficulties such asthese lead this assessmentto endorsethe recommendation of
OED's evaluation of post-conflict reconstruction concludes that Bank involvement in
demining should focus primarily on non-clearance activities, such as coordination,
information and mine awareness,training, and institution building. (OED 1998 p.29).

26        The Reintegration project also ventured into areasbeyond Bank core competence,
but without the unsatisfactory outcome of demining. Although "demobilization"                  was in
its title, the Reintegration project only assisted,principally through training, ex-soldiers
who had already been disarmed and demobilized before the project started. Hence it was
unlikely to achieve its objective of promoting political stability, an aim usually associated
with demobilization itself, something that the Bank had only limited experience with in
1996. Promoting economic growth was also an unlikely objective for a supply-side
operation such as this that was contingent upon firms' demands for training and
retraining in a very weak labor market. The more successful reintegration side of the
project, however, was able to draw upon Bank experience with labor redeployment
programs completed elsewhere in the region. Many ex-soldiers and others in post war
BiH clearly needed to re-tool skills that no longer suited the market transition conditions
of BiH's recovery, and in this respect the Reintegration project did address a relevant
issue.


Keeping Control During Implementation

27        Successful project implementation requires adequate oversight to ensure that
project resources are used efficiently to help achieve the intended objectives. Concerns
about possible waste of resourceswere raised through international press reports in mid-
1999. These included allegations of large-scale fraud and corruption within BiH's aid
program as a whole, affecting perhaps one third of all disbursements. OHR established a
special investigative unit to look into this, but was unable to corroborate corruption on
the scale alleged. In connection with the Demining project, however, criminal charges of
fraud and misuse of authority were filed against demining contractors and BiH's
Demining Commissioners. These followed thorough investigations by the Fed-BiH
Financial Police.7 No Bank staff was mentioned in investigations into this fraud,

7. Charges filed and arrests made in March 2001 arose from problems identified much earlier dur ing the
implementation  of the Dem ining project. The principal technical advisor to BH-MAC was a firm with

however. The Project Management and Auditing.Unit                  (PMAU) first introduced through
the ERP did bring valuable discipline to PIU work, but clearly not enough to avoid the
problems that came to light in the caseof the Demining project.



30        Results Achieved Through                      the Five Projects

Emergency Recovery Project (BA-SF-44389)

31        This project successfully met its first objective of restoring key productive
capacity and infrastructure in BiH, but on a smaller scale than envisioned at appraisal.
About 70 percent of the planned investment was made. Actual donor cofinancing was
only half the large amount (perhaps unrealistically) anticipated. This reflected a poor
Bank assessmentmore than a decline in donor interest. Nevertheless, ERP's US$113
million investment significantly helped BiH's recovery. Success was aided by: (i) Bank
focus upon its core competencies; (ii) partnership with BiH's more war-resilient
institutions (Fed-BiH's power utility, Elektropriveda, for instance'); and (iii)
exceptionally diligent and authoritative PIU management, with strong support from the
Bank office in Sarajevo. Critical imports financed by the project allowed the repair of
power lines, substations, and even a hydroelectric plant, all of which contributed to the
restoration of power supplies essential for BiH's economic recovery.

was good. Continuity and
sustainability are assuredas the Federation Investment Bank (FIB) took over the portfolio
after project closing in 1999. The positive experience encouraged other donors, notably


direct cammercial interests in bidding for BiH contracts. In 1997 demining equipment donated to BiH had
been illegally transferred to selected firms competing for BiH demining contracts. Misprocurement     was
declared and Bank disbursements suspended in May 1998, by which time, however, 85 percent of the IDA
credit had been disbursed.

8. Fed-BiH Eletropriveda did repair and reconstruction work under extremely dangerous conditions
throughout the war. Its acquired technical competence ensured that only equipment best suited to BiH's
emergency needs was imported under the project.

EBRD, USAID, and KW          to launch similar lines of credit, and the Bank itself to follow
up with more credit through LIP. That project broadened credit to include BiH's service
sector, which accounts for 61 percent of the economy, beyond ERP's limitation to
manufacturing that accounted for only 16 percent of BiH's GDP.


33      ERP yielded mixed results in reestablishing a minimum level of institutional
capacity for the government. Half of the project assistanceunder this component financed
supplements to the very low salaries of career civil servants, enabling key institutions and
departments such as the Central Bank, Banking Supervision Agency, and Ministry of
Finance to function. These supplements also helped reduce disparities of pay between
Bosniak and Croat officials in the Fed-BiH government, making collaboration between
them more feasible. Repairs to the war-damaged buildings in Sarajevo, such as those of
the Customs Administration and the Tax Administration, enabled these agencies to get
back into action. In the divided city of Mostar, however, the project failed, despite its
persistent efforts, to bring the Bosniak and Croat parts of the local administration into a
single refurbished building. Mostar's initial reluctance to participate in the institutions of
Fed-BiH Entity Government was finally overcome, but at a high cost. The project
contributed to a costly new building to house Fed-BiH ministry offices alongside many
war-damaged structures still left in ruins in the city. The strained and complex post-war
BiH politics in Mostar prevented efficient ERP assistancethere.

34      The project's last objective -   alleviating the severepost-conflict hardships of
vulnerable groups in BiH -     was an orphan in two respects. First, it was not part of the
project's legal agreements. Second, and more important, it was a humanitarian goal
unrelated to the Bank's expertise and role. The OED mission found that evidence of the
results achieved in BiH, while uneven, nevertheless points to the partial achievement of
this objective. In a humanitarian sense,finding the vulnerable target groups to assist was
itself quite easy in 1996 in BiH -   nearly everybody had suffered and hence qualified.
Being unwilling to wait long in line to receive a US$6.62 handout probably ensuredthat
higher-income people did not displace poorer beneficiaries. Even with only half the
funding expected at appraisal, 525,000 people were reported to have received up to five
payments each through 190 municipal centersthroughout Fed-BiH. There were major
logistical challenges at different levels. The Central Bank's inability to process letters of
credit meant that cash could not reach all payment centers and some beneficiaries were
not paid on time. At the municipal level in Novi Grad near Sarajevo, for instance, just
eight municipal staff had to screen and assist more than 4,000 applicants in only two
days. Monitoring and oversight challenges for the newly created Fed-BiH Ministry of
Social Affairs, Displaced Persons and Refugees (FMSA) were overwhelming. Success
cannot be judged from documented evidence of this component's beneficiaries, lists of
whom were not made available to the OED mission. Nevertheless, as reported by several
interviewees in BiH, a major relief operation did indeed take place. Inaccessible records
in this case may result indirectly from Bank inexperience in overseeing an emergency
humanitarian relief operation of this type that other organizations are better equipped to
handle. This result supports the ICR conclusion that the cash handout component should
not have been part of a project focused upon reconstruction.

35        The project did, however, make an important contribution outside the framework
of its original objectives. It set up the special Procurement Management and Auditing
Unit (PMAU) to help establish good practice procedures for all Bank-assisted projects in
BiH. This was a very necessary step in view of the large scale of IDA and trust fund
financing and the debilitated condition of BiH government oversight at the time.


Emergency Landmines Clearance Project (Cr. 2095-BA)

36        The Demining project failed in its most relevant aim of protecting BiH's
vulnerable population from landmines. Instead, it supported a system in BiH that, through
misinformation and failure to report progress, exacerbatesuncertainties and fears about
landmines not for just vulnerable groups but for all households and businesses. Thus,
official maps in BiH -       developed with project technical assistance-               show as active
minefields today areasthat have long been demined. The OED mission itself crossed one
such field, regularly traversed by locals with no ill effects, near Sarajevo's football
stadium. Lack of resources to update the maps was given by BH-MAC                       asthe reason for
an error that undermines a citizens trust in a data setthat is supposedto protect. BH-
MAC      faces an important disincentive, too: its legal liability for accidents that occur on
sites they had declared to be safe. Outside BH-MAC,                BiH officials at all levels and
demining contractors sharedwith the OED mission their doubts about the trustworthiness
of BiH landmine maps. In informing the OED mission that BiH mine accident statistics
are still worsening (inconsistent with reported data), BH-MAC                 officials themselves did
not convey to OED any senseof improvement as far as vulnerability from landmines is
concerned. More accurately, though, BH-MAC                  reports that 90 percent of known
minefields have lost their fencing and markers (BH-MAC                   2002, p. IO), examples of
which the OED mission saw for itself on field trips near Sarajevo. Both types of error in
BiH's system -        pointing to mines that do not exist and failing to point to those that do
-   have the quite negative effect of

9. Mine awareness did not go far. Just 7,000 people attended lectures given through the project. Future
prospects for reducing vulnerability are not supporting by puzzling data. BiH's current maximum output is
to clear 24 square kilometers per annum, at which rate BiH would clear the remaining 2,143 square
kilometers and be free of mines only after 89 years! For all the investment made in demining, is there no
end in sight to BiH's landmine trauma eight years after the war?

in BiH at Gorazde, an easternenclave under siege for most of the war and ringed by
minefields on today's map; yet upon visiting the town, the OED mission found that the
last mine accident there had been in 1996, inferring the presence of far fewer mines than
reported. After war, landmine inflation thrives for other reasons.It boosts the interests of
commercial deminers and their clients in government, whose funding requests are driven
by landmine lamentation rather than proposed solutions. Thus BH-MAC           estimates that,
today, there are still 1.3 million landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) across 2,143
square kilometers of BiH, figures near the lower end of the 1S-3.0 million range
estimated at war's end. On this scale, the removal of 8,209 landmines and clearance of
6.2 squarekilometers -       the project results reported by the ICR -  contributes very linle
to protection, especially if there are doubts about the effectiveness of the work done. As
stated in project documents, accurate and reliable information is key to protection from
landmines and the project was expected to help provide it. This is recognized by the
ICR's call for improved landmine data reliability (ICR para. 1l), which is ironic today
since it should have been delivered by the project itself.

38       Landmine accidents -      a stark indicator of vulnerability - saw their biggest drop
in BiH in 1996, before the project. Local people's own keen knowledge about the
location of mines and the halt to seeding new minefields helped lower the accident rate.
Since then, accident rates have continued to fall, but more slowly. The latest figures
given to the OED mission show 27 fatalities in the first half of 2003. While these are 27
too many, they demonstrate that landmine accidents are no longer a major cause of death
in BiH. Traffic accidents take more than 400 lives each year, for example. But road
accident fatalities do not make the dramatic news headlines that the life a child taken by a
landmine does. In this way, the media, too, feeds landmine inflation.

39       Like other projects in BiH, Demining was implemented through PIUS. In this
 l


case,however, poor relations between the PIUS and their respective mine action centers
(that were entity-level at the time) undermined the project's institution building objective.
Disputes were fed by publicly aired doubts about a counterpart's professional experience
and competence. Toward project closing, a new institutional arrangement with a BiH
State-level BH-MAC       was established to replace the Entity-level arrangements in place
for the Demining project. Oversight of the BH-MAC          was in the hands of a three-person
Demining Commission representing each of BiH's main ethnic groups. Today, BH-MAC
remains dependent on donor funding for 90 percent of its resources. It is responsible for
coordinating 42 local and foreign demining organizations and firms active in BiH. The
two firms that handled 90 percent of the Demining project's contracts are no longer in
BH-MAC's       list of accredited companies. Results such as these do not support the ICR's
conclusion (para. 44) that the Bank's comparative advantage in demining lays in
institution building.

3.10     Institutional failures also took a toll on partnership. By OED's account only
US$9.6 million of trust fund cofinancing materialized out of US$59.5 million expected at
appraisal. Only four donors contributed out of the eight or more expected. Demining
assistanceby other major donors to BiH bypassedthe project. Only US$2.5 million of the
U.S. Department of State's US$5 1.5 million Humanitarian Demining Program (HDP)
during 1996-2002, for instance, was channeled through the Bank-financed Demining

                                                      13


 project. From 1998, U.S. demining aid was delivered through the International Trust
 Fund for Demining in Neighboring Slovenia (S-ITF). The EU, which was expected to be
 the largest cofinancer of the Bank project, also went its own way, financing its demining
 operations through BiH entity Civil Protection departments.

 3.11    The project's objective of strengthening local mine clearing capacity was not met.
 Contrary to ICR reports (paras. 22-23), a local BiH demining industry was not
 established through the project. Foreign firms from France, Italy, Russia, Zimbabwe, and
the United States dominated, taking contracts amounting to 98.2 percent of project
funding for demining. The two largest firms -            accounting for 90 percent of business
contracted under the project -       lost their accreditation with BH-MAC         as soon as the
project closed. BiH deminers were indeed trained and many have been deployed on work
in Afghanistan, Angola, and Macedonia. But why is demand for their services at home
insufficient? After having been rejected as inefficient by the designers of the Demining
project, the military -    traditionally with heavy responsibilities in this area-         are now
regaining their accreditation as humanitarian deminers. Since the closure of the project to
date they have accounted for 22 percent of the total area cleared in BiH.

3.12     The project failed to conduct demining that was high priority for BiH's economic
and social recovery and reconstruction. Instead, so-called Category I demining -               of a
five-meter perimeter around individual housesto allow refugees to return to their former
homes -     was the top priority then and still is today. Category I does not address
reconstruction, nor the potential productivity gains of demining farmland around the
houses, for instance, but is consistent with the international community's humanitarian
goals and policies for BiH. loBut it distracted the project from the recovery and
development goals of demining, and from the enumeration of the potential economic
benefits of demining. Internal economic rates of return, relatively easy to estimate using
increased land values as proxies for benefits, were assessedneither ex-ante nor ex-post
for the project investments. In short, the project failed to treat BiH demining as part of a
productive investment for recovery, as recommended by the Bank's own demining
operational guidelines -      issued on February 7, 1997, during the implementation of the
BiH project -      and incorporated into the design of the later transport and demining
project in Croatia (Ln. 3869). Another ICR recommendation to help BiH governments
prioritize demining tasks (ICR para. 11) also relates to what the project itself had
promised to do, yet failed to deliver.


Emergency Demobilization           and Reintegration       Project (Cr. 2906BA)

3.13     Through providing training and counseling, this project enabled the economic
reintegration of 17,378 demobilized soldiers (the majority), displaced persons, war
widows, and other unemployed persons, Altogether, 82 percent of those trained under the

10. According to one major player, humanitarian demining aims at removing "landmines that maim and kill
innocents, obstruct emergency assistance activities, hamper economic development, and impede the free
movement of citizens" (US. Department of State http://www.state.aov/~p~~/hdp/),

                                               14


 accounted for most project expenditures. "Counseling" was also provided, but it was very
 basic, involving advice to beneficiaries on writing resumes and preparing for job
 interviews. Of those who got jobs, 66 percent were still in employment one year after
their initial placement, according to a useful impact evaluation conducted under the
project. This compares with only 15 percent of a control group of employees with similar
 demographic and socio-economic characteristics to the beneficiaries but without the
training. Other project assistancewas mostly on a very small scale, such as the 387
persons helped with trauma counseling through the project. The small and reduced scale
of this project, which attracted less than half the funding expected, severely constrained
its scope and impact. Instead of being a US$20 million operation as planned, only
US$9.2 million in funding became available. Practically none of the donor cofinancing
hoped for at appraisal was forthcoming. As with other early projects, this had more to do
with poor financial planning at appraisal than lack of donor interest. Unit cost savings,
nevertheless, meant that the project was able to train two-thirds of the targeted
beneficiaries with just one-half of the intended resources.

3.14     Expecting a small operation such as this to promote economic growth was an
unrealistic objective. It assistedbarely 5 percent of the estimated 425,000 soldiers
demobilized in BiH during 1996. As of December 2002, 145,000 demobilized soldiers
still remained unemployed in BiH, more than five times the number assisted by the
project (Government of BiH website, p.6). These results demonstrate how a small
Reintegration project, itself dependentupon a buoyant demand for labor (that did not
materialize), cannot be expected to make a significant impact upon economic growth. At
the micro level, the OED mission visited a chemical factory in Tuzla that had trained the
largest single contingent of demobilized soldiers under the project, 331. Today the
company responsible is in bankruptcy, having reduced it total staff from 1,200 to less
than 100. Poor outcomes such as these reflect more the lack of demand for labor at the
macro level within the BiH economy than the shortage of adequately trained labor, the
issue addressedby the project.

3.15     OED could find no evidence that, as intended, the project significantly reduced
dependency by the unemployed on social assistance.While a standard aim for labor

to collect data about the unemployed, rather than matching this with employers' data on
job opportunities. In the Herzegovina-Neretva canton visited by the OED mission, for
instance, the system was meant for training, but barely used. The limited information
gathered across BiH was not sharedbetween entities and cantons or even made available
to the unemployed or the public in general. The designers' belief that such a system -             if
it used compatible computer hardware and software in Fed-BiH and RS -                could
contribute to cross-Entity communication and reconciliation did not become reality.


Local Initiatives    Project (Cr. N002)

3.17     As intended, this project very successfully assisted many economically
disadvantaged or underserved groups in both Entities of BiH to resume economic
activities. Through micro-credit organizations (MCO) established under the project, some
20,000 micro-enterprises -     having up to five employees -       received 50,261 loans for 6-
 18 months, to finance improvements to their workplaces, or purchase equipment and
inventory. The loans were small, averaging US$l,600, and repayment records were
excellent, no doubt helped by the promise of further (and larger) loans to borrowers who
repaid on time.

3.18     Making up for the earlier ERP's undue focus upon manufacturing for its business
lines of credit, 92 percent of LIP loans went to trade, services, and agriculture, the sectors
generating most employment in BiH. According to the ICR, the project helped sustain
64,853 jobs (40,739 existing plus 24,114 new). If each employee had two dependents,
then 195,000 people may have benefited directly through the project. A detailed baseline
survey conducted for this project of 3,281 project beneficiaries found that 43 percent of
them were even more than just economically disadvantaged, since they were below the
poverty line of US$275 per month for a family of four (Dunn et al. 2003). Nearly all
beneficiaries were "under-served" in the terms of the project objective statement, since
only 5 percent of them had accessto commercial bank funding. Half of the beneficiaries
reported that their output had increased by more than 10 percent thanks to the loan. The
OED mission visited selected several micro-enterprises -         including a baker. market

reported in the ICR. The project
design and hence ICR did not take into account the revolving fund nature of this
operation that allowed project funding to be used and reused several times over to
finance several successive loans. The Memorandum of the President's (MOP) mention of

an appraisal target of 7,000~10,000referred only to the first round of loans made. Since
these loans were short term and quickly repaid, the project appraisal could have
conducted a financial analysis and simulation to estimate the likely number of loans to be
made and amount to be lent. Altogether by completion, the project lent US$82.4 million
to microenterprises, through the effective application of US$l9.6 million project funding.

3.20     The project achieved outstanding results in establishing a framework for the
development of sustainable micro-credit institutions in BiH. There was clearly a strong
demand for this line of business in BiH. Altogether, 35 institutions, all but six local,
applied to participate. LIP first selected 17 of them, later paring this down to just 9 of the
best performing and financially most resilient. These became the client Micro-Credit
Organizations (MCOs) of the follow-on LIP-II project that is carrying the approach
forward. Under LIP, the MCOs operatedwithin a framework of laws that were similarly
drafted by the project for both Fed-BiH and RS. The OED mission visited three MCOs
across BiH (MI-Bospo, LOK, and Microfin) and was impressed by the professionalism of
their organizations. Significantly, five MCOs, including LOK and MI-Bospo, have
become sufficiently creditworthy to raise commercial loans on their own. The presently
low debt-to-equity ratios of these MCOs suggeststhat they have scope for further
borrowing in the future. All three MCOs visited by OED are profitable, whether
measured by their operating ratios (operating revenues minus operating costs) or return
on assets(operating revenue divided by total assets). Some even want to expand and
become fully fledged commercial banks, an unlikely prospect given BiH's already
crowded banking sector. Nevertheless, their ambition is a positive indicator of the health
of a sub-sector that the LIP helped establish.

3.21     Through direct finance to micro-enterprises and building a sustainable
institutional framework around them, LIP probably did help the start-up and expansion of
small businesses as intended. While respondents reported business expansion, specific
data on business start-ups was not collected by the baseline survey. Nevertheless, given
the war's massive interruption to business, postwar economic growth in BiH must have
been fuelled by the substantial resumption of business activity to which the LIP made an
important contribution.


Republika Srpska Reconstruction Assistance Project (Cr. 302%BA)

3.22     The project assisted some 750 war-affected and disadvantaged RS farmers to
restart their farming activities through providing them with livestock and farm
equipment. Approximately half the project assistancewas in the so-called "anvil" region
of central RS, an ethnically mixed areaaround the city of Mrkonjic Grad. The war had
depleted the RS livestock herd to just 2,000. Today, the herd is not only larger (5,000
head of cattle) but also of better quality. Through importing 3,876 pregnant heifers, the
project contributed to the increase, but at least 800 of the animals were sold for slaughter.
During visits to farms near Mrkonjic Grad, the OED mission could seethat those
remaining were high-quality pedigree animals. The high cost of feeding and difficulty in
caring for the unfamiliar breed were given by farmers as the main reasons for their
slaughter, especially during the 1999 drought. Although provided on the basis of one
heifer per farmer as a loan to be repaid, recipients regarded the animals as a gift to

beneficiary farmers in seven of RS's 63 municipalities. Being donated, these were well
received by the farmers. In hindsight, the heifers too should have been donated, in
accordance with the practice of other bilateral donors at the time. But the loan precedent
established by the earlier Fed-BiH Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project precluded the
grant option in RS.

3.23     The project successfully improved the quality (but did not increase the quantity)
of the public housing stock in RS. Altogether, it made 3,570 existing dwelling units more
habitable through restoring common areasof 162 war-damaged apartment buildings
(against targets of 4,500 units in 250 buildings). This effort affected less than 1 percent of
RS's total housing stock, though, 10 percent of which was damaged in the war. Housing
improved under the project was made more livable through low-cost (averaging
US$2,750 per unit) rehabilitation to stairwells, access,roofing, and external walls.
Among other things, the OED mission noted during site inspections that the external
improvements to war-scared buildings were, not least of all, an important statement of
returning normalcy to towns formerly ravaged by conflict. By dealing exclusively with
common areas,the project skillfully    focused upon the public-good side of housing. As
well as meeting a Bank priority, it allowed implementation to proceed even where
ownership of individual units still remained hotly contested between the original
occupants displaced through ethnic cleansing during the war, and current occupants, who
might themselves be refugees from other parts of BiH. Into this extremely complex and
tense situation, the project injected a framework to begin the settlement of outstanding
ownership issues -     one of the toughest to resolve in post-conflict BiH. It even led to
preparations for the sale of the publicly owned housing stock to residents. As agreed,
internal repairs and rehabilitation to the apartments themselves were left to the occupants
at their own expense. Despite the wording of the project objective, the quantity of the
housing stock remained unchanged becausethe project did not foresee construction of
new dwelling units. Since housing was just one component competing for funds among
several sectors, its total impact was limited. Even so, the results achieved by the RS
Reconstruction project's housing component can be judged a success,albeit on a very
small scale in relation to the total needs.

3.24     Very good project results were achieved in terms of restoring water, sanitation,
and solid waste services and the electricity supply in RS. In classic reconstruction mode,
in which the Bank can bring its core experience to bear, the project helped the
rehabilitation and reconstruction of water networks, water treatment plants, electricity
sub-stations, and power lines across some 26 RS municipalities. A few, such as Prijedor
and Srebenica, were blacklisted by OHR for failing to implement refugee return
provisions of the peace settlement, and therefore excluded from the project. The
rehabilitation of the war-damaged water treatment plant at Nevesinje in eastern RS
benefited the town's 18,000 inhabitants. Network restoration in Bijeljina even lowered
unaccounted-for water to below pre-war levels thanks to better billing and collection
arrangements introduced under the project. Power network improvements to many towns,
including the RS capital Banja Luka, ended the frequent blackouts of the immediate
postwar period. More reliable electricity allowed more rigorous billing, enabling RS
utilities to report profits on their operations from 2000 onwards. The elimination of
electricity theft, which had reached 13 percent of all production during the war, also
helped. Since BiH's power grid straddled the frontiers of the postwar partition, RS energy
sector collaboration with counterparts in Fed-BiH was unavoidable, but pursued in a
constructive spirit, with much learning from Fed-BiH's earlier experience. Altogether,
the results of this component of the RS Reconstruction project were highly satisfactory.

3.25     In part, the achievements were due to very capable teams and management of the
PIU in Banja Luka, which in turn was overseen by a PMAU unit, itself modeled upon the
earlier experience of the ERP in Fed-BiH. RS staff were systematically trained in Bank
procurement guidelines in particular. For the RS Reconstruction Project, the very high
caliber achieved by local RS staff meant that far less had to be spent on foreign technical
assistancethan foreseen at appraisal. Excellence of project management, nevertheless,
may have incurred the price of isolating the PIU of this project (and others too) from
mainstream public administration in RS. Officials in the mainstream told the OED
mission that they believed that projects such as the RS Reconstruction were really Bank
operations, run by enclave PIUS who answered more to the Bank than to the RS
government. Clearly, more has to be done to deepen and broaden local ownership, even
of a successful operation such as this one.



40       Conclusions        and Lessons

Ratings

41       Emergency Recovery Project: Overall, ERP's objectives were substantially
&want      to both BiH's own reconstruction needsand policy and to the Bank's own
strategy in support of post-conflict recovery. The relevance rating would have been
higher had it not been for ERP's fourth humanitarian objective, which was only modestly
relevant to BiH's reconstruction. Ef~c~cy in achieving those objectives was substantial,
as was efficiertcy, especially given that far fewer resources were mobilized than expected.
The overall outcome of the project is therefore rated satisfactory since it did achieve its
objectives, albeit with minor shortcomings, especially with respect to restoring

                                                 19


government institutional capacity and the control of the emergency cash payouts to the
needy. S~stai~abiZity is rated likely, thanks to the operational skill and attention devoted
to the repaired infrastructure and the ongoing management of the enterprise credit line
portfolio. I~stit~ti~~aZ development impart is rated as modest; gains in procurement
management, for instance, were substantial, but otherwise efficient governance of
infrastructure in BiH is still some way off. Bank performance is rated satisfactory,
thanks to the expeditious design and preparation of a first operation in the country that
became substantially relevant. Borrowerperformance            too is rated satisfactory especially
in view of the excellent work done by the PIU.

42.     Emergency La~dmi~es Clearance Project: The project objectives were modestly
relevant to BiH's post-conflict recovery program. Both efficacy and efficiency in
achieving the objectives were negligible; project objectives were not met, yet substantial
costs were incurred. Since this project not only failed to achieve its development
objectives but also contributed to greater senseof vulnerability and fear of landmines in
BiH, its overall outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory. The project's sustairtability is
rated highly unlikely becausethe project approach's technical resilience is very weak
and near total dependenceupon donor funding (which is drying up) makes financial
resilience negligible. Institutional   development impact is rated as negligible, owing to
the project's failure to find ways of effectively using resources for demining that protects
vulnerable groups and helps BiH's post-conflict reconstruction and development. Bank
perfurmance is rated highly unsatisfactory;       inexperience led to a flawed basic design
concept -     that, at the national level, demining must precede economic recovery -        and
Bank supervision unduly focused upon contract unit costs which lost sight of project
objectives. Borrower performance is also rated highly unsatisfactory, especially during
implementation, when serious conflicts of interest and fraudulent use of resources,
contributed to the project's failure.

43      Emergeizcy Dem~bili~ati~~ and Reintegration Pruject: For a country in an
emergency post-conflict situation the project objectives were modestly relevant; they
emphasized longer-term goals too much, even though they neglected demobilization
itself. Efficacy in achieving the relevant objectives was modest, through the effective
support the project gave to reintegrating demobilized combatants, albeit on a small scale
and fewer than targeted. On the other hand, efficiency is rated substantial thanks to
project costs per beneficiary than were lower than expected. Since the project achieved
most of its objectives, but its relevance was constrained by its scale, focus, and by a
component that did not fit (LMI), its overall outcome is rated as moderately
satisfactory. Project s~stai~abili~     is rated as likely, although the outlook for future labor
demand in BiH is uncertain. OED ratesthe project's i~stit~ti~~al          development impact as
modest, as it did help increase BiH's effective use of labor resources, but to a limited
extent only. Despite the lack of focus of some objectives and components upon
emergency reconstruction needs,Ba~kperf~rma~ce              is rated satisfactory, given the
highly effective Bank supervision that ensued.B~rr~werperf~rma~~e              is also rated
satisfactory, especially in view of the solid work done by the PIUS during most of the
implementation.

                                               20


44      Local Initiatives Project: All three project objectives were highly relevant to the
post-conflict development needsand policies pursued in BiH, already more than a year
out of the war when this project began. Efficacy in achieving these objectives was high,
being exceeded in the case of the setting up the MC0 framework in particular. Efficiency
is rated high also, through benefiting the target population at a relatively low cost per
beneficiary. Hence, overall outcome is rated highly satisfactory since all objectives were
fully met and even exceeded in one case.Sust~i~~biZity is rated likely since demand for
micro-credit is likely to remain strong in BiH. Incipient commercial lending to MCOs
may gradually replace donor funding in the medium term. The institutional development
impact of this project is rated high, since it introduced an entirely new way of financing
small firms in BiH that made efficient use of the limited resources available. Bank
perfirmautce is rated highly satisfactory, especially during supervision conducted
mostly out of the Sarajevo office. OED rates borrowerperformance         as highly
satisfactory through the expedient work of the respective PIUS and the effective working
relationship they established with the MCOs.

45.     Republika Srpska Reconstruction Assistance Project: For the most part, the
objectives of this project were substantially   relevant to Entity and Bank recovery
policies for RS. Since most of its objectives were achieved, efficacy is judged to be
substantial. Efficiency in achieving those objectives is rated substantial, thanks to
lower-than-expected unit costs of infrastructure reconstruction works. Since the project
achieved most of its major relevant objectives, the overall outcome is rated satisfactory;
shortcomings of the agriculture and housing components were minor and outweighed by
excellent results from infrastructure reconstruction. Sust~i~~biZi~ is rated likely, helped
by cost recovery achieved through the power component and modest steps taken toward
long-term solutions for housing's legal framework in RS. The i~stituti~~~l     development
impact of this project is rated modest as there were important but limited stepsto enable
resources in the power, water, and housing sectors of RS to be used more effectively.
Bankperformance,      relying heavily upon the Sarajevo office, was satisfactory
throughout. Borrower performance also was satisfactory, thanks especially to the
technical competence and effectiveness of the PIU team in Banja Luka.


Lessons

    *   Even in very complex post-conflict situations, traditional Bank assistance in
        rehabilitating infrastructure and restarting business credit can yield very
        worthwhile results for the recovery of the war-affected borrower.


    l   The Bank should avoid involvement in activities beyond its core competence.
        Inexperience and lack of familiarity - with landmine clearance, for example - are
        ingredients for failure.


    l   Designs of projects that rely on PIUS for implementation can make for speedy
        disbursements, but should always include exit strategiesto help governments
        move toward normal operations.

11. For this evaluation, OED identified the following project expenditures: IDA -                              US$7.1 m,; United
States -       US$Mm.;           Italy -   US$3.8m.; Canada -           US$~.6m.; Netherlands -           US 2.7m.; for atotal of
US$l6.7m.          Although the ICR reports final total costs of US$67.0m., this figure includes significant
amounts from the U.S.A. managed by the Slovenian International Trust Fund for Demining, from the EU
managed by BiH's Civil Protection authorities, the United Nations managed directly through its own
agencies, as well as other (unspecified donors). In addition, the ICR reports significant unfunded needs as
part of the final costs. For these reasons, OED believes the lower estimate to be a more accurate reflection
of the situation at project closing.
