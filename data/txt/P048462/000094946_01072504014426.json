outcome of the project is\n            rated as satisfactory, while project sustainability is rated\n            as borderline \"likely.\" Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. These\n            are some of the lesson learned: Grant, not credit, finance\n            should be considered for initial social assistance in\n            agriculture in post-conflict situations. In agriculture,\n            attention to project design and implementation should always\n            be given to linkages among producers, processors, and\n            markets even if the project has social assistance\n            objectives. In all sectors, greater development impacts\n            might have been achieved with complementary investments in\n            technical assistance and more focus on institutional\n            strengthening. For example, provision of resources to\n            farmers would have benefited from accompanying technical\n            support, in the form of professional advice to farmers on\n            such issues as animal nutrition and husbandry, and machinery\n            use. In the housing sector, more consideration might have\n            been given to occupancy issues, given their\n            sensitivity--i.e., the design of the project meant that the\n            Bank had little leverage over municipalities in the case\n            that they obstructed return of original residents to their\n            homes. This raises the issue of the degree to which the Bank\n            can make use of non-economic conditionality to support\n            social reconciliation in post-conflict situations. Reliance\n            on local counterparts for project management and\n            implementation strengthens institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
