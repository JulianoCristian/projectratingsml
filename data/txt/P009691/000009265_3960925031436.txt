(Credit 502-IN)
This is a project completion report (PCR) for the Rajasthan Canal
Command Area Development Project (Credit 502-IN) in India for which a credit
of US$83.0 million was extended to the Government of India in July 1974. The
credit closing date was extended twice by one year each to June 30, 1983.
The credit was fully disbursed by January 6, 1984.
Information sources used for the PCR include the Rajasthan Canal
Project I appraisal report (Reporr. No. 447-IN); the draft PCR prepared by the
Government of Rajasthan (GOR); supervision reports and correspondence files.
A specific field trip in connection with the PCR was not made.

INDIA
RAJASTHAN CANAL COMMAN) AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 502-IN)
EVALUATION 8UMMARY
Introduction
1.      The Rajasthan Canal Command Area Development Project (RCP I) vas the
first IDA-assisted ^ommand area development project in India and the first
project in whicb lining of the irrigation systems to the individual farm
boundary was introduced. The project is unique in its opening up desert
lands for cultivation.
Objectives
2.      The project covered 244,000 ha of Cultivable Comand Area (CCA).  The
main objective was to provide for improved irrigation facilities and roads,
land development works, and sapporting agricultural services but institu-
tional strengthening was also an important objective. Project cost was
estimated at Re 1,392 N (US$174 M) and an IDA credit of US$83 M was made.
Land development works were to be financed through institutional credit. The
credit became effective at the end of 1974 and its closing date was June 30,
1981.
Implementation Experience
3.      Progress on most project components was satisfactory.  Actual total
project cost was about Rs 1,469 M, about 6% more than the appr&isal
estimates. The physical appraisal targets were achieved by June 30, 1983,
except for watercourse lining. This component suffered mainly from shortage
of key construction materials like coal and cement and from the sharp
increases in cost of implementing this work. Landshaping and leveling were
largely done by the farmers themselves without resorting to institutional
credit. Original targets of canal lining, roads, afforestation and village
water supply components were achieved.
4.      Disbursements of credit funds lagged behind appraisal estimates
throughout project implementation. The slow disbursement was mainly due to
delays of watercourse lining arising from the shortage of construction
materials and adequate funding. The credit was fully disbusred by January 6,
1984.
5.      Under the project, Command Area Development Water Utilization
Department (CAD & 'WU) at state level and Command Area Authority (CAA) at the



-iv-
project level have been created. Although, initially, there were some delays
in positioning the staff, CAM has developed into one of the strong command
area organization in India. The Rajasthan land Development Corporation
(RLDC) was established in 1974 to ensure smooth flow of institutional credit
for the works of on-farm development (OFD), and their performance has been
steadily improving. The project reorganized and strengthened agricultural
extension services in five of 26 administrative districts in the state, based
on Training and Visit (T&V) methodology.
Results
6.      It is estimated that as a result of project works, the net irrigated
area increased by about 109,000 ha. The water management system in the
project area--warabandi--is among the best in India and ensures a reliable
and equitable water supply to farmers. An estimated 33,000 farm families
benefitted directly from irrigation and safe drinking water supply. In
addition, all-weather access to villags faciliates flow of modern inputs and
crop marketing service in the project area. Estimated production increases
are about 200,000 tons of foodgrains about 76,000 tons of cotton, about
44,000 tons of pulses and 34,000 tons of oilseeds. The actual economic rate
of return (ERR) is estimated at 30X compared with appraisal estimate of 251.
Sustainabilitv
7.      Given that the water management system is among the best in India and
that substantial institutional development has taken place, sustainability
seems to be assured (and this could be tested five years hence through an
impact evaluation). Also some of the lessons and findings have been incor-
porated in the Bank executed IFAD financed second phase project (see basic
data sheet).
Findinftl and Iessons
8.      The project was successful, achieved most of its targets and has
contributed to agricultural development in the state.
9.      Other lessons include:
-   early start of the second phase project delayed completion of the
first phase project (PCR para. 8.04);
-   complicated credit procedures had to be simplified considerably (PCR
paras 8.01-8.03); and
-   whatever the credit procedures they cannot resolve the inequity of
benefits which make it vulnerable to poor recovery (PCR para 8.03).

RAJASTHAN CANAL COMMAND AREA DEVELOPNENT PROMECT
I.   NTRODCTION
Background
1.01    Rajasthan is the second laigest state in India, with an area of 34 M
ha but with only 75 people per km compared to an Indian average of 178 per
km . It is one of the least densely populated states in India with a popula-
tion of about 34.3 M (1981), of whom 802 are rural. The northwestern part of
the state is arid, with annual rainfall less then 300 tm, and drains towards
the Indus River. The southeastern part, with annual rainfalls of 800 to
950 mm, is semi-aria and drains mostly to the Chambal River and then to the
Ganges system.
1.02    About 372 (13 M ha) of the state is desert, and is largely uncul-
tivated.  Forests cover 1 M and 14.3 M ha are under rainfed crops, mainly
millet, sorghum and gram. About 2.1 M ha are irrigated, 55X from dug wells,
35X from public canal systems and 101 from tanks. Irrigated crops include
paddy, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, oilseeds, millet, pulses, and fruits and
vegetables. The desert is among the harshest environments in India. Intense
heat and sandatorms make the area difficult for any form of permanent settle-
ment without irrigation, afforestation, and roads. Rowever, several large
irrigation schemes, notably the Rajasthan Canal Project (RCP), which the
project discussed in this PCR (the Rajasthan Canal Command Area Development
Project, Cr. 502-IN) is part of, are opening up desert lands for cultivation.
1.03    The RCP, a long-term program for development of the northeastern part
of the Rajasthan desert, is located along the border with Pakistan and is one
of the largest irrigation projects in India. It was initiated following the
Indus Water Treaty, which establisbed the division of waters between India
and Pakistan. The project was designed to irrigate about 1.15 M ha of cul-
tivable command area (CCA) and receives its share sf the Indus water through
a lined canal having a discharge capacity of 530 m /sec. The development of
the RCP area is divided into two stages:
State I - comprising 540,000 ha of the northeastern area
incorporating Phase I - 244,000 ha, the project
discussed in this project completion report (PCR);
and Phase 2 - 296,000 ha, including 50,000 ha of
area unallocated to projects; and
State II - covering 610,000 ha of the southwestern area.
1.04    In 1977, GOI requested the International Fund for Agriculture
Development (IPAD) assistance in financing the second phase of development
works (about 246,000 ha) in the first stage of RCP (RCP II). This follow-on
project was appraised in 1978 by the Bank on behalf of IFAD. The main

investment components of the Rajasthan Command Area and Settlement Project
(IFAD LT. 32-IN) are the same as RCP I. The project incorporated lessons
frow RCP I.
1.05    Infotmation sources used for the PCR include the RCP I appraisal
report (Report ?Io. 447-IN); the draft PCR prepared by the GOR; supervision
reports and correspondence files. A specific field trip in connection with
the PCR was not made.
Identification. Preparation and Avpraisal
1.06    The soils and water management aspects of irrigation development in
the RCP area were studied by a UNDP/FAO team between 1966 and 1971. Many of
the results obtained in that study, particularly the soil surveys, were used
in formulating the project. The project was prepared by the Government of
Rajasthan (GOR) and presented in a feasibility report dated May 1971. In
November 1972, a Bank Group irrigation reconnaissance mission visited India
to review the need for command area development (CAD). The FAD/IBRD coopera-
tive program was asked to assist in the further preparation of the Rajasthan
Canal Command Area Development Project 1j. The project was appraised in
November 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington, May 24-28, 1974. Board
presentation took place July 16, 1974, and the credit became effective Decem-
ber 30, 1974.
II. THE PROJECT AT APPRAISAL
The Proiect Area
2.01    The project, located in the northern desert region of Rajasthan
state, is part of Stage I of the ongoing RCP (para L 03). The agroclimatic
conditions in that area are difficult. Intense heat and violent sandstorms
make the area difficult for any form of permanent settlement without water
for irrigation dcvelopment, large scale afforestation and the leaching of the
saline soils. Initially, the project area covered about 200,000 ha of
irrigable land in two blocks within Stage I of RCP. In 1982, an additional
area of some 44,000 ha was added to the project at the request of GOR (para
3.02). The area developed for irrigation was being settled by landless
farmers from nearby areas in uniform farm units of 6.32 ha. Settlers were
charged an average of Rs 29,000 per unit repayable over 15 years without
interest. At appraisal, it was estimated that about 17,000 farm families had
been settled on irrigated areas. Cropping intensity at appraisal was

Proiect Description
2.02    The project included the following components:
(a)  Land develoDment.  Leveling and shaping of some 58,000 ha of sand
dunes for irrigation of which 26,000 ha was to be leveled by the
farmers and 32,000 ha by the GOR. Reclamation of some 17,000 ha
of the seriously affected saline soils was to be undertaken by
GOR, using heavy equipment; additional 17,000 ha of less seriously
affected saline soils were to be reclaimed by the farmers, using
their own equipment. Lining of some 5,800 km of watercourses in
the command area of about 200,000 ha 1/ was to be carried out
concurrently with land leveling;
(b)  Linin_ of the canal system.  Lining a total of 915 km I/ of canals
to increase canal carrying capacities a-d reduce seepage and
operational losses;
(c)  Afforestation and-Stabilization.  About 5,700 km of canals and
roads to be provided with shelter belts to stop windblown sand from
clogging and covering them; some 35,000 ha of high sand dunes
bordering the irrigated land to be stabilized and planted with
shrubs and grasses; establishment of 1,800 ha or irrigated village
firewood plantations;
I/ At the request of GOR, appraisal target of 200,000 ha watercourse lining
was revised in 1982 to include additional 15,000 ha in the extended area.
2/ At the request of GOR, a work plan for the canal lining was revised in
June 1983 to include additional 400 km of minors and small dis-
tributaries.



-4-
(d)  Roads.  Construction of 431 km of major market, feeder and village
roads;
(e)  Domestic water suply,.  Construction of filtered and disinfected
water supply units in 100 villages;j/
(f) ejtilite-ri. Provision for import of 46,000 nutrient tons of
fertilizers to offset soil fertility loss caused by land leveling;
and
(g)  Other comgonents.  Provision of vehicles and equipment for project
administration, construction of the force account portions of the
work, and for agricultural supporting services. Financial provisions
for project administration, extension services, and the O&M of the
physical facilities during the project implementation.
Cost Estimate
2.03    Total project cost was estimated at US$174 N with a foreign exchange
component of Us$47.1 M, 27% of total project cost. Project implementation
was to take place over six years and be completed by June 30, 1980.
Financinn
2.04    The IDA credit of US$83 M amounted to 48% of the total cost, financ-
ing the foreign exchange costs and about 28X of the local cost. GOR/GOI was
to contribute the balance (US$ 91 M equivalent). GOR was to finance canal
lining, village water supply, roads, and afforestation. Fertilizer purchases
was to be financed directly by the credit. On-farm works was to be financed
mainly by the farmers, using credit funds provided by the commercial banks
which were to be refinanced by the Agricultural Refinance and Development
Corporation (ARDC) _/. Disbursements for on-farm works were to be made
against ARDC refinance of the participating banks. The credit was expected
to be disbursed by June 30, 1981.
jj In 1982, 15 more villages were added to the appraisal target of 100
villages in the extended area.

Procurement
2.05    As it was neither feasible nor economic to combine categories of
civil works into contracts sufficiently large to attract international com-
petitive bidding (ICB), civil works, (canal lining, roads, village water
supply, OFD works) were to be carried out by local contractors following
local competitive bidding procedures, or when the use of machinery was
required, through force account. Fertilizer procurement was to be combined
with the regular bulk fertilizer procurement by the GOI's India Tender Board
based on ICB. Out of US10.2 X, estimated for vehicles and equipment,
US$6.3 M was to be procured through ICB. About US$1.0 X worth of equipment
and vehicles, consisting of groups of contracts costing less than US$100,000
each, was to be purchased through normal GOR procurement procedures. The
balance of US$2.9 M, consisting of field vehicles were to be reservea for
local procurement and were not eligible for reimbursement out of the proceeds
of the credit.
Beuefits
2.06    Upon completion, the project was to provide year-round irrigation to
200,000 ha 1J, including 92,000 ha of new land developed under the project.
It was anticipated that at full development (1989), the incremental produc-
tion resulting from the project would amount to about 238,000 tons of
foodgrains, 12,000 tons of pulses, 92,000 tous of seed cotton and 460,000
tons of fodder. The cropping intensity in the project area was to increase
from 90% at appraisal to 130X at full development. Farm employment was to
increase by about 21 M mandays a year. The project was to improve the income
of about 33,000 farm families by Rs 11,200 over a tea-year period and gener-
ate about 70,000 farm jobs. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the
project was estimated at 25%.
III.  PROJECT IMPLEM NKATION
General
3.01    During its iuitial period, project implementation was delayed by (i)
slow organizational build-up; (ii) insufficient fund allocations (para 3.05);
and (iii) shortage of construction materials (para 3.03). These problems
were gradually overccnme but the project implementation period had to be
extended by three yearo frJm June 1980 to June 1983.
V Increased in 1982 to 244,000 ha.

f/ Of the revised CCA of 244,000 ha, only 215,000 ha was planned for lining.
The above data indicate that the project achieved most of its investment
targets. As a result of project works, about 1,300 km of canals have been
lined (table 2), the canal irrigated area increased from 108,000 ha in
1974/75 to about 244,000 ha in 1983/84 (compared to 200,000 ha targetted at
appraisal). All weather rural road network increased by 425 km (para 3.09).
The targets for efforestation (para 3.08) and village water supply (para
3.11) were achieved.
3.03   Watercourse Linin2.  Acute shortage of coal 1/ and cement throughout
the implementation period of the project constrained the progress of civil
works, particularly canal and watercourse lining. During the implementation
period (1974-1983), average supply of coal was only 46% of the demand and the
average supply of cement was only 602 of the demand (table 3). In 1979, for
¶xample, the project received only 6,500 tons of coal against an annual
requirement of 83,000 tons. These shortages were largely a result of a
country-wide shortage and railway transport difficulties, problems which
could not be resolved by GOR alone. To correct the situation, GOI and GOR
convened in March 1981, a high level review meeting to search the steps to be
taken for improving the supply of coal and cement. At the time the meeting
was held, only about 116,000 ha or 582 had been lined out of the target area

lining.



-7-
of 200,000 ha. Following that meeting, there were some improvements, though
some material shortages (especially coal) persisted.
3.04    An issue encountered during the implementation of watercourse lining
were GOR attempts to offset the rising cost of watercourse construction by
reducing the extent of lining.l/ The issue was raised in 1976 2/ and 1981.
In July 1981, a government order was actually issued limiting the extent of
lining to 75% of the length of watercourses. The Bank's response was to
express its concern that there was insufficient evidence which would justify
reduction of watercourse lining and that such a measure would effectively
reduce water availability for the RCP II area. The Bank also indicated that
the increased costs and labor inputs of operating and maintaining an unlined
watercourse and the social impact on tailend farmers who share in the costs
in lining but receive their water supply through an earthen channel needs to
be determined. The Bank indicated that any unilateral decision by GOR to
reduce the watercourse lining would not be acceptable and that disbursements
would uot be made against partially lined watercourses. The Bank provided,
however, guidelines for a detailed analytical study of 75% vs 100% lining of
watercourses to be undertaken by GOR. The studies were carried out but not
in time to effect Phase I. The main reason was that observations of irriga-
tion in partially lined watercourses indicated that partial lining was not a
viable alternative for the sandy soils of RCP. In June 1982, the GOR decided
to retain to lining the full length of the watercourses.
3.05    Finance for watercourse lining was provided by commercial banks (CB)
which were to be refinanced by the Agricultural Refinance and Development
Corporation (ARDC). Works on the land of farmers ineligible for commercial
credit was to be financed from a Special Loan Account (SLA) established by
ARDC, GOR and GOI and managed by ARDC. The Rajasthan Land Development
Corporation (RLDC, para 4.02) provided interim finance to the construction
authorities (CAD) for execution of OFD works and assisted the CB with collec-
tion and screening of individual loan applications. The watercourses, which
are located along farm boundaries are a communal investment. The cost of
lining was to be levied equally on every ha of the chak CCA and each farmer's
share is proportional to the size of his farm. However, the charge was to be
based on a calculation of the actual cost of lining for each outlet.
1/ GOR reported that the cost of 100% watercourse l ning increased from
Rs 1,150 per ha in 1976 to Rs 2,350 per ha in 1981 mainly due to higher
prices of labor, transport, coal and cement. Lining of 75% of the
watercourses was estimated at Rs 1,990 per ha.
2/ By the Chief Engineer. The Bank disagreed and indicated that there was
insufficient data to justify such a proposal.



-8-
However, due to chronic accounting backlogs at CAA, this delayed determina-
tion of the actual loan amount for farmers. For example, although lining of
watercourses in a number of chaks was completed in 1977, many of the farmers
concerned were not informed of the exact amount of their loans for some
years.l/ Furthermore, RLDC could not receive from the Banks full reimbursement
of the funds it advanced before the accounts for the respective works were
finalized. This resulted in increasing burden on its resources. This was an
undesirable situation which could create serious difficulties at loan
recovery time. Consequently, the Bank recommended in 1981 that finance of
watercourse lining be organized according to the "Haryana Model" (para 8.02).
3.06    Land ShaDina.  At appraisal, it was estimated that about 58,000 ha
of sandy soils would require landshaping and leveling, of which 26,000 ha
were to be leveled by farmers without project assistance and 32,000 ha were
to be done by the Command Area Authority (CAA). However, at an early stage,
it became clear that due to the relative ease of the work, and the fact that
farmers could immediately irrigate their entire farm (6 ha), most of them
prepared to landscape on their own. Consequently, this component was reduced
from 58,000 ha to 14,000 ha. However, as seen in the following table, area
covered by landshaping from all sources was at completion higher than expec-
tations and reached about 52% of total appraisal estimate.

3.07    Soil Reclamation.  At appraisal, it was estimated that about 34,000
ha of flood plain soils were afflicted by moderate to severe salinity, of
which about 17,000 ha was seriously affected requiring reclamation. The
Agricultural Extension Wing of the CAA recommended the following practices
for the reclamation of soils: (i) addition of sand and deep plowing; (ii)
green manuring; (iii) application of gypsum; (iv) flooding and leaching; and
(v) addition of farm yard manure. The farmers having medium soils adopted
leaching and addition of sand while the farmers having fine soils carried
out deep plowing, leaching, green manuring and adding farm yard manure.
These methods were reported to be successful. The reclamation work was
carried out at farmer's cost. Out of 34,000 ha needing reclamation, about
32,000 ha have been reclaimed. It is noted that there is no systematic
method of monitoring the results of reclamation.2/ Salinity could reappear
after a few years unless long term control is exercised. A periodic soil
testing program of each chak should be carried out to check on the soil
health after reclamation treatment.

3.08    AffoMe&tagign.  The plantation works along 220 km of roadside, 5,500
km of canalside, 1,800 ha of village firewood, and the development of 35,000
ha pasture were carried out according to the plan. Pasture planning lagged
initially but soon recovered its pace.
3.09    Bads.  Construction of roads was satisfactory in all respects except
for the initial delays which are directly attributable to lack of coal for
brick manufacture.  As a result, the w,rk was delayed by a year from the
estimated time of completion. The project constructed 425 km of district and
village roads against 431 km of appraisal target. To facilitate the con-
struction of roads in later years, Public Works Department (PWD) used
imported stone to replace brick on the unfinished sections of road for soling
and hard shoulders. As result of the project, a reasonable provision of road
.-cess has been achieved, serving almost all parts of the project area, and
vAthout which development of the irrigation potential would have been
impossible.
3.10    Encroachment onto the road reserve took place in a number of places.
There were two forms of encroachment. In the first, farmers who have not yet
been paid compensation for land surrendered by them for road construction,
continued to cultivate these areas. To overcome this difficulty, GOR
strengthened the staff of the land acquisition office to speed up compensa-
tion payments. The second form of encroachment was the construction of shops
and other buildings close to the edge of the road pavement. The Bank
expressed its concern demanding to stop the road encroachment, which endanger
road users and cause serious congestions. However, although GOR has the
necessary powers to evict the offenders, the problem appears to be politi-
cally sensitive and no adequate actions have been taken../
3.11    VillAge Water SuRply.  All of the 115 village water supply units were
installed as planned. After installation of the facilities by PWD, the units
were handed over to the village panchayats, who are to operate and maintain
these facilities with technical assistance from the PWD, However, the 7il-
lage panchayats were not able to maintain the units due to financial con-
straints.  Some of the completed witer supply units became inoperable due
to shortage of filter material insertion and other minor deficiencies.2/ For
example, IDA's supervision report of December 1981 pointed out that out of
the 96 completed, 15 units were inoperable. In order to improve O&M, GOR has
transferred the responsibility for providing periodic maintenance and sup-
plies to the Public Health Engineering Department (PRED). PHED now plans to
establish one division with three or four sub-divisions to be located within
the command area. The task of these units is not only to take over the
responsibilities of supervising, operating and maintaining all new systems
installed under the project, but also all existing village water system in
the command areas.

A detailed breakdown of the actual project expenditures by year against the
appraisal estimate is presented in table 4. The higher than estimated
exchange rate of US dollars to rupees and the lower than estimated contingen-
cies provided the project with substantially more rupee funds than that
estimated at appraisal and enabled to finance a larger volume of physical
works.
Disbursement
3.13    Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates throughout project
implementation (see comparison in table 5). This was attributed to the
following factors: (i) acute shortage of cement and coal during most of
implementation of the project did not permit rapid progress on civil works
and the expenditures remained low; (ii) lower than expected price and physi-
cal contingencies; and (iii) land shaping and land reclaation were not
carried out as a pre`ect cost as anticipated during appraisal but at farmer's
expense. The credit was fully disbursed by January 6, 1984, compared with
the original credit closing date of June 30, 1981. 1/

IV. INSTITUTIONAL P3RFORM&NCE
Proiect Imvlementation
4.01    Since the project was to be the first in a series of similar CAD
projects, there had been concerns both at central and state levels to devise
organizational arrangements which can be duplicated in other projects. In
1975, GOR created a Command Area Development and Water Utilization Department
(CAD & WU) at state level and CAA at the project level. The CAD & WU, headed
by a secretary, was guided on policy matters by a coordination committee for
CAD chaired by the chief minister. The CAA is headed by an Area Development
Commissioner (ADC) who has been vested with the powers of chief engincr
(irrigation), director of agriculture, revenue commissioner and registrar
of cooperative societies. The ADC has been supported by four departments:
agriculture, irrigation and land development, town planning and cooperatives,
public works and forest. Although there were some delays in drawing staff
from the concerned departments to implement the project, the CAA has
developed into one of the stronger command area organization in India.
Raiasthan Land Development CorroratLion
4.02    Under the project, the Rajasthan Land Development Corporation (RLDC)
was established in 1974 to: (i) undertake programs of OFD works;
(ii) operate as an agency for financing these programs; and (iii) recover
the amounts spent on development programs from the land owners. RLDC advan-
ces funds to ID and obtains credit from participating banks on behalf of the
farmers. It also screens farmers' loan applications on behalf of the CB and
facilitates an uninterrupted flow of funds for finance of OFD works.
However, RLDC did not received an adequate return for its services. The

the following year. However, GOR may have had difficulties in providing
these estimates, since these are considered confidential prior to
approval by the legislature.

interim finance it provided was interest free and it did not receive any
return for its services to the CB.  Moreover, as indicated (para 3.05),
accounting backlogs at CAA delayed disbursements by the Banks for completed
works. As a result, RLDC's financial situation has aeteriorated. In
1977/78, it suffered a financial loss of Re 1.4 M and a further loss accrued
also in 1978/79. RLDC did not have sufficient staff for adequate technical
screening of OFD plans and for supervision, but at the same time, some of its
functions were duplicated ty other agencies. Under RCP II, GOR undertook a
systematic assessment of RLDC's functions and certain improvements were
introduced.
Agricultural Extension Service
4.03    Under the project the Training and Visit (T&V) extension system was
introduced thoughout the project area. After two years of successful
experience, the GOR decided to spread this approach to other districts so as
to bring benefits to a much larger proportion of the state's farming popula-
tion. The Rajasthan Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Cr. 737-IN)
was appraised in October 1976, and became effective on February 6, 1978.
Since then, the project's extension functions have been integrated into the
state-wide extension network. The extension activities in the RCP area are
under the control of CAA but the Department of Agriculture is responsible
for implementing the T&V system. The project extension services are effec-
tive, comprising five district extension officers (DEO), 15 subject matter
specialists (SMS), 50 agricultural extension officers (AMO) and 327 village
extension workers (VEW). Extension staff ratio in the RCP area is generally
based on one VEW per about 1,000-1,200 ha, one AXO per about 7 VEWs, one DBO
per 6 AEOs, and one team of two SMS for about 47 VEWs, which is considered
adequate. Presently, many of the VEWs serve only about 160-180 farm families
and their activilies have been very satisfactory. During the appraisal of
the RCP 11 in 1979, it was felt that more SMS for teaching water management
be required and provisions for that were included in that project.
Water Management
4.04    Water management in RCP follows the Warabundi system which is
dominant in Northwest India. According to this system, each farmer is allo-
cated the same amount of water per ha of CC&. The water is delivered at the
same day and hour and these are predetermined for a period of 12 months.
Warabundi has been introduced to all the areas brought under irrigation in
RCP.
Cost Recovery
4.05    The Project Agreements stipulated that GOR would establish a commit-
tee to recommend arrangements for the recovery of project costs. The commit-
tee was established in March 1978. It recommended that Rs 2,950 per ha be
recovered fron the beneficiaries over 30 years at 12% interest. This amount



-13-
represents the actual investment cost of canal lining, village water supply
and 0&M costs during the implementation period. Investment cost excluded
from the calculation are: (i) OFD expenditures as this cost is actually a
loan to be recovered directly from the farmers; (ii) afforestation costs,
as this cost is not directly attributable to the cultivators alone, and sale
of firewood would go to state revenue. The recovery of these costs over 30
years at 12% interest would require an annual repayment of about Rs 150 per
ha. The committee recommended that the repayment of investment cost of
Re 2,950 begin only after farmers have repaid the loan for the construction
of OFD works which means after 15 years from the receipt of their loans.
4.06    The Project Agreements also stipulated that GOR would levy qnd col-
lect water charges in amounts sufficient to cover O&M costs. The committee,
established in connection with the project cost reco-ery (para 4.05), also
carried out an 0&M cost study. They found that O&M cost at full development
was estimated at Rs 68 per ha. In Rajasthan, fixed water rates per ha are
charged for each crop. The rates, which were increased by 151 in 1979 and by
anothar 25% in 1982, range from Rs 35 per ha for bajra to Rs 72.5 per ha for
cotton. For a typical cropping pattern, the water charge averages about
Re 72 per ha per annum. Thus, these increases in water charges have been
adequate to cover O&M costs.
Accounts and Audits
4.07    The ID (for canal and watercourse lining), PWD (for roads) and Forest
Department (for afforestation), all maintained separate accounts on project
expenditures. Submission of the disbursement applications was centrally
coordinated by the Chief Accounts Officer. The required annual audit reports
submitted to IDA at a considerable delay and were incomplete. These reports
related to expenditures on tLe entire Ra.jasthan Canal Project including
operations financed entirely by GOR, anI were not IDA project specific.
Financial statements of expenditures ce?tified by the state accountant
general for the years from 1974/75 to 1978/79 were received in January 1984.
The statements for the years from 1979/80 to 1982/83 are still awaited.
V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
CropDed Area and Crog Yields
5.01    A farm survey unit was established under the project to assess the
project benefits. A benchmark agroeconomic survey of a random sample of RCP
I farmers was conducted in 1974, followed by annual sample surveys. The
sample siae has ranged from 200-500 cultivators. The surveys has covered the
following main subjects: cropping pattern, crop yields, fa-ming practices
and farm incomes. Yield estimates are based on crop cutting experiments.

The results of the surveys indicate a continuous improvement in crop inten-
sities, farming practices and yields since the project began. A comparison
of the cropped area changes in 1974/75 and 1982/83 is shown below:

The above data shovs that in the project CCA of about 244,000 ha, the total
cropped area has increased from about 155,000 ha in 1974/75 to 270,000 ha in
1982/83, an average annual rate of about 9% per year. During the same
period, the cotton area increased about three-fold and the wheat area nearly
tripled. The changes in irrigated area up to 74 km of the Rajasthan canal
area (CCA of about 383,700 ha), of which the RCP I forms a part, from 1974 to
1980 are shown in table 6.
5.02    The completion of OFD works, including lining of watercourses,
resulted in a considerable increase in irrigation intensity (table 7).
During 1980/81, the irrigation intensity in areas where lined watercourse had
been constructed was 134X as against only 83% in areas where unlined (or
partially lined) watercourses were operative.
5.03    A comparison between the crop yields in 1975/76 (beginning of
project) and 1982/83 is shown below:

Yields of major crops such as wheat and cotton have shown a markedly upward
trend (table 8). The increase in yields is attributeble to the shifting of
low yielding local varieties to high yielding varieties (both paddy and
wheat), increased use of fertilizers (para 5.05) and intensified extension
activities (para 4.03).
Agricultura-1 Production
5.04    Based o-n the expected future cropping patterns and yields levels, the
crop production is projected for the future with project in table 8 and

cottou 83X, groundnut 100%, mustard 77X and gram 75X. The supply of fer-
tilizer jj to the project area has increased almost six-fold from 1,500
jj As provided under the project, GOI procured fertilizers in the amount
of Rs 147.6 M. Fertilizer was procured to offset soil fertility loss
caused by land leveling. Although no detailed fertilizer aistribution
records were made available at the time this PCR is prepared, the project
authorities have indicated that the project received adequate amount of
fertilizer from GOI's fertilizer pool throughout the project period.

VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
6.01    The project ERR has been reassessed, taking into account the actual
implementation schedule, actual incurred costs, and present estimates of
agricultural benefits. Since the project components are interdependent (para
7.01) and are difficult to separate, the ERR was calculated for the whole
project. The cost streams include the economic cost of all civil works,
administration and engineering and incremental OEM costs. Basic assumptions
for the analysis are identical to those made for the appraisal of the
RCP II, the Rajasthan Command Area and Settlement Project (Report No.
2712-IN). Discounting cost and benefit streams over 50 years results in an
ERR of 28% compared with the appraisal estimate of 25%. The higher than
estimated at appraisal ERR is mainly a result of extending the project area
by about 18% without additional cost incurred. The cost and benefit streams
are presented in table 9.
VII.  THE BANK PERFORMANCE
AD1araisal
7.01    Overall the appraisal report outlined a well-balanced development
plan consisting of closely interdependent project components. For example,
watercourse lining reduces seepage and operational losses, provides more
reliable water supply and ensures equitable distribution of water within the
watercourse command and thus would increase the areas irrigated and crop
yields. However, without the provision of roads to reduce transport cost and
facilitate movements of inputs and marketable produce it would be impossible
to attain the level of production required to justify the investment in
watercourse lining. For appropriate functioning, the roads and the water



-17-
distribution network require good maintenance, which can be provided only if
they will be protected from dune invasion through the afforestation and dune
sta.'ilization program. The problems encountered with the implementation of
watercourse lining, land leveling, land shaping and land reclamation throulgh
institutional credit, could not have been foreseen at appraisal due to the
more limited data and experience available at that time.
Sui-ervision
7.02    Sixteen supervision missions visited the project at an average inter-
val of about six months. Since 1979, when the implementation of RCP II
picked-up its pace, supervisions of RCP I and RCP II have been carried out
concurrently. The size of a mission ranged from one to five and averaged
2.1. In addition, a number of special missions visited the project to
provide specific technical assistance. Following each mission, letters
summarizing the main findings and indicating corrective actions required were
sent to GOI and GOR.
7.03    During the later years of the implementation period, the supervisiou
missions were concerned primarily with reporting shortage of coal and cement
(para 3.03), slow disbursement of credit funds (para 3.13), reduced length
of watercourse lining (para 3.04). Supervision missions were very helpful
in persuading GOR to meet the need of coal and cement, in effectively com-
municating with the project staff and government officials to revert to full
lining of watercourses, and in expediting the disbursement of credit funds.
The Bank was flexible in adjusting appraisal targets. When it became clear
that the land development (land leveling, shaping, and reclamation) target
could not be achieved as designed, and that the allowauce for contingencies
and the savings incurred from this land development and others (para 3.13)
would not be fully utilized, the Bank agreed to GOI's proposal to increase
the project CCA by nearly 20% (para 3.02).
VIII, LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION
Finance of Watercourse Linin2
8.01    At the time of appraisal, GOI and the States (throughout India)
considered institutional credit a suitable way to finance the constructiou
of watercourses, without burdening the limited States' development resources.
In retrospect, it is clear that two main factors were not given sufficient
consideration: (i) the complex credit procedures and the need to obtain
agreements of the majority of farmers; and (ii) although the costs per ha
served were to be equal, the benefits were not, and for some of the farmers
(especially at the head of the watercourse) benefits were not sufficiently
higher than the costs to make it an attractive creuit undertaking.



-18-
8.02    Simplification of credit procedures can be achieved by using the
"Haryana Model" as following: (i) the credit is given by the banks to a
corporation responsible for construction (e.g. RLDC); (ii) the corporation
maintains individual account for each farmer and transfer these on completion
to a government revenue department for recovery; (iii) the reveaue department
pays the amount collected to the corporation and the latter repays to the
banks; and (iv) any deficit is covered by the government. This system has
been adopted by GOR for RCP areas since 1982.
8.03    While the above system simplifies credit procedures and transfer the
responsibility for recovery as well as the financial burden of poor
recoveries to the State government, it cannot resolve the inequity in
benefits which make it highly vulnerable to poor recovery. In fact, most of
the states now finance construction of watercourses from the development
budget. This would be the most suitable method of finance also in Rajasthan
Canal Project.
The TiiUai of Phase_II
8.04    A follow-up project, Rajasthan Command Area and Settlement Project
(IFAD Ln. 24) was appraised (by the Bank) and became effective before
Phase I was complete.  Although there was an understanding (unrecorded) that
Phase II work will not commence prior to the end of Phase I, GOR was under
pressure to initiate activities also under Phase II. This aggravated the
delay in completion of Phase I. In retrospect, it appears that the Bank
should have negotiated with GOI and IFAD a delay in the appraisal/start of
the Phase II project by two years.l/
C&1cluaioDs
8.05    The project was implemented successfully, achieved most of its
targets and has contributed to furthering the state's agricultural sectoral
policy objectives. While materials supply difficulties persisted throughout
the project implementation period, the volume of lining works achieved per
annum was among the largest in India. The quality of works was good.
Finally, the water management method used--warabundi-is among the best in
the country.

ment).
