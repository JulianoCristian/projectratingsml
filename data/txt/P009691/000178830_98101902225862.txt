INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
RAJASTHAN CANAL COMMAND AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of India for the equivalent of US$83
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for conmand area
development in the Rajasthan Canal region. The proceeds of the credit -
except for the part allocated to on-farm development (US$22.5 million) and for
fertilizer (US$18.7 million) - would be channelled to the Government of
Rajasthan in accordance with the Government of India's standard terms and
arrangements for the financing of State development projects. For on-farm
development, the Government of India would relend the proceeds of the credit
to the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) for 9 to 15 years at 6.25%
and 6.75% annual interest, respectively. ARC would in turn on-lend the funds
to the Rajasthan State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB) and to parti-
cipating commercial banks in the project area at not less than 7% annual
interest. LDB and the commercial banks would relend the funds to farmers at
an interest rate of not less than 9-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the
Government.  Governing a country diyided into more than 20 States with a
population of some 580 million and over 60 major languages is an extra-
ordinary responsibility. The country's poverty and poor natural resource
endowment, supplemented by a net transfer of external resources averaging
in recent years well below US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp
limitations on the rate of growth. Any judgment of India's economic per-
formance must take these underlying circumstances into account. So, also,
must account be taken of two massive uncertainties which overhang India.
The first is the availability of water. A bad monsoon, which is inevitable
from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy and
wipes out the results of years of effort. The second uncertainty is the
availability of external assistance. The vast majority of bilateral aid
is committed annually, usually several months after the start of the fiscal
year, and with considerable uncertainties about the level of commitments
and disbursements of particular donors.   Any delay in IDA replenishment



has an !±normous impact on aid flows. Together, these considerations severely
complicate planning and force a high degree of caution in foreign exchange
Tanagemcmnt.
In this perspective, the performance of the economy has been
.ar froni bad. In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly
4,°' per annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth
rate of less thar. 1% during the preceding 50 years. Population has also
grown f.ister in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income
lhas nevertheless risen from a more or less stagnant level in the fir--t nalf
of this century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year since
independience.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high
cost and has yielded results of variable quality; many industrial and agricul-
tural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others have taken
excessiviely long to be completed and have operated well below full capacity;
in some regions of the country growth and structural change have been rapid
and compare favorably with developments in many other parts of the world, but
in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly even decline. Despite
these i-nprovements and although the distribution of income in India is rela-
tively even by comparison with many other countries, there has been little
impact apon the living standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural
population. The Government has become increasingly concerned about the plight
of the lower income strata which, conservatively measured, consist of some
200 million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head per year, and
has initiated in recent years a variety of programs specifically designed
to alleviate poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42%
of national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years
previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has
increased only slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the composition
of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now
contributing about one-third each compared with an overwhelming preponderance
of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        One of India's most impressive achievements since the mid-1960s
has been the doubling of the average growth rate of productivity in foodgrain
production. This has been achieved primarily through the introduction of
new, high-yielding seed varieties and through complementary improvements in
farming practices. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to consolidate
the production growth in the wheat belt and to extend it both to other
areas cnd to other food grain crops, most particularly rice. Other crops
have, in most cases, shown a slow but fairly constant rate of productivity
increaEe. Irrigation has played a major part in agricultural growth and, by



-3-
reducing dependence on the monsoon, has reduced variability in performance.
For instance, the drought-induced decline in foodgrain output in 1972/73
was so:.c: ci', compared with a fall of almost 20% due to the drought in
the mid-1960s. At present only about half of the potentially irrigable areas
has been developed. Better utilization of the existing irrigation system
and the extension of the irrigated areas are, therefore, matters of the
highest priority in order to meet India's rising food needs and to protect
the economy against the vagaries of the weather. Land which cannot be
irrigated accounts for about 50% of the cultivable area; output from non-
irrigated land will thus remain important and substantial benefits remain
to be realized through technical change and investment.
8.        Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and to
some extent disappointing. Industrial growth averaged about 7% a year in
the 1950s, rose to 9% in the first half of the 1960s, but declined to some
5% through 1972 and in the past three years has been negligible. The slow
growth since the mid-1960s is especially worrying. To some extent it was
precipitated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the accompanying
general recession. But it has also been the result of many other factors:
the relatively limited opportunities for further import substitution which
had from the outset been at the center of the industrialization strategy;
the recurring and at times acute bottlenecks in the production of a number
of key intermediate goods such as power, steel, and cement; shortages of
imported raw materials; and cumbersome administrative procedures. In
the past year, the Government has made a number of important changes in the
regulations and administration of the industrial licensing system, and in
the recent budget for 1974/75 has made several tax concessions in order to
stimulate the private sector. There are one or two promising signs that
these measures may be having some effect, but it is too early to form a
balanced overall judgment.
9.        The gross domestic savings rate hastbeen in the region of 14%
for the past decade. While this compares favorably with other countries
having similarly low income levels, it has fallen far short of India's
resource needs. And although external assistance has been substantial in
absolute terms, in relation to national income it has been small, so that
the gross investment rate has reached as high as 17% in only a few years.
More recently, at a time of generally sluggish economic activity and also
because of a decline in foreign assistance, the gross investment rate has
been only about 14-15%.
10.       The economy has been passing through an unusually difficult
period in the past two years. On top of the stagnation of the industrial
sector, agricultural production was severely set back by the drought in
1972/73. Foodstocks have been depleted and there have been severe food
shortages in many parts of the country. Prices have risen to very high
levels and there has been considerable political unrest. Despite the
favorable monsoon in 1973 and the consequently good autumn harvest, as well
as large imports in 1973/74, the food position has remained tight. The
situation has been greatly aggravated by the withholding of grain from the
market for speculative and insurance reasons, reduced by the prevailing



- 4 -
climate of inflation and shortage, and by the growing realization that the
1974 spring harvest would fall short of earlier expectations. The crop
shortfall has been the result of acute shortages of fertilizer and of
electric power and diesel for irrigation pumpLng as well as poor winter
rains.  All these difficulties have meant tha: performance in the Fourth
Plan (1969/70-1973/74) has turned out well beiow the targets: an aggregate
growth rate of 3% per annum compared with the aim of 5.7%, with capacity, and
production achievements in all the major sectors falling far short of the
original goals. The growth rate of 5.5% in 1973/74 represented no more
than a recovery from the negative growth the previous year.
11.       Shortfalls in agricultural production, both of food crops and
crops used for industrial raw materials, have been a prime cause of the
inflation which has beset the country for the past two years. Prices have
gone up as a direct result of the imbalance between supply and demandl, and
also indirectly because of the massive budgetary outlays, and consequent
deficit financing, needed for drought relief, food subsidies, and crash
production programs. The acute shortages of many intermediate and industrial
commodities and, more recently, the surge in import prices have also contri-
buted to the inflationary situation. Inflation is now running at an annual
rate of around 25%, compared with only 4-5% a few years previously. The
Government has made several attempts to reduce the rate of inflation, so far
with little success.
12.       The domestic economic difficulties together with the recent surge
in world commodity prices have severely upset the development program. The
Fifth Plan, which was published in draft last December and was due for imple-
mentation starting in 1974/75, is currently under revision, and in the interim
the Government is proceeding with a substantially scaled-down program.
Capital expenditure is being held down to a level which in real terms is
likely to be below that of last year. The thrust of the investment program
is on the key sectors whose output is in critically short supply: coal,
electric power, oil, non-ferrous metals, fertilizer, steel, and transport.
Within the tight budget, allocations to the social sectors, most particularly
education, have been cut below previous levels. In line with the Government's
aim to relieve the pervasive commodity shortages and to stimulate industrial
production, the 1974/75 budget has also made a number of tax and other
concessions to private industry. But the budget has also introduced addi-
tional taxation as well as increases in rates on transport and other public
services, in order to hold down the budget deficit.
13.       Ever since the balance of payments crisis of the late 1950s, a
shortage of foreign exchange has constituted one of the most critical con-
straints on development of the economy. The recent increases in world
commodity prices have added to these problems, at a time when the economy
is singularly ill-placed to deal with them. Petroleum has become a very
prominent item in the import bill. In 1972/73 imports of crude oil and
petroleum products amounted to US$265 million, equivalent to 10% of merchandise
imports; estimates of the corresponding figures for 1973/74 are US$625
million and 18% and for 1974/75, depending on the availability of external
financing and other factors, US$1,300 and 26%. In the Draft Fifth Plan the



-5-
Government had already set out ambitious programs of indigenous energy develop-
ment in order to reduce dependence on imported oil, but these have had to
be supplemented by a variety of other measures. The short-term focus is on
reduced consumption, by increasing the prices of petroleum products and,
more important, by converting oil-burning equipment to coal wherever possible.
But there are only limited opportunities for immediately reducing petroleum
consumption, and some cutback in supplies appears inevitable. Since the
bulk of petroleum consumption is concentrated in such vital sectors as
agriculture (as feedstock for fertilizer production, and as fuel for irriga-
tion pumping and mechanised farming), goods transport, and industry, with
final private consumption accounting for no more than 10% of total consump-
tion, reduced oil supplies are bound to depress overall economic production.
Another emphasis of short-term policy is to remove the immediate bottlenecks
on coal production and transport. For the longer term, programs are already
under way to raise the efficiency of oil utilization and to step up the pace
of development of coal-based fertilizer technology, of oil exploration, and
of exploitation of the considerable hydroelectric resources. None of these
energy adjustment measures will be easy or quick of attainment and it will
be several years before results of appreciable quantitative significance will
be realized.
14.       The increase in oil prices is only one element in a large widening
of the trade deficit. The need for large imports of food and fertilizers,
at the exceptionally high prices of the past year, and the price increases
in oil, steel, non-ferrous metals, and other vital imports increased the
import bill by 37% in 1973/74. This increase was partly offset by a 18%
increase in exports, several export items benefiting from the commodities
booni, but the estimated trade gap was about US$585 million compared with
about US$50 million the year before. The outlook for 1974/75 is bleak, as
the full effect of the deterioration in the terms of trade comes to be felt.
Even with a severe compression of food, fertilizer, and petroleum imports
and a probable decline in general maintenance imports in real terms, the
total import bill could rise by a further 40% if prices continue at their
present level. Exports promise to continue doing well, which should reduce
the impact of the enlarged import bill. Nevertheless, there is a critical
need for external assistance at a much higher level than the U1S 1,225 million
estimated for 1973/74, which was itself UTS$330 million (or 37°) hig11cr thlan
the previous year. The Government secured two million tons of food aid from
the USSR last year, half of which remains to be disbursed this year, and has
negotiated credits from several oil-producing countries. The Government has
also drawn its gold tranche and first credit tranche from the IMF. In
addition, the Consortium is discussing what action is possible to help India
overcome its difficulties, and several members have already announced large
increases in their aid programs for 1974/75.
15.       As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external public
debt (disbursed only) stood at US$9.9 billion on March 31, 1973. Debt
service in 1973/74 is estimated at US$700 million, equivalent to around 23i:
of export receipts. This compares with a level of debt service of about
US$200 million in the mid-1960s.   In order to mitigate the negative effects
on growth of such a high burden of external debt and to forestall any



- 6 -
danger of a foreign exchange crisis, from 1968/69 onwards the Consortium
has extended debt relief to India. In 1973/74, the most recent year in
which this action was taken, the amount of debt relief was about US$185
million.  On the assumption that India can obtain its large, new financing
requirements on appropriately soft terms, debt service is expected to grow
more slowly over the rest of this decade than it did in the 1960s and should
be equivalent to around 20% of export receipts by 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATION'S IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 42 loans and 62 development
credits to India totalling US$1,229 million and US$2,803 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$627 million has been
repaid, and US$959 million was still undisbursed as of April 30, 1974.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of May 31, 1974,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$6.8 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$21.6 million, US$14.6 million
represents loans and US$7.0 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of April 30, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the
importance of industrialization for India's future development, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and also, through its sizeable assistance to development finance
institutions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-
scale enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components
for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better
capacity utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and related
urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit and on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next year. Special emphasis will be given to projects
benefiting small farmers and landless laborers. Lending in support of infra-
structure and industrial investments will focus oni energy-related projects.



Repeater credits for power and railways have high priority in this context,
and discussiorns are under way with the Government in an effort to identify
and prepare projects specifically designed to facilitate coal production and
coal transport. Lending for fertilizer projects, which has been an important
feature in recent years, is expected to occupy an even more prominent place
in the future program; the use of coal-based technology will receive particu-
lar attention.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of rhe discussions within the India Consortium. The need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when output
and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price situation.
Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw materials and
components continues to be an essential element within the overall program
of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for projects in India
should include, as appropriate, the financing of local expenditures. India
imports relatively few capital goods because of the capacity of the domestic
capital goods industry. The import component of projects tends to be especially
low in such high-priority areas as agriculture, education, and family planning.
For the Bank Group to be able to make an appropriate contribution to the
financing of projects in these sectors, it is important to cover a proportion
of local expenditures.
21.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the Bank Group
accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements, and 12%
of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%, respect-
ively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected to
continue growing. Whereas on tarch 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of India's
outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is likely to account for
almost 30%.   Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the
form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly.    In
1972/73 about 13% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION IN INDIA
General
22.       Agriculture is the most important sector in India; it engages
70% of the labor force, contributes presently about 45% of GNP, and accounts
for a major share of exports. Consequently, investments in agriculture have
been given priority, especially since the mid-1960s, and deserve continued
emphasis over the next five years.
23.       Since independence, the overall growth rate of agricultural pro-
duction has averaged about 3% per annum. This low overall rate of growth in



the agriculture sector obscures considerable variations over shorter periods
of time. between crops, and between regions. The overall rate has been very
much affected by the serious droughts in 1965 and 1966 and again in 1972.
At the same time, the success of high yielding varieties of wheat produced
ncreases in wheat production of about 20% p.a. between 1967 and 1971. Other
C-odgrain crops, notably rice, have not enjoyed anything like the same success,
as the introduction of high yielding varieties has encountered difficulties
arising from local climatic and ecological conditions. The effects of the
green revolution, which primarily affected wheat, have been concentrated in
north western India, very largely on account of the advanced state of agricul-
ture in that area and the availability of irrigation.
24.       Despite the progress made in many aspects of food production, India's
agriculture remains heavily dependent upon the vagaries of the weather.
A major factor in reducing this dependence will be the expansion of irriga-
tion and the more effective use of existing investment in irrigation facili-
ties. The Government is also placing emphasis on the improved supply of
inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, agricultural credit, and extension
services.
Irrigation
25.       Over the first half of the twentieth century, the area under irriga-
tion in India increased by only about 1% p.a. to reach slightly more than
20 million hectares in 1950/51, or about one fifth of India's cultivated land.
Out of these 20 million hectares, about half was served by major and medium
irrigation works.
26.       Irrigation development has appropriately received incriased atten-
tion since independence, and substantial resources were devoted to it throughout
the four Five Year Plans. Outlays for irrigation development during the first'
three Plans and during the three Annual Plans 1966-69 totalled Rs 26.8 billion,
and the fourth Plan allocated Rs 16 billion to irrigation.   While minor
irrigation increased only slightly from 6.4 million ha to 7.5 million ha, the
area covered by major and medium systems had more than doubled to 21.4 million
hectares compared with an estimated ultimate potential for irrigation of 57
million hectares.  But of the new additional acreage of about 10 million ha,
only 80% was being utilized, and much of that inefficiently.
27.       The Second Irrigation Commission and the National Commission on
Agriculture found that the under-utilization of irrigation potential was
attributable to the lack of integrated development in the irrigated areas,
insufficient farmer training and extension service, and lack of administrative
coordination. It has been unofficially estimated that the major part of
recently completed irrigation projects require additional investments of
between US$200 and US$500 per ha before they can become fully productive.
Accordingly, for the Fifth Plan period (1974-1979) various measures have
been designed to improve utilization, and a Command Area Development Department
has been set up in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to coordinate work
on a list of high priority projects including the proposed project.



- 9 -
28.       In view of the substantial investment that has already been made
in major irrigation works, the economic return on investment which facilitates
the most effective use of the water provided can be very high. Consequently,
command area development has been given high priority under the v'ifth Plan
proposals, and a relatively large proportion of public sector investment in
irrigation has been allocated for this purpose. Further funds, doubling this
allocationi, will be made available from institutional sources for credit. In
addition, major institutional changes have been proposed affecting the
coordination of services in command areas and the administration of credit.
These p-oposals are incorporated in the framework of this project.
29.       Several IDA agricultural credit projects presently include, as one
component, financing of land leveling through cooperative and commercial credit
institutions. Responsibility for carrying out the works under these projects
rests with the farmers, who, with few exceptions, have been unable to organize
themselves to construct and maintain the necessary works. As a result, the
implementation rate of on-farm works under these and other major irrigation
projects in India has been slow. In addition, these schemes make no provision
for the concurrent improvement and expansion of the irrigation, drainage and
road networks, which is essential for the efficient use of available water.
An acceleration in the rate of implementation of on-farm works will require
a transfer of responsibility for their execution to a project authority. It
will also require legislation, under which on-farm works can be associated
with minor realignments of farm boundaries and with the compulsory execution
of the work.
Agriculture in Rajasthan
30.       Rajasthan is the second-largest state in India, with an area of
34 million ha; but it has one of the smaller populations, about 27 million,
of whom 80% are rural. The northwestern part of the state is arid and drains
towards the Indus River. The southeastern part is semi-arid and drains mostly
to the Chambal River and thence to the Ganges system.
31.       About 37% (13 million ha) of the state is desert and is largely
uncultivated. Hlowever, several large irrigation schemes, notably the
Rajasthan Canal (Irrigation) Project, on which the proposed project is based,
are opening up desert lands for cultivation, using water from the upper
Indus basin. About 2.1 million ha are irrigated, 55% from dug wells, 35%
from public canal systems, and 10% from tanks. Irrigated crops include
cotton, wheat, paddy, sugarcane, millet, pulses, oilseeds, fruit, and
vegetables.
32.       The Fifth Plan has been designed to achieve an overall annual
growth rate of 5% in the state domestic product, including a growth rate of
4.4% in the agricultural sector. Public investment of Rs 6,350 million is
envisaged, of which 40% would go to irrigation projects and a further 10%
to other agricultural projects. Major projects in the agricultural sector
to be financed under the Plan include the Chambal Command Area Development
Project (for which the Executive Directors approved a US$52 million loan on
June 18, 1974), the proposed Rajasthan Canal Command Area Development Project,
the Drought Prone Areas Program (being considered for Bank Group assistance
in FY1975).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33,       In November 1972, a Bank Group Irrigation Reconnaissance Mission
isited India at the request of the Government of India.  It identified
several command area development projects, of which two, the Chambal Command
Area Development Project (Rajasthan) and the Rajasthan Canal Command Area
Ilevelopiaent Project, were appraised together in November 1973 after pre-
paratory work by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. Both projects are very

project is given in Annex III. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Rajasthan
Canal Command Area Development Project," Report No. 447-IN dated June 14,
1974, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations
of this project were held in Washington from May 24 to 28, 1974. The
Borrower was represented by Mr. G. Venkataramanan, Deputy Secretary, Ministry
of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, and by Mr. Hit Prakash, Deputy
Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture. The Government of Rajasthan was repre-
sented Mr. S.L. Klhurana, Chief Secretary, Mr. V.C. Pande, Secretary, Water
Utilization and Command Area Development Department, and Mr. Hari Singh
Chowdhry, Chairman, Rajasthan Canal Board. The Agricultural Refinance
Corporation was represented by Mr. M.A. Chidambaram, Managing Director.
The Project
34.       The proposed project is the development of two blocks totalling
200,000 ha in the command area of the existing Rajasthan Canal (Irrigation)
Project (RCP), ohe of India's largest irrigation schemes, in the northeastern
desert region of Rajasthan. Under this project, Rajasthan's share of the
Beas and Ravi river waters is diverted by the Harike Barrage in Punjab and
fed through a 214 km feeder canal into the Rajasthan Main Canal. The Rajasthan
Canal irrigation system is designed to provide perennial irrigation ultimately
for 1.14 million hectares of cultivable land. Presently, the distributary
system is completed to serve nearly the whole of RCP's 540,000 ha Stage I
in the Ganganagar District of the Bikaner Administrative Division.   About
33,000 farmer families drawn from landless agricultural laborers in adjacent
areas and from temporary tenants dwelling in the project area are being
settled on 6 ha farms. The present cropping intensity in the project area
is 90%, with 41% occuring in the wet summer and 49% in the dry winter season.
Main wet season crops are cotton and pulses, and the main dry season production
is wheat and gram. In addition, mustard, millet, sorghum, berseem, groundnuts,
paddy, and sugar cane are grown in the area. Present yields of the main
crops, cotton and wheat, are low, mainly because of the limited supply of
water and other farm inputs - such as fertilizer, quality seeds and pesticides
- and unimproved farm practices. Agricultural production on the whole has
been disappointing due to these and other constraints, such as inadequate
roads, lack of on-farm development and ineffective supporting services.
Leakage from unlined channels, deficient operating procedures and inadequate
on-farm water management have resulted in an overall irrigation operating
efficieTicy of 35% to 40% against the potential 65%.

35.       The proposed project would be a major step in a program to correct
these deficiencies. It would consist of land development, including level-
ling of 32,000 ha, reclamation of 17,000 ha of saline soils, and
construction and lining of 5,800 km of watercourses; lining of 915 km of
existing branch, distributary, and minor canals; afforestation to provide
shelter belts for roads and canals, and sand dune stabilization; construction
of 430 km of roads; provision of 46,000 nutrient tons of fertilizer to
restore soil fertility on farms developed under the project; facilities for
the supply of filtered and disinfected water to 100 new project area
villages; provision of vehicles, equipment and housing for project adminis-
tration and agricultural support services.
Project Implementation
36.       Together with the Chambal Command Area Development Project
(Rajasthan), the proposed project is expected to serve as a prototype in
India for command area development. Consequently, particular care has been
giver to the institutional and organizational aspects of the implementation.
To ensure full cooperation between all the departments concerned witlh
command area development, the Government of Rajasthan (GOR) has set up
a Command Area Development and Water Utilization Department at state level
and is establishing a Rajasthan Canal Command Area Authority (CAM). The CAM
would be responsible for water utilization and integrated area development
in the irrigation command, for all colonization activities in the project
area and the setting up of village cooperatives, for research and extension and
for coordinating the supply of inputs. It would be in charge of implementing
and managing the project. Its Board would be headed by an Area Development
Commissioner, who would also be the CAM's administrator. The CAM would have
four departments: irrigation and land development, agriculture, revenue,
and cooperatives and colonization. The establishment of the CAM, with
organization, board membership and powers satisfactory to the Association,
would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed credit. 1/
37.       On-farm development within the project area would be compulsory
to ensure efficient project execution and optimal use of the available land
and irrigation facilities. To assist in this objective, the Rajasthan Land
Development Corporation (RLDC) would be set up as a statutory corporation by
GOR with an authorized share capital of Rs 100 million and a 50% equity
participation by the Government of India (GOI). Its Board of Directors
would be chaired by the Secretary of the Command Area Development and Water
Utilization Department and would comprise representatives of GOI and the
CAA. RLDC's establishment with capitalization, board membership and powers
satisfactory to the Association, would be a condition of effectiveness for
the proposed credit. 2/ RLDC's functions would be to act as a financial
intermediary for on-farm development in the State. It would channel all land
development funds to the CAM in line with the progress of on-farm works.
RLDC would prepare applications for land development loans on behalf of
1/   See Section 5.01(e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement.
2/   See Section 5.01(d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement.



- 12 -
those farmers wiho - because of their credit standing - are eligible for
such loans from the Rajasthan State Cooperative Land Development Bank (LDB)
or from commercial banks. Other farmers would receive special loans from
RLDC, using GOI funds. Subsidies would be available for several categories
of disadvantaged farmers under the existing GOI program for small farmer
development.
38.       The extension service in the project area would be reorganized
and would make use of progressive farmers as part-time extension workers.
A special group will be created in the CAA to monitor the progress of the
project.
39.       On-farm development, in particular land shaping, would disturb
the soil profile and result in a temporary loss of fertility. Under the
present conditions of fertilizer shortage, GOI allocations are likely to
fall shiort of requirements. In order to ensure the availability of fer-
tilizer needed to restore the fertility of disturbed soil, the project
provides for the import of 46,000 nutrient tons of fertilizer which would
supply the difference between present allocations and recommended levels
over a three-year period. Proposed arrangements for the distribution of
this fertilizer to the farmers affected by land development are satisfactory.
Project Costs and Financing
40.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$174 million equivalent,
including US$47.1 million in foreign exchange. The principal cost components
are: Canal lining, road construction and afforestation works (US$47.7 mil-
lion), land development and village water supply (US$38.6 million), supple-
mentary fertilizer (US$19.7 million), and project administration (US$8.7
million). The balance is made up by physical and price contingencies (US$59.3
million).
41.       The proposed credit would cover 48% of total project cost.    GOR
would finance 42% and GOI 5%. The balance would be contributed by the
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) and by the participating commercial
banks and LDB. Of the proceeds of the credit, GOI would use US$18.7 million
for the procurement of fertilizer. US$41.8 million would be on-lent by GOI
to GOR on the normal terms on which development funds are being provided to
state governments by the center. The remaining US$22.5 million would be
passed on to ARC with 9 and 15 years maturity at 6.25% and 6.75% annual
interest respectively. 1/ ARC in turn would refinance about 80% of the land
development loans extended to farmers by participating commercial banks and
LUB at not less than 7%, repayable in accordance with the terms of the loans
to farmers. Farmers would repay a commercial bank or LDB loan over a period
of not more than 15 years, including not more than two years of grace, with
interest at the rate of not less than 9-1/2%. Farm loans would be secured
by mortgages. The exchange risk associated with the proposed IDA credit
would be borne by the Borrower.
1/   Thlis amount of US$22.5 million on-lent to ARC becomes part of the over-
all funding provided to ARC by GOI at tihe terms mentioned in the text.
Consequently, there is no way of stating which of the terms mentioned
apply to the funds stemming from the proposed loan.

Procurement and Disbursement
42.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be used to finance:
civil works, including on-farm development (US$51.4 million), equipment
and vehicles (US$6.3 million), fertilizer (US$18.7 million), and contingencies
(US$6.6 million).
43.       The estimated cost of vehicles and equipment for project manage-
ment, force account construction and for hire to contractors, is US$10.2 mil-
lion. Out of this total, US$6.3 million would be subject to international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference
limited to 15% of the cif price of imported goods, or the prevailing customs
duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of
bids. About US$1.0 million worth of equipment and vehicles, consisting of
categories of items costing less than US$100,000 each, which for reasons of
efficiency are not suitable for international tendering, would be purchased
through normal GOR procurement procedures, which are satisfactory. The
balance of US$2.9 million would be reserved for local procurement and would
not be eligible for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the Credit. Fertil-
izer would be procured by the Government of India for reasons of economy and
efficiency as part of the regular bulk purchases in the world market.
Fertilizer procurement by GOI is based on international competition. However,
because of the tight supply situation in the world market and the limited number
of suppliers, formal advertisement would not lead to an adequate response.
Instead, the Government seeks price quotations from potential suppliers
followed by price negotiations to obtain the lowest price. This procedure
is in accordance with international practice now common in the fertilizer
trade and would be acceptable,provided at least three quotations are invited.
44.       The civil works included in the project are individually small,
scattered over the entire project area, and scheduled for construction over
a six-year period. Much of the construction work and on-farm development
would be carried out intermittently as determined by seasonal weather con-
ditions, by the ongoing agricultural activities in the project area, and in
particular by agreements amongst farmers for land-levelling programs. In
these circumstances it would not be feasible or economic to combine any of
the categories of civil works into contracts sufficiently large to attract
international competition. It is therefore proposed that the civil works
be carried out by local contractors, which are mostly small labor contractors,
following local tendering, or, where the use of machinery is required,
tlhrough force account.
45.       The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment or against the ex-factory price of equipment
manufactured locally, and at the rate of 70% for imported equipment procured
locally. Disbursements for civil works and on-farm development expenditures
would be on a percentage basis. Disbursements for fertilizer would be made
against c.i.f. cost. GOT plans to purchase the fertilizer financed from
the credit in the first year of Project implementation. Since distribution
of this quantity of fertilizer will be made by GOI to Rajasthan and by
Rajasthan to Project farmers only over the period of the Project, most of



- 14 -
the fertilizer would initially be devoted to India's general requirements, but
the GOI would be obligated to replace it in later years in order to meet
the specific Project needs. These arrangements would in effect introduce
an element of program lending into this operation, but this is considered
to be justified in view of India's acute need f'or foreign exchange for
fertilizer imports following the increase in the oil price last fall (see
paragraph 14 above). As indicated in paragraph 39, proposed arrangements
for distribution of this fertilizer are satisfactory. The credit would be
fully disbursed by June 30, 1981, about one year after Project completion.
Benefits and Economic Justifications
46.       The average cropping intensity in the project area would rise
from 90% at present to 130% at full development. The production of foodcrops
would increase from 47,000 tons at present to 312,000 tons, and that of
non-food crops from 170,000 tons to 817,000 tons at full development.
Market prospects for all the crops are good. Processing, storage, and
marketing facilities are generally satisfactory for the present levels of
production, and GOR has investment plans which should be adequate to meet
requirements at full project development.
47.       Farm incomes would increase on the average from Rs 5,300 to about
Rs 16,500, depending on farm location and size, over a ten-year period.
Irrigation charges would be raised to cover the full cost of operating
and maintaining the project works. These charges, including the service
of farm loans, would still leave the farmer with a substantial increase
in net income to provide adequate incentives for participating in the
project. For capital cost, a committee to be established by GOR would
recommend appropriate recovery arrangements, taking into account the
farmer's incentive and capacity to pay. 1/
48.       The project would provide the equivalent of 70,000 additional
full time jobs over the next decade and would lead to an increase in the
net value of production from the project area of Rs 255 million (US$32 mil-
lion) per year in ten years' time and Rs 350 million (US$44 million) at full
development after 21 years. The economic rate of return on the project in-
vestment is estimated at 25%, assuming a 25 year project period, first
benefits in year 2 and full development in year 21; including all in-
vestment costs except price contingencies; evaluating incremental farm labor
costs at Rs 41.0 million at full development; and evaluating all inputs and
outputs at projected 1980 market prices (expressed in 1974 constant prices).
1/   See Section 2.09(b) of the draft Project Agreement.



_ 15 -
49.       The project would improve the harsh desert environment through
the planting of shelter belts along canals and roads and through controlled
pasture development to stabilize sand dunes. Experience in comparable
irrigation command areas has shown that health improvement has followed
irrigation improvement. The village water supply component of the proposed
project would help control the danger of major infectious diseases as the
population density grows in the project area.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
State of Rajasthan, the draft ARC Agreement between the Association and the
Agricultural Refinance Corporation, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
5l.       Points of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 36, 37
and 47. The Development Credit Agreement specifies among additional
conditions of effectiveness that a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Government of India and the Agricultural Refinance Corporation shall have
been executed and ratified, that the Command Area Authority for the Project
has been established by the Government of Rajasthan, and that the Rajasthan
Land Development Corporation has been established (see Section 5.01(b), (d)
and (e)).
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

in No. 902  Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8. 1973:. Closing Date:
December'31., 197~
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. The first two loans are fully
committed, and disbursements under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule. An eleventh
loan to ICICI is scheduled for appraisal in August 197h.
Cr No. 89   Beas Equipment;  US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1974.
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign exchange
cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydroelectric power
from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and Rajasthan and for
associated construction works. The project, which has been subject to some delays,
is part of a larger scheme for the integrated development of the eastern rivers
of the Indus Basin.  The closing date of December 31, 1972, has been postponed
for the second time.to June 30, 1974.  Final disbursement requests have been
received and are being processed.
£Ln No. 614  Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18.,1969; Closing Date:
December 31. 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high yielding varieties.  The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets.  ImplementatiQn problems over processing plant
construction and land-levelling have been resolved. Expansion of an existing
processing plant is in .progress, and tenders for a new plant are under prepara-
tion.  Large scale land-levelling demonstrations have stimulated demand for such
work and orders are to be placed shortly by contractors for imported machinery.
1/ These notes are.designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report .any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
Thlly should be read Xn this sense and with thq understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakness in
project execution.

-: o. 176   Kadana !rr7gation:  US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closin _Date: September 30, 1976
This project iLll finance in part the construction of Kadana Dan
-    a-:e 1-h  v-rer and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
;<ect a-so includes field channel construction, land-levelling, drainage
;c.rks an:i roads and a program to support agricultural development0  The project
w-i  be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays on dam
construc-ion.  The agricultural components of the project are also behind
slchedule. Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the start of
the project, before major investments have been made. These will not affect
the economic justification of the project.  Further delays have occurred as a
resuilt cf material shortages in the present construction season, and the need
for additional spillway construction. If material shortages are not relieved
and the additional apillway construction is not started forthwith, the resulting
delays could affect the economic justification of the project.
Cr No. 268  Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 10,000 ha.   It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lines main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1,973, overall performance' on the project was satisfactory with con-
strurtion and Credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute shortage
of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal excavation, has
since hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main canals is now
likely to fall more than one year behind schedule.  This in turn is likely to
delay the introduction of irrigation to over 40 percent of the project area and
maiy have a serious adverse effect on the rate of return, which is now being
exlamined. LnTid development is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging
behind water availability in the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy
or the credit operation for land development and has requested IDA financing
for a  omnand Area Development Project (CAD), to be implemented by a Central
Auth ority for zill farmers in need of land development.  The project will include
the setting up of a well-coordinated technical and administrative organization
v:d b1:y suitable legal measures.  Project preparation is underway and appraisal
s ceduled for November 1974.

Cr No. LLO Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit of
November 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.  Apart
from the: Punjab project, which consists of mechanization.equipment only, all are
similar in structure being designed to provide long and medium-term credit to
farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as imported
tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling. Disbursement of these credits
started slowly. So far as the minor irrigation components were concerned, the
main difficulties stemnued from the institutional requirements, in particular
the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending terms and the streng-
thening of institutions responsible for assessing groundwater availability. These
constraints have now been overcome and disbursements are accelerating, reflecting
high demand for minor irrigation investments spurred by the experience of the
1973 drought-. Tractor procurement has been delayed following the substantial
change in both the supply and demand situations since the projects were originally
appraised. It has recently been agreed that the credits should be amended to
permit the financing of indigenously manufactured tractors as well as imported
tractors and that some funds earmarked for tractors should be. reallocated to
minor irrigation components.
Cr No. 230 Agro Aviation; US$6.o million credit of January 28, 1971;   Closing
Date: December 31. 1974-
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spraying
of pesticides as part of India's plant protection program. So far no disburse-
ments have taken place because the Government has been considering the procurement
arraniaements for the importation of aircraft. Bids have now been received and are
being evaluated.
Cr No. 267 Wedt Storage; us$5.o million credit of August 23, 1971;    Closing
Date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat belt,
comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and,10 silos
(200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study. Warehouse con-
struc-tion is about 75% complete and preparations for silo construction ar pro-
g.ressing. The Government Food Ninistry intends to select a local research
institute in the near future to conduct the stu'dy.

million, for roads valued at US$7.6 million, for
village water supplies valued at TUS$2.0 million,

bulk by the India Tender Board through international
shopping, which includes seeking price quotations
from at least three possible suppliers, followed by
negotiations with bidders to obtain the lowest
