have 8 heifers (estimated cost: $11.2\n            million, including contingencies); (b) the continuation of\n            the development begun as part of the (First) Integrated\n            Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms by increasing\n            the numbers of heifers on each to ensure their long-term\n            financial viability (estimated cost $2.7 million, including\n            contingencies); (c) (i) the expansion of existing processing\n            plants which produce baby milk-powder, sterilized fluid\n            milk, and whole milk powders; (ii) the diversification of\n            present plants to include production of butterfat,\n            evaporated milk, and powdered coffee creamer; (iii) the\n            establishment of two milk collection centers; (iv) the\n            provision of approximately 50 small milk cooling units; and\n            (v) the construction of a frozen milk products plant at\n            Yeongnam (estimated cost: $8.8 million, including\n            contingencies); and (d) the expansion of technical services\n            for both farm development and milk processing (estimated\n            cost: $1.8 million, including contingencies)."}, "docdt": "1975-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
