The objectives of the project, were to: (i) reduce\n            the transport costs by rehabilitating the most important\n            sections of the highway network;( ii) improve the system of\n            road maintenance works by increasing contractors rather than\n            by force account; (iii) assist and expand the capacity and\n            efficiency of the trucking industry; and (iv) increase the\n            availability of trained engineers in Tanzania.  Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) main institutional and policy changes,including\n            reorganization and institutional reinforcement of roads\n            administration as well as changes in the procurement\n            regulations should be undertaken prior to project\n            effectiveness; (ii) it would be appropriate to annually\n            review the program and to phase it with implementation\n            progress,using subsequent fund releases based on continuing\n            institutional reforms and strengthening; (iii) A carefulr\n            eevaluation  of the engineering design prior to actual\n            commencement of works would avoid such delays and cost\n            overruns; (iv) road networks are deteriorating faster than\n            the level of investments to rehabilitate and to maintain\n            them; (v) establish a maintenance strategy for the roads;\n            (vi) improve the regulatory environment to stimulate the\n            development of the private sector; and (vii) public sector\n            based equipment rehabilitation programs do not work."}, "docdt": "1995-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
