F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The primary project objective is to help alert and prepare vulnerable people in case of a disaster
associated with an outburst flood from Lake Sarez and other frequent natural hazards such as
mudslides, rockfalls, avalanches, and seasonal floods that are common in the project area. To
achieve this objective, the project aims at: (i) enhancing the current monitoring system of Lake


                                               ii

Sarez and establishing a community-based early warning system; (ii) enhancing prevention,
mitigation and preparedness capabilities of communities at risk; (iii) preparing a long-term
strategy to deal with the risks and resources associated with Lake Sarez; and (iv) strengthening
national capacity. The November 2003 MTR confirmed that project's development objective is
still valid, and is realistic in scale and scope.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance)

After the demise of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan experienced a five year civil war that ended with a
peace agreement in 1997. Today, Tajikistan remains the poorest among the most fragile CIS
countries, although economic growth has been strong over the past several years; economic growth
reached 10.6% in 2004, but dropped to 8% in 2005 and to 7% in 2006. Despite this, nearly two-
thirds of the population continues to live in severe poverty. The largest portion of the population
lives in rural areas. In 2003, the urban population was estimated at 27 percent, 7 percentage points
lower than in the 1970s. Many of these poor rely on agriculture for survival, and are particularly
vulnerable to natural disasters. Limited institutional capacity in the government means that its
ability to prepare for and cope with natural disasters is limited.

Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) was significantly affected by the civil war,
particularly because it is very remote and during the conflict it was cut-off from regular food and
other supplies. Its residents remain some of the poorest in Tajikistan. In addition, the province is
mostly mountainous, with small remote villages that are prone to a number of natural hazards, from
earthquake to seasonal flooding. Lake Sarez poses the greatest danger to these residents. The lake,
located in the heart of Gorno Badakhshan, two days of traveling by vehicle and foot from the capital
of Tajikistan, Dushanbe, was formed in 1911, when a 2.2 billion cubic meters (BCM) landslide,
caused by an earthquake in the Pamir Mountain range, blocked the Murghab River Valley. The
landslide buried the village and the inhabitants of Usoi, giving the landslide dam its name. Soon
afterwards, the river rose to form a lake around 60 kilometers (km) in length, and on average 212 m
deep, containing approximately 17 BCM of water or roughly half the size of Lake Geneva. As the
lake formed, it submerged the village of Sarez, giving the lake its name: Lake Sarez.

The average altitude of the lake level is between 3260 and 3265 meters above sea level (masl). The
maximum elevation of the natural landslide dam crest is 3490 masl. With its height of 550-650
meters and its length of about 2 km, it is the highest dam in the world (both natural and man-made).
Available reports on Lake Sarez and the Usoi dam prior to 1998 described them as being of
questionable stability. These reports suggested that if a strong earthquake would occur in the
vicinity of the lake, it could cause the dangerous "right bank" (a partially collapsed body of earth
and rock with a mass of roughly 2 BCM) to slide into the lake, generating an enormous wave that
could rise above the natural dam, possibly washing it away. The reports also suggested that the
resulting flood could affect up to 5 million people living along the Bartang, Pyanj, and Amu Darya
rivers, a path traversing Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.

In 1988, the Former Soviet Union (FSU) installed an early warning system based on data
transmission via satellite designed to alert Moscow and Dushanbe of an outburst flow from Lake


                                                   1

Sarez. The system was developed to warn the inhabitants of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya
Basin, but not the population in the Bartang Valley and the Pyanj Valley, living below the lake. By
the mid-1990s the system was no longer operational, and in 1995 the Government of Tajikistan
(GOT) adopted a resolution calling for the development of an integrated program to secure Lake
Sarez. Since then, efforts were made towards assessing the magnitude of the problem and
identifying mitigation measures.

The potential danger of Lake Sarez and Usoi landslide dam was brought to the attention of the
Secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) of the UN in 1997.
The Government of Tajikistan approached the donors' community, including the World Bank and
requested international assistance to address the risk posed by the lake. As follow-up to these
discussions, an inter-agency mission, led by IDNDR, was conducted in June 1999. The mission
concluded that a complete, or even partial collapse of the Usoi dam, and its devastating impacts
were very unlikely, but that the threat of a collapse of the right bank landslide remained as an
unfortunate reality. The mission also identified a set of measures to mitigate the Lake Sarez hazard,
and confirmed that the most urgent action to address the Lake Sarez problem was the installation of
a monitoring system linked to an early warning system to alert the most vulnerable communities.
The mission recommendations, which formed the basis for the development of the Lake Sarez Risk
Mitigation Project (LSRMP), were endorsed by the President of Tajikistan, who personally
requested support from the Bank.

The Lake Sarez Risk Mitigation Project was approved by the World Bank in June 2000 and despite
its modest size, it represented the first concrete step to address the risks that Lake Sarez posed. This
project was in alignment with the Country Assistance Strategy that was aimed at assisting the most
vulnerable groups in Tajikistan, located in isolated mountainous areas and lacking most basic
services; and strengthening disaster mitigation capacity of the former Ministry for Emergency
Situations and Civil Defense to address issues pertaining to Lake Sarez. The IDA credit amounted
USD 0.47 million of the total USD 4.29 million estimated at appraisal, and which was covered by
other donors, both with tied and untied parallel financing agreements. The project represented an
initial, fast-track operation of modest size compared with the magnitude of the problem, and
addressed the immediate needs of the communities at risk in Tajikistan, while seeking longer-term
solutions to this complex issue.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The primary project objective was to help alert and prepare vulnerable people in case of a disaster
associated with an outburst flood from Lake Sarez and other frequent natural hazards such as
mudslides, rockfalls, avalanches, and seasonal floods that are common in the project area. To
achieve this objective, the project aimed at: (i) enhancing the current monitoring system of Lake
Sarez and establishing a community-based early warning system; (ii) enhancing prevention,
mitigation and preparedness capabilities of communities at risk; (iii) preparing a long-term strategy
to deal with the risks and resources associated with Lake Sarez; and (iv) strengthening national
capacity. The November 2003 mid-term review confirmed that the project's development objective
was still valid, and was realistic in scale and scope.




                                                     2

The key indicators to evaluate the project performance included (see annex 2):

          a) Proportion of vulnerable communities able to implement disaster management plans
             and to contact authorities within minutes from the disaster onset.

          b) Government and NGO personnel are able to predict occurrence of a disaster and to
             respond effectively when a disaster occurs.

          c) Increased dialogue and financial support for Lake Sarez disaster mitigation and
             prevention issues through new partnership with the international and scientific
             community.

          d) Monitoring System and Early Warning System work and people know how to use
             them.

1.3     Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and
Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not formally revised.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of the project were the vulnerable communities located in the Murghab
and Bartang valleys (about 19,000 people) and along the Tajik side of the Pyanj valley (about
130,000 inhabitants in Tajikistan), together with the emergency management professionals at the
central and local levels, who benefited from training and technical assistance. Other beneficiaries
included local NGOs (i.e., Manand Nature, Fidokor, Kuhiston, National Red Crescent Society)
concerned with the Lake Sarez problem.

1.5     Original Components

The project was originally intended to be implemented over a period of five years and was to
include the following four components:

Component A. Monitoring and Early Warning systems (Total US$2.5 million, Swiss Trust
Fund US$1.7 million, SECO US$0.8 million). The objective of this component was to design and
install a monitoring system and an early warning system, which were considered essential to
safeguard the life of the communities located in the Murgab and Bartang valleys and to define a
long-term strategy for Lake Sarez. This component was to include the following three sub-
components:

A.1 Design, technical assistance and training (US$0.8 million). To help Tajikistan deal with
Lake Sarez problem, the Government of Switzerland was to finance consultancy services for the
preparation of the detailed design of the monitoring and early warning systems. Activities to be
financed under this component were to include technical assistance in the preparation of tender
documents for procurement, manufacturing, supply, installation and commissioning of the two
systems. Under this sub-component training and technical assistance were to be provided to the
Sarez Agency during project implementation, and for the initial 3 years of operation of the
monitoring and early warning systems.



                                                   3

A.2 Equipment supply, installation, training and spare parts (US$1.5 million). The
Government of Switzerland was to co-finance the equipment and installation of the monitoring
system of the lake, and the early warning system in the villages most at risk in the Bartang and
Murgab valleys (about 19,000 people). The equipment was supposed to be procured on the basis of
the detailed design and tender documents prepared under Component A. The supplier of the
equipment was to be responsible for the minor civil works required for the installation, for carrying
out training activities of the Sarez Agency during project implementation, and for providing
specialized assistance in the operation and maintenance of the systems during the first 3 years of
operation, including the provision of spare parts. Conceptually, the design of the monitoring and
early warning systems would have been based on three elements: (i) a monitoring system to provide
instrumentation reading; (ii) an early warning system, capable of alerting vulnerable communities
and relevant authorities; and (iii) a monitoring and early warning systems knowledge management
tool to map risks scenarios.

A.3 Panel of experts (US$0.2 million). In view of the complexity of the Lake Sarez problem, it
was considered necessary that the Government of Tajikistan appointed a Panel of Experts (POE) to
review, steer and advise on the implementation of the project. The Government of Switzerland was
supposed to provide financial support to allow the POE to act as a high level advisory group to the
Government of Tajikistan during the implementation of the project. Prior to commencing of the
project, five members of the POE were selected by the GoT, which were found acceptable by the
International Development Association (IDA). The first POE reflected national, regional and
international expertise. The POE was expected to visit Tajikistan 6 or 7 times for a period of 7-10
days each visit, during the 5 years of project implementation.

Component B. Social training and safety-related supplies (Total US$0.75 million, AKDN
US$0.50 million, USAID US$0.25 million). The objectives of this component were to make the
early warning system community-based and to help communities prepare for a potential outburst
flood from Lake Sarez, as well as for smaller-scale higher-frequency natural disasters that occur
frequently in the project area. These objectives were to be achieved by conducting a human
geographic/demographic investigation, including information of the population living along the
upper Pyanj River. Activities under this component were to include: awareness-raising of vulnerable
communities; regional-level and village level training on emergency preparedness, evacuation and
survival; and building capacity levels of NGOs and government agencies to assist potential victims
of natural disaster. Communities in remote mountain valleys were also to be taught to establish
areas called "safe havens", where evacuees could survive until they are rescued. The Aga Khan
Development Network (AKDN) and the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) were to finance consultancy services, communication and rescue equipment, vehicles,
computers and software, and to facilitate the provision of basic safety-related supplies to the most
vulnerable populations located in the Murgab and Bartang valleys in order to upgrade the "safe
havens."

Component C. Study of Long-term Solutions (Total US$0.4 million, SECO US$0.4 million).
This component aimed to support the preparation of a long-term solutions study to critically review
and integrate past studies and rank options to reduce the potential risk posed by Lake Sarez. The
Government of Switzerland was to finance consultancy services to review past studies, carry out
complementary desk studies (e.g., assessment of different access routes to the lake, digital terrain-
modeling, inundation studies, wave generation and propagation in the lake, mechanisms of dam


                                                   4

overtopping, sediment accumulation rate, seepage through the lake, etc.), screen alternative options
for disaster prevention and formulate recommendations on long-tern solutions. This work was to be
carried out by the same consultant selected to carry out the design of the monitoring and early
warning systems.

Component D. Institutional Strengthening (Total US$0.64 million, IDA US$0.47 million,
Government of Tajikistan US$0.17 million). The newly created Sarez Agency (SA) was to be
responsible for managing and coordinating the activities under the project. This component was to
finance consultancy services and equipment to strengthen the capabilities of the Sarez Agency and
other units within the Ministry of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense (MESCD), as well as the
incremental operating costs associated with project management. Operation and maintenance costs
of the monitoring and early warning systems were to be financed on a declining basis starting from
75 percent in the first year, 50 percent in the second year, and 25 percent in the third year of their
operation. The operation and maintenance of the monitoring and early warning systems (to be
installed under the project) were to be carried out by a unit within the MESCD, which was to be
defined during project implementation.

1.6     Revised Components

Management of Component D: Based on the evaluation of project implementation undertaken in
June 2001 and mid-term review, Component D was revised. Initial project design envisaged the
implementation to be carried out by a core unit within the Sarez Agency headed by the Agency
Director. By the mid-2001, the Sarez Agency's performance on overall project management,
particularly on financial management, was regarded as unsatisfactory. By February 2002, the
responsibility for implementation was passed on to a small Project Implementation Team
established within the MECSD under the direction and guidance of the Head of the Population and
Territorial Protection Department and the Head of the Usoi Department, which operated the original
warning system. By the mid-term review in November 2003, it was agreed that Usoi Department
would take over responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the monitoring and early
warning systems, and most of the technical assistance planned under Component D was targeted to
the Usoi Department staff.

1.7     Other Significant Changes

Additional financing: In order to strengthen the capacity of the new Project Implementation Team
to manage project implementation and ensure compliance with World Bank's procedures and
guidelines, a PHRD grant was obtained in the amount of US$85,500 to finance consultant services
in financial management, procurement and monitoring. Thus, the revised cost of Component D was
estimated at US$0.726 million.

Extension of the closing date: The original closing date of the project was December 31, 2005, but
it was extended by one year until December 31, 2006. The project was originally conceived as a 5-
year operation: 2 years for the setting up of the monitoring and early warning systems and 3 years
for providing assistance in operation and maintenance as well as in interpretation of monitoring
data. Since the supply and installation phase was completed only in December 2004, the
Government of Tajikistan approached the Bank at the end of 2005 with a request for a one-year
extension of the closing date. The extension would allow for the enhancement of long-term



                                                    5

sustainability of the project by providing the adequate know-how to the staff of the Usoi
Department to operate and maintain the systems, to interpret the monitoring data, and to effectively
respond when a disaster occurs.

Economic Development (JSDF Grant): During project implementation, it became apparent that the
targeted communities lacked basic social services and infrastructure, which hindered the
improvement of their living standards and restricted their mobilization and participation in project
activities. As a result of this analysis, the project committed and managed to mobilize resources to
create livelihood development opportunities for the local communities. In addition to smaller
parallel funding provided by the "Grassroots Initiative" of Embassy of Japan in Tajikistan, a JSDF
grant (US$1.6 million), for an associated project titled "Reducing Poverty in High Mountain
Environments around Lake Sarez", was obtained and implemented by the same NGO implementing
component B of the Lake Sarez Risk Mitigation Project.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background Analysis: The project built on extensive background analysis conducted during
exploratory missions in the region, and through coordination with other donors active in the region,
and with local government officials. The project design drew on lessons learned from Bank
experience in risk mitigation and other related projects. Specifically, the project was designed to
incorporate "non-structural" or community development and capacity building components side by
side with investments in infrastructure to enhance the sustainability of the project. Second, the
project drew on experiences in emergency response planning, which had shown the importance of
designating "safe havens" and also in designating a Panel of Experts to advise the government.

Project Design: Given the extensive preparations during the project design, and the extent to which
previous lessons learned and missions to the region were taken into account, the project design can
be assessed as being detailed and thorough. In fact, a QAG review complimented the project team
on the extensiveness and detail of the project design, particularly because of its relatively small
project size. The project was designed in consultation with other donors, and the project was able to
leverage co-financing and parallel financing from a number of donors active in Tajikistan. The
greatest constraint faced by the project in its design was the limited capacity of implementing
agencies, given the difficult post-conflict realities on the ground, including weakened governance
and financial control mechanisms. By project's closure, it was possible to fully appreciate the
importance of taking into account these lessons learned at the design stage, as well as others,
regarding the Sarez Agency's competence and commitment during implementation. The result was
stronger focus and enhanced efficiency during implementation.

Adequacy of Government's Commitment: This project was designed at the request of and with
the full support of the highest levels of government. That said, the government's commitment to the
long-term sustainability will be tested, in light of financial limitations. Given these constraints, the
project built on stakeholder involvement by working together with local NGOs and communities,
and involving them in the implementation and sustainability of the project. At closure, the GOT
remains committed to the project objectives. However, it is unclear how the GOT will be able to
leverage financing for the operation and maintenance of the Monitoring and Early Warning Systems



                                                      6

(M&EWS), even with community involvement, and for the continued support of the Usoi
Department.

Assessments of Risks: At the appraisal stage, the project was rated as posing a modest risk.
During preparation, the GOT confirmed its commitment to the project up to the level of the
President's office. The project's sustainability was to be enhanced by: (i) supporting operation and
maintenance costs of the monitoring and early warning systems on a diminishing basis during the
first three years of their operation; and (ii) by strengthening the capacity of the implementing
agency and the communities at risk. The long-term sustainability of the project was to be
determined by adequate and timely budget allocation to cover operation and maintenance costs of
the monitoring and early warning systems; and the communities' willingness and commitment to
participate in the implementation of disaster preparedness plans. During preparation, field
investigations revealed the alertness, understanding and willingness of respondents in relevant
communities to be excellent prospects for introducing an early warning system. Residents in
vulnerable communities displayed both a high level of education, but also a sense of belonging to
the area and, consequently, a willingness to participate in disaster preparedness trainings. During
project preparation, several risks were identified, and mitigation measures suggested. They are
shown below.

Implementation

2.2.1 Factors that have affected general implementation progress

Some factors that have affected implementation of the LSRMP have served to support effectiveness
and sustainability of the project, while others have hindered timely implementation. Overall,
however, none of the factors that affected implementation undermined the achievement of the
project's objective and component outcomes. The factors are listed below:

Difficult working environment: The primary external factors that affected implementation in the
early stages were associated with post conflict situation in Tajikistan including: (i) the difficult
working environment in the region, and availability of qualified local contractors; (ii) the security
and safety concerns to work in Tajikistan; (iii) transportation means to Lake Sarez; and (iv) weak
governance, especially lack of Government's proper financial management controls, particularly
within the Sarez Agency. These factors influenced the decision of international firms to participate
in the tender process for the supply and installation of the monitoring and early warning systems.
As a result, two procurement processes were abandoned between August 2001-August 2002, and a
third procurement process had to be launched in early September 2002.

Governance within the Sarez Agency: The independence of the Sarez Agency (SA) and its lack of
accountability to the Ministry of Finance on the use of funds resulted in poor financial management.
This caused the Bank to consider the project formally as a problem project with an unsatisfactory
rating in implementation progress and to request the MoF to put in place a more stringent financial
management system for the project. The adoption of such system and the eventual removal of the
project from the SA, entrusting the implementation to the Project Coordination Team (PCT) first
and Usoi Department later, allowed the project to once again move forward.

Limited knowledge about World Bank procurement rules: The limited understanding among
staff within the MESCD, who participated in the evaluation committee, about World Bank
procurement procedures led to substantial delays with the procurement of the supply and installation
of the M&EWS. It took the PCT more than 4 months to clear the evaluation report internally within
the MESCD after completing the full evaluation.

The risks identified above were mitigated in the following manner:

Timely involvement of the World Bank's team and close supervision: The team played a key
role in supporting all phases of the project, from identification to closure. The staff has provided


                                                     8

constant assistance to the counterpart and responded promptly to enquiries and request of assistance.
The project was supervised closely; when shortcomings were identified, solutions were punctually
proposed and followed-up until concrete action was taken.

Good coordination among project co-financiers: The project involved a number of components
financed by distinct donors. Close coordination among donors was therefore of key importance for
quality implementation of the project. The donors' representatives and project dedicated team kept
close communication and exchange of relevant information through out the operation.

Availability of additional co-financing when needed: To ensure full coverage of the communities
at risk and enhance the sustainability of the project, it was concluded that more effort had to be put
in protection of socio-economic infrastructure, improvement of communication between villages,
removal of bottle necks on the roads connecting the communities, development of community-based
livelihood activities as well as additional capacity building of the implementing agency. The
additional funding required to implement these components was provided with a JSDF and a PHRD
grant.

2.2.2 Specific factors that affected implementation progress by component:

Component A: Monitoring and Early Warning System ­ delays in awarding the contract for the
procurement and installation of the monitoring and early warning systems (M&EW) systems
postponed the implementation of this component and, as a consequence, the entire project. In the
summer of 2005, the Government of Tajikistan requested a one year extension of the project
implementation period to allow the staff of the Ministry of Emergency Service and Civil Defense
(MESCD) to be become acquainted with the new M&EW system, of which installation had been
completed only few months earlier.

Component A1: Design and technical assistance. The delays in awarding the contract for the
procurement and installation of the EWS and MS reflected on the overall timing of delivery of the
technical assistance. However, once the contract for procurement and installation of the M&EW
systems was awarded the TA component progressed at consistent pace. A moderate expansion of
the scope of services of the technical assistance consultant to facilitate complementary site
investigations was agreed in June 2001.

Component A2: Equipment supply, installation, training and spare parts. Initial delays
occurred in this sub-component because of the difficulty in hiring a qualified contractor to procure
and install the monitoring and early warning systems. Several firms withdrew their bids based on
the following four factors: (i) deterioration of security in the region after 9/11 and the consequent
military operations in Afghanistan, (ii) diversity and variety of the equipment included in the bid,
(iii) the difficult working environment, (iv) remoteness, and (v) unskilled local sub-contractors. The
procurement process was amended to address these issues, however there were some additional
delays due to the lack of transparency in the procurement process and delays in the evaluation
report.

Eventually, the contract for supply and installation of the M&EW systems was awarded to a
contractor in July 2003. Once the contract had been awarded no further delays occurred in the




                                                    9

implementation of this sub-component. The monitoring and early warning systems were installed in
December 2004.

Component A3: The Panel of Experts (POE) has been maintained during project implementation,
and has been instrumental in advising the Government of Tajikistan at critical milestones. The
composition of the POE envisaged at the beginning of the project had to be revised because it was
overbalanced in theoretical seismology and tectonics. The POE was eventually formed by experts
in seismology, meteorology and hydrogeology and substantially contributed to the implementation
of the project from a technical and scientific stand point. This final POE comprised three expert
members, one national (chair) and two internationals.

Component B: The main factor that affected the implementation of this component was initial
issues with the quality of physical infrastructures and cache containers provided as well as with the
planning for training. The implementing NGO was chosen based on an excellent track record
working within the affected communities. During the project implementation, however, it lagged
behind in providing continuous support during the execution of this component. Emergency caches
that were built in approved sites deteriorated quickly and the stocks were not replenished
satisfactorily. By January 2004, this component was downgraded from highly satisfactory to
satisfactory because of the limited attention by the implementing NGO to complete the activities
outline in their implementation plan. At this point it was agreed that they had to submit a detailed
plan to complete the pending activities by September 2005 to the MESCD to conduct the joint
training of communities to operate the early warning system. By November 2005, the implementing
NGO agreed on an implementation plan with the Usoi Department to be completed by the spring of
2006 that included: (i) conducting first-aid trainings in the Project Area; (ii) replenishing medical
supplies and other missing items in the cache containers; and (iii) conducting further community
trainings in disaster evacuation. By the closing of the project, the emergency caches had been
rebuilt and restocked, and the outstanding trainings were performed in April 2007.

Component C: This component did not face any major challenges during implementation,
primarily because once the panel of experts (POE) was formed, they offered guidance to the
consultant to develop long-term strategies for the mitigation of risk around Lake Sarez. The POE
expects to meet in May 2007 to hold a multi-stakeholder workshop, funded by UNISDR, to further
discuss some of their findings and to explore possibilities for the extension of the existing
monitoring system.

Component D: Because of changes in the management of this component, the implementation of
the institutional strengthening component faced delays. Under the design of the project, the Sarez
Agency was to be formed to manage and coordinate activities pertaining to Lake Sarez. Lack of
initial capacity within this Agency, however, led to poor performance in project management and,
most notably, in financial management procedures. By February 2002, the management of this
component was formally transferred; first to a Project Coordination Team (PCT) for the general
implementation of all components; and at the end of 2004, once the Early Warning and Monitoring
systems had been installed and component B completed, to the Usoi Department for the operation
and maintenance of the systems. In the initial phase, many of the capacity building activities
planned under this project were directed to the staff of the Sarez Agency. With the transfer of
responsibilities, however, the staff of the Usoi Department became the main beneficiaries of the
training, specifically on operation and maintenance of the M&EWS. This lack of continuity


                                                   10

reduced the efficacy of the training delivered and resulted in some limitations in the capacity built
within the institutions responsible for disaster management and awareness. These limitations
concern particularly data analysis and management.




Figure 1: Implementation arrangements and structure at appraisal; when the Sarez Agency was dissolved because of
poor financial management and accountability, a technical PCT (2002-2004), and the Usoi Department (2005-end of
project), ultimate responsible for O&M of the M&EW systems, took responsibility for project implementation.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The components of the project were designed to cover not only improvements in infrastructure, such
as early warning and monitoring systems, but also to enhance the ability of communities to interact
with local governments and other stakeholders to prepare and respond to potential disasters. At
design, the monitoring and evaluation indicators intended to capture increased ability of the
implementing partners and beneficiaries as well as measure the physical outputs. Key outputs under
the M&E framework included: (i) Proportion of vulnerable communities able to implement disaster
management plans and to contact authorities within minutes from the disaster onset; (ii)
Government and NGO personnel are able to predict occurrence of a disaster and to respond
effectively when a disaster occurs; (iii) Increased dialogue and financial support for Lake Sarez
disaster mitigation and prevention issues through new partnership with the international and
scientific community; (iv) Monitoring System and Early Warning System work and people know
how to use them.

During project implementation, the key output indicators progressed in a satisfactory manner. Yet
while the indicators were fulfilled it is difficult to ascertain whether the quantifiable indicators used
during implementation accurately capture the improvements and achievements made. This is


                                                         11

especially true for indicators that aimed to measure improvements in dialogue, capacity, or
awareness, since many of the key output and impact indicators in the results framework used
quantifiable units. Qualitative assessments done at the field level confirm that there has been a
positive impact in both the enhanced understanding and capacity acquired by local communities to
prepare and mitigate for a disaster. Yet this highlights an important lesson learned for future
projects that hope to gauge the levels of improvement in "soft" indicators. The improved capacity
of communities, local NGOs, and local government officials is crucial to the sustainability of the
project, since these stakeholders will be responsible for continued operation and maintenance of the
monitoring and early warning systems as well as updating know-how in the face of potential
disasters. In the end, projects dependent on such processes will have to be assessed using qualitative
indicators, supplemented by human judgment, rather than mere numerical indicators, to evaluate
performance and progress. This judgment should be as objective and expert as possible.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards: The project triggered the following safeguard policies:


                        Safeguard Policies                            Applicability
                                                                 Yes                  No

Compliance with all safeguards triggered has been rated satisfactory or highly satisfactory for the
entire duration of the operation. This assessment was based on the fact that (a) the project had no
negative effect on the local environment as well as no substantial alteration to the existing pre-
investment conditions; (b) the project reduced the risks posed by Lake Sarez to indigenous people,
and benefited local communities through enhanced access to services and communication; while
this safeguard was triggered in 2000, when the project was designed, it will not be today, given the
better understanding of Tajikistan's demography and ethnical distribution; (c) the risk posed by
Lake Sarez was reduced by the project, and the general understanding of the Usoi's landslide-dam-
lake system was improved and deepened; and (d) water flows and management have not been
altered from pre-project conditions.

Fiduciary

The Project Implementing Agency, Usoi Department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations and
Civil Defense, submitted to the Bank acceptable regular quarterly financial monitoring reports.
Project financial statements have been audited by acceptable-to-IDA audit firms on an annual basis,
and satisfactory audit reports together with project financial statements have been submitted to the
Bank. The Project's Team maintained appropriate internal control environment although there were


                                                      12

weaknesses of the performance of the Sarez Agency, which was responsible for project
implementation at the beginning of the project implementation.

The audit of the project financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 will be carried
out by an audit firm selected under the block audit arrangements. Audit report and financial
statements for the final year will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30 2007.

Procurement

Procurement under the project is rated satisfactory, on the basis that procurement guidelines were
followed despite limited prior knowledge of the Bank's procurement procedures. The weak
capacity in procurement was foreseen, and adequately addressed in the project design through a
requirement that stipulated 100 percent review of procurement. This requirement explains some of
the delays in concluding contracts since it required review and approval by the Bank team.
Nevertheless, the project continued to move ahead, and the counterparts seemed satisfied with the
procurement arrangements.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The following section outlines the planned transfer of responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of the monitoring and early warning systems by component:

Component A: Monitoring and Early Warning Systems. The proposed arrangements for the
operation and maintenance of the monitoring and early warning system is designed to build on the
technical assistance provided by the Government of Switzerland that trained technicians, scientists
and local communities in disaster prevention measures. Under this component, a monitoring and an
early warning system was designed, installed and operational assistance was funded by the
Government of Switzerland for a period of three years. However, since the installation of the
system took 5 instead of 2 years, the extra operational assistance after installation had to be reduced
to 1 year, but even this represented an additional service, for which a contract amendment was
concluded (see section 2.2.2, 1st par.). After this time, the proposed arrangement at appraisal
indicates commitment on the part of the Government of Tajikistan to provide an annual budget to
the Sarez Agency to cover operating expenses such as utilities, salary of support staff, rental of
office space and other miscellaneous expenses. In addition, the Government of Tajikistan will
provide an annual budget to cover the associated operation and maintenance expenses.1 Since the
Sarez Agency was dismantled, the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the
monitoring and early warning systems have been transferred to the Usoi Department, whose staff
was trained, very committed and managed the M&EW systems satisfactorily until the end of the
project.

Component B: Social Training and Safety Related Supplies. This component built on active civil
society groups in the region identified during appraisal that worked to develop local capabilities for
effective rescue and recovery assistance and for community self-help during and after the potential
disaster. Additional financing under this component was used to address the livelihoods needs of

the communities, by allocating funds towards improving access to markets through road
improvement projects and other basic infrastructure improvements. At appraisal, local NGOs
expressed their readiness to develop methods for organizing and assisting community-level disaster
preparedness and for implementing community training for natural disasters. Since these local
NGOs have a long history of engagement in the area, it is presumed that they will continue to
remain active in these communities and dedicated to the needs associated with potential disasters
around Lake Sarez, and that their initiatives will build on capacity financed through this component.

Component C: Studies and Long Term Solutions. Under this component, the consultant had to
critically review and integrate previous analyses of Lake Sarez, and to determine possible solutions
for its effective and sustainable management. A major output of this component was to develop a
series of studies and to propose possible long-term solutions to mitigate risk around Lake Sarez.
The Government of Switzerland financed consultancy services to review past studies and design
concepts on Lake Sarez, and carry out complementary desk studies to develop possible long-term
solutions for risk mitigation based on an accurate understanding of the hydrogeology of Lake Sarez
and the magnitude of risk posed by the landslide-dam-lake system. The findings and analysis were
submitted for input and comments to the Panel of Experts (POE). While there is no arrangement for
continued studies at this time, at the closing of the project, local experts were furnished with up-to-
date and accurate information on the risk potential, and were involved in developing potential
solutions to address these issues. A workshop has been scheduled for May 2007 to discuss the
studies and to help further develop long-term solutions and discuss follow-up interventions, which
may be deemed necessary to capture any changes in the hydrogeology and risk regimes of Lake
Sarez (see section 4).

Component D: Institutional Strengthening. The purpose of this component was to develop the
institutional capacity of the newly created Sarez Agency, which was designed to coordinate between
the Usoi Department and the Territory and Population Protection Department under the Ministry of
Emergency and Civil Defense. Staff assigned to the Sarez Agency were to be trained in project
management, audit and financial/procurement support, and the operation and maintenance of
monitoring and early warning systems. In this way, the Sarez Agency would have been able to take
over the management of the monitoring and early warning systems at the close of the project in
December 2006. In 2004, once the M&EWS were installed and the management responsibility
transferred to the Usoi department, the project initially financed the incremental operating costs
related to project management and the operation and maintenance costs of the monitoring and early
warning systems. Donor financing for these activities has been gradually decreased and, by the
project closing, the Government of Tajikistan has assumed full responsibility for costs associated
with operation and maintenance of M&EWS, and the management responsibility lays with the
newly trained and equipped "Department for Management of the Usoi System and Lake Sarez
Problem" (DMUSLSP); this department was created after the closure of the project by merging the
Usoi Department and Sarez Directorate, under the Committee of Emergency and Civil Defense.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives set for the project were reasonable within the timeframe and cost of implementation
of the project, and relevant in the context of the natural hazard posed by Lake Sarez. At design, a



                                                    14

QAG report commended the team on extensive preparation and a detailed PAD, and assessed the
LSRMP as being well prepared and a convincing operation.

While aiming at strengthening the capacity of the GOT to manage the risk posed by Lake Sarez, the
project design gave emphasis to the importance of building awareness among the communities
directly at risk of natural disasters ­large scale/low frequency and vice versa- and to bring the
preparedness and response capacity to the lowest level possible, while maintaining strong linkages
between local and national capacities to prepare and respond to a natural disaster. This element of
dual capacity, centralized and decentralized, is even more significant when the people at risk live in
very remote areas, hardly accessible and with limited access to emergency supplies and equipment.
The additional funding mobilized to strengthen Component B reflects the strong commitment within
the project to strengthen capacity and resilience at the local level.

The implementation strategy and arrangements were suitable to the context of the Republic of
Tajikistan and to the socio-economic and geographic characteristics of target territory. Issues and
delays in implementation were mostly caused by: (i) delays in procurement (as explained above in
Section 2.2 Component A); and (ii) initial substandard quality of construction works and supply
under component B implemented by the partner NGO. However these factors could not have been
predicted during the appraisal phase and, because of close supervision by Bank staff, by the end of
the project the components were completed satisfactorily. Given the capacity constraints in
Tajikistan, the implementation arrangements represented the best possible scenario.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The primary objective of Lake Sarez Risk Mitigation Project was to help alert and prepare
vulnerable people in case of a disaster associated with an outburst flood from Lake Sarez and other
more frequent natural hazards such as mudslides, rockfalls, avalanches, and seasonal floods. The
project aimed at building national capacity to plan, coordinate, promote and implement sustainable
mitigation and preparedness activities for Lake Sarez. Specifically, the project assisted in: (i)
enhancing the original monitoring system of Lake Sarez and establishing a community-based early
warning system; (ii) enhancing prevention, mitigation and preparedness capabilities of communities
at risk; (iii) preparing a long-term strategy to deal with the risks and resources associated with Lake
Sarez; and (iv) strengthening national capacity. The project represented an initial, fast-track
operation of modest size compared with the magnitude of the problem, and addressed the immediate
needs of the communities at risk in Tajikistan, while seeking longer-term solutions to this complex
issue.

The primary objective was achieved satisfactorily through the implementation of the components
and sub-components. The factors which have affected the general implementation, determining the
satisfactory rating have been described in detail in section 2.2. In the following paragraphs each
component is evaluated separately.

Component A: Monitoring and Early Warning Systems.

 Rating           S

The Monitoring and Early Warning Systems were installed in December 2004 and since then have
been operated and maintained by the Usoi Department. Additional communication equipment,

provided under JSDF is operated locally by the communities. The M&EWS comprise of the (i)
Monitoring Units, with their own independent power supplies, the measurements devices and the
raw data preparation for transmission; and (ii) the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
(SCADA) with data collection, preparation, calculation, storage, presentation and with command
generation and coordination tasks between the Dam house and Dushanbe. The components of the
Monitoring System are used to trigger alarms and are integrated into the Early Warning System. The
first measurements campaign, using the monitoring system have been carried out and the data
analyzed to assess the status of the lake and its dynamic behavior. The Usoi Department staff has
received training in the operation and maintenance of the monitoring and early warning systems.
However the training and capacity building efforts were not always efficient because of the lack of
basic knowledge (e.g. computer skills) of the trained personnel. There seems to still be needs for
continuous capacity building for operation of M&EWS data retrieval and processing and
maintenance.

Component B: Social Training and Safety Related Supplies.

 Rating          S

All vulnerable communities identified, developed disaster management plans and organized
response groups in case of emergency; they received disaster mitigation training and first aid
training. Evacuation paths and safe heavens had been identified and established. However, despite
familiarity of the project area and a promising start, the implementing partner's performance raised
some concerns over the quality of the delivery and specifically on sub-standard infrastructure
rehabilitation and quality of supplies (Mid-Term review 2003). The implementing partner was
urged by the Government of Tajikistan and by the Bank to rectify the situation, and took action
accordingly. By the Last Supervision Mission ­ September 2006- the situation had improved and
the shortcomings largely rectified and stockpiles had been replaced. The NGO provided additional
funding from their core budget to ensure the achievement of the objective.

A dry-run of the Early Warning System took place in April 2007, after considerable delays, to allow
installment of additional communication equipment in some of the villages covered by the JSDF
financing.

Component C: Long Term Solutions.

 Rating          S

No major event has affected the implementation of this component and the results are of great value
for a more holistic understanding of the landslide-dam-lake system and the risk entailed. The study
of the long term solutions to minimize the probability of failure of the Usoi dam and to mitigate the
overall risk posed by the landslide-dam-lake system, was completed and delivered in 2005. It
assessed a set of economically viable solutions to mitigate the risk and use Lake Sarez as a resource
for economic development. The solutions studied comprise: (i) lowering the lake level (including
commercial generation of hydropower); (ii) engineering the Usoi dam; and (iii) measures to reduce
the impact of failure. The output from this component was used in a multi-stakeholder workshop,
organized by UNDP International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) and held in Dushanbe in
May 2007, to discuss long-term solutions for Lake Sarez, as well as possible follow up interventions.
The outcome of this conference was two fold: (i) it was assessed that ­ as a result of the LSRMP-


                                                   16

there is a general better understanding of the risk posed by the landslide-dam-lake system and better
preparedness both locally and at national level; and (ii) eliminating the risk by controlled lowering
of lake level by the construction of a hydropower plant was identified as the most promising long
term solution. The feasibility of the hydropower solution has much better perspectives now that
when it was studied in 2002, due to: a) increased international oil/ energy prices; b) interest of
external buyers (Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan), willing to purchase electricity at tariffs not currently
sustainable in Tajikistan.

Component D: Institutional Strengthening.

 Rating            MS

The implementation of this component underwent some difficulties because of changes that
occurred in project management responsibilities throughout the project (see Section 2.2 Component
D). The capacities of the GOT and of the MESCD were very low at entry, and the project design
had been over-optimistic to envisage that adequate capacity be achieved within the project duration.
Excellent capacity in computer, GPS and GIS systems is crucial for the correct operation and
maintenance of the M&EW systems as well as for complex data analysis. The Usoi Department,
which was eventually targeted for capacity building by the project ­ see section 2.2 Component D
for factors that have affected implementation of this component- did not have previous capacity and
had to be trained from the basics. In addition, while the Usoi Department has shown a capability to
mobilize and coordinate cooperation from other governmental and research institutions, this
cooperation has not been institutionalized to ensure that it occurs on a regular and formalized basis.

3.3      Efficiency

The project was judged to be cost-effective because of the relatively small investments needed per
potential life saved due to risk mitigation measures around Lake Sarez. The analysis used the cost-
per (statistical)-life-saved and the cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) saved as
measures to assess the cost worthiness of the investment. This indicator is still used by some
government agencies to assess safety measures (not necessarily associated with dams). The cost-per
(statistical)-life-saved for this project was found to be in the order of US$232.

A comparison for this value was carried out on the basis of international benchmarks. The cost per
DALY saved for this project was in line with the range acceptable under the standards established in
the 1993 World Development Report (i.e., less than US$250 per DALY saved).

The funds available for the project have been disbursed according to the initial cost estimation, with
funds un-disbursed due to advantageous exchange rate during the project implementation.
Moreover the additional funds received by the project for parallel livelihood activities (JSDF) in the
Bartang and Pyanj's communities have enhanced the overall impact of the LSRMP, fostering its
sustainability at local level. The equipment installed is a tremendous step ahead to reduce the risk
of life loss associated with a flood wave from Lake Sarez. The funds have been spent according to
procurement rules. Hence, taking into account the remoteness of the project's location and
complexity of the equipment procured and installed, all funds are considered as spent efficiently.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 Rating           S

The overall objective and outputs of the project were achieved satisfactorily, and this is particularly
remarkable in light of the complexity of the country context, the changes in implementation
arrangements and the dynamic regional situation. In addition to financing a state-of-the-art Early
Warning and Monitoring System, the project was able to leverage parallel financing to provide
relatively isolated local communities with a means of communication and improving access roads.
With USD 470,000 IDA financing the project mobilized more than 10 times as much of parallel
financing, at the beginning and during project implementation including JSDF.

The LSRMP has been an outstanding example of effective donor coordination, leverage of financing
and synergy of resources. The Ministry of Emergency Situation and Civil Defense was regularly
supported by an active POE. The local population acquired further understanding of the hazards
posed by the lake as well as those caused by the hydrogeology of GBAO, characterized by high
mountains, spare vegetation and erratically distributed seasonal precipitation. Gabion walls and
other simple engineering solutions were used to protect housing and economic assets from recurrent
floods, landslides and mudslides.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project, in conjunction with the JSDF, had a remarkable impact on the livelihoods of the local
communities, especially in the Bartang valley. The VHF and HF radios installed under the project
are well maintained and provide a vital means of communication among villagers; people can now
communicate medical emergencies as well as social events among villages. This is a significant
improvement for villages that were often isolated for several months of the year.

In addition, improvements made to the main access road in the Bartang valley, meant that 2006 was
the first winter that the entire community was not completely cutoff from the rest of the country and
from basic food and fuel supplies. The improvements in communication and in roads have meant
that previously isolated communities can build social capital in the region.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

In December 2006, the GOT announced a restructuring of several government ministries, including
the MESCD. As such, it is difficult to assess what the potential long-term impacts of the project
will be, given that the changes introduced have not yet clearly defined the operation and
maintenance of the monitoring and early warning systems, nor the responsible agency for
coordination with local stakeholders and beneficiaries.

On the local level, however, the improved access to the region and the introduction of radios has
meant that community institutions have been strengthened to better cope with possible disasters
from Lake Sarez. In addition, these improvements have led to better communication and interaction
between different villages, including for social events, which has strengthened the ability of these
communities to work together for a wide array of issues in the future.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Positive social and livelihood effects created by the social component and basic infrastructure (see
point a)

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Representatives from project's donors and the independent government M&E team participated in a
workshop organized to analyze the results of the project, the risk to its sustainability and the lessons
learned, on March 19 2007. The workshop's feedback on the achievement of the project was
positive and the stakeholders agreed on the important role that the LSRMP has played in mitigating
the risk posed by Lake Sarez on the population living downstream, in acquiring knowledge on the
complex landslide-dam-lake-RBL system, as well as improving the livelihood of the people living
in the Bartang and Pyanj valleys, which has been the project main positive externality.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating          M

Risks identified in project design. At the appraisal stage, the project was rated as posing a modest
risk. During preparation, the GOT confirmed its commitment, up to the level of the President, to the
project.

The project sustainability was to be enhanced by: (i) supporting operation and maintenance costs of
the monitoring and early warning systems on a declining basis during the first three years of their
operation; and (ii) by strengthening the capacity of the implementing agency and the communities at
risk.

The long-term sustainability of the project was to be determined by: (i) the adequate and timely
budget allocation to cover operation and maintenance costs of the monitoring and early warning
systems; and (ii) the communities' willingness and commitment to participate in the implementation
of disaster preparedness plans. During preparation, field investigations revealed the alertness,
understanding and willingness of respondents in relevant communities to be excellent prospects for
introducing an early warning system. Residents in vulnerable communities displayed both a high
level of education, but also a sense of belonging to the area and, consequently, a willingness to
participate in disaster preparedness trainings.

General risks to the sustainability of the overall objective of the project remain consistent with those
identified at project design:

The Usoi's Landslide-Dam-Lake-RBL system has been studied in depth during the project and it is
commonly agreed that the understanding of its behavior, under specific circumstances, is now better
understood. However the development of unexpected modes of failure cannot be completely ruled
out. Additionally, since 2005, due to increased inflow from the lake's tributaries and consequent
raise in the lake's average level, new springs have appeared in the Usoi landslide's canyon and
substantial movements of the Right Bank Landslide (RBL) have been registered by the monitoring
system. In light of this recent evolution of the Landslide-Dam-Lake-RBL system, additional work
is required. The risk that funding may not be available for this work needs to be considered and


                                                   19

efforts are required from the Government and donors to ensure adequate resources are regularly
mobilized.

The risks to effective sustainability of this original operation could be mitigated by a follow-up
project(s) addressing the safety of the Landslide-Dam-Lake-RBL system. Long-term solutions have
been extensively reviewed in the assessment and feasibility studies carried out in component C of
the Lake Sarez Risk Mitigation Project. Further action upon these studies' findings and
recommendations should be taken by the GoT and the donor community, to envisage a long-term
intervention on the lake that may also include commercial exploitation of its water for the
production of hydropower.

Lake Sarez is and will remain a regional problem (and potentially a water and energy resource) and
it should be regarded from this standpoint. In any follow-up activity the coverage by early warning
system of communities residing in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan should also be taken into account.

The risks to the sustainability of the achieved outputs, by component are summarized in the
following table:

                                                       Sarez Directorate) may cause a reduction in

                                            communication and system repairs.
                                            Without the appropriate training and
                                            financing, the monitoring system will face
                                            barriers to fulfilling its full potential in the
                                            medium and long term.

                                            analysis ­ such as Geology Institute and
                                            Seismic Committee- with the DMUSLSP.
                                            The DMUSLSP does not and cannot have
                                            full in-house capacity for this task and this
                                            collaboration needs to be assured in order
                                            to have all information properly analyzed.

                                            The DMUSLSP signed a contract for
                                            communication services, with the foreign
                                            organization that procured and installed the
                                            EW&M systems. The DMUSLSP sees the
                                            risk that untimely payments may result in a
                                            cancellation of the contract by the
                                            contractor; they fear that what is an
                                            acceptable delay in Tajikistan would not be
                                            the same abroad.


Component B: poor maintenance of            Negligible to low
communication equipment, safe heavens,
evacuation paths and stock piles.           Communities have shown commitment to
                                            the operation and maintenance of the
                                            equipment and emergency facilities
                                            provided under the project. The continuous
                                            presence and engagement with
                                            communities of national and international
                                            humanitarian organizations that
                                            participated in project implementation
                                            should also guarantee adequate assistance
                                            to the local population when required.


Component C: Insufficient follow up on      Negligible to Low
additional studies and long term solutions.
                                            The study presented on long term solutions
                                            has been well received by stakeholders and

                                         a follow-up conference on long term
                                         solutions for Lake Sarez is already been
                                         organized for May 2007. A recent
                                         development, over the past two years,
                                         reported by the Usoi Department, have
                                         been substantial rises in the lake level over
                                         short periods of time, during snow melting
                                         season, up to 25 cm/day, and the
                                         concurrent appearance of new springs in
                                         the dam face and canyon sides. This led to
                                         flooding downstream that destroyed a
                                         monitoring station, its access bridge and
                                         portion of the foot path to the dam house.
                                         Additionally, small movements and sliding
                                         of part of the Right Bank Landslide have
                                         been registered. Such developments
                                         underscore the importance of this project
                                         (e.g. in organizing protection of
                                         downstream villages), but also the need for
                                         continuing engagement of the international
                                         community.

                                         The long-term solutions identified in the
                                         Study are costly; therefore fund
                                         mobilization for their implementation
                                         remains a challenge in Tajikistan. The
                                         possibility to link the mitigation measures
                                         with production of hydropower offers a
                                         concrete option to increase the cost-
                                         effectiveness of the investment.

                                         Given the recent ­since 2005- evolvement
                                         of the system, (see above), the POE (See
                                         POE last report, September 2005) has
                                         recommended further studies in and
                                         drilling of the RBL. The funding and
                                         technical capacity required for this activity
                                         pose a challenge for the GOT.


Component D: Institutional Strengthening Moderate

                                         The achievement of this outcome has been
                                         hindered during implementation because of
                                         the low initial capacity of the implementing
                                         agency and its staff, as well as the necessity
                                         to have the original director removed and

                                                     By the end of the project, the capacity of
                                                     the staff of the Usoi Department was built;

                                                     into a Committee and the merger of the
                                                     Usoi Department with the Sarez

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating          S

The IDA team worked closely with the Government and provided expert input during the
preparation of the project. It took into account lessons learned from previous investments. It
identified risks to project implementation as well as to its sustainability. The QAG commented that
the preparation for such emergency intervention had been lengthy (11 months) and that the PAD
was very elaborate for such a small loan; however, on balance, the LSRMP was assessed as a well
prepared and convincing operation.


(b)     Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

 Rating          S

The project supervision was frequent and comprehensive. The Bank's team visited the project site
several times during implementation and offered expert assistance and advice. The aide memoires
and ISRs were compiled comprehensively and offered a clear snapshot of the project progress and
constraints on the ground. Issues were addressed timely and the government appreciated the
responsiveness of the Bank. Although the Government and implementing partner found some of the

Bank's procedure for financial management and procurement burdensome, the team provided
assistance to help them comply with the requirements.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating           S

In light of the above rating and justification, the Bank performed satisfactorily and provided the
necessary expertise and support to the Borrower and its PIUs.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

 Rating           MS


 Ministry of Emergency Situation and Civil Defense            MS

The Government of Tajikistan was and remains very committed to the problem of Lake Sarez. It
keeps the hazard posed by the lake to the population at high priority in its agenda and received
positively the outputs of the project. However, during project implementation, a holistic
engagement of all relevant governmental technical units was not fully realized. There was not
enough coordination between the bodies directly targeted by the project and those that although not
direct beneficiaries, had valuable expertise for the analysis of the information collected by the
monitoring system, namely the geology institute and the department of hydrology and meteorology.
The latter were provided training but did not have incentive to collaborate. The situation remained
the same at the moment of the completion report.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance


Rating          S


Sarez Agency                      Unsatisfactory
PCT                               Satisfactory
Usoi Department                   Satisfactory

The first PIU, the Sarez Agency, performed unsatisfactorily since it failed to establish an acceptable
financial management system. In 2002, when the management of the project was transferred to a
small Project Coordination Team (PCT) the overall performance improved and the project
management and progress could be rated satisfactory. At the time of this managerial review, it was
decided that the Usoi Department would take the leadership in managing the Early Warning and
Monitoring systems in the long term. By beginning of 2005, when the systems were fully installed,
the management of the project passed to the Usoi department, which performed in a satisfactory
manner until the closure of the project in December 2006.

( c )   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating           MS

The operating environment in Tajikistan remains challenging and the Government has limited
financial resources to mobilize all the required expertise for a project as complex as LSRMP.
Nevertheless, the Government understands and remains committed to reducing the threat posed by
Lake Sarez. The MESCD made a remarkable effort to identify and engage adequate staff for the
project, and although problems arose, it had a proactive and constructive attitude in addressing
them.

6.      Lessons Learned

The LSRMP provided five important lessons learned for future projects:

Importance of community involvement in disaster risk management and the positive impact of
the parallel social components: Community involvement in risk reduction operations of this kind,
particularly in such remote locations, is key to their success. Community engagement and sustained
participation, including project activities to enhance local livelihood and communication facilities,
granted the adequate environment for component A and B to be effectively implemented; and upon
project completion, provide a strong basis for future operation and maintenance of the equipment
and facilities delivered by the project. The project also had a positive social impact due to the
additional simple communication and access measures for local communities, provided by the
parallel financing, i.e. the JSDF. Specifically, these target communities clearly benefit directly from
the project design that mitigates the risk that local residents face from potential disasters around
Lake Sarez, while also enjoying improvements to their livelihoods accrued by small initiatives in
the project that enhanced economic development. For example, clearing of roads has meant that
relatively isolated villages are now able to enjoy greater access to larger towns and neighboring
villages. In addition, the warning system included the distribution of radios that the residents have
been able to use to communicate with each other, not only about disaster management issues, but
also about social events. This has greatly benefited the local communities, and has enhanced the
sustainability of community involvement.

Linking M&E indicators with intended outcomes required qualitative data: Generally, it is
difficult to design a cost effective monitoring and evaluation systems for operations that involved
intensive training activities as part of the institutional strengthening and capacity building
component. Monitoring the effectiveness and quality of training has been a challenge. It is difficult
to monitor and assess the capacity developed at community level with a quantitative indicator.
Many of the indicators developed during project design focused on the number of trainings held, or
the number of people trained, giving little indication of the quality of the training, or that the quality
of the training would help to ensure the project's sustainability through the enhanced ability of
beneficiaries to execute disaster preparedness plans. Therefore, in addition to the usual M&E
framework, for operations that require qualitative assessment of outputs, the M&E component
should include a qualitative assessment, by means of a structured survey of the abilities acquired
through the project activities and training.




                                                      25

Monitoring project implementation in remote and difficult areas was challenging: In the initial
phase of the project, given the remoteness of the target communities and the relative independence
of the operation managed and financed by the implementing NGO, monitoring on the progress of
the social component (financed in parallel) was challenging. Lack of regular monitoring also
delayed decisions on actions necessary to improve the performance under the component (see
section 2.2.2). Subsequently, an independent monitoring system was established to supervise the
activities undertaken by the same NGO under separate financing provided by the JSDF [Reducing
Poverty in High Mountain Environments around Lake Sarez]. This monitoring system ensured
regular supervision of project activities by an independent team of monitors, who reported to the
GoT and to the donors. Although not directly monitoring progress and achievement of component
B, this monitoring arrangement also help channel information and feedback to the GoT and the
donors, on the activities implemented under LSRMP. Therefore, a similar monitoring framework is
a good example of effective monitoring and could be extended to other operations of this kind.

Importance of convening experts for advisory services: The Panel of Experts (POE) maintained
during project implementation has been instrumental in advising the Government of Tajikistan at
critical milestones of project implementation. However, the project highlighted the importance of
the composition of a POE. The first POE was reconsidered after the first meeting, after it became
clear that (i) the panel exhibited an academic bias towards theoretical seismology and tectonics; and
(ii) some experts tended to dominate discussions based on seniority, grade level, or background,
leaving little room for consensus building. A second POE was appointed by mid-2002, which was
kept through the end of the project. Some of the lessons learned that guided the selection of the
second POE, which should have guided that selection of the first POE, included: (a) the most
effective POE are very small (2 to 4 members) and the members are carefully chosen to cover each
of the major disciplines involved in the project; (b) the best type of Board member is a mature
individual with an established technical reputation and with wide practical experience; (c) the ability
of the expert to work in a team, and to actively participate in consensus building is crucial; and (d)
when forming the POE the client should not only ask each potential member whether they would be
willing to serve on the POE but also whether they would be willing to serve together with other
potential POE members.

Addressing institutional arrangements: The failure of the Sarez Agency in leading and managing
the project satisfactorily was related to governance; and the identification of a suitable
implementing agency remained one of the challenges faced in the first years of project
implementation. The lesson that can be drawn form this experience is that, at an early stage of the
project's preparation, the borrower should be supported in a thorough analysis of its implementation
capacity. For a project that entails this complexity and requires high level of technical competence,
the implementing agency should be identified with a well-established administrative body, with
strong and reliable leadership, both of which are likely to remain and be strengthened throughout the
operation. However, when the projects is implemented in a context presenting broader governance
problems, fiduciary setbacks should be anticipated at the design phase, and potential delays factored
in to the implementation strategy and schedule.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower appreciated the support received by the World Bank's project team and the partner
donors throughout the project. They expressed satisfaction on the advice received from supervision
missions and subsequent detailed aide memories.

The Implementing Agency claimed that the need to become acquainted with and apply procedures,
had delayed implementation by 6 months; this was said to be valid for both LSRMP and JSDF.

(b)    Cofinanciers

The cofinanciers expressed satisfaction with the project's achievements and the close coordination
maintained throughout the operations. They have expressed concerns on the risks of effective and
durable operation and maintenance of the Early Warning and Monitoring System, as well as on the
recent restructuring of the MESCD.

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

The implementing NGO rated its performance as satisfactory, given the achievement of the project,
and their role in improvements to communities' livelihood. The NGO also commented on the
complexity of the Bank's procurement procedures.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Monitoring and Early Warning Systems.
The Monitoring and Early Warning Systems were installed in December 2004 and since then have
been operated and maintained by the Usoi Department. Additional communication equipment,
provided under JSDF is operated locally by the communities. The M&EWS comprise of the (i)
Monitoring Units, with their own independent power supplies, the measurements devices and the
raw data preparation for transmission; and (ii) the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
(SCADA) with data collection, preparation, calculation, storage, presentation and with command
generation and coordination tasks between the Dam house and Dushanbe. The components of the
Monitoring System are used to trigger alarms and are integrated into the Early Warning System. The
first measurements campaign, using the monitoring system have been carried out and the data
analyzed to assess the status of the lake and its dynamic behavior.

Component B: Social Training and Safety Related Supplies.
All vulnerable communities identified, developed disaster management plans and organized
response groups in case of emergency; they received disaster mitigation training and first aid
training. Evacuation paths and safe heavens had been identified and established. Stockpiles were
placed at safe heavens and communities have been maintaining them with the support of the local
NGO. A dry-run of the Early Warning System took place in April 2007, after considerable delays,
to allow installment of additional communication equipment in some of the villages covered by the
JSDF financing.

Component C: Long Term Solutions for Lake Sarez.
The study of the long term solutions to minimize the probability of failure of the Usoi dam and to
mitigate the overall risk posed by the landslide-dam-lake system, was completed and delivered in
2005. It assessed a set of economically viable solutions to mitigate the risk and use Lake Sarez as a
resource for economic development. The solutions studied comprise: (i) lowering the lake level
(including commercial generation of hydropower); (ii) engineering the Usoi dam; and (iii) measures
to reduce the impact of failure.

Component D: Institutional Strengthening.
The implementation of this component underwent some difficulties because of changes that
occurred in project management responsibilities throughout the project (see Section 2.2 Component
D). The capacities of the GOT and of the MESCD were very low at entry, and the project design
had been over-optimistic to envisage that adequate capacity be achieved within the project duration.
Excellent capacity in computer, GPS and GIS systems is crucial for the correct operation and
maintenance of the M&EW systems as well as for complex data analysis. The Usoi Department,
which was eventually targeted for capacity building by the project ­ see section 2.2 Component D
for factors that have affected implementation of this component- did not have previous capacity and
had to be trained from the basics.

The outputs under each of the components were fully achieved by the time the project closed. The
table below shows the progress made on each of the outcome indicators as well as of the output
indicators that measured the progress made under each component. Information from PAD and ISRs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project's effectiveness did not use standard economic and financial indicators, but rather based
its analysis of cost effectiveness on the potential lives saved because of reduced vulnerability to
natural hazards (either the high magnitude, low frequency event as represented by an outburst flood
from Lake Sarez, or the low magnitude, high frequency events such as rockfalls and seasonal
floodings, which are common in the project area). This project directly benefited about 19,000
people located in the Bartang and 130,000 along the Tajik side of the Pyanj River (Rushan Region
of the Gorno-Badakstan Autonomous Oblast) by improving their alertness and preparedness to
natural disasters. A substantial portion of the project cost went to protect the population most at risk,
about 19,000 inhabitants living in the Bartang valley just below the lake, by providing them with an
early waning system based on an automatic protocol.

The project also generated substantial indirect benefits by reducing the uncertainty associated with
hazard from Lake Sarez and by generating the basic information and producing the technical
capabilities used in the decision-making process for responding to the challenge of Lake Sarez, thus
indirectly benefiting the populations of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
(about 5,000,000 people) located in the Amu Darya river basin downstream from the lake.

On the basis of the cost-effectiveness analysis, this project was found to be a cost effective means of
protecting the lives of the poor. The analysis used the cost-per (statistical)-life-saved and the cost
per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved as measured to assess the cost worthiness of the
investment. The former indicator is used by some government agencies to assess safety measures
(not necessarily associated with dams).The cost-per (statistical)-life-saved for this project was found
to be in the order of US$232 (considering the immediate 19,000 beneficiaries of the Bartang valley).
The best comparison for this value would be the cost of an alternative life protection program or the
extra compensation required by workers in Tajikistan to undertake risky jobs. However, this
comparison is limited by the availability of reliable data. In the absence of this information,
comparison was carried out on the basis of international benchmarks.

The U.S. Federal Government practice in financing "Life-Protecting-Programs" considers the
justification of such programs as "Very Strong," when the cost per life saved is less than US$3
million. In this particular case, the project will invest four orders of magnitude less than the
minimum threshold considered by the U.S. Federal Government for a "Very Strong" justification of
the investment. Just for reference, values of a (statistical)-life saved based on extra compensation of
workers in the United States vary from US$1.0 million to US$8.0 million. The cost per DALY
saved for this project, based on rough estimates of the potential reduction in deaths (about 18,570),
the probability of the outburst flood from Lake Sarez (estimated at 5% and consistent with the value
given to an event considered" very unlikely"), and the number of lost DALYs represented by the
death of one person (about 23), was found in the order of US$ 194. A country specific comparison
is also limited by the availability of detailed cost-effectiveness studies in the country. Since no such
information has been verified to date, the original assumptions of the project hold, and the DALY
used makes the project cost effective.

Introduction:

Given the context and challenges underlying the project and the key role played by coordination
among stakeholders, a workshop was organized to allow participants to express their views on the
projects. Lessons learned risks to sustainability and challenges were discussed to capture the
achievements of the project and the areas where potential future operation could/should focus upon.
The workshop was directly attended by the donors and GoT; the views of the local communities
were voiced by the JSDF project's monitor and the representative of the Usoi Department.

Initial discussion

The first discussion focused on the project components' design and the following comments
were received from the participants:

In 1991 there was a pilot project implemented with fund from ECHO. The project installed a
manual Early Warning system and the population in the Bartang valley received training. During
this initial operation the stakeholders could assess that the Government's capacity at local level was
weak and there was not in depth knowledge, among its official about disaster preparedness and
management. The improvements happened slowly and were halted during the civil conflict. The
LSRMP, built upon this previous experience and both the local and central Governments were
strengthened.

This first local EWS was easier to operate by the people, however had the disadvantage of being
manual, therefore required somebody to press the button to give the alarm. It was also not linked to
a monitoring system and therefore data on Lake Sarez were not regularly collected and stored. A
stakeholder emphasized that the principle of decentralization is important also in disaster
preparedness and management. Given the remoteness of the communities at risk, they should have
some control on their EWS and be able to operate even if the central authorities could not respond.
All the equipment should be maintained and the communities should be trained continuously.

Leadership was key to the design and especially implementation of the LSRMP. The commitment
of the head of the Usoi Department and his dedication to the safety and wellbeing of the people of
the Bartang and Pyanj valleys provided additional positive momentum to the overall operation.

Local Government Departments and Institutions are closer to the people needs and are the first to be
contacted by the population in case of need. To build their capacity to enable them to respond
adequately to the population was important and yielded more durable results.

Contributions from the Japanese Government (ex: dam house building) could have begun earlier
and its activities could have started from the beginning of the project to achieve maximum
effectiveness.

For the last three years the behavior of Lake Sarez changed greatly. Without the Monitoring system
it would have been impossible to see the whole picture of its condition. The Monitoring system was
a key inclusion in the project components.

Factors that have affected implementation:

Component A:

The Government representatives and implementing partners commented that the WB's procurement
procedures were too complex and lengthy for their capacity. Particularly, during the first six months
of operations and then again in 2002 there were delayed as first the SA, and then the PCT had to
become acquainted with the procedures.




                                                   38

The Department depends on outside providers to operate and maintain the satellite communication
of the system. And fears that in case of delayed payments, quite common in the Tajik system of
business, may hamper the continuity of this supply.

The representative of SECO, commented that, in case of system failure the GOS might consider
providing assistance.

The stakeholders have expressed that the complex procurement procedure creates a feeling of
mistrust between the WB, the Government and the implementing agencies.

Component B:

Dry runs with the new EW equipment still remain to be performed; however the Department and the
FOCUS are planning to hold them by early April 2007.

Component C:

This component encountered implementation problems due to the changes that occurred in the
leadership and management of the project throughout its duration. The achievements of this
component would suffer if the Staff at charge of Lake Sarez's EW&M Systems and of the overall
management of the operations on Lake Sarez is replaced by new staff with no adequate capacity
and/or proper handover.

Risks

The stakeholders discussed the risks identified at appraisal to project implementation and risk
identified at closure for project sustainability.

They all agreed that the risks identified at appraisal were significant and that the mitigation
measured put in place were effective to mitigate the risks when possible. The Bank team distributed
a list of risks to long-term sustainability and the table was positively received. The stakeholders
added 3 more risks: potential general failure of the dam, lack of coordination among specialized
government institution for effective data analysis and delays in payment to the international
providers of communication services. (Full table is attached ­ Annex 2).

Lessons Learned

In addition to the lessons learned presented by the team, the stakeholders identified the following as
relevant lessons learned during project implementation.

The project was supported by a strong partnership. Various stakeholders provided funds and
expertise to the project, creating an outstanding synergy of resources among national and
international partners. In such operation this close collaboration has been instrumental to final
success and it helped all stakeholders to learn that complex challenges need to be addressed by
different points of view and require a strong team work.

The studies carried out during implementation provided different evaluations of the risk. The Lake
Sarez System is dynamic, and although much more has been learned about it during the project, the

first two yearbooks present a rapid increase in the level of the lake as well as an increase in the
number of springs. The monitoring and measuring of the system needs to be done frequently and the
risk assessment properly adjusted to the measurements on the ground, and communicated regularly
to the highest authorities in Tajikistan.

The problem of Lake Sarez has been very much addressed at national level in Tajikistan; however,
although the communities at immediate risk are in Tajikistan, it is a regional problem. It is important
to give Lake Sarez a regional dimension, particularly in light of the need to mobilize funds for the
implementation of long term solutions, which involve the production of hydroelectric power that
could serve Tajikistan and its neighboring countries, among others.

The livelihood subprojects implemented with direct funds from the Japanese Embassy in Tajikistan
(Grass Root Development Imitative) and with the JSDF, had a great role in the overall success of
the social component of the LSRMP, as well as for the entire project. If these additional funding
and parallel community based development initiatives had been included into the project at an
earlier stage the project could have been even more effective in engaging with local communities,
and the equipment used by communities could have been installed earlier, to improve their safety
and livelihood faster, winning additional local support for the project.

The project underwent several changes in leadership and management, both at the borrower and
donors' level. Although the general commitment to the project remained high throughout the
operation, close supervision and follow-up faded toward the end of each leader's assignment as well
as near the closure of the project. Stakeholders identified poor handover and loss of project's
historical memory as the main triggering factors. In addition, as the project was coming to an end,
time and funding finishing, the stakeholders registered a general decrease in interest for the
remaining operations. To some extent, this hindered some pending issues as well as the smooth
collection of important information and lessons learned.

In spite of the efforts made, the project did not create the required partnership among government
department and institutes, key to the analysis of data collected for Lake Sarez and to its overall
management. At the time of the workshop, there was no cooperation between the units under the
Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense and the Seismic Institute, the Geology
Institute, etc. The stakeholders linked the poor engagement of these partners, with the lack of
incentives offered to them during the implementation. Without the incentives there will not be a
fruitful cooperation and coordination among the agencies. Therefore the incentives should be
offered for the work to be implemented.

General comments from Stakeholders

Japanese funding for Tajikistan is going to be reduced. However this would not hamper allocation
of more funding for successful and relevant projects like LSRMP. To allocate funds the Japanese
Government requires details on administrative costs of the project and sustainability measures. If
these conditions are fulfilled the Embassy will consider financing.

Improving the livelihood of the vulnerable communities provided a great support on the LSRMP
and, indeed the LSRMP together with the Japanese Grass Root Projects and the JSDF have changed
the face of the Bartang Valley.

Dear Mr. Denizer:

We are very grateful for your cooperation and assistance aimed at implementation of the Lake Sarez
Risk Mitigation Project. We are satisfied with the outcomes achieved that ensure the proper
continued monitoring of Sarez Lake and Usoi Dam.

        We would like to inform you on the further steps relating to the resolution of the Lake Sarez
issues. From 22-23 May, 2007, we are planning to organize the Second Lake Sarez International
Conference considering the outcomes and recommendations received under the LSRMP and the
outcomes of researches received for the recent years. We hope that the WB will support our
initiative to attract the international organizations, specialists and donors to implement the long-term
activities related to the Lake Sarez.

        We have reviewed the Aide Memoire and the Project Completion Report and agree with the
recommendations and opinions set forth in the Aide Memoire. We have no any comments on the
above Report.

        Look forward to further cooperation.

        Best regards,



        Chairman M. Zokirov.

  AND CIVIL DEFENSE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF TAJIKISTAN ON MAY 31, 2007.


Introduction

Lake Sarez, formed by a landslide, poses some threat of instability, particularly on the right bank
(located four kilometers east from the rockslide dam with an estimated volume of 0,9 . While
there is some debate on the stability of the Usoy rockslide dam, beyond this is the issue of the area
being seismologically active. An earthquake could destabilize the fragile dam and pose a threat to
residents of the valley. Because of this, the Government of Tajikistan actively supported the
initiatives of the World Bank and other donors to address the Lake Sarez problem. The issue of
stability of Usoy rockslide dam was a subject of much controversy throughout its existence. It is
clear now that the rockslide dam is stable and can not be destroyed in a flash. Yes, the danger exists,
as the area is seismologically active, but it is much lower than conceived before.

Project Achievements

Expert Panel: During project implementation an expert panel was created and played a crucial role
in providing the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan with consultations on the issues related
to the key stages of project implementation. Expert panel was formed of and included experts in
seismology, metrology, and hydrogeology, and had a significant influence upon project
implementation in technical and scientific terms.

Capacity building: The Project aimed at building the national capacity in planning, coordination,
assistance, and implementation of the activities for sustainable risk reduction and preparedness
towards Lake Sarez risk. As such, the project achieved (i) technological capacity through the
installation of the first system of Lake Sarez monitoring and early warning systems in the villages;
(ii) local capacity by enhancing prevention measures, risk reduction, and population preparedness in
risk zones; and (iii) national capacity in the development of long-term strategies of risk mitigation
and resources associated with Lake Sarez.

Donor Coordination: During the Project implementation, "Usoi" Department maintained close
cooperation with several implementing consultants and NGOS, as well as with the many donors
who were active in the project. All donors have demonstrated good coordination of project goals
and fulfilled agreed financing obligations.

Benefit to population from the LSRMP implementation: In line with the stated objectives of the
project, the people residing in the risk zone have gained skills of conduct in emergency situations,
rendering first aid, survival techniques. In addition, several activities were undertaken to improve
ecological situation in Bartang River valley by way of planting trees and other forest plantations.
The target population was involved in constructing of the paths to the sites of potential evacuation,
and benefited significantly from the early warning system; since there is no other form of
communication in the Bartang River Vaeely, the early warning system is used by population both in
emergencies, and in everyday life for communication with outer world.

Issues during Project Implementation:

Component A: Initial delays in awarding the contracts for this component resulted in delays in
implementation for the entire project. These delays were caused by the worsened security level in
the region after September 11, 2001 and the subsequent war in Afghanistan, and a lack of
transparency in the process of procurement and delays related to reporting from the assessment
commission. In addition, the remoteness of the project area caused some delays in the
implementation of the equipment.

Component B: At the beginning of project implementation this component was very active. By
June 2005, progress made under this component was declining, due to insufficient attention from
implementing NGO, which should have completed its part related to this component according to its
implementation plan. By November 2005, the implementing NGO agreed to a plan of activities to
be implemented jointly with the Usoi Department by the spring of 2006. By the project's end date
major planned activities were completed except for the testing of monitoring and early warning
system. This activity was carried out on April 19-16, 2007.

Component D: This component faced problems resulted from changes occurred in the project
management during its implementation.


Conclusion

This project has assisted both the Government of Tajikistan in understanding and mitigating risks
from Lake Sarez, and the local communities in disaster awareness and preparedness. Because of
this project, the Committee on Emergency Situations and Civil Defense under the Government of
the Republic of Tajikistan had a chance to reduce the Lake Sarez breach risk to a certain extent;
most notably, an early warning system was installed allowing timely notification of population
residing in Lake Sarez breach risk zone. The installed monitoring system at Lake Sarez allows for
the collection of hydrological, meteorological, and seismological data in the area of Lake Sarez, and
also enables to monitor the state of the right-bank land/rockslide-prone bank vault and Usoy
rockslide dam. The major advantage of the monitoring and early warning system is the direct
monitoring of Lake Sarez state in automatic mode in the SCADA center in Dushanbe, which allows
responding and taking appropriate decisions in case of emergencies. Besides, at the same time
management of CoES and population residing in the flood-prone zone can receive notification about
Lake Sarez emergency situation. Within the framework of the Project, local rescue teams were
created and training provided to population on emergency situations, first aid and survival
techniques. There were created and implemented small projects on disaster mitigation. Also, stocks
of essential goods were established in the most vulnerable localities. Overall the Government of
Tajikistan appreciates the achievement made under this project.
