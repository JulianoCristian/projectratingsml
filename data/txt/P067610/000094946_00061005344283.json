The project\n            consists of four components. 1) The first component will\n            design and install a monitoring system and an early warning\n            system to safeguard the life of the communities located in\n            the Murgab and Bartang valleys and to define a long-term\n            strategy for Lake Sarez. 2) The second component will make\n            the early warning system community-based and help\n            communities prepare for a potential outburst flood form Lake\n            Sarez as well as for small-scale natural disasters that\n            occur frequently in the mountains by providing social\n            training and safety-related supplies. 3) The third component\n            will finance consultancy services to conduct studies of\n            long-term solutions. 4) Institutional strengthening\n            component will finance consultancy and equipment to\n            strengthen the capabilities of the Sarez Agency and other\n            units within the Ministry of Emergency Situations and Civil\n            Defense, as well as the incremental operating costs\n            associated with project management."}, "docdt": "2000-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
