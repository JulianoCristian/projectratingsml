INTERNATIONAL BANI; FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIENT
REPORT AiD RECOMIENDATION OF ITIE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
ETABLISSEMENT PUBLIC D'ELECTRICITE WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF TIE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR TIE MEHARDEH TIERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Etablissement Public de l'Electricite (EPE) with the guarantee of the
Syrian Arab Republic for the equivalent of US$25 million to help finance the
Mehardeh thermal power project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 4 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per aannum. The loan
would be made jointly with a loan equivalent to US$18 million from the Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development which would have a term of 20 years, in-
cluding 4-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 4 percent per annum.
PART I - TIIE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Syria"
(R73-110, May 21, 1973) was distributed to the Executive Directors in May
1973. A Bank Group mission visited Syria in November 1973 to review the im-
pact of the October hostilities on the economy and ongoing projects. An eco-
nomic mission is scheduled to visit Syria in March 1974. A country data sheet
is attached as Annex I.
3.        Since the attainment of independence in 1946, Syria has had numer-
ous changes in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of land-
owners, traders and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians,
and civil servants, and a shift of the economy from a laissez faire system
to a largely publicly owned and regulated one. The Baath Socialist Party --
the ruling party since 1963 - has provided substantial continuity of empha-
sis on economic and social development policies, which have prevailed in
spite of Government changes and external tensions. During the 1960's an
agrarian reform was completed, with redistribution of land to large numbers
of formerly landless peasants. In November 1970 General Assad came to power
and assumed the duties of President of the Republic. His regime has been
characterized by a balance of firmness and conciliation in domestic policies;
economic pragmatism; search for a better defined role for the private sector
in the centrally regulated economy; and diversification in foreign economic
relations. In March 1973, a permanent constitution was approved by referen-
dum. General elections of the legislature in May 1973 gave the majority of
the vote and seats to the Baath Socialist Party. A national referendum re-
confirmed President Assad for a seven-year term. After the October conflict,
the Government has been seeking a settlement with Israel based on the return
to the pre-1967 borders.

4.        In the last decade, Syria has achieved diversification of produc-
tion and rapid growth under fairlv stable prices. GDP increased in 1960-72
by about 7 percent per year in real terms, compared to 3.4 percent during
1953-60. The most dynamic sectors were manufacturing, transport, cammunica-
tions and services during the whole decade, agriculture in the early 1960's,
and oil production and oil transit during the late 1960's. A substantial
increase in oil transit rates in 1971, new factories entering into produc-
tion in 1972, and an improved business climate, also contributed to a GDP
increase of about 11 percent annually in real terms in 1971 and 1972. During
the recent hostilities, part of the country's productive capacity was damaged,
including the oroms refinery, power plants, ports, oil pipeline terminals and
some industrial plants. However, prompt action by the Government and grant
assistance by the other Arab countries for reconstruction are likely to contain
the slowdown in economic activity resulting from the power and fuel shortage.
GDP probably declined slightly in 1973, as a result of both the hostilities
and a severe drought in late 1972 early 1973 but, barring a resumption of
hostilities, economic activity should come back to normal bv mid-1974.
5.        Industry has been regarded by the Government as the spearhead of the
country's development during the last decade. A large and diversified invest-
ment program contributed to a rapid growth of the sector of about 9 percent
per year between 1966 and 1971. In the latter year, the sector accounted for
19 percent of GDP and about 8 percent of employment. Agriculture, however,
remains the most important sector, accounting for almost one quarter of GDP
and two thirds of employment. Wide fluctuations in agricultural production
primarily caused by variations in rainfall are a major unsettling factor in
growth. Employment problems remain serious, as growth of direct employment
opportunities has been limited by the low labor requirements of the oil sector
and other industries and the long gestation of most public investments. Agri-
culture absorbed most of the increase of active population (around 3 percent
per annum) during the sixties, as emigration to nearby countries provided
limited relief, and underemployment increased.
6.        Resource allocation to economic development has been consistent with
the priority needs of the economy, and a large public investment effort has
been a main factor of dynamism.   Measures have been taken to strengthen the
country's transport infrastructure, to interconnect and expand its power system,
to expand its industrial basis, and develop its limited petroleum and mineral
resources. Agriculture, irrigation and land reclamation received about 18
percent of public investment in 1960-1970, and the construction of a major
dam at Thawra on the Euphrates set the basis for lessening the dependence of
agriculture on weather conditions through irrigation.
7.        In spite of continued austerity of non-military current public
expenditure, public revenues were insufficient to meet the requirements of
a large investment program after 1967. In 1969, the Government took several
measures to improve tax assessment and collection and increased somewhat the
rates of profit taxes, though there is still scope for structural improvements
in the tax system. Savings of public enterprises rose substantially and
financed an increasing part of public investment. However, with modest gross



- 3 -
national savings and with low net external financing, domestic borrowing from
the banking system, mainly from the Central Bank, increased considerablv to
finance the current budget deficit as well as part of the investments. In
1970, the Government took measures to encourage private savings and limit
credit expansion, including higher interest on deposits, saving certificate
issues and restrictions on credit overdrafts. As a result, the growth rate
of money supply decelerated to 6.4 percent in 1971 (compared to 15 percent
per year during 1966-70) and demand deposits increased by 19 percent.
8.        After a period of small overall surpluses, the balance of payments
has been in deficit and net foreign assets declined every year since 1968.
Increasing trade deficits were only partly offset by rising receipts from
services, mainly oil pipeline dues representing 28 percent of total export
earnings in 1971. Recent liberalization policies and devaluation of the
Syrian pound have resulted in capital repatriation and a better investment
climate in the private sector. In 1972, exports increased substantially
(particularly wheat, petroleumi and textiles) due to a record harvest and
the 1971 currency realignment. There was also a marked increase in offi-
cial grants from Arab countries ($42 million during January-September 1972
compared with $21 million in 1971), and a jump in net private capital inflow
(from $1 million in 1970 to $75 million in 1971 and $23 million in January-
September 1972). Nevertheless, the situation remained tight due to the
delay of payments of oil transit dues from Iraq after the 1972 nationalization
of the Iraq Petroleum Co. (IPC) pipeline. This situation improved markedly
with back payments of about $40 million under an agreement with Iraq in January
1973, which also increased oil transit dues by about 50%.
9.         The long-term prospects for the balance of payments are good, main-
ly due to the 1973 oil transit agreement, to rising quantities of oil export-
ed and to the recent oil price increases. In the short-run, however, the
impact of reconstruction efforts and increases in import prices will not lead
to rapid improvements. Oil exports are expected to increase from 4 million
tons in 1972 to 5.2 million tons in 1974 and 12 million tons in 1977. The
recent price increases are expected to bring the average price of the low-
quality Syrian crude from $2 to about $6 per barrel, resulting in an addition-
al revenue of about $165 million in 1974 and - assuming no further changes
in prices - $336 million in 1977. Transit dues for Iraqi oil are not linked
to the level of oil prices under the 1973 transit agreement which is not due
for renegotiation until 1976; transit revenues may be of the order of $100
million in 1974 if pumping is resumed at the 1972 level. The Government has
indicated that the largest part of the imports of military equipment due to
the recent war are financed by grants from Arab countries. The financing of
the supplementary import requirements of capital goods and refined oil pro-
ducts due to the extensive war damage would offset in part the expected in-
crease in export revenues from oil. Successive revaluations of the Syrian
pound vis-a-vis the dollar (from LS 4.32 per $1 before February 1973 to LS
3.75 in February 1974 are unlikely to affect balance of payments prospects,
since at the same time the value of the Syrian pound decreased in terms of
the currencies of the major trading partners of the country.



- 4 -
10.       The impact of the recent hostilities on the economy is likely to
result in a growth rate of GDP at about 6 percent per year during the Third
Plan period (1971-1975), instead of 8.2 percent expected in the Plan. The
investment program of the Third Plan ($2.1 billion or double the amount of
the Second Plan) still seems achievable. In the longer term, the Government's
continued emphasis on investment should make it possible to sustain a 7 per-
cent annual growth. Prospects for continuing fast growth in oil, manufactur-
ing and electricity are favorable and growth in private investment may well
continue.
11.       Syria, however, will require more external aid in the medium-term and
more technical assistance and guidance on institution building than it can
obtain from its present sources if it is to reach the above targets. The bulk
of Syria's external borrowing was concentrated in 1965-67, with gross official
capital inflows averaging some $55 million per year since 1965 and a peak of
almost $80 million in 1967. Reported non-military external debt outstanding
and disbursed increased from an estimated $100 million in 1963 to about $230
million at the end of 1971. Debt including undisbursed has risen from about
$258 million at the end of 1970 to $325 million at the end of 1971 and $512
million at the end of 1972, mainly to USSR, East Germany, Kuwait, Czechoslovakia
and Saudi Arabia. The total held by IDA amounted to $37.3 million at the end
of January 1974. Commitments increased substantially in 1971, mainly from East
Germany, Kuwait, USSR and Japan. Requirements of gross official external as-
sistance are expected to rise from about $50 million in 1971 to about $80 mil-
lion in 1975 and average about $100 million a year thereafter.    Existing sources
of external assistance are expected to continue lending at about the present
levels, and the balance will have to be found from multilateral and new bila-
teral sources. The Bank Group's shares in the total external non-military debt
(presently about 7 percent) and debt service (presently less than 2 percent)
are expected to remain comparatively small. Debt service payments excluding
military debts, about which information is not available, amounted to 13 per-
cent of exports of goods and services in 1971-72, and are estimated at 11 per-
cent in 1973. A debt service ratio of the same magnitude is expected also over
the next five years, thanks to a rapid growth of export receipts.
12.       The proposed loan would be the second to be made to Syria by the
Bank. Syria's recent growth, with substantial improved export prospects and
generally favorable outlook for further growth, adequate public investment
allocation, recent improvement in economic management and prompt action for
reconstruction indicate a satisfactory performance. A considerable improvement
in the long-term prospects of Syria's balance of payments indicates a capacity
to service substantial new borrowings. Nevertheless, in view of the low per
capita income (about $290 in 1972), serious underemployment, vulnerability of
agriculture to weather conditions, and pressure on the balance of payments in
the next few years, Syria should continue for the time being to seek part of
its borrowings on concessional terms.
13.       Following Iraq's rnationalization of the facilities of the Iraq
Petroleum Company (IPC), Syria nationalized the section of the IPC pipeline
running through its territory, in June 1972, with a provision for compensation.
At the time of nationalization, the company asked the Government to submit to



- 5 -
arbitration, purstuant to the original convention, the question of Syria's
right to nationalize the properties. While reasserting its willingness to
compensate IPC, the Government questioned the company's interpretation of the
arbitration clause and its applicabilitv to nationalization as such. This led
to a deadlock on the issue of arbitration ratlwr than a discussion of compen-
sation. Since then, Government officials have informed our staff on various
occasions that the Syrian Government was prepared to discuss the amount of
compensation with the companY, and this position has been relayed to IPC and
its shareholders. This issue has also been complicated by the existence of
substantial counterclaims on the part of the Government related to past IPC
dues. While this delay in actual negotiations on compensation may therefore
be understandable, the Bank will continue to follow this matter closely.
PART II - BANK GROITP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
14.       Syria has to date received three IDA credits, two for highways,
totalling $22.3 million, and one for water sunpi", amounting to S15 million.
On Yarch 19, 197/4, the Executive Directors approved a S63 million loan and a
$10 million credit for an irrigation project. The first highway project is
about to be corpleted satisfactorily, although it had a slow start.    The
credit for the second highways project became effective in February 1973; the
water supplv credit became effective in Februarv 1974. Though Syria is a
mehber of the Corporation, IFC has made no investments there in the past.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 28, 1974,
and notes on the execultion of ongoing projects.
15.       Until recentlv, lack of familiarity with Banl Groun proceduires and
reluctance to accept Banl rather than IDA terms have prevented Svria from
obtaining assistance from the Bank Group on the scale appropriate to its
economric performance and its development needs.   Recently, the Bank Croun h-las
established a fruitful dialogue with the Government wbich resulted in a better
unidlerstanding of Bank Group reouirements and the request of financinR for
several projects.   The Government's increased emphasis on sound economic
management provides the Bank Group withi an appropriate setting to make a
meaningftl contribution to economic development. Svria's relatively developed
administrative structure, adequate public investment allocation and increasing
interest in cooperating with the Bank Crouip should make it possihle for it to
absorb larger amounts of Banlc Group financing than in the past. In line with
the needs of the economy and the Third Plan investment strategy, the Bank Grouip
plans to focus on (i) irrigation and soil improvement in the Euphrates basin,
to increase agricultural emplovment, prodUCtion and exports while reducing
food imports and the dependency on weather fluctuations; (ii) institution
building in the public sector, b', assisting wqater sunplv, sewerape, transpor-
tation and power projects of high priority; and (iii) rural development
schemes. A project for drainage in the lower Euphrates is being prepared
with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and is likely to result
in a lending operation in FY76.   Studies for the preparation of this project
are to be financed from the irrigation loan and credit. The Cooperative



Program is also assisting in the identification of a livestock project for
FY76.  Other lendinz operations whose preparation is advanced are a secon1
power project (steam-electric generation) and a sewerage project for the
cities of Damascus, Poms and 1ania.  Studies for the latter are financed from
Credit 401 (Damascus Water Sunply Project).
PART 111 - ELECTRIC POE.!FP TNI SYPIA
1 f1,     Crowth of power Rstnlv has plaved a kev role in the economic grx.rth
of Svria in the sixties. During the last ten ylears, energv consiunntion has
shown an average, annual growth rate of 12 percent, which accelerated to 15
nercent in 1969-1972 not including the temporary requirTments of Thawrn's
construction.  Thp shnre of industrinl consumption incrensed steadilv, and
reached about l,5, of the total, at the end of the neriod.  Per capita energEy
consurption increased ranidly, from 76 1J]h in 19f6i to 146, in 1970, althoucl
its level still is lows, if comparedi with that of Turlcey (245), Lebanon (441)
and Trac (224).   In spite of the progress made, however, expansion of power
generation has lagned behind demand, particularlv in industry in the last
few years.
17.       Ulntil the mid-sixties, the power sector was fragmzented in a largc
number of isolated power svstems. The Government started a program of ra-
tionalization and expansion by creating in 1965 a Covernment owned entity,
EPE, responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of elec-
tricitv throughout Syria.   Considerable progress in interconnection was made
with the completion of a 230-kV svstem linking the larle urban areas of Alerpo,
Tiara, looms and Damascus in 1W68, Thaw-ra in 1960, and Lehnnon in 1972.  The in-
terconnected svstem, however, had a total installed canacitv of onlv abotut
230 PW (excluding 25 MWAs fromi Lehanon) before the October conflict comparer
with the countrv's totnl installed capacitv of 75n mw. Of these, L60 MWJ 1were
cantive plants for industry and irrigation pumping, and about 60 MW were
isolarecd svstems opernted hv EPE.  About 47 percent of the ponulation, living
in aboout 3,n00 villages with 2,000 inhaHitants or less, has no access to elec-
tricitv.  Ftirther proeress in interconnection and expansion of the rower system
is recquired to meet tle demand arising from a continued industrial erowth and
to inrrease the stunply of electricity in rural areas.
1,.       The Covernment's long term strnte'v is based on the noxirnu--i ise of
the hydroelfectric potential of the Euphrates river, which accotunts for al-
nost 89 percent of Syria's water resources, and on the expansion of therml.n
capacity emDloying indigenotus fuel.  The development of thie Funfhrates basin
is expected to add abouit 500 NW to the capacity installed in the coitntrv and
to increase tbe countr-'s irrigated land fronm the nresent 5n0,n00  ha tn ahouit
1 ,20,0no 0 ha over a 40-50 year period.  The first phlase of the develorment
began in 19(S, with finnacial assistance fror the UISSP, and comprises the
construction of a 60-ri high earthfill clar nt Thawrn with a live storage eap-
acitv of about 7,/AnO million rr3 ard a power station withi initial canacitv of
three 100-14W units.  These works are sclheduled for comuletion in earlv 1075).



- 7 -
Two more 100-MN units are expected to start operation in 197(6.    Thle availa-
bilitv of power from Thawra is estimated to reach a peak of 2,200 GW^h in 1978
and gradually decline thereafter, to about 1,100 GWh in 1990, since an increas-
ing share of the available water will be used for irrigation. The possibili-
ties of other hvdro-power developments are limited, and further power develop-
ment will be predominantly thermal, with oil as the main source of primary
fuel.
19.       Since 1971, EPE hns been implementinn an expansion progran financed
bv the German Democratic Republic, to be completed substantially bv 1975/76,
of 66-kyc and lower voltage transmission facilities to interconnect towns and
villages and about 20 MW in new diesel] plant. In earlv 1973, the Government
emb.arked on a crash program to instal] 160 NW in gas turbine capacity.    During
the October 1973 conflict, about 165 IV1 of the capacity of the interconnected
svstem was damaged, including abotut 75 '1 the renair of whicb mav not be eco-
nomically 1lustified. By Februarv 1974 abouit 80 percent of the power reonnire-
ments were already met, after repairing a number of small steam units, increas-
ing to 40 MW the supply from Lebanon, andl installing the gas turbines ordered
in earlv 1973. Arab States gave Syria as a grant ten gas turbines with a
total capacitv of 230 M!, and bv mid-1974, when these turbines are scheduled
to enter in operation, all power restrictions are expected to be dropped.
With the addition of 500 NW in Thawra, and the expansion of captive plant,
total installed capacitv in the countrv is expected to exceed 1,500 MW by
1976. In addition, the Government intends to step up its ruiral electrifica-
tion program by about 10 percent annually from the present level of about
$2 million equivalent; to start a 10-year program to convert the present
127/220-V distrihution voltage in the major cities to 220/3PO-V; and to curb
the replacement and expansion of captive plants located near interconnerted
-facilities. EPE also intends to construct 1,100 km of 230-kV transmission
lines to be financed out of an existing credit from the USSR.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Mehardeh Thermal Power Project -
Syria" (No. 245a-SYR dated February 2Q, 197(i) is being distributed separately.
A loan and project sunmmary is attached as Annex III. Feasibilitv studies were
prepared by SOFRELEC of France. The project was appraised in the field in
Mav 1973.  An updating mlssion visited Syria in Februiary 1974 to review the
impact of the October hostilities and the increase of oil prices on the proj-
ect. The mission concluded that these do not affect the viability of the
project. The mission's finding are included in the Appraisal Report. Nego-
tiations for the proposed loan were held in February 1974. The Syrian dele-
gation was led by Mr. Hlanv Sawaf, Vice Minister of Petroleum, Electricity
and Mineral Resources.
21.       The proposed Droject consists of the first 125-IRV stage of a thermal
power station to be constructed on a new site at the Nehardeh reservoir on
the Orontes river; construction of four new and expansion of four existing
230-kV substations; management and engineering consulting services and



- 8 -
training.  Prior to the project cormpletion, which is scheduled in mid-1978,
EPE would construct the required transmission lines, to be financed tinder the
existing credit from the IJSSR.  Construction of a second 125-MtJ stage of the
fIehardefi station and other substations is scheduled to follow in about six-
teen months.
22.       The proposed oil-fired plant would be constructed about two kilometers
northi of the town of l4ehardeh.  No problem with dust emission or ash disposal is
expected.  The wind is predominantly easterlv and a 125-m highi chimney would
assure difftusion of particles.  Sufficient space would he provided on the site
to install exhaust gas cleaning facilities if necessarv in the future.    Under-
grouind water is abundant and would be used instead of surface water from the
Orontes during extremely dry periods to assure that the requirements for ir-
rigate(d areas fed from the Orontes are adequatelv covered.
Proiect Execution - Consultants
23.       As a result of the expansion and rationalization of the power sector,
EPE's available capacitv is expected to rise from albouit 300 MK in 1972 to about
(A80 NW in 1975 and 1,250 NW in 1979.  During the relativelv short period the
company has been in existence, EPE has focused on the technical problems of
onerating and integrating numerous separate systems. In view of the expected
rapid expansion of activitv the company now plans to focus on improving its
technical and administrative capacity.   For this purpose EPE intends to em-
plov consultants, to be financed tinder the proposed loan, to Prepare a studv
for the improvement of its operational and accounting methods and orpaniza-
tion, and a study for the unification and modernization of its tariff structure.
Consultants would also assist in implementing on-the-job and other training
programs. EPE also intends to set up a technical training center for the
staff of the new power station. The loan includes s250,000 to assist in fi-
nancing part of the cost of this training center. Engineering, final design,
contract administration and construction supervision for the project would be
carried out bv consultants to be selected shortly.
Project Cost and Financial Results
24.       The estimated cost of the project excluding interest during con-
struiction is $62.6 million, including $43 million in foreign currency.    The
proiect is nart of EPE's S46n million investment program for 1973-79.     EPF
is expected to provide 20 percent of the financing for this program from
internal sources, after debt service payment and working capital increase.
The balance will be providedl by net capital contributions by the Government
(about 36 percent), consumers contributions (about 3 percent) and long-term
borrowing (41 percent).
25.       The nroposed Bank loan of S25 million and the Euwait Fund loan of
$18 million would finance the estimated foreign cost component of the project,
equivalent to 69 percent of the total cost. Local expenditure would he fi-
nanced bv EPE's internal sources and Government contributions. The Kuwait
Fund loan would be for a term of 20 vears, incltuding 4-1/2 years of grace, at



- 9 -
percent per annum.   The fulfillment of al.. conditions necessary to permit dis-
bursements under the loan agreement betweep EPE and the Kuwait Fund would be
a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.     The Bank and the Kuwait Fund
will coordinate their actions regarding project admiristrat ion, supervision
and disbtursement.
26.       EPE's financial position is basicallv sound and the average level
of EPE's tariffs is adeouate to provide sufficient rates of return once the
short-term effects of the war have been overcome.     In 1973 and 1974, IEPJ's
onerating results are expected to be negative because of reduced sales and
high cost of operation of gas turbines to meet base load formprly covered- by
steam generating stations damaged during the October conflict.      The rate of
retuirn is expected to increase graduallv to more than 9 percent with the
generation of hydropower from Tliawra and the completion of the proposed proj-
ect i.n 1978.  The Government hns stated in writing to TFE that it intends to
bear the financial consequences of the conflict instead of EPE.      The price
paid by EPE to the National Oil Company for fuel is not expected to increase.
Section 2.03 of the Guarantee Agreement provides that the Government would
supplv FPE with funds to carry out EPE's authorized ecnansion program, when-
ever siuch funds are unavailable from other sources.    Sections5.04 and 5.05
of the Loan Agreement provide that EPE would maintain the average level of
its tariffs at no less than the 1973 level urtil. the end of 1977 and maintain
a rate of return of at least 9 percent on averagle net fixed asset:s in oner-
ation thereafter.   EPE's debt service coverage is projected to he satisfactory,
increasing from 1.8 in 1975 to 3.3 in 1979.     Se,.tion 5.06 ef the Loan Agree-
ment provides that EPF would not undertake anv mediunm- or long-term debt
without the Bank's approval, unless its net revenues cover debt service bv
at least 1.5 times.
Economic Justification
27.       EPF's sales are expected to increase at about 22 percent p.a. on the
average through 1979.   The share of sales to industrv is exnected to reach 70
percent in 1979, partly as a result of the inrornoration of captive plants in
the interconnected system.   EPE's expansion program has been demonstrated by
comparison with alternative programs to he the least-cost solution for meeting
Syria's incremental. electricity needs through 1979, even after taking into
account the now higher international price level of fuel. The project is
technically sound and economicallv justified. It will provide substantial
improvements in EPE's organization and management, personnel expertise and
tariff structure, in line with the expected rapid expansion of its activities.
The economic return of the Mehardeh Power station and associated transmission
facilities is estimated at about 17 percent, on the conservative assumntion
that the price Paid for electricity by the consumers is a minimum measure of
economic benefits.
Procurement
28.       Goods and services financed by the Banl and the Kuwait Fund would
be procured after international competitive bidding under the Banl:'s guiidelines.



- 10-
No suppliers in Syria are expected to bid for the supplv of equipment and the
borrower has not requested a preference margin for domestic suppliers of equip-
ment.  Bid documents have been issued for major items of the power station
equipment and suppliers have been requested to quote also for an option for
the purchase of a second 125-MW generating unit and four 230/66-kV substations
within 16 months of contract signature.
Disbursement
29.       The Bank and the Kuwait Fund would disburse 25/43 and 18/43 respect-
ively of the foreign exchange cost of equiipment, and of the foreign exchange
component of the cost of services for the project. Anv undisbursed amount
of the proposed loan will be cancelled, unless it can be reallocated to con-
sultants services for the next stage of development.
PART V - LECAL INSTEUTENTS AND ATHTUORITY
30.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EPE, the draft Guar-
antee Agreement between the Syrian Arab Republic and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors senarately. Ratification
of the ag'reements by the legislature is required under the laws of the Syrian
Arab Penublic and, owing to the lengthy legislative process involved, a pe-
riod of six months has been allowed after the date of signature for the ful-
fillment of the conditions of effectiveness. Sections of the Loan and Cuaran-
tee Agreement of special interest are referred to in paragraph 26 of this
Report. Otherwise, the draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for
loans for rower projects involvint joint financing.
31.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of tl,e Bank.
PART VI - RECOUMJEIDATION
32.       Tn formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -1/
Credit 46 - First Highway Project; US$8.5 million Credit of December 24,
1963; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
This project includes improvements of the 530 km Damascus-Homs-Hama-
Aleppo-Raqqa highway linking the capital city with the cotintry's major
productive centers. Construction started only in 1968 due to inade-
quate engineering studies and the need to completely redesign the
highway. As a result of this delay, the original closing date of
December 31, 1968 was postponed twice up to December 31, 1973. Works
are now well underway and are expected to be completed by early 1974.
However, to allow for longer than exvected time for delivery of main-
tenance equipment included in this project ance already ordered, the
closing date has been postponed for a third time to December 31, 1974,
the current date.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengtlhs and
weaknesses in project execution.
