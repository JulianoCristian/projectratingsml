     SUMMARY

1.     This memorandum seeks your approval for a first extension of the original closing
     date of the above mentioned grant by 4 months, to December 31, 2011 to support the
     achievement of the Project Development Objectives. The grant of € 6.5 million (US $
     9.6 million equivalent) for the project was approved on May 5, 2010, and became
     effective on May 24, 2010, with an original closing date of August 31, 2011. The
     Recipient, in its letter dated August 22, 2011 (attached) requested a 4 month
     extension. Concomitantly, we reduce from four to two months the Disbursement
     Deadline Date for the purposes of paragraph I. (ii) of the Disbursement Letter dated
     May 25, 2010.

     PROJECT STATUS

2.     The development objective of the project is to increase domestic production of food
     crops (mainly maize and rice) in targeted areas, in order to mitigate the short-term
     impact of increasing prices on households and to expand food crops farmers’ access
     to agricultural inputs in the medium- and long term. This development objective will
     be achieved by: (i) expanding the access of food crop producers to fertilizer and
     improved seeds; and (ii) expanding the access of food crop producers to small-scale
     irrigation infrastructure.

3.     The overall implementation progress of the project is rated as marginally
     satisfactory. As of August 10, 2011, the project has disbursed US $ 3,075,519.82
     about 47.32 % of the original amount of grant approved by the Board. The project
     was to provide 3,275 tons of fertilizer and 545 tons of improved seeds to about
     15,500 producers (12,000 producers of maize and 3,500 producers of rice). This is
     expected to generate (i) an increase in rice production in the project area of 3,500
     tons; (ii) an increase in maize production in the project area of 12,000 tons and (iii) a
     total of 15,500 farmers (direct beneficiaries) receive project benefits.

4.     As of August 10, 2011, project progress towards achieving development objectives
     can be summarized as followed: (i) Farmers’ access to agricultural inputs and
     increase in rice and maize production: During the 2011-2012 campaign, about 545
     tons of improved seeds (maize: 300 tons and rice: 245 tons) as well as 3,275 tons of
     fertilizer were procured and distributed to 15,500 maize and rice producers (12,000
     producers of maize and 3,500 producers of rice). (ii) Promotion of small-scale
     irrigation and post-harvest infrastructure: Out of the 2,000 hectares of small-scale
     irrigation perimeters in the Niger River valley, 95% were developed and concerning
     the 1,000 hectares in the lowlands of the hill region and in the Mono and Couffo
     rivers valleys, about 65% were developed. As for post-harvest infrastructure, the

                                              4
     contracts for the 35 storerooms and 70 drying areas have been awarded and the
     infrastructures are under construction.

5.     The project has performed satisfactorily as regards compliance to financial
     covenants through the regular and timely submission of financial reports and annual
     audits. The 2010 audited reports were received and the auditors issued an unqualified
     opinion.


     PROPOSED CHANGES

            • Closing date
6.   The extension of closing date is required to allow the Recipient to complete all
   project activities. The project experienced significant implementation delays mainly
   because the government authorities took too much time in concluding the contracts
   awarding process for the provision of goods and services. The extension will in
   particular provide additional time and resources to (i) purchase and deliver an
   additional 650 tons of fertilizer to the producers; (ii) recover the fertilizer credit from
   the producers and prepare a report on the distribution of agricultural inputs; (iii)
   monitor the construction of the post-harvest infrastructure in the project area (35
   storerooms and 70 drying areas); (iv) monitor the completion of the small-scale
   irrigation perimeters development and provide small-scale irrigation equipment to
   producers (2200 motor pumps); (v) develop an additional 1000 ha of small-scale
   irrigation perimeters, with the realization of 100 artisanal wells and the provision of
   1100 motor pumps to producers; (vi) complete the field survey that will be used to
   monitor progress towards the achievement of PDO and carry out a technical audit to
   assess the effectiveness of the activities planned and carried out under the project in
   response to food crisis. The results will assess the overall effectiveness of project
   implementation and will provide evidence for improved and best practices; (vi)
   ensure trough training the understanding by the implementing entities and various
   stakeholders of the project ESMF; and (vii) start the preparation of the project ICR;

7.     The Recipient reaffirmed its commitment to the project’s objectives and its
     willingness to continue the implementation of activities under the project. From our
     assessment, this will allow the project to achieve its development objectives. In order
     to achieve these objectives, the Recipient requested the Bank to extend the project for
     four months.

8.     Please note that the detailed work plan for the four months period of extension is
     attached to this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing
     Date) as well as the updated procurement plan for 2011.

9.     A review of these documents suggests that the activities could be completed by the
     requested extension date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by December 31,
     2011.

                                    Restructuring Paper
1.     The closing date for Benin, Emergency Support to Enhance Food Security Project,
     TF 096893; P120052 will be extended from August 31, 2011 until December 31,
     2011. Concomitantly, we reduce from four to two months the Disbursement Deadline
     Date for the purposes of paragraph I. (ii) of the Disbursement Letter dated May 25,
     2010, as the Administrative Agreement with the European Union closing date
     remains unchanged as at April 30,2012..

2. As of August, 10 2011, project progress towards achieving development objectives
   can be summarized as followed: During the 2011-2012 campaign, about 545 tons of
   improved seeds (maize: 300 tons and rice: 245 tons) as well as 3,275 tons of fertilizer
   were procured and distributed to 15,500 maize and rice producers (12,000 producers
   of maize and 3,500 producers of rice). Out of the 2,000 hectares of small-scale
   irrigation perimeters in the Niger River valley, 95% were developed and concerning
   the 1,000 hectares in the lowlands of the hill region and in the Mono and Couffo
   rivers valleys, about 65% were developed. As for post-harvest infrastructure, the
   contracts for the 35 storerooms and 70 drying areas have been awarded and the
   infrastructures are under construction. The Recipient reaffirmed its commitment to
   the project’s objectives and its willingness to continue the implementation of
   activities under the project. From our assessments, this will allow the project to
   achieve its development objectives. In order to achieve these objectives, the Recipient
   requested the Bank to extend the project for four months.


3.     Please note that the detailed work plan for the four months period of extension is
     attached to this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing
     Date), as well as the updated procurement plan for 2011. A review of these
     documents indicates that remaining project activities could be completed by the
     requested extended date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by December 31,
     2011.

4.     The proposed extension is necessary to allow the recipient to complete all project
     activities. This will in particular provide additional time and resources to (i) purchase
     and deliver additional 650 tons of fertilizer to the producers; (ii) recover the fertilizer
     credit from the producers and prepare a report on the distribution of agricultural
     inputs; (iii) monitor the construction of the post-harvest infrastructure in the project
     area (35 storerooms and 70 drying areas); (iv) monitor the completion of the small-
     scale irrigation perimeters development and provide small-scale irrigation equipment
     to producers (2200 motor pumps); (v) develop an additional 1000 ha of small-scale
     irrigation perimeters with the realization of 100 artisanal wells and the provision of
     additional 1100 motor pumps to producers; (vi) complete the field survey that will be
     used to monitor progress towards the achievement of PDO; (vii) carry out a technical
     audit to assess the effectiveness of the activities planned and carried out under the
     project in response to food crisis. The results will assess the overall effectiveness of
     project implementation and will provide evidence for improved and best practices;
     (viii) ensure trough training the understanding by the producers and various
     stakeholders of the concept of sustainable management of irrigation perimeters and
     equipments; and (ix) start the preparation of the project ICR;

5.    This will be the first extension of the closing date of the project.
