                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Despite a slow start, the project implementation picks up rapidly over the last months. The delivery for fertilizers and improved seeds to farmers is completed. The small irrigation
                         sub-component is going well and the civil works for the construction of post harvest drying and storage facilities have started and the infrastructures are due to be delivered to the
                         beneficiaries by December, 15 2011. The extension of the project closing date has allowed the PMU to catch up with the delay experienced and speed up the implementation
                         process so as to ensure that the full grant is disbursed within the remaining time frame (that is before December 31, 2011).
