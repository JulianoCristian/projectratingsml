{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Support to\n            Enhance Food Security Project for Benin were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: local committees, involving\n            representatives of farmer organizations and municipalities,\n            are the key to proper management and maintenance of storage\n            facilities, drying areas, and irrigation infrastructure. The\n            resolution of land tenure issues should be a prerequisite\n            for all rural project investments. Input subsidies can be\n            the easiest mechanism for many governments to boost food\n            crop production and mitigate the negative impact of food\n            crises, but experience with Emergency Food Security Program\n            (PUASA) showed that although starting an input subsidy\n            scheme could be a good idea in the short run, it is rarely\n            sustainable in the long term because of state budgetary\n            constraints. The challenge is to implement a sound market\n            based mechanism, e.g. the warrantage system as pursued under\n            the project in order to provide an adequate exit. Recent\n            reforms in Benin's procurement administration and\n            system must be implemented effectively by all ministries for\n            projects to be implemented more efficiently."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
