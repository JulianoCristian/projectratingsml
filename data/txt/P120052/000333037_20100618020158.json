objective of the Emergency Support\n            to Enhance Food Security Project for Benin is to increase\n            domestic production of food crops (mainly maize and rice) in\n            targeted areas. Between September 2007 and August 2008 food\n            prices in Benin increased by an estimated 32 percent. This\n            unprecedented increase in food prices fueled a significant\n            increase in the general price levels (by 12 percent) over\n            the same period, prompting the government to enact a variety\n            of  measures to control prices (the cost of which is\n            unsustainable) and seek the assistance of donors to support\n            an emergency food security program. The Government launched\n            the Programme d'Urgence d'Appui a la Securite\n            Alimentaire (PUASA) - the Emergency Food Security Support\n            Program, in 2008 to address the country's immediate,\n            short and medium term needs to increase domestic productive\n            capacity and food security. The International Development\n            Association (IDA)-financed Emergency Food Security Support\n            Project (EFSSP), approved in October 2008 supported this\n            effort and focused on immediate needs by increasing the\n            access of cereal crop producers to fertilizer during the\n            2009 cropping season."}, "docdt": "2010-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
