                         Implementation Status Overview
                          1. Despite a slow start, the project implementation picks up rapidly over the last three months. All key bidding documents for the purchase and distribution of fertilizer, the
                         procurement of motor pumps for small scale irrigation infrastructure, and for civil works for the construction of post harvest drying and storage facilities were prepared and launched.
                         The delivery for fertilizers is scheduled for March 15, 2011.

                         2. In order to catch up with the delay and speed up the implementation process to ensure that the full grant can be disbursed within the remaining time frame (that is before August

                         2011), an updated work plan has already been prepared by the PMU as well as a revised procurement plan. The procurement process to award the contract for the provision of
                         motopomps and works (storage facilities, tubed drillings and wells) experienced some delays making it difficult for the PMU to keep the initial project targets in terms of number of
                         hectares to be irrigated and number of beneficiaries.

                         The team will need to monitor the project closely to avoid further implementation delays.
