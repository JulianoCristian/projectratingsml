are: (a) to protect vulnerable population groups\n            from the adverse social effects of a deteriorating economic\n            situation; (b) to maintain essential public health,\n            nutrition and family planning programs; and (c) to prepare\n            future projects and programs in the social sectors.  Part A\n            of the project - support of social sector reform - aims at:\n            (a) establishing and monitoring additional budgetary\n            allocations to primary health care and education; (b)\n            delineating and rationalizing the specific roles of\n            non-governmental and governmental institutions in social\n            services financing and delivery; and (c) providing an\n            adequate framework and data base for larger investments in\n            the social sectors.  Part B of the project - support of\n            population, health and nutrition programs - aims at\n            responding quickly to basic needs of population groups which\n            are currently poorly served by health, family planning and\n            nutrition services.  These programs include: (a) priority\n            public health programs (health care strengthening and\n            support to communicable disease control programs); (b)\n            family planning and safe motherhood activities; and (c)\n            nutrition activities, including iodine deficiency control."}, "docdt": "1990-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
