Lessons suggest that contrary to\n            the Operations Evaluation Department's general\n            assessment, - that Bank's transport operations, achieve\n            better results on physical aspects, than institutional ones\n            - this project promoted substantial reform in the\n            country's highways sector. Key factors contributing to\n            these achievements were the Government's and\n            Bank's flexibility in redefining the scope of technical\n            assistance (TA) to meet clients needs, and, a sustained\n            commitment by the Department of Public Works and Highways to\n            pursue a long-term reform consensus, supported by the Bank,\n            in addition to: the use of participatory processes to build\n            ownership in implementing road management systems, and the\n            use of consulting services to assist processing politically\n            complex reform initiatives. While civil works faced\n            technical, financial, and managerial intervention problems,\n            these were overcome by strong ownership, and the adequate\n            coordination of the Bank. Nonetheless, it is suggested that\n            the civil works program should be fully appraised before\n            negotiations; that procurement documents, and TA studies to\n            be implemented in the first year program, be finalized at\n            approval time; and, that contracts stipulate provisions for\n            increasing contractor's performance bond amounts, to\n            discourage unrealistic bidding."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
