MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of the Pbilippines for the
equivalent of US$150 million to help finance a Highway Management Project. The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
20 years, including five years of grace.
2.          Country/Sector Background.  The condition of the Philippine road
network is generally poor due to factors such as inadequate designs, substandard
construction, and inadequate maintenance. The Government recognizes that roads
are the backbone of the country's transport system and that a reduction of the
currently high road transport costs will be crucial to improving the country's
competitiveness in the international market. The Department of Public Works and
Highways (DPWH) is addressing this situation through investments to improve the
network's condition, policy reforms to improve the quality and timeliness of
works, and measures to develop a sustainable institutional capacity to manage the
network. It is focusing these efforts on the arterial highway network (13,650
km), which carries about 40% of total domestic traffic and, as indicated by a
recent survey, requires substantial improvement. DPWH has therefore developed
an arterial highway investment program for 1990-96, with an emphasis on
rehabilitation. Organizationally, the Department has decentralized responsibility
for the arterials to its regional staff in order to increa&a their responsiveness
to network needs.
3.          To iwppove maintenance, the Department is making a transition from
force account works, which have been poor, to greater private sector
participation, under a phased program. In 1990, DPWH carried out 40% of its road
maintenance responsibilities by contract and by 1994 expects to contract out
about 80% of these operations.   Pilot projects testing the effectiveness of
contract maintenance indicate that costs are much less than the standard cost of
force account works, and the quality is superior.  In view of the staffing
implications of its move to contract maintenance, DPWH is implementing a manpower
and equipment reduction plan aimed at a 25% cut in permanent maintenance staff
and a gradual lay-off of a'l casual employees by 1994 through early retirement
and attrition. Maintenanct operations are also benefitting from a 24% increase
in the 1991 budgetary allocation for recurrent road maintenance, which is based
on a formula known as the Equivalent Maintenance Kilometer (EMK). The current
allocation for routine maintenance of arterial highways is n^- satisfactory. The
Goverment has also instituted a separate item in the budget proposal for
periodic road overlays. -
4.          The proposed project would support investments as well as policy and
institutional changes benefitting the arterial highways. In particular, it would
assist DPWH to develop and implement a Road Management System (RMS) for improved
planning and budgeting of arterial maintenance and rehabilitation, which will be
an important adjunct to the Department's move to contracted maintenance. At
present, due to the absence of factual irformation, decisions on maintenance and
rehabilitation works are largely based on the subjective judgements of local
staff. The RMS would allow DPWH to plan these works on rational engineering and



- 2 -
economic grounds, thus ensuring more effective use of funds. The RMS comprises
a road data base, a road and bridge monitoring system and decision models for
programming rehabilitation and routine maintenance activities. The system would
enable DPWH to evaluate the economic effects of various maintenance,
rehabilitation and improvement strategies, determine optimal budgetary
requirements, and select appropriate standards for maintenance intervention that
optimize the use of available budgetary resources.
5.          The project would also address problems in the local construction
industry, including its underdeveloped technical capabilities and constraints
created by government contracting procedures.
6.          Proiect Objectives. The project's main aim is to improve the quality
of the arterial highway network and thereby to reduce transport costs and
increase the country's economic competitiveness. Toward this goal, the project
would: (a) support selected subprojects included in the arterial highway
investment plan; (b) institute a nationwide road management system to improve the
planning, budgeting and implementation of maintenance and rehabilitation works;
(c) encourage increased private sector participation in road maintenance; (d)
strengthen the capabilities of road subsector sta!f through technical assistance
and training; and (e) improve the effectiveness of the Philippine construction
industry.
7.          Project Description.  The project would finance: (a) development and
implementation of a management system for DPWHIs annual and multiyear programming
and budgeting of pavement and bridge works; (b) civil works subprojects to begin
in 1992/93 and 1993/94 to upgrade, rehabilitate, strengthen or resurface some
1,400 km of deteriorated or damaged arterial highways and substandard bridges;
(c) consulting services to assist DPWH to (i) coordinate project activities, (ii)
improve road design procedures and construction quality, (iii) initiate a road
accident reduction program, (iv) develop a manpower planning and training program
to meet DPWiH's changing staff needs due to decentralization and contract
maintenance, and (v) increase DPWH's capacity to produce environmental impact
statements for its projects; and (d) consulting services to assist the
Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP) to carry out studies
and implement measures to strengthen the local construction industry.   The
project would be carried out over a seven-year period by DPWH and CIAP. Its cost
is estimated at US$198.7 million equivalent, 58% of which would be foreign
exchange. A Bank loan of US$150 million equivalent is proposed. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. S439-PH dated October
4. 1991 is being distributed separately.
8.          Sustainability.  The main sustainability issue for this project is
the future operation and maintenance of the road network, including the roads
improved under the project.   This has been addressed by a combination of
technical, institutional and financial interventions, including a commitment for
an adequate maintenance budget, improving the delivery of maintenance by
contracting out to the private sector, and improved qualitv of construction by



providing technical assistance to develop DPWH control capacity and to develop
the construction industry.   The primary emphasis is on the institutional
strengthening of DPWH through a more focussed role, of which a key element is RMS
to be introduced under the project.   This comprehensive approach begins to
address the issue of sustainability, but will require follow-up efforts by the
Bank and the Government to ensure long term success.
9.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank ggerations.  The Bank Group has
helped finance five highway and two rural road projects in the Philippines: four
of the highway projects have been completed. Assessments of the completed
projects have identified inadequate maintenance, both as regards budget and
execution capability, and lack of timely pavement strengthening and upgrading as
the principal weaknesses. DPWH concurs with these conclusions, and has addressed
them by establishing a budget commitment with the Department r; Budget and
Management, instituting a new strategy of contracting out 80% of maintenance to
the private sector, and focussing on improved management of the network,
including planning, design and construction quality, with the assistance of the
RMS to be installed under the project.
10.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is important
to renewed economic growth in the Philippines, to the responsiveness of the
country's overall transport sector, and to the institutional development of DPWH.
The project would support investments targeted toward making the best use of the
existing arterial highway network, which, in its deteriorated condition, is
constraining attempts to restart the economy. It is also one of four coordinated
projects through which the Bank is addressing major issues in the transport
sector: a recently-approved Industrial Restructuring Project is addressing the
Lack of financing available to the private sector for vehicle fleet renewal,
abile a maritime project and a sector policy adjustment operation are also being
prepared. Most important, the project supports DPWH's institutional development
toward comprehensive management of the arterial highway network. Given the time
required for such development, this is expected to be one of a series of projects
for that purpose.
11.         Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government on: (a) implementation of agreed modules of the RMS by June 30,
1995; (b) formulation and adoption of a three-year rolling arterial highway
investment program by March 31, 1992 in consultation with the Bank and updating
of the program by March 31 of each subsequent project year in consultation with
the Bank, applying appropriate economic and technical criteria; (c) selection of
the project's 1993/94 civil works program by March 31, 1992 based on criteria
satisfactory to the Bank; (d) regarding maintenance: (i) allocation of about 80%
of the total maintenance budget to contract works by 1994 and, in consequence,
adjustment of the number of DPWH maintenance staff in accordance with a plan and
timetable satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) maintenance in real terms of the 1991
routine maintenance budget for national roads; (iii) retention of an item in the
recurrent budget for periodic overlay works; and (iv) by March 31 of each year
commencing 1992, preparation, in consultation with the Bank, of the maintenance
program for the next fiscal year, including the program and budget for periodic
road overlays; (e) appointment of a consultant to assist DPWH with project
coordination by June 30, 1992; (f) initiation of an agreed training program by
September 30, 1992; (g) maintenance of the Project Management Office to



- 4 -
coordinate project activities until project completion; and (h) by June 30, 1992
revision of DPWH design standards and contract documents for project civil works
to ensure that they are environmentally sound. An understanding was also reached
with the Government on its local procurement procedures to be used for the
project.
12.         Eavigmental Inmct. Training provided under the project to DPMH's
central environmental protection unit is expected to initiate development of the
staff's capabilities to manage environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and to
monitor construction and maintenance works for compliance with environmental
legislation. DPWH will submit an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) on all
subprojects to the Government's Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). For those
subprojects which the EMB considers would have a significant onvironmental
impact, an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared. When EMB approves
a subproject, they then issue an Environmental Compliance Certificate and the
subproject may proceed to implementation.  DPWh road design standards and
contract documents for project works will also be revised to include measures
such as siltation protection, anti-erosion works, etc. to ensure that designs and
construction techniques are environmentally sound.
13.         Program Obiective Categories.  With regard to the Bank's xrogram
Objective Categories (POCs), in addition to the environmental aspects described
above, the project focuses on private sector development through its emphasis on
contract, maintenance and its technical assistance for the development of the
local construction industry. The project also supports the country's poverty
alleviation program by addressing regional imbalances in road infrastructure,
especially in lower income areas.
14.         Benefits. The main benefits expected from the project are lower road
transport costs and savings in road maintenance costs. Benefits accruing to
competitive truck and bus companies will ultimately be peassed on to producers and
consumers through lower prices of goods and services.  Economic evaluations
carried out for individual road subprojects to begin in 1992 indicate economic
rates of return (ERRs) ranging from 19% to 126%, with an overall weighted ERR of
33%, which is considered satisfactory. Subprojects with ER^9s in the lower end
of the range are in areas like Negros and Mindanao and were selected in line with
the Government's objectives for regional development and poverty alleviation.
Subprojects to begin in 1993/94 would be selected on the basis of agreed
criteria, including an ERR of at least 15%.
15.         Risks. The main project risk relates to the Government's commitment
to, and the pace of, institutional reforms being supported. However, actions
already taken by the Government to decentralize its operations, increase private
sector participation in maintenance, and reduce its maintenance staff indicate
a level of commitment warranting Bank support for expansion of the reforms. In
addition, civil works under previous projects have been delayed and cons'truction
quality has sometimes been poor. Under the proposed project, these potential
problems would be addressed by appointing consultants to help ensure project
coordination and technology transfer, completion of actions already begun by DPWH
for timely subproject preparation, and strengthened quality assurance measures.
