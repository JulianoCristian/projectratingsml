will,\n            by and large, have positive impacts on the surrounding\n            environment, namely through improved wastewater systems,\n            better use of irrigation, and drainage systems, with\n            improved public health conditions. Nonetheless, this\n            environmental assessment looks at potential adversity on the\n            environment, due to land terracing on slopes, deforestation,\n            adversity affecting natural habitats, and biodiversity,\n            uncontrolled use of pesticides, and herbicides, and, impacts\n            on cultural heritage sites. Mitigation measures include the\n            following. Contractors shall be responsible of maintaining\n            appropriate ditches to control drainage channel discharges,\n            and disposing construction waste, oil spills, and lubricants\n            at selected dump sites. The Archaeology Department will\n            conduct ad hoc inspections, in coordination with government\n            agencies, to prevent the risk of damage to unknown\n            archaeological sites. Communities, and municipalities alike\n            will be involved in the adequate disposal of solid wastes\n            resulting from schools rehabilitation, which prioritizes on\n            sanitary, and toilets installation. Likewise, the\n            rehabilitation of health centers will require municipal, and\n            community involvement for the adequate disposal of medical\n            wastes. The Ministries of Energy, and Agriculture,\n            contractors, and communities will be involved in monitoring\n            irrigation, and drainage water quality resulting from\n            degraded ponds, and reservoirs, clogged canals, or\n            sedimentation. Adequate design of canals will provide access\n            for weeds/sediments removal, and, an operation and\n            maintenance plan shall enforce monitoring and control of\n            agrochemical uses."}, "docdt": "2001-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
