Development\n            Project (CDP) for Lebanon were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the CDP was started as a\n            separate, individual initiative. This type of project,\n            however, should fit and be implemented within the context of\n            an overall poverty alleviation strategy of the Government,\n            and it should include an exit strategy in order to address\n            the sustainability issue. In a CDD project, it is important\n            to have a project development objective that can be easily\n            measured and monitored, and to design a system that will\n            show trends in selected indicators. Despite shortcomings of\n            the implementing agency, a project can still be implemented\n            reasonably satisfactorily if the individual members of the\n            project management team are strongly committed and dedicated\n            to the successful implementation of the project. Timely\n            restructuring is essential to deal with design and\n            implementation problems and to ensure satisfactory project\n            implementation. The implementing agency should recruit as\n            field coordinators only those persons that actually reside\n            in the area or region, as frequent field coordinator visits\n            played a constructive role in the successful implementation\n            of sub-projects. Stakeholder ownership is critical for the\n            success of community sub-projects, and the concept of\n            'beneficiary' should include the community as a whole."}, "docdt": "2008-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
