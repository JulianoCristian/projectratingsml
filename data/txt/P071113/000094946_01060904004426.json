           Community Development Project is to establish an effective\n            and sustainable instrument to improve the living conditions\n            and the economic status of disadvantaged communities. There\n            are two main project components. The first focuses on social\n            and infrastructure development and provides sub-project\n            grants for 1) carrying out social assessments and designing\n            programs of sub-projects; and 2) implementing sub-projects\n            consisting of a) improving access to basic education,\n            health, and social services by rehabilitating and upgrading\n            schools and health, youth, cultural, and recreation centers\n            and facilities in poor areas; b) carrying out programs for\n            revolving school textbooks, literacy, and primary health\n            care; c) improving access to specialized social services to\n            satisfy the needs of vulnerable groups at risk; d)\n            developing basic rural infrastructure activities such as\n            community potable water and small drainage and irrigation\n            schemes; and e) enhancing environmental protection\n            initiatives such as reforestation and and natural resource\n            and cultural heritage preservation. The second component\n            focuses on income enhancement by funding capacity building\n            activities to support 1) micro and small entrepreneurs and\n            nongovernmental organizations providing credit to target\n            beneficiary groups; and 2) women, youth, and disabled people\n            to provide them with demand-driven specialized skills that\n            will help them increase income and business opportunities."}, "docdt": "2001-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
