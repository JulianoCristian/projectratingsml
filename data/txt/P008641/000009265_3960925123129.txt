SEVENTH PQWER 9ROJECT
(LOAN 2240-PO)
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Seventh
Power Project in Portugal, for which Loan 2240-PO in the amount of US$126.4
million was approved on February 24, 1983. The loan was closed on December
31, 1986, the original closing date, although one of che hydro plants
financed under the Project, Alto Lindoso, was still under construction and
US$44.91 million under the loan was still undisbursed.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy
Technical Division of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and Electricidade de
Portugal (EDP), the Borrower (Part II). The Ministry of Industry and
Energy and the Borrower provided comments on the PCR (Attachment 1).
Preparation of this PCR started about 28 months after the loan
closing date following a PCR mission which visited Portugal in April 1989.
This unusual long delay was due to: (i) the faint hope that Government
could, even at the last minute, change its posture regarding compliance
with major covenants agreed under the loan which would have allowed
extension of the loan closing date; (ii) the shortage of staff prior,
during and following the reorganization of the Bank; and (iii) EDP`s own
staffing constraints following an extensive administrative reshuffle. The
PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECa COMPLETION REPORT
SEVE431IrAOR! PROJECT
(LOA 2240-gP)
EVALATIONUMA
The Project had two objectives. First, to help EDP further
strengthen its organization structure, accelerate the integration of
municipal power undertakings which retailed about 27X of EDP's net
generation; and Second, to help EDP meet, at least cost, its forecasted
growth in demand while improving, or at least maintaining, the quality of
service.
Imolamentation Experience
Except for major design changes which arose due to the
prevailing geological conditions at the site of the hydro plant of Alto
Lindoso. the Project was executed as planned. In general, EDP planned,
designed and supervised the Project very ctnmpetently. Problems that arose
during implementation were handled by EDP with oompetence and, where
necessary, in consultation with the Bank.
The project was implemented essentially on  chedule, with the
exception of the Alto Lindoso plant which is expected to be completed in
1992, almost three years after the estimated at appraisal completion time.
usults
Although EDP was able to meet the Project objective associated
with meeting demand at least cost, the same cannot be said about the second
objective. The Iroject saw EDP's financial position deteriorate
drastically as the entity became handicapped by serious financial problems
stevming from its inability to collect its bills from recalcitrant
customers and insufficient tariff increases. These problems were outside
EDP's control in that they were all rooted in the lack of support from the
Government during the period of Project implementation. Thus, EDP failed
in a rather unexpected way in meeting the revenue covenant, the debt-
equity ratio, the agreed level of accounts receivable and the integration
of municipal undertakings. The lack of any Government action to improve
EDP's performance on the above-mentioned issues led the Bank to the
decision not to extend the loan closing date and to cancel the remaining
(US$44.91 million) undisbursed loan amount.



- iii X
Lesson eare
This Project is not an exception to the general rule that no
lending operation will have any chance of success unless there is a firm
and constant commitment on the part of the Government to achieve the agreed
goals. Under the Project, EDP's efforts to achieve the goals were
insufficient in the absence of supportive Government action which was
mainly due to the absence of & majority Government. The second lesson is
that projects should be closely supervised and the third lesson is that a
covenant should not become operative only towards the end of the project
period if it is to be effectively implemented.
Perceived bifferences Between Bank, and Borrower
Although the Government and the Borrower are in general
agreement with Sections I and III of the PCR, they wish to point out that
in 1986 changes were introduced in EDP's accounting system which explain
the drastic reduction of the entity's internal cash generation (ICS) from
15.61 in 1985 to (-18.3X) in 1986 (see para. 13). If the figures for 1986
and 1987 were expressed in their comparable figures in accordance to the
system prevailing prior to 1986, the ICG for 1986 would have been 1.71 and
not the reported (-18.3X). However, considering that the covenant called
for an ICG of not less than 30X, the achieved level of 1.71 was far below
the target level.

Guarantor                  Government of Portugal
Background
1.       At project appraisal in 1981, Portugal was heavily dependent on
imported crude oil and petroleum products for meeting its demand for energy.
In 1981, domestic production of primary energy accounted for only 17i of the
total commercial energy supply and the remaining 83X was imported, primarily
in the form of crude oil, petroleum products and some coal. Between 1973 and
1981, the annual oil import bill increased from $100 million to $2.4 billion.
During the same period, oil imports, as a share of export earnings, increased
from about 52 to 582. In order to reduce the dependence on imported oil, the
Government of Portugal developed a long-range energy policy, the basic thrust
of which was to diversify its energy sources and to develop its domestic
resources, with a heavy emphasis in the short run on energy conservation.
2.       GOP's energy policy initiatives have had the Bank's active support.
,Prior to the subject project, the Bank had made six loans to the Portuguese
power subsector, the latest in 1976 to finance part of the 1976-78 investment
program of Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), the national power entity
established in July 1976. It had also made three other loans to the energy
sector. Bank lending for energy had not only provided investment funds for
the projects and helped attract financing from other sources, but more
importantly it had contributed to the following major institutional changes:
(a) establishment of EDP and its development into a sound utility; (b)
implementation of a revised rate structure for electricity, taking into
account marginal costs of supply; (c) rationalization of petroleum prodiv:t
pricing; and (d) launching of energy efficiency programs.
Proiect Obiectives
3.       The project had two objectives.  First, EDP needed to further



strengthen its organization structure, accelerat- the integration of municipal
power undertakings (271 of all publicly sold electricity *ra8 outside EDP's
control), and improve its financial condition. The Bank's continued
participation in the subsector was considered essential to carry forward the
institution-building efforts initiated under the earlier power loans   Second,
the project would help ED? to meet, at least cost, its forecasted growth in
demand and to maintain the required reliability of the system. The power
generation program would also contribute to the national energy sector
objective of diversifying sources of imported energy supplies.
Project Description
4.       The project consisted of a three-year (1983-1985) time slice of EDP's
investment program and included facilities under construction in January 1983
or to be started prior to the end of 1985. It involved work on the
installation of new generating plants with related transmission and
distribution facilities. Completion of hydro plants under construction during
this period would eventually add about 1,459 MW (or about 312) to the system.
Amongst these, the Crestuma, Torrao, and Alto Lindoso hydro plants were the
more important. One oil-fired thermal plant (2x250 MW) would be completed and
one (2x300 OW) coal-fired thermal plant would nearly be completed. Two
combustion turbines (2x83 MW) would be installed at an existing thermal
plant. About 564 km of transmission lines and 12,500 km of medium and
low-voltage distribution lines would be constructed, along with associated
transformer capacity of about 4,700 MVA. The project would also provide
facilities to conrect 315,000 new customers to the national grid.
Miscellaneous additional works involved expansion of testing and measurement
facilities, purchase of additional computer hardware and software, a study for
upgrading the existing computerized accounting system, and a study for
identification of possible nuclear plant sites. The total base cost of the
generation, transmission and distribution programs and miscellaneous works and
services that would be implemented between January 1, 1983, and December 31,
1985, was estimated at US$1,169 milli3n, of which about US$453 million would
be in foreign exchange, as shown in Table 1 below:

Proiect Design and organization
5.       ED? was responsible for implementing the project.  Although it was,
at appraisal, a relatively new ccrporation, its staff had been working in the
sector for a considerable time with the utilities that had been merged to form
EDP. Thus EDP's staff were well qualified, with extensive experience in power
system operation, The Planning Department was successfully using modern
computer models to prepare long-term development studies (up to year 2010),
and medium-term investment programs which were revised once a year using sound
methods and procedures for determining the least cost development programs.
EDP's engineering staff were involved in the projects from the stage of
preliminary design up to commissioning of the facilities. Detailed
engineering designs associated with the project faclilities excluding
distribution works to be undertaken in 1984 and 1985 were ready at appraisal.
Construction supervision was conducted by qualified teams who lived in
accommodation provided by EDP at the project site. EDP's arrangements for
planning, engineering and supervision were satisfactory.
Procurement
6.       A list of goods (with their estimated costs) had been agreed between
EDP and the Bank as suitable for procurement in accordance with the Bank Group
guidelines for procurement and eligible for Bank financing. Contracts for
equipment and civil works to be financed by the Bank were let by international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines for
procurement. A preference of 152 of the CIF bid price or applicable duties,
whichever was less, was granted to any participating Portuguese equipment
manufacturers. Except for civil works associated with the hydro plants of
Alto Lindeso and Torrao, components against which the Bank would disburse were
to be impleueited within three years. Bidding and contract awards for a
considerable amount of equipment and materials were to be completed by
mid-1983, while contract awards and mobilization of contractors for civil
works aasociated with Alto Lindoso and Torrao was to take place in 1984.
Under the previous Bank loan, project implementation had been delayed somewhat
due mostly to procurement related problems. Accordingly, during appraisal
special attention was given to procurement issues in order to ensure that
similar delays would not occur under the present loan.
7.       A considerable number of contracts associated with the supply of site
construction equipment, studies, and some transmission and distribution
equipment had been awarded prior to Board presentation. Also, the list of
project components suitable for Bank financing included the tail end of civil
works and bulb units associated with the construction of the Crestuma hydra
plant (partly financed under the earlier loan). The Bank therefore agreed to
reimburse EDP in an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$5.0
million (about 42 of the loan amount), for payments made after July 1, 1982
(the time of project appraisal), towards items financed under this loan.
Environmental Aspects
8.       All steps were taken to ensure that EDP complied fully with the
regulations prescribed by the state Commission on Environment, which is
responsible for ensuring that environmental factors are taken into accotut



-4-
before projects, including power projects, are approved in Portugal. EDP took
adequate actions in regard to the environmental impact and relocation issues
created by the project, not only in Portugal but also in Spain for the Alto
Lindoso project. Thus, no environmental problekis arose during project
execution.
Risks
9.       The major physical risks facing the proposed project were those
normally associated with the construction of hydroelectric plants. EDP used
experienced staff in designinP-, inspecting and maintaining its hydroelectric
plants, and it took all necessary measures to reduce to the extent possible
the associated risks. In addition, EDP also employed a separate independent
panel of experts, acceptable to the Bank, to: (a) review the adequacy of th
designs of the dams of the Alto Lindoso and Torrao plants; and (b) conduct
periodic reviews during the construction of the dams. In addition, EDP agreed
to furnish to the Bank, not later than June 30, 1984, monitoring and
inspection programs for the Alto Lindoso and Torrao dams, which was done.
Implementation
10.      Except for adjustments to trim the investment program to fit in wlth
national priorities, the project was executed as planned. The only
significant changes in design were in respect of the Torrao and Alto Lindoso
hydro plants. As anticipated at appraisal, EDP planned, designed and
supervised the project very competently. Problems that arose during
implementation were also handled by EDP with the required competence, where
necessary in consultation with the Bank. Minor procurement problems did arise
but were resolved satisfactorily in consultation with the Bank. The design
changes at T-rrao and Alto Lindoso were as follows:
(a) 1Wrrao: (i) Height of dam increased by one meter to optimize the
gate opening; (ii) stilling pool extended by 20 m to improve the energy
dissipation of the discharged water; (iii) provision of separate galleries for
the inlet and outlet of the hydraulic circuit; (iv) addition of two more
underground chambers for the installation of electrical equipment; and (v)
increase in earth excavation and increased protection of river banks due to
unforeseen geological faults. These design changes resulted in the following
increases in the (4uantities of works:
Original       Actual       X Increase
(i)  Excavation (m3)                  488,300        628,968           29
(ii)  Reinforced Concrete (m3)         310,460        398,258           28
(iii)  Construction Steel (tons)          2,322          7,116          206
(b) Alto Lindoso: (i) Changes in the design of excavation; (ii)
construction of retention beams; (iii) concreting of geological faults; (iv)
consolidation of river banks; and (v) replacing of flat penstocks by buttLrfly
valves in the draft tube valves chamber.



Completion Schedule
11.      The project was implemented essentially on schedule, with the one
exception of the Alto Lindoso plant. (Even in respect of Torrao, construction
was completed with only three months' delay, in spite of the design changes.)
In respect of Alto Lindoso, there have been substantial delays because of the
design changes mentioned above and also because of an unanticipated problem at
the foundation of the old dam, which caused a delay of 14 months. This
problem could not have been foreseen at the time of appraisal. Consequently
the first unit of the power station is now estimated to be completed only by
May 1992 aad the second unit by September 1992. (By December 1985, date of
completion of the project, ttie contract for the hydraulic circuit had not yet
been awarded.) In May 1988, 1002 of the excavation and 702 of the concretting
at the dam and 50% of the excavation and 2 of the concreting for the
hydraulic circuit had been completed.
Prolect Results
12.      General.  Out of the project's two objectives one was fulfilled.  The
completed physical facilities enabled EDP to meet, at least cost, its
forecasted growth in demand. However, the project failed to achieve its
institutional goals. The earlier Bank project (of 1976) saw the emergence of
EDP as a sound utility. In the purely engineering area, it remained a solid
institution during the period of the project. However, the project has seen
EbP"s financial position deteriorate drastically. EDP became handicapped by
serious financial problems that were rooted in an excessive debt burden, in an
inability to collect its bills from recalcitrant customers such as
municipalities and industries, and in insufficient tariff increases. These
problems, which are discussed in paras 13-17, were outside EDP's control in
that they were all rooted in the lack of support from the Government during
the period in question. During project implementation, the Government changed
hands several times, and other considerations caused the various governments
to give little backing for EDP's efforts to maintain its financial position.
This shows the need for a firm and constant commitment on the part of the
Government for a project to achieve the agreed goals.
13.      Net Internal Cash Generation.  The revenue covenant under the subject
project required EDP to attain a level of net internal cash generation of at
least 301 of average capital expenditures, to be achieved over time, rising
from 102 in 1983 to 202 in 1984, 252 in 1985 and 30% in 1986 and thereafter.
The actuals for these years are given below. (These targets were considered
reasonable in view of EDP's need for resources with which to undertake its
investment program.)

Year                         Target                     Actual

-6-
14.      The target was substantially exceeded in 1983 mainly because:  (a)
the apppraisal estimate did not provide for the revenues for the year to
include interest on the arrears for 1982 and 1983; and (b) the appraisal
target was based on lower revenues, assuming the write-off of substantial
irrecoverable arrears from municipalities but owing to non-integration, t1--
anticipated write-off did not materialize. In 1984 and 185, the shortfallb
arose becaurs the Government did not approve tariff increases to the f-,ll
extent necessary even to keep pace with inflation, and these problems worsened
further in 1986 and 1987, again owing to grossly inadequate tariff action. As
a result, EDP's internal cash generation deteriorated seriously and was a
negative 18.3X in 1986 and a negative 17.41 in 1987.
15.      Thermal Support Fund.  In order to alleviate the financial
consequences resulting from wide variations between actual and average
hydrological conditions, the Government created .in 1960 a "Thermal Support
Fund" (TSF) administered through the accounting records kept by the then
separate generation companies. Surplus revenues in years of ebove average
hydroelectric generation were to be set aside to cover the costs of extra
thermal power production and energy purchases in years of drought. By 1976,
the TSF was in deficit, and this worsened significantly with the subsequent
drought years of 1980-1983. The fund was restructured at the time of
appraisal (January 1983), to provide for (i) segregation of TSF accounts from
those of EDP, and (ii) imposition of a surcharge on tariffs whenever the
accumlated TSF deficit and finance charges amounted to 151 or more of EDP's
annuai revenue. The level of the surcharge would be set so that any deficits
of the TSF would be fully recovered within no more than five years. However,
the Government did not fulfill its part of the agreement. It did raise
tariffs an average of 82 effective July 9, 1983 to provide additional revenue
to the TSF, but the increase was not enough to stem further increases in the
TSF liabilities. As a result, the fund continued to be financed by borrowings
contracted by EDP on its behalf, and the total liabilities of the TSF to EDP
progressively rose until at the end of 1985 they were Esc. 86,009 million
(US$611 million equivalent). As a result, EDP's debt-equity ratio was around
2.0 at the end of 1985 and 1.9 at the end of 1986, much worse than the ratio
of 1.5 specified in the loan documents as the cut-off ratio above which the
Bank's prior approval was required for further long-term borrowing. bespite
continuous urging by the Bank that the TSF be entilely separated from EDP and
managed as a separate entity, no effective action was taken by the
Government. Rather, in July 1986 the Government abolished the TSF by a decree
embracing several autonomous Funds without instituting any other satisfactory
replacement in its place.
16.      Accounts Receivable.  One of EDP's most intractable problems since
around 1979 has been the difficulty in cellecting its bills mainly from high
voltage consumers such as municipaiities and industries. As of December 31,
1981, EDP's accounts receivable for electricity supply had reached the
unacceptably high level of 9.5 months' sales, forcing EDP to borrow to carry
on its operations. About 702 of the receivables were due from
municipalities. Part of the problem lay in a shortage of resources arising
from the low tariffs that the municipalities charged its customers, but the
real problem was the growing feeling that they could postpone electricity
payments to EDP without fear of consequences. To alleviate the problem, the
Government put in place in 1982 a series of measures to establish a sound
relationship between EDP and the municipalities. It was then hoped that after



-7-
a lead time to complete the processes then under way, EDP's accounts
receivable would be brought under control by 1985. Accordingly, EDP agreed
with the Bank to ensure that commencing with the fiscal year 1985, EDP's
accounts receivable would at no time exceed the equivalent of three months'
sales. The Government also agreed to take all measures necessary to enable
EDP to meet this commitment.
17.      However, the expectations at appraisal did not materialize.  Rather,
the outstandings actually grew by leaps and bounds, from Esc. 55.4 billion or
US$393.55 million at the end of 1981 to Esc. 183.0 billion or $1,300 million
(equivalent to 11.5 months'sales) at the end of 1986, in spite of the
integration of all but eight of the municipal utilities. This worsening
problem contributed in no small measure to EDP's liquidity problems and forced
it to borrow expensive funds in the market.
18.      Integration of Municipal Undertakings.  At the time of appraisal, 65
municipal and private undertakings had been integrated with EDP, leaving 96
municipalities still to be integrated. At that time, EDP distributed about
73Z of all publicly sold electricity, with the balance sold mainly by
municipal undertakings. In 1982, the Government inaugurated a new strategy
for distribution. Under the terms of a new decree law, municipalities (or a
consortium of municipalities) could, if they so chose, transfer their assets
to EDP or to some other locally or regionally based public enterprise for
operation. It was expected at appraisal that nearly all of the remaining
mnicipalities would integrate or arrange a concession with EDP. EDP thus
expected to reduce the high level of arrears then owed by municipalities (due
to their practice L*  not charging customers at the full national tariff level
and not paying EDP for the bulk electricity supply), and to establish a sound
basis for the future ^ollection of amounts due. Although most remaining
mnsicipalities progressively integrated with EDP by selling their assets to
it, in March 1987 eight municipalities (including Porto) were still outside
EDp, accounting for 1.7 TWh (1986) of sales (at MV and LV) compared to 12.0
TWh for the whole of EDP. In a further bid to speed the integration process,
the Government enacted a new Government order dated February 25, 1987 enabling
EDP, in agreement with a municipality, to assume the powers of management and
to run the municipal utility as a separate entity outside EDP. In January
1988, EDP assumed the powers of management of Porto under the orders of the
Government although the municipal undertaking has still not been integrated
with EDP. Further progress was made in 1988, and by the end of that year, all
municipal undertakings except Porto were integrated with EDP.
Audit
19.      Under Section 5.02 (b) of the Loan Agreement, EDP was required to
submit to the Bank audited accounts within eight months after the end of the
year for 1982, seven months after the end of the year for 1983, six months
after the end of the year for 1984, and five months after the end of the year
for 1985 and thereafter. However, there were substantial delays in the
receipt of audited accounts, for which EDP was not to blame, mainly because of
accounting problems created by the integration of municipal undertakings with
EDP and extensive changes in accounting procedures that had to be authorized
in discussion with the Government. By and large, these delays were therefore
outside EDP's control. The extent of delays was as follows:

Performance of the Bank
20.      The Bank's performance from project identification through completion
was satisfactory except in regard to frequency of supervision towards the
close of the project. Thus, after the supervision of June 1984, the next
supervision mission was mounted only in December 1985, and in this period, the
financial problems worsened significantly. There was, however, continuity of
staff and the staff assigned to the project were well experienced. The
appraisal mission also identified the right issues and provided appropriate
covenants to ensure action. In the end, failing to get appropriate action,
the Bank proposed in early March 1986 to suspend disbursements unless an
agreed program to address EDP's financial problems was put into place. The
matter was even personally raised L,' the Bank's Country Programs Director with
the Deputy Minister of Finance but to no avail. In the event, since there
were no potential disbursements which would be subject to suspension 1/, the
loan was allowed to run its course until the Closing Date of December 31, 1986
and the unutilized balance of US$44.91 million was cancelled. While the Bank
thus raised the problems with the Government, it is not clear whether earlier
action might have had a better impact.
Peformance of the Borrower (EDP)
21.      EDP's performance continued to be excellent, as under the earlier
project, except in regard to its financial situation, which was due to
circumstances beyond its control. There were cordial relationships between
EDP and the Bank throughout the project period. However, in regard to
long-term debt, EDP failed to obtain the Bank's prior approval in each case
where the approval was necessary under the debt-equity covenant.
Performance of the Government
22.      As already mentioned in para. 12 above, there was considerable
political instability in the country during project implementation, leading to
frequent changes of Government and frustrating decision-making on sensitive
1/  No commitments entered into after January 1, 1986 were being honored by
the Bank for disbursement purposes. Also, interest during construction
was not normally subject to suspension.



-9-
political issues such as tariffs and integration of municipalities. The
unstable political climate led the Government to display what the Bank
perceived as an apparent lack of commitment to its undertakings with the
Bank. This was most evident in respect of the financial issues facing EDP.
It was not possible for the Bank to get the Gov-ument to agree on an
acceptable plan of action to resolve the issues. In consequence, the closing
date was not extended beyond the original date of December 31, 1986.
Peformance of Consultants
23.      The performance of the expatriate firm of consultants appointed to
identify possible nuclear plant sites was satisfactory, while that of the
expatriate firm for upgrading the accounting system was mixed.
Lessons to be Learned
24.      There are a few lessons to be learned from this lending operation.
First, no lending operation will have any chance of success unless there is a
firm and constant commitment on the part of the Government to achieve the
agreed goals. Under the project, EDP's efforts to achieve the goals were
insufficient in the absence of supportive Government action. The question
arises whether at the time of appraisal, the Bank had just cause to question
the Government's commitment. Going by the experience of the previous loan of
1976, the Bank was indeed justified in accepting at face value the
Government's assurances. This leads on to the second lesson, which is that to
be able to monitor strict compliance with the covenants, regular supervisions
should be undertaken by the Bank and not, as happened here in 1985, after an
18-month interval. A third lesson is that a covenant should not become
operative only towa is the end of the project period if it is to be
effectively implemented. For example, the covenant on restraining EDP's
accounts receivable to three months' sales was to be effective commencing with
1985, the last year of project implementation, which left little time for any
reasonable dialogue to take place between the Bank and the Borrower, for
corrective action to be initiated by the Borrower and for the Bank to invoke,
if necessary, any remedies in the event of non-compliance with the covenants.

POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEN
As to the Distribution investment program, the appended tables
summarize works completed on the period 83/85, as show% in the
quarterly reports. A column for 1986 waa also added.
The deSree of implementation on the various items is not uniform.
According  to   quarterly  reports   forecast,  the   degree   of
implementation of annual plans did not show a clear trend,
ranging  froa   very   poor   to   extremely   high   degree   of
implementation, in some cases above 100%. The reasons for that
can be found in the quarterly reports, but effets of integration
of  Municipolities,  must   be  underlined,  as   they  lead   to
adjustemsnts on invesotmet plans.

3- COST OF THE PROJET
1 - The following tables provide:
Table I  - Iwsrmnt PrOg   (1983/87)
Table II - Investment Progr  (1983-87)
(values confired)
InsUtn t Progr  (1983-8)
(as per Appraisal Report)
Table m  - Deviaticn betWaw I and I.
2 - The tenical cost of the proJect (at 1982 pricew) was estited at 130.9
thamwid million esados (1,334.0 million dollars) for the period 1983-8,
%hereas the works carried out totalled, in that sum period, 106.9 thound
mllion escdom (1,097.5 milion dollas), at the exchage rte adoped In
the Appraisal Repot.
-         7herefore, the degree of work carried out along that period w_ 81.6%.
We dshuld mantion that at the beglzili  of the period that percentags was
hig  (93.9%), progmssively decreasing to 72.1% in 1985 and 63.7% in 1988.
3 - The evolution of the exchane rate (see Table I) was conideraby different
coivaratively to that contuqoated in the Appraia Report which partly
Justified the decrease of the ammt inveited, exprssed in dollars, to nmuh
lor values then th    previusly estimated. So, consider    the investbent
mae (te:hnical cost, current prices) canerted into dollars at the exchan
rate in force alag 1983-85, ve rewh a total of 1,174.9 millIon doLllr. This
unot :ccxmts for Just 67% of the value that would have been red if the
exhange rates xpected in the Appraisal Report would 1'Ave been verified. On
the other hand, th  Internal inflation Inreased mmh above the figr provided
for in the Aprisal Report.

Under the loan agreent signed on March 11, 1983, the World Bank agreed to lend
to EEP an amxot equivalent to 126.4 million dollars, in varias currecies.
The proceeds of the loan were meant to cover part of the goods and services requir
for the project as well as financial  ages dwing constrzction and other charges
on tie loan.
The origioi  dt schedle was not fulfilled, having bee dised cnly
the wDnt equivalent to USS 81,486,577.21.
Table I sets forth the categpries of itns finWAred out of the proceeds of the loar
and the yearly allocation of the awnts of the loan to each category.
Tables TI and m  c¢mpare pisildints with the real allocated anmts
a  repective percetages.
Table 1V siw  the quarterly d     nsbavsment sdhedule of the Appraisal Report verDn
the reality.
Tese Tables evidence that just 64% of the proceeds of the loan, correspolding to
WS 81,486,577.21 has been used.
The arulment of the loan was wroxned by the Bank on Deceeber 15, 1986 and
foRally reqsted by EP thr4i telex No. 124/87 of Febry 9, 1987.
In March 1987 the am.nt of USS 42.4 millicn wa anulled and the balanoe of US
$ 2,513,422.79 (Banc's letter of September 24, 197) in September of the sm.yew.
Tt most sigiwant devaticns are found In iteu  1 and 3,  pectively "eivil
eneering works for Alto Lindoso, Torro And Crestua hydro pawr plants" and
"Site equiplnIt. An Infportant deviation is also found in item 5 "laboratory,
aototae a-d hardwab equiwnt" becm    a few adjustmnts to the origial cunslt-
4Ig cotret had to be introed, numly in the aomnting ares. Also, shortep
of qualified pezornl In EDP affected the initial ccmletion dates.
Besides, as a rewlt of delWs in the prject, interests during constructicn were
much below the exctatiou.

Item 3.15 of the Staff Appraisal Report of the World Bw* calls for the revisir
at the tmin of pepaing the final report, of the matters relative to envirn-
mental impact caused by the undertakings. Particularly, it shazld be revised
the necessary measures for the reduction or cuspensation of posslble negative
effects on the different sectors affected by the project.
The 8stLlies dealing with Alto Lindoso development (includng Touved, plant dam-,
stream) were made by both E!SPresa Geral de Fomento, in Portugal and IDASA - ThgE
neria del Atlantico, SA, in Spain.
EDiresa Geral do Fcmento has also studied the envirownental aspects of Torr5o
developmnt.
AppendIxes 5 ard 6 provide a resumi of those stuzies for each development, cha-
racterislng the respective enviramnts, reporting the main impaot8 and def1nin4
the-correcting aid conpernating #meaures to adopt.
gm negotiation and accomplii!ment of those m.erLues are puruing nonuuLy,
either in Portugal or In Spaln, taking into accout the cormlusian and recmn-

1. DECRIPTIMO  OF TE UNTRHAEINGS
The Alto Lindoso and Touvedo hydroelectric developmnts are
situated in the upstream extreme of the national course of the
LLma river. They are integrated into the general sche  forecastec
to utilize the hydroelectric powers of the catchment area of the
Llma river in Portuguese territory..
The Alto LLndoso reservoir, created by an about 110 a-high
dam which is located immediately downstream of the internationtl
stretch of the river, will suberge  about 1 .100 ha. This area
corresponds almost entLrely to Spanish territory where   the
comprised river stretch is about 17.5 km.
The respective underground powerhouse, located slightly
downstrem of the vertical of the dam left abutment, will be
equipped with two. generating units which have the global power of
630 MNW the discharged flows being led back through an about
5 100 am-long tunnel. The forecasted output in this pldnt wlll be
about 877 GMh in average year.
.The Touvedo plant will be situated about 18 km downstram of
Alto Lindoso.
The respectivedam is of the gravity type, about 41 m-high.
oad lts about 10 km-long reservoir will flood about 170 ha.
The open-cast powerhouse to be established on the left part
of the river bed in prolongation of the dam profile will  be
equipped with a power generating unit of 25 MW. its output being
estied in 61 NMN.
2. DZICRXPflOF 0 THE ENV ROWMEN? SN PORTUGAL
The valley of the LLma river with flat. bottom is inserted in
*a gorge which has abrupt and high banksi the longitudinal profile
is interrupted by asmal weak-headed rapids, some natural ones and
othes of artificial.dau. The main tributaries of the Lrama river
n -ational territory are the Castro Laboreiro rLver (on the
fr=ontler and the Ves river, both on the right bank.



- 40 -
The longitudinal profiles of the tributaries are very
inclined, a fact that speeds the fast propagation of the local
floods.
The main economic activity of 'the population living in tbe
azrea under study is the agriculture , where two different types of
exploitation are perceptibles
- The utilLzation of the low zones of the generally very fertile
vallys. .whore a very intensive agriculture is practisd, thA
main cultivations being the corn, the potato. the horticultural
ones and the vineyard. As exemples oh these areas, one may
point out- the meadow near the village of Virzea.. the riparian
zone of 3m6lo and the Entre-Ambosos Rios wide valley.
- The utilization of some mountains zone where an agriculture
auch guided to basic products of subsistence is practised,
such as: the rye, the barley -and fodder to feod the cattle
throghout Winter.
The Alto Lindoso reservoir in Portugal will submerge about
183 ha of riparian lands, approximately 23 ha of which ar arable
lands  not being however affected any dwelliAg. At Touvedo, the
future reservoir will submerge about 100 ha of riparian lands,
47 ha of which are arable lands. Fiften constructions Will
further be affected, of which six are dwelling-houses and twoare
camercial houses.
3. ZDDTZsPZCATXo O0 TSE hIWXRDNHfh?AL IMPACTS
In the presence of the procedure to execute the LLndoso
plat and the Touvedo reservoir, three types actions. that are
Liable to arouse some significant environmental impacts are.
. eihaixed:
- The phenomno  concernLag the construction of each one the dams
and the remalning works and complematary installations,
including the set of supporting provisional works.
the existenc  of each one of the dam  and of the set of final
istallations that result from their construction, namely,
- Th resorvoirs created by the dam.



-41-
3.1 - NatUre of the macts
As for the nature, the impacts may be classified into
- Physical impacts - they are identified taking into ac ,mt
the cOmpOAnet affected.    -
- Sociological impacts - they are analized on an assumption
that eMphasizes-the 'sUbject0
submitted to the changes forecasted
in the physical environment.
.3.1.1 - Impacts of physical nature
3.1.1.1 - Climatical impacts
The foreseeable climatical chanqes are very little
significant.
The increase of the water free surface at the Alto
Lindoso reservoir little affects or does not affect atall
the Portuguese basin; the way fogs and frosts, relative
humidity, local dews and rains frequently increase will
have to be forecasted over the flooded areas upstream of
the already existing reservoir and, therefore, in Spain.
3.1.1.2 - Kydrologicai impacts
The hydrostatic level may decrease a bit in the 7.2
km downstream of the Alto Lindoso dam up to the outletof
the tailrace tumnel. in order not to affect the local
agricultural activity, and in precise situations, ZDPmay
need to let som  irrigation flow pass towards downstream
of the dam.
Upstream of the dam, in the border zone of the
reservoir, the hydrostatic level raises, being of reduced
advantage in Portuguose lands, except for the raising of
the water level in some shafts aDd to open new irrigation
shafts in the valley of the Castro Laboreiro river where,
on the other hand, fertile l nds of Vdrzea and of Insuas
will be submerged. ?he effects concerning the raising of
the water lovel will be much more felt in Spanish
territory.



-42-
In the reservoir basdi to be located at ?ouvedo, the
local hydrostatlc level will obviouslyraise too, although
La a relAtively reduce stretch.
3.1.1.3  Hydrodynamical impacts
a) Upstreo of the Alto L$ndoso dar
It is estimated that the sedLment discharge of the
Lina river wll be about 100 ton/ka2/year, and the
dLscaSrge transmitted at the bottom is Vorth bydislodging
of sediment and saltation about 20% of the total sediment
dischare.
Mainly the silt and the clay and som sand will be
deposLted in the reservoir. However, if the operating
regime Ls intensive and makes the reservoir level vary
considerably, the quantlty of sand to be deposited wil
he hlgher.
b) Downtrem of the Alto Lindoso dam
With the construction of the dam at Touvedo and
eosequent raising of the base level of the Lime river#
a setting back of the months of the inf loving water lines
from the dam up to near Cidadele will be checkeds this.
will cause a relatively smali increase of the sedientato
mainly in the Tamente and Proufe rivers. as well as in the
stream  of Poibas, ?ajacor Moinhos and CabaninhaS.
Downstream of the Touvedo dam, as this one will penui
to modulate the flows that were discharged at Alto Lindoso
the modlfLcations of erostve nature will not increas gives
the regulation of the flows to be discharged in thvalley.
3.1.1.4 - Morphodynamical impacts
TakLng into account the geological structur of thf
region, the movemnt of large land masses with spectacuisi
slidings is not expected. However, if there are great and
frequent oscillations of the reservoir level, the tectonic
structures permit to forecast the possiblity of soME slopS
sl1es.



- 43 -
3.1.1.5 - Sesicalimpacts
This. region may be considered as characterized.by
siemic movement with acceleration of 60 gal - 60 cm/ofg2
in a return period of I 000 years. It wag been with this
value that one has begun the dam (Alto Lindoso and TM"
do) designs, corresponding to a seism of intenity Im -6.8
i.e., degree VII'on OAeralU's scale modified.
In a return period of 100 years, the seumm to be
ciered will have an acceleration of 27: gal - 27 cm/se
to whlch the intenasity I a 5.8, degree VI on Mercalli' s
scae modified, corresponds.
3.1.2 - Impacts of sociological nature
3.1.2.1 - Sociological areas of impact
The com_mities of Varzoe in Soajo and of Lioso
should be considexed vith par;$cular emphasis in this
chapter. The formr case is a clearly more important om
becuse a large part of the agricultural area of theo
village will be submerged.
At this moment, wthout investlgating in detal the
whole phenomen involved, little maore may be forecasted
tba, for some cases. movings of the-population in
geogrphc  terms and, conseuently, with changes in thdi:
psychological, sociological and, perhaps, ideological
equlibria in.an extent that will be necessary to dofine
on later stages of the study. The change in the familia
enterprses and in the agricultural expioitation manner
gy have important effects on the reguiding itself of the
interaction and of the institutional structures thmselves



-44-
3.1.2.2.- Foreseable impactS
The main effects of the Lindoso undertaking are
situated, in human and social terms, in the village of
VAr:ea. (*) of the Soajo p5 iiS.Vwhee the major part of the
arable lands will be submerged. The village being
situated in the point of confluece of the abrupt slope
with the meadow, as if they were not willing to occupy
fertile land with their houses, the inhabitanti of VWraea
live on the meadow and, one could almost say, for the
meadow. Thence the reason why one verifies thats most
people seem not to. Wish to leave the place. after the dam
is constructed, though they are awra that there would not. be
sufficient lands left for them to cultivate and to live on
such lands, even with difficulties similar to the present
ones .
The overflowing of the arable lands of* V¶rzea will
possibly destroy a communitarian life that has so far
been condition for personal and collective guiding. The
eventual displa ement towards more or less neighbouring
areas, like Assoreira or Mesio, will need .to be performed
with the utmost care in the terms of socio-anthropological
acompani ment, aiming at reguiding their tables of refeenc.
in terms of the new place and ways of living, a- different
communitarian environemont.
T*) The number of portions (properties) embraced by the re8ervoir is
703, which belong to 102 landowners from the village of VArzea.
The type of utilization of the corresponding area is:
aultivation 15.6 hal fallow 3.0 hat sloughs 6.5 ha and wood
21.9 ha.
The area of fallows to be sumerged is 11. S ha in a total of more
than S00 ha.
fhe number of landed properties alredy acquired is 60.
Th total area of the arable lands belonging toinhabitants of
V¶rzea is 85.8 ha.



- 45 -
A somewhat different kind of problems will b  the
Ong that is possible to forecast for the area of Lindoso
and of the sites place where the main sociological m
will not result, provaling not only the ecoloqical and
econemic modifications but also the interaction of two
communities, or rather. of a coammunity and of a population
aggregates the former being traditionalist and structured
on the basis of essentially current social and cultural
valuest and the latter being formed by the mass of site
workers that may be characterixed, in a very summarized
manner, by its anonymity and heterogeneity.
3.2 - Location of the impacts
once the several types of impacts that are forecasted as
a result of the Alto Lindoso and 5teuvdo dams are analyzed
according to their nature, they are located along . the
different stretches of the reservoir  pursuant to the appends
maps.
4. DZSCRIMP!ON OF TR ZNVWIRONDNN IN SPAIN
fTe Lima river in its affected reach coWprises the
municipalities of Lovios and Entrima. from the frontier with
Portugal up to th neighbourhood of the Poverhouse of Uas Concba
As main feature it may be pointed out that the river runs
inserted in mountains, having elovations near 500 a and a great
proliferation of ravines and valleys; these are forxmd'in the
confluence of the Lima river with its tributaries, where the
better fitted agricultural lands are found. as it is the case of
the $alas. Lovios, Caldo and Casal rivers.
As it generally occurs in GalUsa  antd precisely in the
region of Alto Linoso (a zone being the object of study), the
Pepilation gathers in small centers near the arable lands, among
Which Valoiro, Lovios, CoMpostelA, Aceredo. Bau, Quintela, Re-
lolira, auscalque and L anteil are emphasized.
Yhe reservoir will affect about 646 ba. 250 ha of which
ar arable land. on the other hand, it shouI4 be staded that
117 dwellings, one church and thlrty six mills will be affected.

increase of humidity of the.air  a greater evaporation in
ammtens of heat and. conseuently, an increase of the rains
in the hiqh zones will thus be reorded.
F   mor., it should be stated that there is a spring
of the mal waters in the village of Villr .- mea (Lovios),
origineted by fracture located in the course of the Caldo
river. There is a thermal fountain in Portugal at an
elevation sim4ila to this one.
5.4 - Hydrodynamical impect,
The hydrodinamical impacts are important in terms of*
physical environment. It should be taken into consideration
the majority of the rivers which flow into the Lima river
are of toruntial regime. These rivers, which have a
considerable head, show great energy and, consequently.
dynamics makes the river carry all the solid materials that
arive at the river bed.
5.5 - IorphodyniiCal impacts
These are the impacts produced by the change of the
forms. From this viewpoint, it should be taken into account
that the Alto Lindoso reservoir will affect the forms procucec
by the following material s
Impacts produced by granitic forms, granodioritss and or
scbists.
Impacts produced by the alluvial materials.
a) Tspacts pwodWuc by granitic, granodiartiLc forms and.
schists.
The posble impact is reduced in this type of materials
for beig very hard rocks.
b) Ipact produced by the alluvial materials.
fle alluvial materials ar  found in the vallys of the



- 48 -
rivers and in the slopes of the m     as. As for the
materials that appear in the valley  of the rivrs, they mAy
be terraces or also loose blocks which the river.has  arried.
Both in a type of alluvial material and in the other
Ones, the dyamics iMpcti is important in the zone of tho
river reservoir, since it may cause the scouring of the
sl6pes and the deposit of sediments in the reservoir itself.
As for the sliding of the hillsides, the more logical
repercussion vill be the appearance of crumblings, with
which* irrespective of-geoteohnicalproblUas. a decreas  of
the edaphic surface and. consequently, of;the product

5.8 - cological impacts
The possible impacts that the future veseroir may cause
in the existing flora and fauna are analyzed in this chapter.
- Ilora
The impacts on the flora will be closeli connected to
the modifications which will be checked in the climate of
the zone.
A  it stated in the climatology chapter, the future-
reservoir may make the precipitations and fogs inerease,
which means an increase .of the hlaidity.
The actually existing vegetation is composed of the
Country pine tree (pinus pinaster), alders (alnus glutino-
sa L. ), the oak tree (quercus robur), the acacia, the
-eucalyptus and the vegetition typical of the low tmotain.
The futur change of the miicroclimate will not cause an
outstanding impact for mentioned species, given that ther
3existnce can be noticed iii zonsi of Galicia with a high" 
degree of humidity, although an increase of the vegetation
typical of humid zones, such as the willow an" the alder,
is foreseeable.
As for the cultivations, the future climatology may make
funguses appear; this will comp9l.to.4a grsater number of
treatments in the,horticulture and in- the grapevines. it
hold however bepqited out that.winter floods of the Lime
river bring about similar situations at present. On the
other hand, an  idree of the erosion capacity of the

As for the water fauna, the ma4n water living species
are the cann trout, the barbel and baj,a the features of
which enable them to adapt themselves to the future condition
of the reservoir.
5.9  impacts produced on the historic-artistic patrimony
!h zone affected by reservoir is not rich is
archaeological structureso* such as graves and castrost though
lt is foud lnteresting to analyze and catalogue the possible
tracs of lithic industries, since the themisquiteunknown.

reprospeating type preliminary study was.carried au inthe
iae affected both- on the Lima river and on the Castro La-.

One deduces from the mentioned study that, within the
limits that encompass the reservoir  waters, it does  not
seem there to b remains of great archaeological structures
though one may document the existence in the same ome of..
sme interesting geologic and edaphic forations il terraces
of the ancient quate ry.
For the purpos of solving the possible impact of the
reservoir on the geological and archaoloical patri
it is recouended to carry out the following pollcys
a) Prospecting in the. zone affected by cataloguing all the
possible places. with. archaeological and- geological
-interest that will be. affected by the reservoir.
b) Excavations in the zones that come to be found interesting
As it is obvious, these works shall be carried out
under the supervision of the Culture MiLnistry bad with lts
cooperation to,-in case said. Miniastry considers it
convenient, carry out the laboratory study and the scientiflc
publUcation of the results.
5.9.2 - Impacts on monuments
The sole monumental resource affected is the church
of Aceredo.
In this church. romanesque traces of an ancieot church
utiUlzed for the construction of the exLsting one are still
manifest.
its archLitectural value is scarce.
510 - Impact on the comanunications
*Te zone affected is connected by the .CH-540rro   from
Otense to Portugal, in- addltion to a copLous system of
district roads and.local roads which,. starting from the 546
high road connect the several. dwelling centers aog-    -
themselves.      *.

The future reservoir will bring about important impacts
oan the communications network, tho reason why each one of
them is thereupon analyzed in detail, beginning with   the
domestic communications, with the religious type outbuilding,
agricultural work and services.
Impacts on the Domestic communications
The CR-540 high road will be affected in a section of 10
km,, approximately between km 64 and km 74.
Given its importance as axis of commnunications at
municipality, province and even international level, the
construction of a variant to replace the existing one is
ceonsidered essential.
ReUgious type outbuildings
The impact produced by the reservoir in thb comuications
that join the different population centers with the parish
center analyzed in thLs chapter.
For this purpose each one of the parishes is individually
analyzed.
- Parish of Ilia (T.14. of Entrimo and Lovios)
The centers of 8uscalque, Reloeira, Quintela and Lante-
ail belong to this parish.
For being totally flooded, the first two will not be the
object of this analysis.
The local road which actually connects Quintela to Lan-
temil will be submerged, the reason why a variant of said
road is proposed, which wsill permit to communicatewith theo
parish center. As for the village of Lantezil. the
communications that join it to IIIa will not be affected, the
reason why its religious outbuiidings will notsuffer any type
Of impact.
- Parish of Galer (T.M. of Entrimo)
The religious communications will not be affected in the
parish.



- 54 -
- Parish of Mania (T.M. of Lovios)
It should be stated that, though the parish canter is
metioned as being the village of MaJn, the church ad the
grveyard are at the place of Aceredo Both the church and
the graveyard will be affected by the future reservoir. As
a solution, the removal of the church or the construction
of a new one in the vicinity of Compotela, near the proposec
varlant to the CN-540,  is proposed. being thus solved the
co-unication problems by relUgious reasons as far as this
parish is concerned.
- Parish of Lovios (T.M. of Lovios)
with the raising of the water level in the Portage and
Salas tributaries, the existing communications between
Lovios and the villages on the right. bank of the mentioned
rivers will be cut off, the reason why a variant of the
road from Lovios to Gendive which will restablish the
*mntibned       cations is proposed.-z-
- Parish of Torno (T.M. of Lovios)
The religious type connections in the parish are ensured
with the new viaduct over the Lii.a river, which joins serdadifia
to Torno, thus replacing the existing stone bridge.
Parish of -San-Martin do Grou  (?;M. of Lovios)
The cominnications in this parish will not be affected.
fPrish of San Manuel de Grou (T.L. of Lovios)
The comunications that connect the centers of villAges
with the parish center will. not be affected.
Depedence upon agricultural work connectiom
Given that a reservoir can priorly create a barrler
that separates the arable lands from the dwelling place of
thi owners, the impacts en the accesses to thementioned
arable lands are analyzed in this chapter.



- 55 -
-In this perspective, the most affected zones seem to
be those corresponding to Buscalque, Illa and Lantemil.
where sewral inhabitants with arable lands and dwelling oan
opposite banks of the reservoir were detected:
- 1 landowner of Buscalque with 3 700 m2 in Bau and 9 000
a2 in Cmpostela.
- 3 landowners of 1lla, one of them with properties of
11000 o2 in Compostela, 5 500 m2 in Bau. and the remainiiL;
ones with lands in Compostela.
- I landowner dwellinq in Portugal, whose lands in Compos-
tela and Bau are let on lease to inhabitants of Lantemil.
The influences on the mentioned connections of the
agricultural work do not justify the construction of a
viaduct between the dwelling zones and the arable lands.
the reasmo why it is supposed that the appropriate solution
would be the acquisition of the mentioned lands by the
Eteprise  that will operate the hydroelectric power plant.
Cone*ctions concerning services
At present, places like Quimtela, Lantemil. Quintas..
Asperelo are deeply connected to Entrimw in terms of trade.,
banks, etc.. As these populations are all situaded on the
same bank, and further considering the proposed aCe¢ss
network, one will not forecast any impact on the actually
existing service connections.
Thaeopulations situated on the left bank of the
river depend on Lovios in terms of servicess there is not
alas here any impact to be feared, since the future variant
of the B-540 and the viaduct over the Salas river will
ensure said connections.

5.11 - impats of religious nature
Both the graveyard and the church of Aceredo (both
at levels lower than that of full storage) are by themselves
an important impact, given that the asJes removal turns into
a complex work requiring the cooperation not only the civiL
authorities but also of the church authorities, As wv1l as
of the uajerity of the parish inhabitants.
a £s a solution for this problem, one proposee  thh
removal of the parish center with.its graveyard to a new
zane that may dispose of good couunications with   the
remaining parish, after trying to find out what the affected
people think.
5.12 - Lotion of the imets
Once analysed. the several types of impacts which
are.expected as a result of the Alto Lindoso dam in Spain
are located along the different stretches of the dam.
pursuant to the appended maps.

equivalent to ture mmths.
After Deoer 1985t (), the ammit of accuts receivable contU= to lrase
rehing at the end of 1987 Eec. 206.6 billion (equivalent to 11.8 mmntt of
sales) of ldch Ese. 180.3 million represent the uumt in arrears. In this
flzre the burden of the mmicipalities is  admxlately 68.6% In 1987 euit
64.7% in 1986.
The Industry sector slightly reduced Its ccntribution for the total In arears,
28.6% and 25.7%. respectively in 1986 and 1987.
The indicator "collection rate" evidences the clear aggpavation of the situation
in 1987 cncernIng the municipalities in spite of having been integrated all but
six nuzLcipalities.
Alwog with the proceeding of the integrations, as referred to In the following
item, the Governust has recently set a few moamwes to be issad. Thee nEELres

SYNTHESIS OF THE TARIFF           DT 11/"JDPL
________LO ___8 IN_WE PRIO  198___          0| 02
l- 60neral
a) Thermal Supoort Fund
Enforced by a Governmental Order - Decreto-Lei nQ 351/83, of
August 1st .It was autonomous both administrative and
financially from Electricidade de Portugal - (EDP), and its
aim was to correct the financial results of EDP, caused by
deviations of the hydrological regimes from the average.
A sequence of four extremely dry years led to a deficit
situation of the fund.
In order to correct this deficit a Governmental Order -
Portaria nQ 755-A/83, of July 9th - settled the inooicing of
an additional to the energy rates, for the LV, MV and HV
tariffs.
In 1985, the additional was changed to a percentage - 8% -
of the total invoice - Portaria nQ 31-MISS, of January
12th.
In 1986, the Thermal Support Fund, as an entity with
administrative and financial autonomy, was extinguished
- Decreto-Lei nQ 202/86, of July 22th. Its attributes were
then committed to EDP, being the invoicing of the additional
kept, up to the annulment of the deficit.
b) Indexation formula
In 1987, a Governmental Order - Portaria nQ 518/87, of June
26th - revoked the indexation of the energy rates to the
fuel prices.
c) Low - voltaae tariffs
The lower limit of the subscribed demand for the three-rate
time-of-day tariff, was revised from the previous 13.2 kVA
to 19.8 kVA - Portaria nQ 31-M/85, of January 12th.
For that tariff, the invoiced demand, that was previously
considered equal to the subscribed demand, was defined,
since then, as an average of the maximum demand (15 m) and
the subscribed demand.
d) Value Added Tax
It was introduced in Portugal in the beginning of 1986.
The  reduced  value  of  8%  has  been  considered  in   the
electricity sales.

In December 1987, six wuicipalities (Porto, Espirio, Gondomar, Paredes,
Valawo  and Covil!l) were still coutside EDP amcamting for 1.47 T?h (1987)
of sales (at 4V anid LV) compared to 18 TSh for the *hole of DP.
On the first of January 1988, the Integration of Paredes took pla:e nd at
the end of 1988 cnly Porto remaned nunaintegrated.

Comments
The issues facing the project at the Issues Paper stage were as
follows:
(a) The financing plan for the project, estimated at that time to cost
US$2,640 million equivalent, was uncertain and it was necessary for
the Bank to be satisfied that the financing for each year of the
project would be arranged;

Table 2
Page 2
(b)  GOP and EDP had requested that the Bank loan be increased from the
planned US$80 million to US$100 million;
(c) the satisfactory restructuring of the Thermal Support Fund (TSF) was
needed in order to balance over the long term the cost of generation,
in real terms, from thermal and hydro sources. Approval by the
Council of Ministers of the decree law restructuring the TSF was
proposed by the appraisal mission as a condition of negotiations and
its publication in the official gazette was further proposed as a
condition of Board presentation;
(d) establishment of a plan of action was necessary to resolve the issues
of municipal arrears, operation of municipal undertakings or their
integration with EDP and implementation of uniform low voltage
tariffs; and
(e) appropriate cash generation targets for EDP from 1983 onwards had to
be established. The appraisal mission proposed not less than 102 of
the average investments for 1983, 20% for 1984, and 302 for 1985 and
thereafter with special provisions for dry years.
At the Loan Committee stage, the Loan Committee's approval was
obtained with the following changes:
(a) increase in the loan amount to US$126.4 million to cover interest
during construction of about US$25 million on the Bank loan;
(b) waiver of the Council of Ministers' approval of the decree law
restructuring TSF, as a condition of negotiations; and
(c) provision of retroactive financing of up to US$5 million.
There were no significant changes as a result of negotiations except
for the following:
(a) increase in the disbursement percentage for civil works from 402 to
75S to mainta4n the Bank's contribution to the overall investment
program; and
(b) as requested by EDP, the period during which interest during
construction could be financed under the Bank loan was shifted from
that within the three-year time slice of actual expenditures in
1983-85 to the three-year grace period of the loan.

Comments
The slow disbursements were mainly due to: (i) delayed award of the
main civil works contracts related to Torrao and Alto Lindoso hydro plants;
(ii) the lower tender prices obtained for the main civil works of Torrao; and
6iii) the significant rise in the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis other
currencies, reaching its zenith in early 1985 and only slowly declining
thereafter through the rest of the project period.

Comments
The actual total cost, excluding Interest During Construction, was
only 672 of the appraisal estimate, mainly because of the Government's
decision in 1983-84 to slow down public investments during Its stabilization
program. The appraisal estimates and actuals of the costs of the components
financed under the Bank ltoan are given below.

The actuals were only about 652 of the appraisal estimates mainly
because of the significant increase in the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis
other currencies and because of less work actually performed compared to what
was estimated at appraisal.
B. ProAect Financing
At appraisal, there was a foreign exchange financing gap for
implementing the 1983-85 program (the project) amounting to 78% of the program
and it was therefore not possible to have a financing plan with firm
commitments over the project period. No meaningful comparison of the actual
financing plan with the appraisal estimate is therefore possible. However,
based on the previous borrowing performance of EDP, the Bank was comfortable
about EDP's ability to complete the required borrowings, and this expectation
was fulfilled.

C. Studies
EDP undertook two studies under the subject project, one for
upgrading the existing computerized accounting system and the other for
identification of possible nuclear plant sites. The study for identification
of possible nuclear plant sites, financed by EIB, was satisfactorily completed
by an expatriate firm of consultants. Possible nuclear sites were identified,
but owing to the controversies surrounding nuclear power, it has been decided
to defer the nuclear program for some time. As regards the study for
upgrading the accounting system, which was financed by the Bank, the
performance of the expatriate consultants who conducted the study was mixed,
since in certain areas, e.g., that of low voltage consumers, the results were
disappointing. The work suffered also because counterpart staff of the right
calibre could not be provided by EDP. The budget allotment for this project
commitment was exceeded by the end of 1987; work has continu..d in 1988 and
1989 on a skeleton basis and will be stopped altogether after 1989.

PROJECT CONPLET;ON UEEM7
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2240-PO)
In general, the enterprise (EDP) is in agreement with the PCR.
However, it has a few specific comments that it would like to see
incorporated:
Concerning the financial objectives established for EDP under
the World Bank loan, some statements should be revised or
complemented so as better to explain the real evolution of the
financial situation of the enterprise. Specifically, paras. 13
and 14 (net internal cash generation) comment on the accounting
figures without mentioning that in 1986 there was a change in
the accounting system, which had an impact on the following
years and which in part explains the drastic deterioration of
the ratio in 1986 relative to 1985.
This fact ought to be mentioned, because the ratio ia 1986 would
have been positive tl.67%), instead of negative (-18.3%),
demonstrating a situation very different from that of the
previous year, although far out of line with the objective set
under the loan. The same observations are pertinent concerning
the assessment in this chapter concerning the contractual
undertakings (status of covenants), section 5.05.
Concerning para. 11 (completion schedule - page 5), it is
expected, at present, that the two units of Alto Lindoso would
be commissioned by June and October of 1992, respectively.
Concerning the percentages realized for excavations and
concreting to May 1988, the percentage of concreting realized
