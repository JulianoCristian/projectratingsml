       time slice of EDP's overall investment program.

The 1983-85 investment program\n            includes: (i) construction of hydroplants which will\n            eventually add 1460 MW to the system; (ii) completion of the\n            second phase of an oil-fired thermal plant (2 x 250 MW),\n            installation of two combustion turbines (2 x 83 MW) at an\n            existing plant, and work on the first phase of a coal-fired\n            thermal plant (2 x 300 MW); (iii) construction of about 564\n            km of transmission lines and about 12,500 km of medium- and\n            low-voltage distribution lines, with associated transformer\n            capacity of about 4,700 MVA; (iv) expansion of testing and\n            measurement facilities; (v) computer hardware and software,\n            and a study for upgrading the accounting system; and (vi)\n            study for the identification of possible nuclear plant sites."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
