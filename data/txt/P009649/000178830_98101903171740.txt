REPORT AND RECOI2fMI4DATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PitOPOSED LOAN TO
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
1.        I submit the follow,ing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $40 million to
the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited (ICICI),
with the guarantee of India.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Since 1955 the Bank has made seven loans to ICICI totaling
US $159.91 million (net of cancellations). The first five. loans have been
fully disbursed. As of April 3Q, 1970, $35.3 million of the last two
loans (Loan No. 414-IN and Loan lNo. 515-IN) remained to be disbursed.  Loan
No. 414-IN is fully committed and the uncommitted balance of $8.7 million
for Loan No. 515-IN is expected to be committed shoitly.- Repayments to the
Bank had totaled US $56.5 million by April 30, 1970.
3.        In view of its estimated foreign exchange requirements over the
next two years ICICI has requested an eighth Bank loan. In February 1970
a mission visited India to appraise ICICI. Negotiations were held in
Washington and were coipleted on Play 18, 1970.  ICICI was represented by
its General Manager, Mr. S. S. Mehta; India, the Guarantor, was represented
by Mr. G. V. Ramakrishna, Director, M'Iinistry of Finance, Department of
Economic Affairs.
4.        Details of undisbursed loans and credits and comments on delays
in project execution were given in paragraphs 5 and 6 of my Report on the
Sixth Industrial Imports Credit (P-794, dated April 8, 1970). The following
is a statement of the totals (in US$ millions) as of April 30, 1970: 1/

5.        Since 1957, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totaling
US$42.3 million, of which US$34.2 million represent loans and US$8.1 million
equity. As of April 30, 1970, US$15.4 million of this total had been dis-
bursed and US$6.1 million cancelled. The largest commitment is a total of
US$18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertilizer plant in Goa. A
number of other industrial schemes are currently under consideration.
6.        A Credit for the Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project ($35 million)was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 5, and one for the Punjab Agri-
cultural Credit Project ($27.5 million) will be submitted for consideration by
the Executive Directors shortly. A Credit for the Cauvery Delta Irrigation
Project ($26 million) is expected to be negotiated soon. Appraisal reports are
being prepared for an agricultural credit project in Andhra Pradesh, an
agricultural aviation project, a grain storage project, the Pochampad irri-
gation project and a second stage power transmission project. Several other
projects are also being prepared.

PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India Limited" (DE-66a) dated May 20, 1970 is
attached.
8.        ICICI was established in January 1955 to finance investments in
industry in India through medium and long-term loans, equity investments,



- 3 -
underrritings and guarantee obligations. During the fifteen years since it
was formed ICICI has always been closely associated with the Bank.
9.        For most of its existence ICICI wTas the only private institution
in India oDerating on a national basis providing long-term finance for
industry in India. Recently, 14 major banks wuere nationalized, eight of
which are shareholders of ICICI; as a result, public institutions now
hold just over 51 percent of ICICI's share capital. However, this is
not expected to have any significant effect on the company's management
and policies in the foreseeable future. Other shareholders include over-
seas institutions in France, Germiany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States w-hich together hold approximately 30 percent of the company's
shares.
10.       Since its inception, ICICI has grown steadily and has made a sub-
stantial contribution to Indian industry. As at January 1, 1970 the
Company had resources (share capital, surplus, reserves and long-term
borroTings) totaling the equivalent of about $220 million, of which about $130
million represented borrowings in foreign exchange.  Apart from share
capital and reserves of about $18 million equivalent, all other rupee
resources (of about $72 million equivalent) have been derived from loan
funds provided by the Government of India, either directly or through the
medium of the Government-ot,Tned Industrial Development Bank of India, and from
debenture issues.
11.       Through December 31, 1969, ICICI had approved assistance to 794
projects which had been sponsored by 536 enterprises; among these projects
wrzere 214 set up by newi enterprises.  At the end of 1969, 143 projects
were in the planning stage and 137 wjere under construction, of which 33
had started production.  ICICI's clients no,r account for important shares
of Indian manufacturing capacity in certain sectors; they have also been
making a significant contribution to India's industrial exports. (See
paragraphs 31-33 of the Appraisal Report).
12.       The recession vhich characterized the Indian economy during
1966-1968 adversely affected ICICI's business, wthich had grown from a level
of commitment averaging Rs. 78.6 million prior to 1964 to a peak of Rs.
330.0 million in 1965. Commitments in 1966 fell to Rs. 175.7 million or
about only one half that of the 1965 peak. However, parallel with a general
business recovery, ICICI's commitments have been rising and in 1969 once
more reached the peak achieved in 1965. The rate of disbursements,
reflecting the time lag betw-een commitments and implementation of projects,
has naturally not yet increased as much as commitients. This is evidenced
in the pace of utilization of the Bank's last two loans (Loan No. 414-IN and
Loan No. 515-IN). Disbursements from these two loans amounted to only
$8.5 million in 1968 and to $12.3 million in 1969, compared with disburse-
ments of $17.9 million from Bank loans to ICICI in 1965. However, follow,ing
large commitments in 1969, disbursements were running at the annual rate of
over $25 million during the first four months of 1970. I.'hile this rate of
disbursements may not be maintained throughout the year, it is indicative
of the ups.2ing in ICICI's business.

13.       ICICI has a considerable pipeline of new proposals for both rupee
and foreign currency loans. As of May 14, 1970, ICICI had just over $lL
million available for commitment in foreign currency, of which +p8.7 million
represented the balance available from the Bank's seventh loan.   Yiost of
this will be taken up by two loans for which commitments are about to be
made. Moreover, ICICI's Board of Directors has already given approval in
principle to foreign currency loans for $21 million.
14.       Apart from Bank loans, ICICI has obtained foreign exchange
r,sources through loans from US-AID of 44.5 million (net), from Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau equivalent to $19.7 million and from the United Kingdom
equivalent to $2.4 million.
15.       ICICI envisages somewhat lower commitments in 1970 than last
year and a steady though modest growth over the next five years. Through
1972, ICICI's estimated foreign exchange needs are about $46 million.
These forecasts rest on the general expectation that the Indian economy
will not experience a recession similar to the one suffered in the mid-
Sixties. Barring such a development, ICICI forecasts seem reasonable. As
available foreign exchange balances are likely to be committed shortly,
ICICI is seeking to raise fresh foreign exchange resources to meet its
needs for about two years. IVith about $5-$6 million likely to become
available from Germany and the U.K., the proposed loan by the Bank would
provide the balance of ICICI's needs during that period. ICICI's lending
plans would also necessitate raising further rupee funds. Over a five
year period ICICI plans to borrow Rs. 400 million and increase its share
capital by Rs. 25 million.
16.       ICIC continues to be well managed and its financial position
remains sound. Despite the need to reschedule certain loans because of
the impact of the recession and despite there being some projects in diffi-
culty ICICI's portfolio is generally of good quality. Net (after tax)
profits have showm a modest but steady growth over the last four years,
having risen from Rs. 13.3 million in 1966 to as. 16.5 million in 1969; in
relation to average share capital this represents an increase from 18.6
percent to 22.0 percent. Reserves have risen over this period from
Rs. 33.8 million to 'is. 61.7 million or from less than 4 percent to 5.4
percent of the Company's portfolio. The debt equity ratio (as defined in
the last Loan Agreement bet-ween ICICI and the Bank) was 7.4:1 at December 31,
1969, compared with the limit of 9:1 established in the Agreement. ICICI
has recognized the need to strengthen further its financial position and
for that purpose ICICI will in the future earmark a portion of its reserves
against specifically established loss possibilities in its portfolio; this
earmarking will not be counted in its borrowing base as established under
the Loan Agreement urith the Bank. Also, to safeguard against the further
decline in its interest spread which would result from any increase in
the cost of future rupee and foreign exchange borrowings, ICICI is con-
sidering an adjustment in its interest rate on foreign exchange loans (now
8.5 percent). The foreign exchange risk of loans made by ICICI are borne
by borrowers.



PART IV - LEGAL IIHSTRUiEITTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement bet-,,een the Bank and ICICI, the draft
Guarantee Agreement betwJeen India and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article II, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The draft Loan Agreement and draft Guarantee Agreement conform
generally to the pattern of agreements for loans to development finance
companies. There is one provision which differs from those included in
earlier agreements with ICICI. As ICICI is a development finance company
which has been associated with the Bank for fifteen years and has
demonstrated its capacity to use capital effectively, only those investment
projects w-.hich need more than the equivalent of $4 million of ICICI's
resources (including the proceeds of any Bank loans) wrill require Bank
approval.
PART V - TTEf ECOTiOMY
19.       An Economic Report entitled, "The Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-13a) w!Jas distributed to the Executive Directors on April 30,
1970.
20.       ..hile India's debt service burden continues to be heavy, I
consider it appropriate, in view of the limited amount of IDA funds available,
to continue making Bank loans to India on a modest scale. As of April 30,
1970, the amount of loans to India (net of repayments) held by the Bank was
$620 million, of wzhich about $128 million remained to be disbursed sholwing
a net figure of $Lh92 million. Given scheduled repayments to the Bank and
expected disbursements, the proposed loan wTould not lead to a significant
increase in the Bank's net investment in India.
PART VI - C071PLIANCE VITH ARTICLES OF AGREIENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan wiould comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOHJENDATIOiT
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
