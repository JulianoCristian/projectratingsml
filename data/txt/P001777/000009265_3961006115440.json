Rehabilitation Program.  The objectives of the credit\n            are to support macroeconomic stabilization through the\n            strengthening of key elements of fiscal and monetary policy\n            while supporting an interlinked program of enterprise and\n            financial sector reform.  The credit has four components.\n            First, it will support the development of integrated\n            sectoral programs in the three key areas of agriculture,\n            health and education.  Second, the program supports the\n            central bank in its key central banking functions of\n            monetary policy management, banking supervision, legal\n            development, accounting - while continuing the strengthening\n            and the streamlining of the foreign exchange management and\n            allocation process.  Third, the program supports the\n            development of a competitive, efficiently functioning, and\n            truly commercial banking system.  New banking entry is being\n            encouraged and the existing state owned banks are being\n            \"commercialized\" and prepared for privatization.\n            Fourth, the program accelerates the privatization program\n            with particular attention being paid to the larger state\n            owned enterprises within the economy.  In addition to\n            privatization, the program supports a review of business\n            environment issues which impact adversely upon the\n            development of enterprises."}, "docdt": "1994-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
