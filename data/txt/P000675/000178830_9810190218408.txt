INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR THE
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
1.        I submit the °ollowing report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Enpire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$11 million on standard IDA
terms to cover the import component of the lending and investment program of
the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and to finance consul-
tants to prepare proposals for a national agricultural credit program.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Since 1950 when Ethiopia was the recipient of the Bank's first loan
in Africa, Ethiopia has received eight IDA credits amounting to US$55. 2 million
and twelve Bank loans totalling US$108.6 million including the Addis Ababa Water
and Sewerage Project approved earlier this month. A summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits in Ethiopia at March 31, 1972 is attached as Annex I.
The status of these loans and credits, including the reasons for certain delays
in disbursements, were analyzed in my Report and Recommendation to the Executive
Directors on the Addis Ababa Water and Sewerage Project (P-1051).
3.        Agriculture presents the best opportunity in Ethiopia for increasing
production and employment. Consequently, the Bank is making a major effort
to prepare agricultural projects and the Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa
has a substantial program of project preparation in this sector. During the
next 12 months I expect to present for your approval loans or credits for three
agricultural projects, an education project and a road project. One of the
agricultural projects, the Minimum Package Project, represents a significant
departure from the traditional approach of external financing agencies to the
financing of agricultural projects. In this project, the aim is to keep to a
minimum the expenditure per family so as to maximize the number of agricultural
families that will benefit from improved inputs and new techniques. The road
project would largely comprise feeder roads expected to benefit agricultural
production in areas to be covered. The proposed education project would also
place a high priority on agricultural education.
4.        Since 1965, IFC has made 4 commitments in Ethiopia totalling $14.1
million. A summary of IFC investments is given in page 2 of Annex 1.
5.        The AIDB project was appraised by missions which visited Ethiopia
in June and August 1971. Negotiations were held on February 14-24, 1972.
The Ethiopian Delegation was led by H.E. Ato Assefa Demissie, Managing Director,
AIDB, assisted by Ato Addis Anteneh, Manager, Agricultural Department, AIDB,
Ato Zerabruk Aberra, Senior Attorney, AIDB and Ato Teferra Wolde Semayat,
Economic and Commercial Attache, Ethiopian Embassy, Washington, D.C.

PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.        An economic report entitled "Current Position and Prospects of the
Ethiopian Economy" (AE-21) was circulated on November 24, 1971. Its main
conclusions were summarized in my Report and Recommendation to the. Executive
Directors of December 29, 1971 on a development credit for the Coffee Processing
Project (P-1006). I then noted that the Government hopes to be able to finance
almost half of public investment from recurrent budget surpluses and domestic
borrowing, which would represent a substantial contribution, but Ethiopia must
mobilize a substantial flow of external assistance in order to sustain an
adequate level of investment. Ethiopia's external public debt at December 31,
1971 amounted to $256 million including undisbursed amounts and annual service
payments corresponded to about 11.4% of foreign exchange earnings.   Since most
of Ethiopia's exports, particularly coffee, face marketing difficulties, the
annual growth of foreign exchange earnings is unlikely to exceed 3 or 4%,
which sets a severe limit to the amount of borrowing on commercial'terms that
Ethiopia can presently undertake. Since Ethiopia also remains among the poorest
members of the Bank Group, there is a clear need for most of external assistance
to Ethiopia to be on concessionary terms. A Country Data Sheet is attached as
Annex II.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS
Agriculture
7.        Agriculture is the mainstay of the Ethiopian economy.   It employs
about 90% of the labor force, contributes 58% of GDP, and accounts for almost
all exports.  Technologically the sector is backward.   It is estimated that
85% of those dependent on agriculture are subsistence farmers -operating on
very small holdings using-outdated methods. The main export is. coffee account-
ing for 60% of export earnings.
8.        Growth during the 1960's was slow. Commercial agriculture grew at
2.8%, subsistence farming at 1.8%, and the total agriculture sector at 2%
per annum from 1961 to 1969. This .compares unfavorably with estimated popula-
tion growth rate of 2.1%-2.5% during the same-period. Since 1969, domestic
food prices have risen sharply. Export growth, moreover,-has continued to
be slow.
9.        Because of meagre resources and limited markets outside agriculture,
raising the -rate of growth of per capita income above the low 2.0% of the past
decade can only be achieved by- significantly raising -agricultural--pro duction.
There is considerable potential for doing so, since there are some 18.3 million
hectares of unused agricultural land, -and the land under cultivation can be
made more productive through better use. Ethiopia also has 26 million cattle
and 22 million sheep, goats, and other livestock, the offtake from which is
only a small fraction of- the potential. The outlook for expansion of the
main export, coffee, is unfavorable but there is potential both for substantial
growth of other agricultural exports and substitution for imports of foodstuffs
and raw materials such as cotton. Overall, therefore, the market prospects
are good, but it is likely to take some time to organize producti6n to realize



-3-
them. This will require overcoming a number of major constraints including
the land tenancy system, inadequate research, transportation and credit,
inefficient marketing, the shortage of trained manpower, and under-financed
agricultural services.
10.       The Government's agricultural strategy reflects the need to improve
the lot of the vast majority of the population engaged in subsistence agricul-
ture while at the same time encouraging commercial agriculture in order to
avoid a potentially severe foreign exchange shortage by diversifying export
earnings and reducing agricultural imports. Until the Third Five-Year Plan
was launched in 1968, the Government largely confined itself to creating the
environment for private investment in commercial agriculture. This was in
keeping with a situation in which research, extension, and other infrastructure
were negligible. In subsistence agriculture Ethiopia initially concentrated
its efforts on a few intensive projects in limited high potential areas, such
as the Swedish-financed Chilalo Project, started in 1967, and the IDA-financed
Wolamo Project (Credit 169-ET) started in 1969. Based upon the results of these
pilot operations and the results of FAQ-financed fertilizer trials, the Govern-
ment in 1970 started a more extensive operation, the Minimum Package Program,
with a lower level of infrastructure and inputs and a lower cost per family
than the earlier more intensive projects. The Minimum Package Program con-
centrates on providing fertilizer and improved seeds to subsistence farmers
on credit, and training the farmers in their use. AIDB is the channel for
credit under this scheme, with the Government providing a 95 percent guarantee.
A project based on this concept designed to assist subsistence farmers through
extending the benefits of fertilizer and improved seeds to a substantially
larger population than covered hitherto is in preparation. We expect to
appraise it in the next few months. In commercial agriculture the progress
in Humera and Awash Valley indicates a new and encouraging willingness of
private entrepreneurs to invest in agriculture. The agricultural financing
under the presently proposed project is designed primarily to meet the needs
of commercial farmers. Pending the findings of an agricultural credit study
to be financed under this project, Bank Group assistance to subsistence farmers
can best be provided through package projects which combine credit with the
necessary extension and other supervisory services.
11.       Because agriculture is central to Ethiopia's development and the
constraints on its development widespread and severe, it was decided to under-
take a comprehensive study of it. A mission for this purpose has already
completed its field work and is expected to discuss with the Government shortly
its draft report and recommendations on a strategy, relevant policy alternatives,
and projects for agricultural development.
Industry
12.       Modern manufacturing has started only recently in Ethiopia.  In 1961
it contributed a little under 2% to GDP and then grew at an average rate of
23% a year from 1961 to 1967. Thereafter, the growth rate declined signifi-
cantly to 13.7% in 1968 and 10.9% in 1969. Indications are that the rate of
growth has probably not risen in the last two years. Despite the rapid growth
in the last ten years, modern manufacturing accounts for only about 5% of GDP
- slightly less than the contribution of handicrafts and small industries.



-4-
13.       Industrial expansion has been the result of direct government
participation and financial and fiscal incentives to investors. The unfamil-
iarity of local entrepreneurs with modern manufacturing and high minimum
investment which is needed to qualify for fiscal incentives have resulted
in the sector being largely in the hands of foreign entrepreneurs. Industrial
production is predominantly for domestic use; the main products are textiles,
food and drink, and construction materials. While a number of Ethiopian
industries are reasonably efficient, high protective tariffs and fiscal in-
centives favoring capital intensive methods have in many cases encouraged
high cost manufacture with limited value added, employment, or foreign
exchange savings. Moreover, the rate of growth of manufacturing has declined
since 1967 as the more obvious opportunities for import substitution have
been taken up. A structure of incentives placing greater emphasis on effi-
ciency and production for export is required for manufacturing to make a
larger contribution to economic growth, employment and economic diversifica-
tion. The Ethiopian Government has recognized the situation and the Bank is
assisting with studies aimed at rationalizing protective tariffs and fiscal
incentives to encourage greater efficiency, and increased exports. The
Government is also studying the feasibility of lowering the minimum investment
eligible for fiscal incentives from the present level of Eth$200,000 to encour-
age more local entrepreneurs and less capital intensive methods. Finally, the
decision to centralize Government investment in manufacturing in AIDB, where
proper criteria for judging economic returns and financial viability can be
effectively applied, should improve the productivity of investment in industry.
14.       The major constraints on the continued growth of manufacturing are
the limited domestic market, the scarcity of managers and entrepreneurs, and
inadequate emphasis on exports. In the longer run, expansion of the domestic
market for manufactures will depend on the rate of growth of income in the
agricultural sector. Meanwhile, based on the present market size, the prospects
for expansion through import substitution are only moderate. Therefore, the
major emphasis in designing policies for encouraging manufacturing must be
placed upon export oriented industries, and in particular upon the processing
of agricultural raw materials. The prospects of processing livestock products,
oilseeds, and vegetable products for export are good provided sufficient atten-
tion is placed upon meeting price and quality competition. The next Bank
economic mission will study the prospects for small industries and agri-indus-
tries and try to identify opportunities and the appropriate policies for
developing manufacturing for both domestic and export markets.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.       A report entitled "Ethiopia - Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank, Appraisal Report" (PA-123) dated April 10, 1972 is being distributed
separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
16.       AIDB was established in November 1970 as a share company under the
Commercial Code and took over a major part of the loan and equity portfolios
of the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), which had received two previous
Bank loans in 1950 and 1961, the Ethiopian Investment Corporation (EIC) and



- 5 -
the Ministry of Finance. The dispersal of investment financing for commercial
enterprises among DBE, EIC, and the Ministry of Finance, had prevented any one
of them from acquiring the staff and experience required for successful opera-
tion. In 1969 the Government appointed a Financial Intermediaries Reorganiza-
tion Commission (FIRC) to examine the situation. The Bank was closely associated
with the Commission's work. The recommendations of FIRC formed the basis for
the establishment of AIDB as'the primary institution for channeling Government
medium- and long-term financing to commercial enterprises in industry and
agriculture.
17.       The Minister of Finance is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of
AIDB and other members are the Ministers of Agriculture, and Commerce, Industry
and Tourism, the Minister of State for Planning, the Governor of the National
Bank of Ethiopia and the Managing Director of AIDB. The Board's high level
compoGitiori emphasizes the importance the Government attaches to AIDB, but
limits its working capacity. This has led the Board to delegate substantial
powers to the Managing Director which involves some risk, but which we consider
acceptable in the circumstances. AIDB has built up a nucleus of well qualified
staff. Its management considers that it needs some strengthening, and to that
end it has decided to recruit three experienced senior advisors; UNDP has agreed
to finance their cost and the Bank is the executing agency. One of these advisors
has already been appointed.
18.       In June 1971, AIDB's Board adopted a Statement of Policy which provides
AIDB with a generally satisfactory basis for project financing. The statement
emphasizes the intention that AIDB operate on a commercial basis and charge
interest rates adequate to meet its costs and provide for reserves and a profit
margin. To increase its resources and to broaden the ownership of industry,
AIDB intends to sell its investments when opportunities occur. AIDB may make
loans (including short-term loans) and equity investments and give guarantees
for public and private projects. It was agreed during negotiations that AIDB
would increase its minimum interest rate for lending to direct borrowers from
its current 8-1/2% level to 9-1/2%. This increased rate would more correctly
reflect the real cost of capital and improve AIDB's ability to attract local
capital resources by paying higher interest to depositors and purchasers of
AIDB bonds. For intermediate borrowers like cooperatives the rate will remain
at its current levels of 8-1/2% for medium- and long-term and 9% for short-term.
In order to facilitate lending to otherwise suitable commercial farmers who
could not meet AIDB's current financial requirements, it was also agreed that
AIDB would amend its Statement of Policy to permit financing of up to 75%
(instead of previous 50%) of the cost of agricultural projects operated by
experienced resident farmers requiring financing of less than US$100,000.
Finally, it was agreed that AIDB would increase the present maximum life of
loans from 10 years to 15 years (including the period of grace if any) in
order to permit a more flexible policy for the financing of some investments
involving assets with a long expected life. The adoption of these amendments
is a condition of making the Credit effective.
19.       AIDB has an authorized share capital of Eth$100 million (about
USU43 million) and a paid-up share capital of Eth$35 million, all of which
is held by the Government or its nominees. AIDB has received and will continue
to receive 50 percent of the National Bank's annual profits through 1974. For
this and some additional assets transferred to it, AIDB has another Eth$18
million shares to issue. AIDB has also taken over from the former institutions



- 6 -
foreign borrowings amounting to Eth$27 million of which Eth$8.3 million are
undisbursed. AIDB also has deposits amounting to Eth$9.0 million.
20.       With the completion of asset transfer in January 1971, AIDB acquired
an investment portfolio with a book value of Eth$100 million. The value of
these assets was realistically assessed at Eth$71 million and the Government
accepted this valuation as the basis for the issuance of shares to the Govern-
ment in return for the transferred assets. This conservative valuation puts
AIDB in a sound financial position to undertake new loans and investments.
Of the Eth$71 million, Eth$20.5 million was in agriculture (Eth$18 million
in loans, Eth$2.5 million in equity) and Eth$50.5 million in industry (Eth22.5
million in loans and guarantees, Eth$28 million in equity). Although much
of AIDB's time since its establishment has been devoted to building its
organization, recruiting staff, and solving problems arising from the trans-
ferred portfolio, it approved during the period through January 8, 1972,
Eth$7.7 million of-medium- and long-term loans, of which Eth$4.2 million was
for agriculture and Eth$3.5 million for industry.
21.       AIDB's profitability since the start of operations on an annual
basis has been about 1.7% of total assets. The low profitability is largely
due to the low return on the transferred portfolio. However, profits provided
sufficient margin to cover possible losses on new operations. Annual profits
after taxes are expected to amount to about 1.2% of total assets through
December 31, 1973 after making adequate provisions for losses on loans and
investments. Despite this somewhat low return on total assets, debt service
coverage is satisfactory. The ratio of AIDB's debt to equity is low and leaves
adequate room for further borrowing.
The Use of the Credit-
22.       The proposed IDA Credit is intended to cover the import portion of
AIDB commitments for medium- and long-term financing for a period of about
one-and-a-half years ending December 31, 1973. The credit would provide
US$5.5 million for industrial subprojects and US$5.3 million for agricultural
subprojects. Some of the funds may, with the Association's approval, even-
tually be reallocated from one sector to the other in light of AIDB's exper-
ience with the use of the Credit. In addition, $200,000 would be provided
to the Government for consultants to prepare proposals for a national agricul-
tural credit program.
The Agricultural Credit Program
23.       Of the US$5.3 million provided under the Credit for agricultural
investment, about US$3.8 million would be allocated for lending to about
245 commercial farms.  These are mostly well established enterprises of
50-500 hectares with considerable additional land, now either idle or
underutilized. An additional US$500,000 is allocated for financing about
5 cooperatives, of which 4 would be cooperatives serving small farmers.
US$1.0 million is allocated for financing agri-businesses, likely to include
a dairy, a tea plantation and an alfalfa pellet scheme. The total cost of
the-agricultural subprojects to be financed is estimated at US$13.4 million,



-7-
of which AIDB would finance US$8.7 million and the subborrowers US$4.7 million.
The estimated foreign exchange content of this lending program is about US$6.3
million, to be covered by the US$5.3 million IDA contribution and US$1.0 million
from the sponsors of agri-business subprojects.
24.       The agricultural portion of the Credit would be available for lending
without the Association's prior approval for subloans, other than to coopera-
tives, in amounts less than US$100,000 for the production of cereal and root
crops, cotton, fruit, vegetables, or oil seeds, or for dairy fanming. These
crops were selected on the basis of AIDB's submission of satisfactory model
farm plans, and in the future additional crops may be added with the Associa-
tion's approval. To confine the use of Credit funds in equity investments in
agri-industry to an amount consistent with AIDB's other requirements for re-
sources, an aggregate limit of US$500,000 has been agreed.
25.       Without taking account of the cooperative and agri-business subprojects
mentioned above, the agricultural portion of the Credit is expected to result
in the development of some 24,000 ha. of land and of some 20 dairy farms. The
additional annual production is estimated to be 60,000 tons of cereals, 4,000
tons of cotton, 26,000 tons of various vegetables as well as small increases
in milk and other less important crops. It is likely that the agricultural
credit program would also finance the first commercial production in Ethiopia
of tea and alfalfa. The domestic market, which suffers from chronic shortages,
can easily absorb the incremental production from the commercial farming
operations.
26.       Because of the need to develop an agricultural credit system in Ethiopia
to support the expansion of agriculture, the proposed credit would include
US$200,QOO towards the cost of an agricultural credit study to be carried out
by a firm of consultants. It was agreed during negotiations that the consultants
and their terms and conditions of employment would be subject to IDA approval
and that they would be appointed within five months of Credit signing.
The Industrial Credit Program
27.       AIDB's commitments.for industrial projects over the period of about
one-and-a-half years ending December 31, 1973 are estimated to amount to about
US$8.7 million. AIDB has a substantial backlog of subprojects and this is a
reasonable target. About 80% of AIDB's industrial investment is expected to
be medium- and long-term loans, and the remainder in share capital. On the
basis of the projects currently under AIDB's consideration, industrial finana-
ing is expected to be distributed amongst textile and apparel (25%), food (25%),
construction materials (20%), small industry (20%), and miscellaneous (10%).
28.       The import component of AIDB's commitments for industry over the
period is estimated to be about US$5.5 million, or 63%, which would be financed
from the proposed IDA Credit. The local currency requirement is estimated to
be US$3.2 million and will be met from AIDB's local resources. The industrial
portion of the Credit would be on normal terms with a free limit of US$100,000
for individual subloans, not to exceed an aggregate of US$1.5 million.



-8-
Benefits and Justivf caJon
29.       The priposed IDA Credit is designed to help in strengthening AIDB
as a development finance company to support productive investment in agricul-
ture and industry. Investments in the commercial farms, for which model farm
plans are available, are expected to result in financial returns estimated
to range from 23% to 53% and economic returns from 23% to 56%. As with most
development finance companies, the projects likely to be submitted by potential
subborrowers are not yet known and, therefore, their economic and financial
benefits cannot be quantified at this time, but for loans to cooperatives, and
for loans or investments exceeding $100,000 in either agriculture or industry,
the demonstration of satisfactory rates of return would be one of the criteria
for approving subprojects.
30.       Additional benefits to Ethiopia from the Credit would include foreign
exchange earnings from exports (mainly vegetables and oil seeds) and savings
on imports (e.g. wheat and cotton). These should be worth at least US$3.5
million annually at full development, and could rise to over US$5.0 million
annually if investments in agri-business are made as expected. Other crops
produced for domestic consumption would help meet the country's increasing
food demands. Theoinvestments in some 250 agricultural enterprises will
create between 3,000 end 4.,OOO new jobs, but no estimate of employment
creation in industry is possible until the specific subprojects are identi-
fied. The Ethiopian Government would benefit from additional revenue, parti-
cularly from corporation taxes (at present 40%) which should ultimately yield
at least US$2.0 million equivalent annually. Lastly, the proposed study of
agricultural credit is expected to lead to significant improvements in the
agricultural credit institutions and policies, particularly for assistance
to small farmers.
Terms of Credit
31.       The Government would relend to AIDB US$10.8 million of the Credit
at an interest rate of 7-1A% annually. This loan would be repayable over
a period of up to 15 years from December 31, 1973, the last date for submitting
subprojects to the ABsociation. As a new institution, AIDB would qualify for
concessional treatment vith respect to commitment charge on the loan, paying
3/4% per annum only against undisbursed amounts authorized for withdrawal by
IDA in respect of subproject loans or investments (except agricultural loans of
less than US$100,000 for which no advance authorization is required). The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. US$200,000 of the Credit
amount would be retained by the Government for the consultants' study.
Procurement and Disbursement
32.       Procurement and disbursement would broadly follow normal Bank Group
practices appropriate to the two main components of the proposed Credit.
Commercial farning investments would generally be small and varied and mould
not be suitable for bulk procurement through international bidding. In most
cases on-farm works (e.g., buildings and land development) would be undertaken
by the farmer himself or by small contractors. Goods required for other on-
farm investments-(about 200 tractors, and other agricultural machinery, irriga-
tion equipment and pumps) can be imported without restriction and would be



- 9 -
bought by AIDB borrowers from suppliers of their choice. Most of the large
international suppliers of agricultural machinery are represented in Ethiopia;
competition is keen and servicing and supply of spare parts are adequate. The
procurement of items to be financed for cooperatives, and for agri-business or
industrial projects would be considered at the time of subproject authorization
or approval and would comply with arrangements normally required by development
finance companies.
33.       The Credit would be disbursed over a period of about four and a half
years.  For agricultural loans of less than US$100,000, other than for coopera-
tives, IDA would reimburse AIDB for 70% of its disbursements, which is the
estimated import component. Reimbursement of all other loans and investments
would be based on the actual import component of AIDB's participation. IDA
would disburse the full cost of the consultants' study. AIDB disbursements
on account of loans or investments approved after March 1, 1972 would be
considered eligible for IDA reimbursement subject to their being consistent
with the terms of this Credit. The amount of retroactive financing for AIDB
disbursements prior to credit approval is expected to be less than US$500,000.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of Ethiopia
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
the AIDB, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for under Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
35.       The draft agreements reflect the normal patterm for credits for
industrial and agricultural credit projects. The relending of the proceeds
of the Credit (except for the portion for technical assistance) will be governed
by a subsidiary loan agreement between the Empire of Ethiopia and AIDB satis-
factory to the Association. The effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement,
the amendment by AIDB of its Statement of Policy so as to conform to the pro-
visions of the Development Credit and the Project Agreements, and the approval
by AIDB of the appointment of an industrial adviser and an economic adviser
upon terms and conditions acceptable to the Association have been specified as
conditions of effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
