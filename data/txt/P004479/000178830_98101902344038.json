 develop an institutional strategy for the implementation of\n            similar projects in the future. The project provides for (a)\n            rehabilitation of the sewer system in the central area of\n            Manila; (b) construction of a sewerage collection system in\n            about 2,050 ha of low-income and blighted areas; (c) staff\n            training and technical assistance; and (d) water quality\n            monitoring. The project should make immediate improvements\n            in the living conditions of about 900,000 urban poor, of a\n            total estimated 3 million population served by the project.\n            The main risk of the project is that this is the first major\n            sewerage and sanitation undertaking by MWSS. Because of its\n            innovative nature, a cautious approach is being taken by\n            implementing only 13% of the combined sewers construction\n            program in areas of significant hazard to public health, in\n            order to give time for the institutional strategy to be\n            tested. Technical and management assistance and training\n            provided under the proposed project and under a recent water\n            supply project (Loan 1615-PH) will help to minimize this risk."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
