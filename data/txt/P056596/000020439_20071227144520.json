This environmental\n            assessment (EA) identifies the negative environmental\n            impacts and presents relevant preventive measures. To reduce\n            air pollution, construction sites will be separated from the\n            surrounding environment. The sites will also be watered\n            regularly. Motor vehicle emission control measures will be\n            enforced to improve air quality. In terms of noise produced\n            by the construction machinery, noise barriers will be\n            installed on overpasses and elevated viaducts near sensitive\n            receptors and residential buildings. The use of low-noise\n            construction machinery will be included in the tendering\n            document for selecting contractors. To reduce vibration\n            levels, the Traffic Policemen Department is responsible for\n            restraining heavy-load motor vehicles in passing through the\n            sensitive receptors at night and prohibiting high speed\n            driving. The Heping Overpass will have a serious sunshine\n            obstruction impact on the residential buildings nearby. To\n            mitigate this, the distance between the buildings\n            neighboring the road and redline will be over 5 meters.\n            Greenbelts will be restored after construction to minimize\n            the impact on roadside vegetation. The silt and powder dust\n            will be removed out of the construction site to prevent the\n            debris from contaminating the drainage. Surface runoff from\n            the construction sites will be collected by storm sewer, not\n            discharged to the canal directly."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
