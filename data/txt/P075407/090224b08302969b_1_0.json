Between 2003 and 2012 three phases of trial road\n            selection, design, and construction were undertaken under\n            the RRST program. The objective was to compare new pavement\n            options in terms of construction and in-service performance\n            against a number of standard Vietnamese control sections,\n            monitoring of the trial sections commenced as soon as\n            construction was completed. A total of 156 kilo meter (km)\n            of trial roads have been constructed within a range of road\n            environments in 16 provinces, from which a representative\n            123 sections of between 80m to 200m in length have been\n            selected for ongoing performance monitoring. The condition\n            monitoring of the Vietnamese trials has resulted in the\n            assembly of a significant amounts of data on the performance\n            of a wide variety of pavement and surfacing types."}, "docdt": "2014-01-01T02:22:01Z"}
