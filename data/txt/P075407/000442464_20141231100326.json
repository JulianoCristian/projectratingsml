were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: gender based community driven small scale\n            road maintenance can be an effective way to tackle local\n            road maintenance issues. Rural road investment does not\n            always trigger the development of rural road transport\n            services. Rural road investment and maintenance require\n            adequate identification, planning, and costing procedures in\n            order to obtain the highest value for money over road life\n            cycles. Targeting small size contractors may trigger\n            additional transaction costs but can provide value for money\n            and quality outputs."}, "docdt": "2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
