                            Executive Summary

This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is an output from the Community
Infrastructure Upgrading Program (CIUP). The RAP takes into account
all resettlement and compensation aspects that originate from the
upgrading activities in 15 unplanned settlements in the three
municipalities of Dar es Salaam. The upgrading involves, among
others, the construction of infrastructure such as access roads,
drainage structures and public toilets. These construction works may
necessarily result into demolition of some of the existing houses and
other structures.

Chapter 1 of this document describes the procedural approach to
minimize unavoidable impacts resulting from demolition of houses and
resettlement. It describes the result of technical solutions to realize the
objectives, such as flexible ROW, and appropriate standards. Efforts to
minimize impacts, combined with suggestions brought forward by the
community at early stage in the planning of the CIUP in order to
further reduce the number of affected HH. As a result of this
consultative planning exercise the extent of resettlement in the 15
sub-ward is limited both in scope and scale. Out of total of 1,035
affected properties, only 25 will require resettlement of the affected
households. The rest need minor adjustments.

Chapter 2 gives an account on the project setting in the framework of
the Local Government Support Program (LGSP), including an
overview of the demographic situation in the 15 selected sub-wards.

Chapter 3 outlines the procedures to ensure full and transparent
information of the affected public and establishment of consultation
mechanisms.     Firstly  the   selection   process    of   community
representatives is described, which constitute important interface of
all planning activities as well as a first hand address of affected
persons presenting their concerns and aspiration with the forthcoming
settlement upgrading investment. Secondly the roles of Technical
Support Team (TST) and the Community Planning Team (CPT) are
explained in view ensuring public and household meetings to
facilitate the survey and awareness raising to Project Affected
Persons (PAPs) all details regarding resettlement (if necessary),
valuation, compensation payments, assistance and grievance
solutions.

Chapter 4 accounts for the household surveys and applied
methodologies to obtain a full picture about the impacts on individual
properties and residents, including businesses. Questionnaires were
instrumental in forwarding a wide spectrum of options and responses

that were taken into account in the RAP. In particular, the PAPs were
offered several options in cases of resettlement. It has been fully
explained that the Government will pay market value replacement
costs for properties (land and. structures) to ensure that affected
household can afford to buy a new residence or replace affected
structures. Out of 46 affected businesses, belonging both to owners
and tenants (Annex 2), the vast majority will be able to re-arrange/
construct new rooms to affected property. Therefore the temporally
impact on local businesses will be limited.
The chapter finally describes the extent of impact to properties being
affected in each of the 15 sub-wards.

Chapter 5 describes the steps taken in preparing the compensation plan.
To begin with houses eligible for the compensation in cash or kind are
determined ­i.e. affected households (owners and tenants) rather than
individual. The chapter then defines the compensation packages as per
impact. Each municipality provided annually updated (market ­ oriented)
standard compensation rates for paying replacement costs for land,
structures and other items (gardens and trees). Allowances for affected
households are paid in cash and kind covering for accommodation,
disturbance, transport, and loss of (temporary and permanent) profit from
affected business. Vulnerable groups receive additional allowances and
assistance and the RAP also recommends that "moving assistance" to be
provided to tenants living in the 25 properties that are earmarked for full
demolition in additional to compensation for disturbance and transport
costs.

Chapter 6. Explains the applied methods during the valuation process
(May-October 2009) for valuing and entering into negotiations and
agreements with the municipal valuation team. The process which
through the PAPs were informed of their rights during the
compensation determination process are described and the means
by which the affected assets and eligible persons were documented,
including the establishment of a dossier that will be entered into a
query database established       at the valuation section in each
municipality are described.

A monitoring database was established to facilitate monitoring of the
resettlement action plan, and that will also be used to record
information from the grievance redress system devised in the RAP,
described in chapter 7. This section also gives an outline of the flow of
information and responsibilities to address all complaints forwarded by
the PAPs with respect to the planned investment project in a correct
and timely fashion.

Chapter 8 specifies the roles and responsibilities of the institutional
actors relevant for this RAP, at municipal and others levels. Key

responsibilities are attributed to the Municipal Council`s Planning and
Coordination Department from which the CIUP Coordinator operates,
while the Urban Planning and Environmental Committee of the
Municipal Council scrutinizes and approves the RAP. The chapter also
outlines the roles of the Ward executive officer and the Community
Planning Team operating under the sub-ward chairman's.

Chapter 9. Provides the implementation schedule and the time chart
for all major activities and events that are determined in this RAP.
Timely planning of certain activities such as valuation, compensation
agreement and payment has been schedule to allow sufficient time
for the project affected person to arrange for alternative housing or
business premises, etc. before actual demolition starts.

Chapter 10 dwells on proposed monitoring of the resettlement actions
being the main responsibility of the head of the Planning and
Coordination Department in each municipality. A set of simple
verifiable indicators are recommended to monitor and evaluate the
success or failure implementation of the resettlement planning. The
verification method basically consists of household surveys.
Community planning teams (CPT) are will also involved in conducting
household surveys to assess the socio-economic situation of PAPs.

 Chapter 11 is the final part that provides cost estimates for
compensation of the affected houses and private structures, and the
costs associated with the relocation procedure and process. The
estimates for compensation costs are based on the records provided
by the household's valuers and surveys team. For all 15 subwards the
cost for compensation of 1,035 projects affected household amount
to Tsh 2,863,768,413. 00

1.0 Introduction
1.1. Key Sections of the Resettlement Action Plan

This document outlines a resettlement action plan (RAP) for phase II of the
Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program. The resettlement policy
framework (RPF) applied for the Local Government Support Program (LGSP)
which provides general guidance for development of this RAP was disclosed
for public discussion, in 2003.

This Resettlement Action Plan includes the following key sections:
     - Description of the project setting;
    - Collection of technical information to identify the extent of unavoidable
       demolition of houses and the necessity for relocating affected families
       or business, either permanently or temporarily;
    - Description of the nature and extent of community consultation and
       participation, including the establishment of sub-ward committees;
    - On-site data collection by means of specific inventory of the affected
       households to obtain exact figures of project affected persons (PAPs);
    - Valuation of the losses of the project affected persons (PAPs) by
       category of impact;
    - Development of compensation packages offered for each type of
       impact.
    - Description of the valuation process and the compensation s given for
       each property affected itemized by asset;
    - Implementation of grievance resolution procedures;
    - Institutional arrangements for payment of compensation, allowance,
       assistance and monitoring
    - Implementation schedules
    - Resettlement monitoring
    - Total budget estimates for the RAP

Prior to valuation exercise, field surveys were conducted to record existing
features, dimensions and values of the affected properties. The results of the
survey details out all particulars of people and affected assets. These records
are stored together with the household questionnaires (see Annex 5.3) as
dossier in the municipal planning and coordination department.

The proposed resettlement actions and measures will ensure:
   - The provision of timely and fair compensation, with the ultimate goal
      that all project-affected persons would be compensated at least to
      restore their pre-project living standard levels;
   - Compensation will include loss of non-movable assets and structures
      (market value), disturbance, vulnerability, accommodation, transport
      and loss of profit(business) allowances, as applicable;

    ___________________________________________________________________
   - Necessary assistance for relocation to all PAPs whose properties /homes
     will be totally demolished, prior to displacement, including assistance for
     the selection of new resettlement sites that have adequate facilities;


1.2 Principle governing the CIUP planning ­Minimization of Resettlement
    From the perspective of resettlement, the major principle adopted for the
    CIUP has been to minimize the extent of demolition of existing residential
    and commercial structures or affect on the structural integrity of individual
    properties. In this context it need to be noted that partial demolition will be
    permitted under the CIUP investment project in accordance with two
    provision made in legislative framework. In several cases of the land owner
    and the valuer have come to mutual understanding that partial
    demolition of house will be unacceptable, although it would structurally
    not affect the building's integrity. The procedures agreement is related
    particularly to cases where the families claimed that remaining property
    would hardly serve as adequate homestead or, in case of small business,
    as basis for sustaining the family livelihood. Consequently, such houses
    /structure would then be totally demolished and the corresponding
    registration and compensation packages would apply. For reasons of
    easing compensating for the hardship the RAP therefore has categorized
    any property as being totally demolished when at least 50% of all build-up
    structures building were to be removed.

   Engineer options and flexible design solutions
   On the engineering side the planning team adopted a more flexible
   approach. The principle of minimization resettlement was pursued by the
   following steps;

     i.    To minimize the extent of involuntary resettlement specific technical
           options have been taken into consideration. Much of the upgrading
           activity will focus on footpath, roads and storm water drainage
           improvements, in order to reduce the number of potentially
           affected houses in certain cases the CIUP planners/engineers, in
           close consultation with the communities, opted to adopt levels of
           service that are technically and financially appropriate (basic and
           intermediate service level)
     ii.   Rather than opting for rigid technical standards with respective
           ROW and more or less straight geometry of new roads the engineers
           designed meandering roods and drainage structure to
           accommodate existing structures as much as possible it reduces
           carriageways and right of way (ROW) to the minimum feasible width
           (to maintain unhindered traffic flow), and in some sections limited
           vehicular flow to one-way traffic;
    iii.   Partial demolition of built structures has been taken into account.
           The potentially affected structure have been carefully surveyed by

     Resettlement Action Plan                                               2
                   Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program
    ___________________________________________________________________
          the engineers to determine whether the affected building would
          remain structurally integral and safe from collapse after demolition
          of apart of structure. In case such examination gave doubtful or
          negative results, full demolition has been agreed.
    iv.   Selection location of new waste collection structures in uninhabited
          spaces where surrounding impacts would be minimized, in contrast
          to other reflections that would rather place the waste collection
          systems in closer vicinity to where (domestic) waste is generated
          and people would have short distance only to deliver and store their
          garbage properly.
     v.   In order warrant meaningful planning (e.g. to ensure safe
          emergency evacuation lines and trafficable road conditions) each
          single location as carefully screened against the above principle
          versus preparing for functional road and drainage network.
    vi.   The planning and final design solutions (see maps in Annex 1) have
          been done in close cooperation with environmental team who
          assessed the EIA documented separately as the EMP for CIUP.

Community involvement in minimization of resettlement
The community actively participated in efforts to minimise resettlement, in the
sub-ward meetings by the chairman residents raised numerous concerns that
were duly taken into account by the CIUP planners. The result of this
consultation was further reduction of potential project­induce impacts. For
example, each potentially affected plot has been scrutinized in joint survey
with Community representatives (Community Planning Teams) and PAPs for
possible solutions (e.g. option of accommodating the re-arrangement
/construction of new room or house). The technically expert gave applicable,
advice on how such re ­ arrangement could be carried out without affecting
the integrity and stability of the old structure. As a result, in most cases where
only single or annexed rooms, part of rooms, latrines, verandas, kiosk and
fences where considered to be demolished, solution that reduce the impact,
to a short period where possible. In fact, in most cases if the owners would
start building /rebuilding the affected structures by the time of receipt of
compensation payment no temporary resettlement, loss business or hardship
would be encountered. As outlined in the implementation schedule (section
9.1) there is a sufficient time between compensation payment and beginning
of the upgrading construction activities to allow for all newly re-
arrange/construct residential rooms or new business annexes (e.g. kiosks) to
be ready for occupation before demolition starts,. This would result only in
minor impacts on day-to-day life or income situation of the affected HH.

1.3Overall extents of unavoidable resettlement and partial impacts on
   properties
As a result of applying the principle of minimizing resettlement, the magnitude
of expected impacts and hardship will be limited to a relatively small number
of families. In total 1035 properties will be affected, of which (25 house fully
resettled permanently demolished), 1010 houses owners will have partial
demolition of their structures. For details, reference is made to Annex 1. (a
map showing the affected areas) In the majority of cases CIUP will result only
in partial demolition of properties, often a portion of a room or secondary
structures like steps, verandas and outside storerooms.


Overall, the CIUP interventions that will result in relocation caused by
unavoidable full demolition and removal of 25 properties, as follows:
       Kinondoni Municipality    1 property
       Ilala Municipality        24 properties;
As far s partial demolition is concerned, this will affect 1010 properties without
necessitating the resettlement of people in
       Kinondoni Municipality    275 properties
       Ilala Municipality        341 properties
       Temeke Municipality       394 properties
   More information on specific impacts are provided in section 5.1 and in
   Annex 5.3-4 and Details of the survey records on the household structure,

2.1Brief description of the CIUP

The Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program (CIUP) is part of the wider
Local Government Support Program (LGSP), intending to enhance the
delivery and management capabilities, productive efficiencies and financial
sustainability of local government in Tanzania. The CIUP is improving
community infrastructure in 31 selected areas in Dar es Salaam to appropriate
functional standards, affordable and responsive to community demand. CIUP
has been upgrading infrastructure and services for Roads and footpaths,
Drainage, Sanitation, Solid waste and Streetlights. Upgrading of infrastructure
and urban services has the implementation period of 7 years (2005-2012).
The first phase of implementation started in year 2005, covers 16 unplanned
areas, and benefits 167,000 people. For phase II, implementation started from
2009-2012. In each CIUP areas a community upgrading plan (CUP) has been
prepared in a participatory, and demand responsive way.

The basic demographic figures of the sub-wards that will participate in phase
2 of the CIUP are given in Table 1.1 `Phase 2 CIUP sub-wards'. The map
overleaf shows the location of both the phase I and phase II CIUP areas.

3.0Community participation and establishment of local communities

Community participation in the CIUP was designed to ensure that an iterative
process of consultation and feedback was undertaken from the beginning of
program preparation through to the post-construction period. The RAP has
paid special attention to community participation seen as most critical in
planning and decision making, in addressing environmental and resettlement
issues, and in devising responsibility for monitoring of outlined resettlement
actions.

3 .1 Selection of Community Representatives

The focus of the participation process has been on the sub-ward level, both
with respect to the entire community and the group of representatives
(Community Planning Team ­ CPT) established at the beginning of the project
preparation period to guide the planning process. Community participation is
regarded as crucial to the success of participatory planning, communication,
monitoring and supervision and settling possible disputes within the
community.
With respect to the preparation of RAPs, the role of CPT or elected
representatives is to;
   - -ensure the functioning of the public consultation process,
   - Assist Municipal Technical Support (TSTs) established to prepare and
      manage CIUP in arranging for community follow-up meetings;
   - Act as resource information persons for the surveyors of the PAPs and
      their affected properties;
   - discuss issues raised by affected persons and communicate them to the
      TSTs;
   - facilitate the assistance program (e.g. moving assistance, assistance to
      vulnerable group)
   - cooperate with NGOs and CBOs involved in development programs;
   - assist in initiating the process of grievance resolution;
   - Assist, as need, in the resettlement monitoring activities.

3.2 Mechanism of Community Consultation and Participation

The following steps were taken to establish strong linkage between
communities and municipalities for the purpose of community consultations
and communication with regard to the CIUP and RAP in the formation of
Technical Support Teams (TST) for each municipality, consisting of municipal
government staff and experts of the consultants' team preparation of maps
for each area is showing the foreseen investment structures and the individual
properties that will become affected.

                    Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program
     ___________________________________________________________________
-     Public meeting announced and organized in each CIUP area to elect
      community representatives for the CIUP preparation. The group of
      representatives would be named Community Planning Team (CPT)

-     Elections and actual formation of Community Planning Teams (CPT) for
      each CIUP area;

-     The CIUP areas subdivided in housing clusters (geographical zones)
      from where the residents would elect representatives. Previous
      experience revealed that it is practical to form clusters of about 30 to 40
      houses. This created a balanced geographical representation. It and
      ensured equity and eliminate favoritism to particular areas. It is also
      facilitate direct communication between residents and representatives,
      because the clusters are small enough to ensure that people know
      each other.

-     Housing clusters defined in accordance with geographical features
      and existing street patterns and not by using existing ten-cell units
      system, which is more politically oriented. Gender equity achieved by
      election of one male and one female from each housing cluster.

-     Subsequent housing cluster meetings it's easy to organize in order to
      obtain feedback. Such meetings instrumental in disseminating
      information and receiving ideas and views on ways to priorities
      community needs and to test willingness of the community to pay for
      urban services delivery.

-     It was further decided that the sub-ward chairman and the sub-ward
      secretary participate in the process by virtue of their administrative
      position. The various communities opt to invite specific stakeholder
      representatives to participate in the process, such as NGOs and CBOs,
      the business community or religious institutions.

Once agreement has been reached on how to select representatives from
the community, the sub-sequent steps for planning were as follows:

1.    Joint field visits (TST and CPT) for orientation, identification of priorities,
      identification of infrastructure deficiencies, proposed infrastructure
      interventions, identification of environmental issues and priorities and
      need for resettlement;
2.    Plotting of the proposed interventions on the relevant map of the
      community area in order to give the CPT an idea of the extent of the
      impact and potential problems, such as demolitions;
3.    Case by case discussion between engineers, TSTs and CPTs to find best
      solution to minimize structure demolition and resettlement and mitigate
      against negative environmental impacts;

     ___________________________________________________________________
4.    Guided by the technical experts (including environmental resettlement
      specialists) the CPTs, and TSTs assisted in costing analysis and
      finalization of the initial investment programs ;
5.    Formal approval of the investment programs by the sub-ward
      committee and the ward development committee.

With the expectation of step (iii) the entire planning include continual internal
consultation between representatives and residents of the respective housing
clusters to obtain feed back on proposed interventions, as well as addressing
complaints, priorities and preference of the PAPs. In some instances, when
crucial decisions had to be made the elected leaders (councillors, etc) were
mobilised to participate in the process and to resolve initial disputes with PAPs.
This facilitated not only the decision-making process but also demonstrated
commitment and a sense of ownership on behalf of the elected leaders.

The results of the planning process, including the respective detailed maps
(Annex 2), are incorporated in the Community Upgrading Plans (CUPs) that
have been prepared for each CIUP area.



4.0 On ­ site data collection ­inventory of the affected households

4.1 Household Survey and Questionnaires
First, the TST code-marked all houses and structures along the new
infrastructure upgrading access routes. The chairman assisted in identification
of the house owners who then were notified and a date for surveying the plot
was agreed. The owners of affected properties and their household members
were surveyed and (see household questionnaire Annex 5.3) to identify their
aspirations, priorities and concerns in connection with the anticipated partial
or full demolition of structures. More detailed about the discussed
resettlement and compensation options are presented below.

During the survey and questionnaire administration the PAPs were made
aware of the implications of impacts, their entitlements and registration
requirements in the line with notification times. In line with the RFP, the cut-off
date has been established and communicated to the PAPs by the date of
the inventory of all affected property in the community.

Resettlement options

During the household surveys all heads of the projects ­affected households
who face full or partial demolition of their home were asked to make
statements concerning their choice for future residence. The majority of the
interviewed PAPs indicated (in the questionnaires) their wish to `remain on
plot' or left to re-arrange on the same plot'. According to the field surveyors

     Resettlement Action Plan                                               9
                     Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program
      ___________________________________________________________________
the connotation is that these projects ­affected persons, most of them facing
only partial demolition of their house or part of a room would opt to re-
arrange/construct the room or house within the same plot boundaries when
space allows. The same holds true for business ­ such as those vending their
goods on the street from kiosks attached on the roadside of the house.

Compensation options:
There has been no choice offered to the PAPs with respect to cash or kind
compensation. The RAP follows the principle that all PAPs (owners) are treated
equally with full cash compensation for land and structures at undepreciated
market-price replacement costs. This compensation will be sufficient for the
purchase of new house or alternatively a plot on which to construct a new
home.

ILALA MUNICIPALTY-SUBWARD

(1)    Kombo
       By adapting the designs to the local conditions, improvement of roads
       and storm water drains will only affect 119 properties. The upgrading
       program in this sub-ward will result in the full demolition of 7 houses
       necessitating resettlement of the residents. The other, partially affected,
       property owners are willing and able to rebuild the demolished part of
       their house on the same plot.

(2)    Miembeni
       The upgrading program in this sub-ward will result in the full demolition
       of 14 houses necessitating resettlement of the residents. Other assets
       affected are several verandas that will be partially removed and
       amount to 91.

(3)    Mtakuja
       The only concern in this sub-ward is upgrading of some of the current
       footpaths into access roads, resulting in widening of the road reserve.
       The designs have been adapted in close consultation with the
       community to avoid demolition. However, two houses need to be
       pulled down completely which will require resettlement of the affected
       families. 101 other houses will be partially affected, involving the
       removal of fences, walls, gates and verandas. The upgrading program
       in this sub-ward will result in the full demolition of 3 houses necessitating
       resettlement of the residents These affected households have indicated
       to reconstruct the lost property within their plots.

KINONDONI MUNICIPALITY-SUBWARDS

(4)    Kwa Kopa
       In this sub-ward infrastructure upgrading necessitates full demolition of
       one (1) house while 81 other properties are to be partially demolished
       due to the fact that parts of the houses (rooms, verandas, shop kiosks)
       protrude into the road reserves. The affected house owners have been
       interviewed.

(5)    Kigogo Kati
       In this sub-ward resettlement actions are equally minimal as only one
       house owner is unavoidably affected by the road rehabilitation works
       and will be resettled. 48 other houses will be partially affected (mainly
       verandas). None of the latter affected households would require
       resettlement.

(6)     Kigogo Mbuyuni
        72 properties will be affected with partial demolition (verandas, side-
        rooms and kiosks), but this would not require relocation of people.

(7)     Kigogo Mkwajuni
        74 properties will be partially affected (removal of side-rooms,
        verandas, staircases). In some properties fruit trees need to be cut.

(8)     Keko Mwanga A
        The planned upgrading works will affect 60 properties. Not one house
        needs to be demolished completely. The landowners opt for
        reconstruction of the part of their property that has to be demolished
        within their current plot.

(9)     Keko Mwanga B
        Improvement including provision of the storm water drains is expected
        to partially affect 25 properties only. No house needs to be totally
        removed.

(10)    Magurumbasi A
        Infrastructure upgrading is only going to result in partial demolition. 99
        properties will be affected, including the removal of verandas, a few
        rooms and walls. Accordingly, there is no need for resettlement of
        Magurumbasi A residents.

(11)    Azimio Mtongani
        Infrastructure upgrading can be done without much demolition. 7 more
        properties will be partially affected, including the removal of one or two
        rooms, walls or verandas. Two mango trees will also be affected.

(12 Azimo Kaskazini
       27 other properties will be partially affected (removal of walls, rooms,

      Most of the existing road lack side drains and the construction of such
      structures will affect the workshops, kiosks, verandas and rooms
      currently extending into the existing roadway. Consequently, 47
      properties partially. The house owner concerned has opted to be
      resettled in one of the areas chosen for the purpose. All others have
      decided to reconstruct in their current plots.

        The CIUP interventions in this sub-ward will not necessitate full
        demolition. 54 houses will only be partially affected: 2 rooms need to be
        removed, while the rest of the affected structures consist of verandas
        and walls/fences.

5.0 Compensation for Lost Assets and Hardship due to Demolition and
Relocation

5.1Groups eligible for compensation

The groups eligible for specific compensation and assistance packages in the
community infrastructure upgrading program are:
      - Affected houses and business (owners and tenants) suffering any
        direct loss, whether permanent or temporary, complete or partial, of
        assets or investment, land and property or access to natural resource
        as a result of the sub-project activities.

        - Vulnerable households-having special needs than other households.
          This category includes households and business that for various
          reasons are unable to find replacement housing, pack their personal
          belongings or business inventory, move their belongings or stock and
          unpack them in the new location

Persons or agencies eligible for compensation for in advertent construction
damage will hold the contractor liable.

The CIUP does not impinge on the local community as no public and /or
social and cultural common facilities will be affected. No community building,
school, clinic or other public structure, nor any infrastructure such as
telephone [poles and lines electric poles and lines, water mains, sewer mains
and the like affected by this project. Compensation measures therefore do
not apply.

5.2Compensation Categories
Compensation for land, built-up structures, and business and relocation
actions will be based on the following categories of the impacts:
-     Replacement cost of property: mainly residential and business structures
      vegetation: property owners (houses and business)are entitled to
      replacement costs for land and structural (unmovable ) asset at
      market values

    ___________________________________________________________________
-     Compensation allowances for property owners: in cases where the
      impact on the property is (i) partial, i.e. will not require displacement
      and the affected property owner opts for re-arrange /construct new
      structures within the existent plot, provisions are made for compensation
      termed in Tanzania law as disturbance allowance. In cases where (ii)
      full relocation in unavoidable, additional accommodation and
      transport and transport allowances will be paid.(see section 4.1-3)

-     Assistance to vulnerable households: special assistance and allowance
      will be considered for this group, Vulnerable group are defined as a
      disabled or old people who leave alone and unable to find
      replacement housing, pack their belongings or business inventory. In
      case of CIUP areas there is no vulnerable person among the affected
      people.

-     Assistance for tenants: Tenants will receive assistance (see Also Annex 2
      number of tenants affected) ­ to the extent they are impacted ­ when
      the affected property is used by tenants for residential or business
      purpose. All tenants will be assisted with moving and locating new
      housing or business and provided compensation for the immediate
      cost. I.e. assistance to pack up, to move the goods, to re-establish
      themselves in the new places etc.). Tenants will also be assisted in
      lodging claims against house owners that do not pass on the transport
      allowance allocated by the project to them.

-     Shops and business: the owners of the affected business temporarily
      affected by construction are eligible for compensation in cash for the
      temporally loss of profit resulting from the period of the move. As
      applicable, wages of salaried employees will be paid for the time the
      business is closed. (See annex 2 detailed of the business affected.

-     Graves: where the infrastructure upgrading requires the removal of a
      grave (including tombstone0 the relatives of the respective dead will
      be given the right to remove the remains of their dead relatives and
      bury them in a cemetery close to the actual location. The municipality
      is responsible to allocate such replacement plot. Standard Municipal
      rates apply to compensate for costs for relocation, including possible
      exhumation rites.

5.3Compensation Package
This RAP follows the terminology of allowances as used in the Tanzanian
Regulations Land Act 4of 1999. (Government Notice of 4/4/2001 the land
assessment of the value of land compensation.) The compensation rates
detailed below are mostly referring to table no. 5.1 which is list the standard
compensation rates applied during the valuation process for replacement of
affected structures, utilities, horticulture, trees, graves etc. (Replacement

      value is defined as cost putting up an equivalent structures as the one existing
      at the time of valuation and making allowance for age, state repair and
      economic obsolescence in the place. Detailed on the case-wise application
      of the rates for each affected property are given in table no. 3.

      The rates are similar for all sub-wards within the Municipality. The actual value
      compensated has been the one determined during the final agreement
      between the valuer and the property owner.

    5.3.1 Property Valuation

    For land (including non-agricultural vegetation)
    This type of compensation applies to all affected households, regardless of
    whether there is need for resettlement of the PAP opts to re-arrange their
    structure on the remaining plot.

    In accordance with 3 of the 2001 Regulation of Land Act 4 of 1999, the basis
    for assessment of the value of land affected by the project is the market value
    of the respective land measurements were in m2.

    The valuers specified the market value (including unexhausted improvement)
    by using the standard rates provided by the municipality for land valuation.
    (See table no 3)

    For Non Movable Built ­Up Structure
    The valuer determined the compensation for all private buildings and
    structures affected by the project. Case-by-case agreements during the
    valuation were in relationship to the material and quality of the structure.
    These valuations use annually updated standard compensation lists of the
    respective municipality. The same lists specify the compensation payment to
    the head of family whose grave will be affected by the project.

    5.3.2 Allowances in Cash and Kind

        Accommodation Allowance:
        The accommodation allowance applies to all structures or portions of
        structures that are to be demolished, regardless of whether resettlement is
        required or not. The Tanzanian Law provides for an allowance which
        compensate s the property owners for the costs incurred in the period
        when construction of new structures is underway. In Tanzanian legislative
        terminology this defined as accommodation allowance, in accordance
        with §8 of the 2001 Regulation of Land Act 4 of 1999, accommodation
        allowances are calculated on the basis of monthly markets rents multiplied
        by 36 (months).

                   Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program
    ___________________________________________________________________
   Disturbance Allowance:
   The Tanzania Law makes additional provision for all allowance which
   compensates project ­affected persons for impacts they experience
   during the process of demolition and, as applicable, of relocation. This
   type of compensation is meant to give support to the family to alleviate
   any social problems or physical hardship that they might experience. In
   Tanzania legislative terminology the compensation for the experienced
   suffering id defined as disturbance allowance. In accordance with section
   20 of the 2001 Regulation of Land Act 4 of 1999 the disturbance
   allowance is calculated by multiplying the actual value of the land by the
   average percentage of interest offered by commercial banks on fixed
   deposits for 12 months. The Tanzanian legislation only considers property
   owners eligible for this type of compensation. However the Government of
   Tanzania has agreed to pay the affected tenants disturbance allowance.
   Since no fixed figure has been set, tenants in CIUP project should get 50%
   of the already calculated mount; the remaining being given to the
   respective property owner. The tenants affected in ach will share the 50%
   equally.


   Transport Moving Allowance:

Transport Allowance (for House Owners)
In accordance with § 11 the 2001 Regulations of Land Act of 1999 a transport
allowance ids paid to all project ­effected persons whether partially or full
affected. The payment is intended to meet transport cost incurred by
property owners. It is specifically noted that the valuers applied this
compensation to all properties, i.e. also to vast majority of those who will not
be resettled. The legal provision determines that the transport costs are
compensated at fixed rates equivalent to the actual costs for transporting
12,000 kg of luggage by road for a distance of 20 km all three municipal
authorities established the applicable rate at the time of evaluation being
TSh. 80,000 per household. The rate will also apply to the tenants affected.

Moving Assistance (for Tenants):
In order too ensure fair compensation of tenants (residences and business),
the RAP will provide a supplementary payment ­moving assistance to tenants
(including business) in (i) all priorities facing complete demolition and
necessitating full resettlement; and (ii) partially demolished structures in which
tenants will be relocated elsewhere within the plot. Verification of all tenants'
households is proposed to ascertain the assistance package to all persons
affected by project. Tenants in partially affected properties need only shift
their belongings to the new structure within the plot. Tenants (household or
business) will receive;

-     Timely notification (3 months) (Rent Restriction Act of 1984) terminating
      the rental agreement as per Tanzania regulations.
-     Assistance to obtain any refund of advance rent payments
-     In accordance with their rental agreements
-     Assistance in finding a new rental until will be provided to any tenants
      in properties that will be fully demolished;
-     Assistance in moving form current to new room on the respective plot
      will be provided to tenants on properties that will only be partially
      affected. The new room will be built and the tenants moved before the
      old one is demolished.
-     Assistance in packing personal belongings or business inventory,
      transporting the same to new location, unpacking and re-arranging.

The respective PAPs have been informed by the survey team about the
assistance offered by the project during verification period. The person's
eligible and requesting this assistance will be registered at the Ward Executive
Office (WEO). Disputes and claims will be settled by the grievance addressing
arrangements.

The WEO will help to forward justified claims to the grievance settlement
offices for resolving problems such as obtaining back pre-paid rental fees.

The WEO will determine the cut-off day for effecting the payment and
assistances.

e) Vulnerability Allowance
Although there no provisions in the Tanzania legislation for dealing with
vulnerable group, PAP s who require special assistance (e.g. elderly,
handicapped), in the line with the CIUP policy that no. PAPS suffer undue
hardship because of project investments, will be provided.
Full assistance to find and received a new residential plot
Construction funds for a new residence that shall be in better condition than
       the one previously inhabited, approved the municipal authority

The vulnerability allowance is calculated at 5% of the total value of the
affected property to be calculated as lump sum allowance for a household
that falls under the said category. The allowance is paid to the head of
household.

Loss of Profit
In according to § 9 of the 2001 Regulations of Land Act 4 of 1999 the net
monthly profit obtained from the business associated with the affected
properties is assessed (for high incomes, evidenced by audited accounts
where necessary and applicable, for low income approved by the authorities
trade business list), and multiplied by 36 months in order to arrive at loss of

     ___________________________________________________________________
profit payable. This calculation applies also for such businesses that are only
temporarily affected during the project's construction phase.

This compensation payment will be made to all business regardless of the
status (owner or tenant) of the user: as long as the respective business is
affected by the project, the loss of profit shall be exclusively and directly paid
to the person who loses his/her business premises.

Compensation for Inadvertent Construction Damage
Persons or agencies who suffer damage from inadvertent construction
incident s are to be compensated by the respective constructor at market­
value plus replacement costs for the damage incurred. The CPT will assist in
bringing claims forward to the municipality and/or the grievance resolution
offices, as applicable.

As precaution measure, the technical specifications in the contracts for the
contractors for the upgrading investments contain clauses that deal with
inadvertent damage. The clauses are detailed in the CEMP for CIUP.

6.0 Asset Valuation Process
6.1 Procedure
The valuation of affected assets eligible for compensation, as well as the
identification and agreement on compensation allowances has been
embedded in the following procedure scheme:


(1)    All potential resettlement issues have been analyzed based on first
       hand information i.e. from survey of the affected households. This survey
       allows identification of the magnitude and impact of resettlement. The
       survey and the answers retrieved form the questionnaires (Annex 5.3)
       substantially determined the planning for resettlement actions. The
       individual household questionnaire responses are also an important
       source of information in setting possible disputes at later stage.
(2)    The land survey team then made demarcations in line with the
       technical designs, and the structural assets subject to demolition were
       marked with code references along with the registered names of the
       property owner.
(3)    The ward executive officer contacted and notified (using Land Form
       No. 69, `noticed to Land Occupier to apply Compensation) in early
       May 2004 each individual land owner / occupier to agree upon a date
       for valuation and filled in Land Form No. 70 `Application for
       Compensation by Land Occupier).

                      Community Infrastructure Upgrading Program
       ___________________________________________________________________
(4)     On the agreed date the appointed municipal valuers, accompanied
        by the municipal coordinator and members of planning team, valued
        the property by discussing each single item eligible for compensation,
        as well as calculating, in presence of the owner, the respective
        compensation values. The negotiations include the agreement of
        temporally loss of benefit for cases where business will become
        affected. During the valuation procedure the owner of the affected
        properties were full informed about the use of established
        (standardized) criteria for compensation of lost asset as well for the
        allowable compensation packages. The valuers took care that the
        procedure was explained manner comprehensible to the owner being
        affected.
(5)     After the negotiation agreement with the affected owner the municipal
        valuer drew up a contract that lists all property and land being
        surrendered and the type of compensation to be given. In kind
        compensation was also recorded in and order form, which were signed
        by the respective parties and witnessed. The compensation contract
        was read aloud in the presence of the affected party prior to signing.
(6)     The items eligible for compensation were documented in the owners'
        presence. Photographs were made of the signing party and of all major
        assets subject to compensation, and they are kept in Chief Valures files.
        Compensation will be included.
(7)     The owners were informed about their rights and the devised
        mechanisms to forward complaints, and notified that they must allow
        access to their property to the ward executive officer and the land
        officer of the respective municipalities for cross-checking their claims.
(8)     In addition, PAPs were informed that any of their complaints and claims
        prior to payment will be forwarded to the Municipal Director who is
        obliged to investigate the case. All claims need to be resolved before
        compensation payments are affected. Any complaints advance after
        a fixed date (within days of receipt of the final claim would be
        entertained).
(9)     In accordance with the laid down procedures and notified schedules
        (still to be determined by the MD), the local authority will pay the
        cheques to the entitled heads of households.
(10)    Thereafter, at a fixed and notified schedule, owners have the right to
        remove all assets and structures. Should the owner fail to comply with
        this action, the contractor will be given in writing the permit to
        unconditionally demolish and remove all structures as and when work
        progress would require.

Note 1: The cut-off dates for eligibility for compensation under CIUP was not
the asset inventory and valuation but the date of signing the agreement
between valuer and the head of the PAPs.

      ___________________________________________________________________
6.2 Documentation, Contract Agreement and Dossier
Written record sand photograph documentation of holdings and asset is
important to settle claims and to avoid later claims or fraudulence. Therefore,
along with the signing the agreements forms, people and asset (infrastructure)
were photographed for documentation. The detailed records of the valuation
are kept in the Chief Valuer office in each municipality as dossier file.

During the valuation process (June-December) all house owners worked with
valuers and municipal CIUP Coordinators and CPTs to establish final
compensation value of asset affected by the project. After discussion and
agreement for the total compensation value the municipal valuer drew
contract listing all property and land being surrendered and the type of
compensation to be given. In kind compensation is also recorded in an order
form, which was signed by respective parties and witnessed. The
compensation contract was read aloud in the presence of the affected party
prior to signing.

For each valuation record a dossier will be prepared and entered into a
municipal database which will have restricted access. The dossier will be
prepared jointly by the municipal CIUP coordinators and the respective CIUP
Resettlement Monitoring Officer (see section 6.1) each municipality office will
maintain such database. The dossier will be entered in query database that
will contain information on;

       Site location with property and valuation codes of effected property;
       Particulars of household members (both owners and tenants, as
       applicable

7. Proposed Grievance Redress Mechanisms


At the time that the individual resettlement and compensation plans are
approved and individual compensation contracts are signed, affected
individuals were already been informed of the process for expressing
dissatisfaction and seek to redress.

Claims and complaints shall be brought to the attention of the sub-ward
chairman who will forward all grievances concerning non-fulfilment of
contracts, level of compensation or seizure of assets without compensation to
the attention of the municipal director. If no agreement can be reached, the
cases will be taken to the local court system. The basis for judging the claim
will be the documentation provided in the municipality's individual dossier for
this RAP.

The grievance procedure will be simple, administered as far as possible at the
local level to facilitate access, be flexible and open to any proofs. Care will
be taken to recognize the fact that most people are illiterate and poor. It is
advocated that all attempts would be made to settle grievances. Those
seeking redress and wishing to state grievances would do so by notifying the
municipal director. The latter will consult with the councilors, the ward/ mtaa
and elders to determine the justification of the claims. If valid, the municipal
director will notify the complainant to settle the matter. If the complainant's
claim is rejected, then the matter can be brought before the local courts for
settlement. If the local courts cannot settle the matter, it can go to the high
court of Tanzania for resolution. The high court will be the highest appellate
"judge" in this system. The decision of the high court would be final and all
such decisions must be reached within a full growing season after the
complaint is lodged.

If a complaint pattern emerges, the municipal director with the TST and CPT
will discuss possible remediation. The director will be required to give advice
concerning the need for revisions to the procedures. Once the municipality
and the community agree on necessary and appropriate changes a written
description of the changed process will be made. The ward executive officer
and sub-ward chairman will be responsible for communicating any changes
to the local community.


8.0 Institutional Arrangements for the RAP

8.1nstitutional Actors
The overall responsibility for the resettlement lies in the hands of the local
authorities under local government administrative and financial management
rules and manuals. In specific, the head, of the planning and coordination

    ___________________________________________________________________
department in each municipality will be the main responsible official to
oversee and coordinate the RAP. Funding will be processed and affected
through the Ministry of Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG)
through the decentralized local government and will comply with the
financial arrangement agreed upon at project appraisal. The finance
administrative committee of the MC maintains the overall budget
responsibility for the resettlement costs and for compensation and claim
payments effected by the municipality's finance department. This committee
also oversees the collection of the resident's contribution for the CIUP.

Compensation and resettlement activities envisage for the CIUP involve
several institutions actors, including the community, individuals, local
authorities and NGOs/CBOs, such as:

The Consultant (SNC-Lavalin) in association with MMK prepared the technical
design for survey is responsible of elaborating the RAP in close consultation
with all institutional actors described in this section. The consultant prepares
the survey of affected households, the community participation process, the
cost estimates and the implementation schedules for all activities described in
the RAP.

Technical Support Team (TST): Responsible for the local surveys to design the
urban infrastructure upgrading, maintains close linkage with the municipal
planning and coordination department through the CIUP coordinator.

CIUP Coordinators: He/she ensures the functioning of the community
consultation and participation process, and timely launching of the project in
community meetings other tasks include the overseeing of the selection of the
community representatives and the establishment of the CPTs who will be,
among other, engaged in moving assistance to PAPs. He/she also
coordinates the set-up of a grievance resolution mechanism at the ward
executive office, the resettlement monitoring and maintenance of the PAP
record database.

The Valuation Section of the Municipal Planning and Coordination Department
provides annual lists for compensation standards. It determines the
notification and registration of PAPs as well as cut-of date for compensation
carries out the property valuation (through officers from the valuation
section), while the Land Officer is responsible for signing the transfer contracts
for land-take.

The Ward Executive Office receives and makes all efforts to resolve
community and PAP issues and complaints, forwards them to the MC in case
no consensus can be reached in the grievance resolution mechanisms at
ward level.

    ___________________________________________________________________
Implementation Schedule

The resettlement action plan and compensation plan has been approved by
the municipal governments.

Timing of all resettlement activities, including land acquisition and demolition
of houses etc. is linked with the schedule stars and [progress of the
construction works. Acquisition of land and asset may be affected only after
compensation has been paid and, where applicable, resettlement sites and
relocation allowance have been provided to displaced persons.

The implication is that before any construction activity is implemented, the
PAPs entitled to compensation will need to notified and compensated in due
to time in accordance with the RAP, all measure required to assist household
with relocation must be completed prior to displacement. The same holds
true for timely compensation for all business that are required to shift
temporarily. The timing mechanism of these measures as outline in section 2
the implementation schedule is attached Annex: 3

10.0 Monitoring the Proposed Resettlement Actions
The monitoring of the RAP is also the responsibility of the Head of the Planning
and Coordination Department in each municipality.

10.1 Application of Verifiable Indicators
As stipulated by the resettlement policy framework, a set of simple verifiable
indicators was adopted to monitor and evaluate the implementation of
resettlement and compensation plans as given in table below.

10.2 Determination of the Monitors and Implementation of Monitoring
     schemes

Consistent with the environmental effectiveness monitoring procedures laid
out in the CEMP, the resettlement monitoring would be carried out by
analyzing household surveys in all resettled families that were registered
during the process of notification and valuation. A query database will be
maintained (see section 6.4) which contain all individual dossiers to keep
track of the affected persons. This will ensure that also those families will
continually be monitored who become resettled in other areas.

The survey will be primarily assessing the actual socio-economic situation
through a structured household interview and questionnaire. The above ­
described indicators will serve as analytic tools.

The cost estimates for compensation of the affected houses and private
structures are based on a complete inventory and subsequent valuation
assessment for all properties that were either fully affected (25 of 1,035 =3%) or
only partially 1010 of 1,035=97%).

The compensation allowances are in line with the packages described in
section 6 of this RAP. The presented figures reflect the actual agreement
between the valuers and the affected person (usually the land owner).

An additional 5% for other cost has been added, calculated from both the
compensation payment and the allowances, to make adequate provision for
other costs related to settlement considered in this RAP, namely moving
assistance and assistance to vulnerable groups. This budget items includes
also the operational costs for a grievance redress office.
