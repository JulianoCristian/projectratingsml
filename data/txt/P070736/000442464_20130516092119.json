Government Support\n            Project (LGSP) for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: key operational lessons from LGSP\n            were incorporated into the design of the new Program for\n            results (PforR) urban local government strengthening\n            program. These include: (i.) distinguishing between urban\n            and rural local governments due to the different financial\n            and capacity needs, (ii.) using independent assessors to\n            increase transparency, (iii.) providing a financial\n            incentive for central government to disburse funds on time,\n            and (iv.) adopting the same collaborative and comprehensive\n            preparation practices. The project adopted a low-risk\n            approach for upgrading with minimal trunk infrastructure and\n            resettlement. The impact evaluation shows improved access to\n            services, health and education benefits. Future initiatives\n            have room to be more ambitious and to try to improve\n            coverage and connectivity to trunk infrastructure. Thinking\n            beyond infrastructure and looking at human development\n            factors is the key to successful upgrading. Counterpart\n            contributions were required at all levels for all\n            components- the rationale at project design was to\n            demonstrate demand and commitment. However, it is not clear\n            that counterpart contributions increased ownership. As the\n            counterpart contributions (5 percent of capital costs)\n            required from poor communities had no direct link with\n            Operations and Maintenance (O and M) requirements for the\n            investments, this raises questions regarding appropriateness\n            of arrangements for the collection and use of funds."}, "docdt": "2013-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
