                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since 2004/05, the Local Government Support Project (LGSP) in partnership with other Development Partner inputs, has enabled the Government of Tanzania to establish a
                         transparent formula-based system of inter-governmental transfers to all local governments in support of the Devolution by Decentralization (D by D) Policy. As part of fiscal
                         decentralization, local government authorities (LGAs) are allocated grants through a transparent and equitable formula-based system. The Local Government Development Grant
                         (LGDG) system provides council development grants (CDG, previously known as Capital Development Grants) and capacity building grants (CBG) on a formula basis, but only where
                         LGAs have met performance criteria. IDA contributions towards such grants ended with the last transfer in September 2010.

                         LGSP also supports the Dar es Salaam Local Authorities (DLAs) in implementing the Community Infrastructure Improvement Program (CIUP) and a Revenue Enhancement Program
                         (REP). The first phase of CIUP has been mostly completed and work on the second phase began in mid 2010. When completed in late 2011, both phases of CIUP will result in
                         upgrading of almost 20 percent of Dar es Salaam's unplanned settlements (estimated that 70 percent of Dar es Salaam's population lives in such unplanned settlements. Under the
                         REP initiative, the project is facilitating the valuation of all taxable properties across the three DLAs. When completed in mid 2011, this will pave the way for subsequent substantial
                         revenue enhancement for the DLAs.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project Support Team for Dar es Salaam (PST-Dar) has to maintain strict contract management over CIUP2 construction activities as well as the consulting contracts for
                         valuation of all taxable properties. This is critical because the project will close at the end of June 2012 and construction activities have to be completed by/before 31 December 2011.
