Resettlement and compensation will be executed as\n            sustainable development programs, providing investment\n            resources to give displaced persons the opportunity to share\n            project benefits. Community compensation will be in-kind\n            only, in the form of reconstruction of facilities, such as\n            school building (public or religious), public toilets, well\n            or pump, market place, road, and/or storage warehouse.\n            Compensation for loss of land will be at replacement costs\n            for equal productive value, or in cash estimated at market\n            values in the local currency adjusted to inflation; however,\n            in-kind compensation may also include items such as land,\n            houses, building materials, seedlings, agricultural inputs,\n            and financial credits for equipment. Crop losses will be\n            compensated based on: cash crops, determined at the average\n            value over the previous year, corrected for inflation;\n            subsistence crops will be determined at the highest value\n            over the previous year, corrected for inflation. The value\n            of stable crops will be determined at the highest market\n            price reached during the year. Given the significance of\n            horticultural, floricultural and fruit trees - particularly\n            mangoes and coconut - to the local subsistence economy,\n            compensation will be on a combined replacement/market value\n            form. Other domestic cash crops, and fruit trees, considered\n            \"wild\" trees, will be compensated under the\n            umbrella of the village, or community compensation.
