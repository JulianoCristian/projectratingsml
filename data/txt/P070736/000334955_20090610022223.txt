IntroductoryStatement

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval ofthe Boardto introduce the following changesinto
the Tanzania Local Government Support Project (LGSP), Credit 4003 and 4003-01, Project IDS
PO70736and P099738, and accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents, in
responseto the Government's request dated April 2,2009.

2.      The restructuring involves the reallocation of significant cost savings inComponent 1and a
large part o f the unallocated funds to finance: (a) cost increases o f US$4.1 million inPhase 1of the
Community Infrastructure Upgrading Project (CIUP) supported under Component 2; (b) an
allocation o f US$20.8 million for Phase 2 of CIUP; and (c) an allocation o f US$7.5 million for
preparation activities for the Tanzania Strategic Cities Project (TSCP). The proposed changes also
include refinements to the results framework, removal o f the household sanitation activities, and a
one-year extension inthe project's closing date. Since the proposed changes involve modifications
to the project development objectives and associatedoutcome targets, we are requesting the Board's
approval. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for the Original Credit 4003 dated January
19,2005 and the Financing Agreement (FA) for the Additional Financing Credit 4003-01 dated
August 30,2006 will be amended accordingly to reflect these changes.

BackgroundandReasonsfor Restructuring

3.      Projectbackground.The original LGSP credit was approved onNovember 30,2004 inan
amount o f US$52.0 million. This amount reflected a reduction o fthe Bank's originally intended
support, due to IDA funding limitations. The original credit was declared effective on April 13,
2005. The additional financing credit, approved on 15 June 2006 inan amount of US$98.0 million,
restored the original funding. The additional credit became effective on August 30,2006. When the
additional financing credit was approved, the closing date o f the project was extendedfrom June 30,
2008 to June 30,201 1.

4.      The current project development objective (PDO) is to: (a) strengthen fiscal
decentralization, and improve accountability inthe use o f local government resources and inthe
management o f intergovernmental transfer systems; and (b) increase access to infrastructure and
services inthe unplanned areas o f Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable
operations and maintenance. The LGSP includes two fundamentally different components: (1)
supporting the establishment o f a new intergovernmental transfer systemfor all local government
authorities (LGAs); and (2) supporting community infrastructure upgrading inDar es Salaam.

5.     Implementationprogress. The most recent Implementation Status and Results Report
(ISR) rates LGSP moderately satisfactory for boththe project development objective and
implementation progress.

6.      Significant improvements have already beenmade with regard to accountability inthe use of
local government resources, and inthe management o f the intergovernmental transfer system,
including the Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) System, which this project
supports. The Letter of Sector Policy described Government's "vision ... o f a unifiedtransfer
system, which brings together programs and grants, recurrent and development funding, donor and



                                                     2

government finding into one process." This was an ambitious vision, however clear progress i s
beingmade as regards the capital development transfer system, with sectoral grants progressively
being incorporated into the LGCDG System. Local government accountability ingeneral, and
accounting for the utilization o f LGCDG grants specifically, i s steadily improving, and there are
promising plans to address the remaining gaps.

7.      With regard to increasing access to infrastructure and services inunplanned areas ofDar es
Salaam, the physicalworks financed by the project provide real improvements ininfrastructure.
Revenueperformance ofthe Dar es Salaam Local Authorities (DLAs)and expenditures on
operations and maintenance have significantly improved over the life o f the project, but the
sustainability and trajectory o f these improvements has become uncertain due to the adoption of the
"Financial Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, 2008". Sustainable strategies for operations and
maintenance remainto be developed.

8.      Component 1: Support for LGCDG System. Component 1supports the LGCDG System
throughthe provision of capital and capacity building grants for LGAs.Implementationof this
component has proceeded well and i s substantially incorripliance with the legal agreements. The
most recent ISRrates implementationprogress for this component as moderately satisfactory.
Achievements include an overwhelming number o f LGAs meeting the Minimum Conditions for
accessingthe LGCDG (127 o f 132 LGAs for FY 08/09). This has been accompanied by significant
improvements inthe performance o f LGAs according to the Controller and Auditor General (CAG)
reports. There remains room for improvement interms o f the timeliness o f quarterly distributions to
LGAs.

9.      Component 2: Dar es Salaam Upgrading and Institutional Strengthening.Component 2
supports the upgrading of infrastructure inunplanned settlements o f Dar es Salaam (Component 2a)
and improvements to revenue collection and operations and maintenance (Component 2b). Inthe
case of Component 2a, most of the construction works under Phase 1have been completed and
designs for Phase 2 works are well underway. Inthe case o f Component 2b, planned revenue
enhancement activities were delayed following the adoption o f the "Financial Laws (Miscellaneous
Amendments)Act, 2008", which transfers responsibilityfor collection for property taxes from the
LGAsto the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). Theplannedvaluation activities are now
proceeding, following an agreement on a collaborative work plan betweenthe T U , LGAs and
PMO-RALG. Overall implementationprogress for Component 2 remains moderately satisfactory.
Implementationi s substantially incompliance with the legal agreements.

10.     Component 3: Support to PO-RALG (now PMO-RALG): This component supports PMO-
RALGinthe management ofthe LGCDG System. While funding was initially providedfor a
Project Support Team (PST), PMO-RALG was able to mainstream implementationo f the project
beginning July 1,2007. Implementationprogress remains moderately satisfactory and substantially
incompliance withthe legal agreements.

11.      Rationale for restructuring. Some minor problems and significant opportunities created
the needfor restructuring:

    a.      Changes infinancing requirements.Component 1o f LGSP was originally designedto
    pilot the LGCDG Systemin41 LGAs, but bilateral donors quickly committed to provide
    parallel support to the LGCDG System, which allowed it to be launched nationwide, with 41
    LGAs supported by the World Bank andthe remainder by bilateral donors. When additional
    IDA financing was provided in2006, the World Bankandbilateral funds were made fungible,
    andnow funda single national LGCDG System. Dueto continued strong donor financing over
    the intervening years, the projected IDAfinancing under Component 1is lower than that
    envisaged and substantial cost savings have accrued inthe project inthe order of US$23.4
    million (15.3 percent o f the total credit amount). The combined support for the LGCDG System
    bythe bilateraldonors, IDA and the Government of Tanzania (as summarized inTable 1below)
    i s adequate (even with planned increases inthe grant size) to cover the intendedperiod.

   Table 1: Fundingo f the LGCDG System by DPs, IDA and Government o f Tanzania (inUS$)




 2009/20 10         Projected       52,257,168       27,446,148         6,666,667       86,369,983
 Total             Projected        92,130,132       47,100,638        12,500,000     151,730,771

    b.      Cost increases since the original LGSP estimates were made in2004. The most
    significant cost increase i s US$4.1 million (2.7 percent of the total credit amount) to cover cost
    increases for CIUP Phase 1. The original cost estimates were prepared in2003 and were
    followed by aperiod o f well documented inflation of construction costs. The proposed
   reallocation i s summarized inTable 3 and detailed inAnnex 1.

    c.      Phase 2 of CIUP. Phase 1(covering 16 communities) was financed by the original
    credit, and when additional financing was agreed in2006, Phase 1hadnot yet progressed
    sufficiently to warrant a commitment to Phase 2 (covering a further 15 communities). However
    it was understoodthat financing ofPhase2 would be considered ifandwhenthere was adequate
   progress on Phase 1. Phase 1i s now substantially complete and Government has requested a
   reallocation of US$20.8 million (13.6 percent o f the total credit amount) to fund Phase 2. Phase
    2 will cover identical activities and will increasethe project's coverage from 10 to 20 percent of
   the unplannedareas of the city.




                                                    4

    d.      Preparation activities for the proposed TSCP. As part the overall urbanportfolio in
    Tanzania, and with a view to strengthening urban local governments, Government i s now
    preparing aproposed Tanzania Strategic Cities Project (TSCP). Recognizing that the immediate
    investment needs o f urban LGAs are so large and diverse that they cannot be accommodated
    withinthe existingLGCDGformula, the TSCP would providea mechanism for financing
    demand-driven infrastructure investmentsinlarge urbanLGAs.TSCP would build on the
    earlier, highly successful approach o f the Urban Sector RehabilitationProject (USRP). The
    US$7.5 million for TSCP preparation (which would constitute approximately 5 percent of the
    total credit amount) i s largely for consultancies for the identification, detailed design, bidding
    documents and safeguardswork on the civil works, so that construction work can start as soon
    as the project becomes effective. Government has requestedthat preparation activities be
    financed under LGSP. A Project Preparation Advance (PPA) was not desired by Government in
    view o f the availability o f cost savings and unallocated amounts inLGSP, and becauseof the
    size of the preparation costs. TSCP preparation activities are an extension o f support to PMO-
    RALGunder Component 3 (Part C) ofthe LGSP. For clarity, we will refinethe PDO and
    project description (by adding a Part D)to take account o f these additional activities (see
    "Proposed Changes" below).

    e.      Household sanitation activities. When the project was originally conceived, a small
    subcomponent was intendedto finance household sanitation activities (inthe order of
    US$300,000-600,000). "The reductioninthe number o f plots without sanitation facilities" was
    includedas an indicator for this activity. When Government did its baseline survey, it
    discovered that all plots already had basic sanitation facilities. For this reason, and because
    Government policy has changed to prohibit subsidies for private sanitation facilities, it was
    agreed with Government at the project's MidTerm Review to drop these activities since
    material improvements couldn't be made at a reasonable scale with the available funds.

    f.      Ad-iustmentsto the results framework. At the time that the project went to Board, the
    Project Appraisal Document (PAD) template did not call for intermediate outcome indicators or
    targets. Whenthe additional financing was approved, the outcome indicators and targets were
    not revised althoughthe duration and scope of the IDA financing were increased. Inthe context
    of this restructuring we will take these changes into account as summarized under "Proposed
    Changes" below.

Proposed Changes

12.     Changes to the project development objectives. Since the financing o f preparation
activities for the proposed TSCP i s a new activity, this will be reflectedexplicitly by modifying the
PDO as follows: "(a) strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve accountability inthe use of local
government resources, and improve management of intergovernmental transfers and demand-driven
urbaninvestments; and (b) increase access to infrastructure and services inthe unplanned areas of
Dar es Salaam and improve revenue performance for sustainable operations and maintenance."

13.     Changes to the project description. A new Part D will be added to the project description
as follows: "Part D: Preparation activities for the proposed Tanzania Strategic Cities Project
JTSCP)."



                                                     5

 14.       Extension of the project closing date. Government has requested that the closing date of
the project be extendedby one year, to June 30,2012. The proposed extension would be essentialto
complete the long-planned secondphase o f CIUP, which will double the project's coverage of the
unplannedareas of Dar es Salaam. Itwould also enable the DLAsto make meaningfulprogress on
revenueenhancement activities.

 15.       Changes to the project's outcomes and associated indicators and targets. To reflect the
adjustments to the results framework and the eliminationo f the household sanitation activities, the
following changes (summarized inTable 2 below) will be made to the project's indicators and
targets as stated inSchedule 5 o f the DCA.

* As
  Originally, 30 o f 41 local governments, i.e. 73 percent o fParticipating LGAs receive LGCDGby FY2007/08.
      explained inthe footnote above, the original target was 73 percent o f Participating LGAs receive LGCDGby
FY2007108. Since the proposed restructuring does not add or alter any of the agreed activities for Component 1, the
target for this indicator was not substantially revised, only roundedup from 73 to 80 percent. The target now applies to
all 132 LGAs covered by the project. By the end o f this fiscal year, the project will have disbursed four out o f five years
o f IDA funding for the LGCDG system, which has already had measurable impacts on local government performance.
3 To access the LGCDG, LGAs are requiredto meet a set ofminimumconditions to ensure funds are properly usedand
incompliancewith statutory andadministrative requirements. These include: (i) submission offinal accounts;
                                                                                    timely
(ii) functional internal audit arrangements; (iii) adverse audit report or confirmed financial management
                                                  no
irregularities; (iv) co-funding obligations met; (v) timely approval o f development plans and budgets; (vi) functional
tender board; and (vii) regular councilmeetings.
  FY2009/10 is the last year o f LGCDG fmancing.

16.     Outputs.Additional outputs will result from the restructuring. CIUP Phase2 will extendthe
coverage of upgrading activities to an additional 15 communities, which will increase the project's
coverage from 10to 20 percent o f the unplanned areas o f Dar es Salaam. The outputs of the
preparation activities for TSCP will include detailed designs for infrastructure investments inLGAs,
together with bidding documents, environmental management plans and resettlement action plans.

17.     Reallocation among categories of expenditure. The restructuringinvolves the reallocation
among categories o f expenditure. A summary of the reallocation amounts by Component i s
included inTable 3 below. Detailedamounts for each credit are included inAnnex 1. The major
changes will: (a) shift cost savings amounting to 15.3 percent o f the total credit amount to the
remaining categories o f expenditure; and (b) shift part of the unallocated portion, which currently
comprises 10percent o f the total credit amount to the remaining categories o f expenditure, leaving
US$4.7 million or three percent o f the total credit for contingency costs. With the exception of the
financing of TSCP preparation (dealt with above), the reallocation does not alter the range of
activities originally envisioned under LGSP.

  Analysis

  20.     Project appraisal. The proposed changes would not alter the original economic, financial,
  technical, institutional or social aspects o f the project as appraised.

  21.     Environmental and social safeguards.LGSP is classified as a category B project. An
  Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework
  (RPF)were developed at appraisal and are currently inuse, and anEnvironmental Management
  Plan (EMP) and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were prepared and implementedfor Phase 1 o f
  CIUP. The additional activities proposed inthis restructuring would not alter the category of the
  project or trigger new safeguard policies since: (a) preparation activities for the proposed TSCP are
  limitedto designwork for future infrastructure investments; and (b) Phase 2 of CIUP does not
  constitute a new class o f activities. The ESMF, RPF and safeguards arrangements are found
  sufficiently detailed to manage and mitigate any negative impacts associated with the expansion of
  activities. However, the original safeguards documents will be updated to reflect the additional
  project activities and a separate EMP and RAP will be prepared for Phase 2 o f CIUP. All public
  disclosures will be inaccordance with Bank policy.

22.     Exceptionsto Bankpolicies.The proposed one-year extension ofthe project closing date
exceeds the three-year limit under the Bank`sOperational Policy governing Additional Financing
for Investment Lending (OP 13.20). This policy states that additional financing may only be
provided if activities are "expected to be completed within three years after the current closing date
for the project." A request was submittedto the Bank's management to seek a waiver o f OP 13.20
to accommodate the extension o f the closing date, and inorder to allow for the successful
implementation of the project with the best possible outcomes. The request was approved by the
Bank's management on May 5,2009.

23.     The use of savings from Component 1is consistent with the Bank'sOperational Policy
governing Use of Project Cost Savings (OP 13.25). LGSP meets the conditions set out inOP 13.25,
specifically: (a) implementationo f LGSP i s currently rated moderately satisfactory and i s
substantially incompliance with the legal agreements for the project; (b) additional activities are
considered a high priority for Government and the activities are consistent with the original project
objectives; (c) additional activities have been fully appraised by Bank staff and are economically
justified; and (d) financing ofthese activities does not violate the country financing parameterson
cost sharing. Inaddition, the extension o f the Closing Date by one year i s consonant with the
requirementsofthe Bank's Operational Policy governing Closing Dates (OP 13.30) inthat: (i)       the
project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) performance o f the Recipient and other project
                                                   the
implementing agencies i s satisfactory; and (iii)the Recipient's specific action plani s acceptable to
the Bank to complete the project.

ExpectedOutcomes

24.     It is proposedto adjust the project's development objectives, outcome targets and outcome
indicators. These modifications are described above under "Proposed Changes". The revisedresults
framework and monitoring arrangements are presentedinAnnex 2.

Benefitsand Risks

25. Benefits.The proposed restructuring would not alter the type o f benefits (direct and indirect)
    anticipated inthe original project document.

26. Risks and mitigatingmeasures.There are no additional risks as a consequence o f the project
    restructuring or reallocation.
