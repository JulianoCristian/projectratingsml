systems would be\n            revamped to improve financial management, while technical\n            assistance and staff training would be provided to improve\n            the efficiency of operations. Modest investments would be\n            made in rehabilitation and maintenance of LWSC's assets\n            to prevent their further deterioration. Construction of a\n            storage reservoir and selective extension of the\n            distribution system would also improve the quality and\n            reliability of water supply in Monrovia."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
