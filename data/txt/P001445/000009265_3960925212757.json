The International Development\n            Association (IDA)'s performance was adequate, and\n            played an instrumental role in establishing and maintaining\n            a very productive working relationship with the implementing\n            agency, and the Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit\n            (GTZ). The experience from this project gives rise to a set\n            of questions which are easy to ask in retrospect but\n            difficult to answer. Why attempt a miniscule rescue\n            operation in the midst of severe country and sector problems\n            and at a time when other Bank's financed projects, with\n            reinforcing objectives, such as the Structural Adjustment\n            Credit, were on hold? Given that the Bank Group was not\n            obligated to disburse funds if the Government of Liberia\n            (GOL) and the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) did\n            not comply with its legal covenants, why did the Bank/IDA\n            not stop all disbursements sooner and cancel the remainder\n            of the credit? One lesson that can be derived from this\n            project's experience is that success is very difficult\n            to achieve and sustain under adverse policy and\n            institutional conditions."}, "docdt": "1991-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
