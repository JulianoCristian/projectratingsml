Government's regulatory and consumer\n            protection performance, 2) improve policy formulation and\n            implementation,  3) design the transmission grid and the\n            wholesale power market,  4) increase the quantity and\n            quality o f electricity for the poor,  and 5) protect the\n            environment. There are five main components added to which\n            is a project management component. Component 1 reviews and\n            corrects problems with the regulatory system and the\n            institutional structure, and strengthens the Electricity\n            Superintendency (SIE) and the Consumer Protection Office\n            (PROTECOM). Component 2 (i) promotes a national dialogue to\n            achieve a consensus on required reforms and the\n            participation of the private sector; (ii) strengthens the\n            National Energy Commission (CNE); (iii) funds public\n            consultation processes; and (iv) improves the management of\n            Government interests as shareholder in power sector\n            enterprises through the Fondo Patrimonial (FONPER).\n            Component 3 improves system reliability and increases\n            competition in the wholesale power market by supporting\n            business plan creation, installing training programs,\n            identifying alternatives for private sector participation,\n            establishing a transmission expansion plan, and reviewing\n            the methodology used for setting transmission charges.\n            Component 4 improves rural electrification programs and the\n            Blackout Reduction Program in urban barrios. Component 5\n            supports the preparation of sectoral environmental documents."}, "docdt": "2004-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
