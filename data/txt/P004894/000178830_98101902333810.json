the attainment\n            of three basic objectives: Part A full capacity operation at\n            SN Metal's new production units, Oran III and Annaba\n            II, through appropriate start-up and operating assistance;\n            Part B evaluation of SN Metal's medium- and long-term\n            investment program to establish priorities and prepare\n            feasibility studies for two high-priority projects; and Part\n            C elaboration of a master plan for SN Metal to determine its\n            proper role in the Algerian economy, define its appropriate\n            overall organization and, in particular, to allocate\n            production among its units manufacturing structural steel\n            work, plate work and mechanical equipment in an optimal\n            fashion. The program, which will take about four years,\n            involves some 2,900 man-months of technical assistance at an\n            average foreign exchange cost per man-month of $8,700 in\n            1979 prices, plus about $2,900 per man-month for local\n            subsistence. The Bank loan would finance a first phase of\n            the program only. Risks relate to the complexity of the\n            tasks involved, problems of logistics and the human factor,\n            which is to considerable importance to the successful\n            execution of technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
