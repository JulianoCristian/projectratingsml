As a result, none of the objectives of the\n            project were met and the project outcome is rated as\n            unsatisfactory. At the time of approval, every indication\n            was that the contract would be formally signed at once and\n            implementation would start immediately. Soon thereafter,\n            however, disagreement arose between SN Metal and UEC (a\n            subsidiary of US Steel) on accommodation for the technical\n            assistance team. Despite several efforts on the part of the\n            Bank team to facilitate agreement, SN Metal and UEC could\n            not reconcile their differences. Subsequently, the Bank\n            learned that the Algerian Government was no longer fully\n            committed to the concept of large scale technical assistance\n            on which this project was based. As the loan and guarantee\n            agreements had not been signed, no formal action was\n            required on the part of the Bank."}, "docdt": "1993-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
