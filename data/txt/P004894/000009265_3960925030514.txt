MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:          Project Completion Note on Algeria
SN Metal Technical Assistance (Loan S016-ALG)
Attached is a copy of the "Project Completion Note on Algeria - SN Metal Technical Assistance
Project (Loan S016-ALG)" prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office.
The loan was approved but never signed, because the Borrower withdrew the loan application.
Therefore, none of the objectives of the project were met and the project outcome is rated as
unsatisfactory. Since the circumstances of the withdrawal are known, an audit is not necessary.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
ALGERIA
SN METAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN S016-ALG)
1.          This is a short Project Completion Note for the SN Metal Technical
Assistance Project which was to be financed by the proceeds of IBRD Loan S016.
2.          In November 1979, the Board approved a $20 million loan to finance
technical assistance for SN Metal, a metal fabrication company. At the time, a
draft contract for the technical assistance had been initiated between SN Metal
and UEC, a subsidiary of US Steel. Every indication was that the contract would
be formally signed at once and implementation of the project would start
immediately.   Soon thereafter, however, during a UEC mission which had been
mandated to sign the contract, disagreement arose between the parties on
accommodation for the technical assistance team (over 100 staff to house for over
three years in three different locations), a matter which had been extensively
discussed earlier and which was even covered by a specific provision of the draft
Loan Agreement.   Despite several efforts on the part of the Bank team to
facilitate agreement, SN Metal and UEC could not reconcile their differences and
SN Metal notified UEC in early 1980 it did not wish to pursue contract
discussions.
3.          The Bank team understood at the time that the Government and SN Metal
considered obtaining technical assistance from sources other than UEC. However,
the Bank team believed that, partly as a result of the negotiations with UEC, the
Government eventually decided that it was no longer fully committed to the
concept of large scale technical assistance on which the project was based. The
Bank was subsequently informed that the Government was considering dropping the
project and seeking to increase production at SN Metal through other means. This
was confirmed at the Annual Meeting, and formally notified to the Bank by cable
dated October 26, 1980, from the Minister of Finance.
4.          As the Loan and Guarantee Agreements had not been signed, no formal
action was required on the part of the Bank. The Board was informed through the
Semi-monthly Report to the Executive Directors as follows:
"After protracted attempts proved unsuccessful to conclude a contract
with a suitable firm to provide technical assistance to SN Metal, which was to
be financed under a $20 million loan approved by the Executive Directors on
November 13, 1979, the Algerian Government has notified the Bank that it was
withdrawing its application for the loan and the loan documents will therefore
not be signed."
