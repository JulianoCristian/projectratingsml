Public\n            Sector Management Technical Assistance credit for Kenya is\n            to improve governance by putting in place systems and human\n            resources capacity that are the necessary conditions for\n            achieving greater fiduciary responsibility and reducing\n            corruption in the public service. There are four project\n            components. The first creates a leaner and highly motivated\n            public service that is better equipped to deliver services\n            to the public by improving pay and benefits; developing a\n            contributary superanuation scheme and new medical insurance\n            scheme; integrating the performance and appraisal schemes;\n            rationalizing services; and integrating payroll and\n            personnel databases. The second component enhances\n            accountability, transparency, and efficiency in the\n            procurement of goods and services. The third component\n            reforms the legal framework by easing the registration and\n            retrieval processes and improving law reporting. The fourth\n            component provides project coordination and supports change\n            management for the project."}, "docdt": "2001-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
