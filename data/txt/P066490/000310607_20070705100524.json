likely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impact, and unsatisfactory Bank and Borrower performances.\n            The report cites four four lessons: (a) When re-establishing\n            a relationship with a country, keep reforms simple: Since\n            policy dialogue with the Government was low in the past,\n            much cannot be expected to be achieved under a project that\n            requires major policy reforms. (b) Build adequate support\n            and coalition among all stakeholders, including\n            parliamentarians, when preparing reforms and drafting bills.\n            The project life of three years was too short for any\n            meaningful policy reforms to be carried out successfully.\n            (c) Develop an effective communications strategy to\n            communicate the benefits of the reform during preparation\n            and implementation: The Government and the Bank designed the\n            project without much involving civil society groups, the\n            private sector, and parliament. The new party in government\n            has to appreciate the issues and the rationale for reforms.\n            (d) Align appropriate institutional arrangements with the\n            champions of the project: During preparation, identify the\n            political champions responsible for the various reform\n            processes which have wide political ramifications.\n            Managerial responsibility for the project should be assigned\n            to someone who clearly has the authority, means, and stature\n            to carry out the reforms. Furthermore, the report cites\n            recommendations from a governance review completed by\n            forensic auditors, which found shortcomings but not fraud.\n            The recommendations include making fraud-risk management an\n            integral part of all future projects; having the Project\n            Steering Committee take an active leadership role in project\n            governance; and requiring strong leadership from those\n            entities having the primary responsibility to spearheadi\n            public sector reforms."}, "docdt": "2005-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
