ROADS PROJECT
Project Summary
Borrower:        The Republic of Guinea-Bissau
Amount:          US$9.0 million
Terms:           Standard IDA
Project          The proposed project consists of a road rehabilitation and
Description:   maintenance program to be executed from late 1979 to late
1982 by three field brigades established for the purpose
of the project. A total of 226 km of asphalt roads would
be patched, resealed and maintained and 388 km of gravel
roads would be rehabilitated and maintained under the project.
The proposed project provides for the purchase of highway
maintenance equipment and spare parts for new and existing
equipment, materials and supplies for the civil works, work-
shop equipment, tools and three transshipment facilities
in the south. A portable axle-weighing device would be
purchased, to initiate a national program of axle-load
control. Technical assistance (216 man-months at a total
per man-month cost of US$9,600, including contingencies and
local housing, transport, etc.) would assist project execu-
tion, train Guinean staff and help strengthen the planning
and operating capacity of CPW.
The Government is the main direct beneficiary of the project,
as the rehabilitation of paved roads will defer expensive
reconstruction. The development impact of the roads would
be shared by the rural population which would enjoy in-
creased cash incomes through improved access to markets.
Through its technical assistance component the project
would have a substantial institution building impact on
the Commissariat of Public Works.
The project has been designed and phased so as to minimize the
major risk to the project, the country's limited absorptive
capacity. Disbursements against purchases of equipment for the
third brigade would be contingent upon satisfactory performance
of the first two.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A ROADS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
first development credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for the equivalent
of US$9.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a roads project in
Guinea-Bissau.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Guinea-Bissau joined the Bank Group in March 1977.  An initial
reconnaissance mission followed in May 1977, and its findings are reflected.
in the following assessment of the state of the economy and its prospects.
A full economic mission is scheduled for FY80. Annex I contains basic
country data.
3.        Guinea-Bissau won its independence from Portugal in 1974, following
a twelve-year armed conflict. Situated between Senegal and Guinea on the
West African coast, the country is characterized by six large estuaries running
far inland from the coast. It is mostly low-lying, with small hills inland,
and includes the islands of the Bijagos Archipelago. There is sufficient
rainfall for a variety of crops, though Sahelian conditions exist in parts of
the country. Reserves of bauxite in the interior are being explored. The
economic and social infrastructure is very little developed, and has suffered
during the war years. National accounts and population census figures are
currently being prepared by the Government, but the Bank staff places the 1977
per capita GDP at roughly US$160 for a population estimated at about 925,000.
4.        The current economic situation reflects the considerable recon-
struction efforts required not only to support economic growth but also to
recoup ground lost during the war years. The economy remains predominantly
rural, and small-holder traditional agriculture accounts for about two-thirds
of GDP and over 90 percent of total employment. Production of groundnuts pro-
vides the main cash income for the rural sector and constitutes 60 percent
of exports. Shipments increased sharply over the 1975-77 period, but the need
for imports of capital goods and food for the urban population has created a
heavy external imbalance on current account. Exports of goods and non-factor
services covered only one-fourth of the import bill over the past three years,
and the monetized sector of the economy has essentially relied on foreign aid
to finance its demand for consumer goods and capital equipment. Despite very
high levels of aid inflows, net reserves have fallen each year since independ-
ence to their currently negative position.



-2-
5.        The political system is based upon the single national party cover-
ing both Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, the PAIGC (African Party for the
Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde). The party organized the liberation
war in Guinea-Bissau and its international prestige and domestic support have
enabled the country to-make a fairly smooth transition to an independent,
peaceful status. One of the long-term goals of the PAIGC is to unite Guinea-
Bissau and Cape Verde, and to this end the two countries are joined in a
customs union and in several cooperative undertakings. The Secretary General
of the PAIGC, Mr. Aristides Pereira, is simultaneously President of Cape Verde.
Within the Government of Guinea-Bissau, many of the twenty commissars
(ministers) are party members. The country is divided into eight administra-
tive regions, each headed by a governor who also heads the regional party
organization.
Structural Characteristics
6.        Rice is the dominant foodcrop, and production of about 100,000 tons
of paddy assured food self-sufficiency prior to the war. Output fell during
the conflict as rice polders were destroyed in the south and farmers migrated to
neighboring countries. Production in 1977 was less than half the normal due
to severe drought which hurt output in the traditional surplus areas of
the south. This has required emergency imports of about 32,000 tons of rice
in 1978. Rainfall in 1978 has been better, and despite some plant disease
problems, output should be considerably higher than in 1977. Virtually all
rice is rainfed, with only about 100 ha presently under irrigation at a
USAID/FAO-financed rice experiment station in Contuboel. About 90 percent
of total rice production is of the bolanha (mangrove) type, in which polders
are constructed to prevent incursions of saltwater. This type of cultivation
is practiced primarily by the Balanta tribe (30 percent of total population)
inhabiting the southwestern coastal area. Other foodgrain production --
mainly millet, sorghum and maize -- totals about 50,000 tons in normal years.
7.        Groundnuts were introduced by the Portuguese and remain the major
export crop, although pre-war production levels have not yet been regained.
Since independence, exports of shelled groundnuts have risen from 8,000 tons
(1975) to 16,000 tons (1977). Most of the groundnuts are produced by the
Fulas and Mandinkas, Moslem ethnic groups who predominate in the interior.
Other export crops include palm products (12 percent of exports), cotton, and
cashew nuts. Fisheries and timber exports amounted to about 16 percent of
total exports in recent years.
8.        Industry is very little developed so far, producing about 5 percent
of GDP. Modern manufacturing is mainly Government-controlled, and includes
a large brewery, several old oil mills, and a sprinkling of small factories
aimed at import substitution. Almost all of industry operates well below
capacity due to supply problems and the low level of domestic demand. The
principal traditional industry is the production of rum from locally-grown
sugar cane.



-3-
9.        The tertiary sector is dominated by the civil service, with some
15,000 public employees. Guinea-Bissau's two majn> trading companies are
in the public sector, one 100 percent and the other 80 percent owned by
Government. These two firms control the groundnut export trade and the
distribution of imported and domestic rice. Private services consist mostly
of independent truckers and shop-owners, concentrated in the city of Bissau
(population about 100,000). There are no contractors considered capable of
undertaking major new construction.
10.       Social services have focused on education and health, with total
school enrollment increasing from 12,000 in 1964 to 90,000 in 1976. Illiter-
acy remains at about 90 percent. Tropical diseases are widespread, including
malaria and filariasis, and considerable foreign financial and technical
assistance has been devoted to the support of Government health programs.
11.       No recent information is available concerning price and wage level
increases. However, since imported goods figure importantly in the mone-
tarized sector, the depreciation of the Guinean peso over 1975-1977 (averaging
14 percent per year) indicates that domestic inflation probably exceeded world
levels. This conclusion is supported by the money supply figures which show
an annual increase of 18-19 percent in currency in circulation plus demand
deposits over 1975-77. In early 1978, the shortage of local rice caused by
1977 drought resulted in higher official retail prices for rice and very high
prices for supplies obtained on the parallel market.
Public Policies and Development Outlook
12.       Economic policy-making in Guinea-Bissau has so far addressed prob-
lems on an ad hoc basis. In judging the effectiveness of Government policies,
the short timespan since independence must be considered along with the
reconstruction problems faced at the conclusion of a lengthy war. Government
has generally adopted a rational course of action within considerable con-
straints, and actively seeks the advice of international experts. A policy
of public control over large parts of the modern sector of the economy was
quickly asserted, and the few major enterprises have all been brought under
state control: the brewery, petroleum products distribution, banking, public
transport, and the two trading companies. On the other hand, about half of
the total retail trade remains in private hands, and the Commissariat of
Economic Cooperation and Plan is working on an investment code. Imports
are strictly controlled by the state through a licensing system. This causes
difficulties in importing spare parts, but has succeeded in limiting the
growth of imports. The central bank (National Bank of Guinea-Bissau) has
consciously retained an over-valued currency since independence. This policy
favors urban dwellers by making imported consumer goods cheaper in domestic
terms. The rural/urban terms of trade were improved when producer prices for
groundnuts were more than doubled in a single step at independence, but
groundnut and rice producer prices have been held constant since then, and
by now may provide inadequate production incentives.



-4-
13.       Short-term prospects for the economy are for moderate growth in
exports with some reduction in rice imports, continuing balance of payments
shortfalls, and budget deficits financed by foreign aid. Government forecasts
for 1978 indicate exports up marginally in current value over 1977, reflecting
a drop in groundnut shipments but an increase in that of palm kernels. Real
GDP has probably increased in 1978 due to more normal rains after the drought
of 1977. Foreign aid will probably remain stable at a relatively high level
over the next few years, but with some shift away from program aid toward
specific projects. In view of the critical balance of payments situation, the
Government requested an IMF consultation mission which took place in December
1978. No IMF program has yet been agreed, but technical assistance is being
provided and there is general agreement with the Government on the need to
reduce the budget deficit. Government will continue to depend, for the time
being, on balance of payments support or program aid to finance the desired
level of consumption for the modern sector.
14.       The relevant constraints upon the country's development over the
next decade are likely to be shortages of trained manpower and an inadequate
physical infrastructure. Few efforts were made during the colonial era to
develop human resources. In each commissariat (ministry), the number of
trained and experienced individuals is modest, even in relation to other West
African countries. This slows the planning and execution of any development
project. Infrastructure problems include poor roads, an outdated port,
limited communications outside of Bissau, a tiny electric generating capacity,
and no safe water supply even in the capital. Physical constraints on the
transport side have held back production of export crops and the dissemi-
nation of modern cultural techniques.
15.       The Government hopes to complete a formal development plan by 1980.
In the meantime, the Commissariat of Economic Cooperation and Plan is orga-
nizing the preliminary steps: two national accounts experts have arrived, and
an inventory of ongoing projects, plans for a census and outlines of develop-
ment strategy have been prepared. The Guinean view of the country's develop-
ment is based on the realities of a small, poor nation with undeveloped
infrastructure and a marked dualism between the small modern sector of Bissau
and the traditional rural sector in the interior. The Government's short-term
strategy is to use foreign aid for quick-yielding, productive projects and
balance of payments support. Projects generating foreign exchange are favored,
and agricultural output is to be boosted by providing cheap consumer goods to
the rural areas. The overall goals of development encompass all sectors: to
increase agricultural production both to satisfy internal demand and for ex-
port; to develop an industry oriented toward providing consumer goods and
simple equipment for the domestic rural market; and to strengthen Government
organization and lay the needed social and economic infrastructure.
16.       Development potential over the medium-term focuses first on fish-
eries and timber resources. Studies by foreign aid agencies have indicated
a potential catch of up to 140,000 tons of fish and 2,000 tons of shrimp
annually. Fishing agreements with the USSR have recently been re-negotiated
and new arrangements made with France, Portugal and others to ensure that
Guinea-Bissau benefits fully from its fisheries resources. Processing facili-
ties are to be installed at Bissau. Timber resources are not yet fully



-5-
surveyed but appear promising, and present exports of about 5,000 tons could
be increased with better equipment and organization. Other development pro-
jects now underway include the Cumere agro-industrial complex, located near
Bissau, which will process groundnuts into oil for export, and rural develop-
ment projects based on groundnuts (French aid), cotton (European Community
aid), and rice (Netherlands aid) in various parts of the country. Projects
now in the planning stage include a 10,000 ton cane sugar mill and a small
auto assembly plant, as well as infrastructure projects aimed especially at
air, water and land transport.
17.       Guinea-Bissau's long-term prospects hinge upon the development of
agriculture and the possible exploitation of bauxite. With the introduction
of new varieties, herbicides, fertilizers and irrigation rice production could
be greatly increased. With reasonably good rainfall, some potential exists
for diversification of export crops; sugar, bananas, citrus fruit and palm
products are being studied. Bauxite deposits, estimated to range from 100 to
over 300 million tons of export-quality rock, could provide important public
revenues in the long-term. Studies for the exploitation of these reserves are
still in the initial stage, and there has been little interest expressed so
far by international mining companies. The deposits are located 150-200 km
from the sea, and total project costs, including infrastructure, would approach
US$1 billion.
Public Finance, External Assistance and Debt
18.       Public finance trends show rising budget deficits.  Budgetary
revenues (US$17 million in 1977 or 15 percent of GDP) are relatively low,
reflecting the small contribution from import and export duties (only 16
percent of total receipts), a legacy from the colonial tariff structure
which is now being revised. Current budget expenditures are relatively high
(US$35 million in 1977 or 30 percent of GDP), and are concentrated on wages
(over 70 percent), with little remaining for materials. Education and health
together receive 30 percent of current expenditure and defense 20 percent.
The current deficit has been financed by borrowing from the central bank and
some external borrowing. Non-budgetary expenditures are large (US$60 million
in 1977 or 50 percent of GDP) and include imports of consumer goods for the
urban population as well as capital goods, technical assistance, and military
equipment. All of this has been financed externally, with about 64 percent
covered by grants. The size of the civil service, at 15,000 employees,
exclusive of the military, is a serious medium-term problem since the level of
resources available from the primary sector is not nearly sufficient to
maintain the public payroll.
19.       Incomplete data indicate that over 1975-77 Guinea-Bissau received
on average about US$40-50 million annually in foreign grant and loan commit-
ments. This assistance was concentrated on program aid, health and education,
telecommunications, fisheries and agriculture. Major donors have been Sweden
(program aid) and the Netherlands (each providing about US$10 million in



-6-
grants annually), the USSR, the UNDP, and the European Development Fund.
Portugal provides important technical assistance, including secondary school
teachers. Among lenders, the African Development Fund is financing a highway
project and a general transport study, while the Kuwait Fund is financing
airport rehabilitation and a port study. The volume of aid flowing to Guinea-
Bissau, at about US$50 per capita per annum or 20-30 percent of GNP, is high
by comparison with other West African countries, partly because of the
significant amount of program assistance provided.
20.       Preliminary Bank estimates of public external debt show high commit-
ments in 1975, and somewhat lower commitments in the next two years. Total
debt outstanding, including undisbursed, was roughly US$60 million at end-1977,
or some 30 percent of GDP, with about US$20 million disbursed. A tentative
calculation of the debt service ratio for 1977 gives a figure of about 10
percent, which is also the ratio estimated for 1978. Over half of Guinea-
Bissau's debt commitments carry maturities of at least 20 years.
21.       The budgetary resources of the Government are modest in comparison
to the existing backlog of reconstruction and development work required.
Even if public revenues can be improved in coming years, public savings will
remain modest and a substantial resource gap will continue. It is therefore
necessary for external aid agencies to finance a high proportion of projects
costs and to provide funds on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
22.       The IDA strategy in Guinea-Bissau is to help create the conditions
necessary for the long-term development of the economy. This means providing
technical as well as financial assistance to strengthen public institutions,
particularly those serving the rural population, and to rebuild the physical
infrastructure supporting domestic production and external trade. An initial
emphasis is therefore being placed on the agriculture and transport sectors.
A roads project was chosen as the first IDA operation because it directly
supports the high priority agricultural sector, and because of its relatively
easy preparation and quick disbursement pattern, which help establish a strong
country relationship.
23.       Agriculture and water transport are key sectors for IDA involvement
in Guinea-Bissau. Therefore, IDA has begun project preparation in these two
sectors which both require a long gestation period. The rural development
project would focus most likely on regions covered by the roads project.
Consultants, under bilateral financing, are preparing a detailed soils and
land use map, and an IDA project identification mission is scheduled for
February 1979. The second project will be in the ports and waterways area.
The Government is currently carrying out a pre-feasibility study for a port



-7-
project at Bissau, with financial assistance from the Kuwait Fund. IDA is
actively parjticipating in the discussion of this study. The social sectors
have not been accorded a high priority in the IDA program so far, owing to the
considerable bilateral aid already directed to education and health.
24.       The level of prospective IDA lending relative to that of other
official development assistance is modest, due to the high volume of existing
aid flows. At end-1979, IDA would account for about 8-10 percent of total
external debt outstanding, including undisbursed. The IDA lending program
outlined above will result in a share of less than 5 percent in Guinea-
Bissau's total external public debt service over the next five years.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       Guinea-Bissau's internal transport system consists of a road network
dating from colonial times, an important system of waterborne transport with
many small river ports, an international airport, and numerous landing strips.
Transport from the important southern rice-growing regions is difficult, even
by water, and the area lacks satisfactory internal transport infrastructure.
The north, which offers the crop diversification potential necessary for
long-term food security, is partially served by water transport, but the road
network is in dire need of extensive rehabilitation and maintenance.
26.       The Commissariat for Economic Cooperation and Plan (CECP) has the
overall responsibility for economic planning and investment coordination. It
is currently supervising a transport study being carried out and financed by
the African Development Fund (AfDF), which will focus on the rehabilitation
needs of priority roads linking the main agricultural areas. In addition, it
will review the country's waterway network with a view to rehabilitating the
coastal fleet and strengthening its management. The transport study will
serve as the basis for the transport investment program.
27.       The three executing ministries in the transport sector exercise
considerable independence. The Commissariat for Public Works, Construction
and Urban Affairs (CPW) is responsible for road construction and maintenance.
The Commissariat for Transport and Tourism oversees ports, coastal shipping,
aviation and road transport, both directly and through agencies such as
Guinea-Bissau Airlines, the Bissau Port Authority and Silo Diata, the state
bus company. It also comments on all proposed road investments. The Com-
missariat for Commerce Industry and Handicrafts (CCIH) controls Armazens do
Povo ("The People's Store", AP) and Socomi, the two state trading companies.
These two firms run virtually all shipping and trucking in Guinea-Bissau,
integrated into their commercial activities.



-8-
There is little coordination between these ministries at the working level.
Interministerial contact occurs only at the Council of Commissars, which is
the executive body of the party's Supreme Council.
28.       Transport Infrastructure.  The 78-vessel coastal shipping fleet,
based in Bissau, moves an estimated 75 percent of freight in the country.
From the sketchy financial records available, the fleet appears uneconomic
to operate, with tariffs barely adequate to cover wages, fuel and maintenance.
The age of the fleet also contributes to its low 'utilization, less than 20
percent of its theoretical capacity. Inland waterway ports are unsatisfactory.
Many piers are in poor condition and have water depths insufficient to allow
loading or discharging at low tide. Road links from these small ports to
villages and farms are poor.
29.       Marine access to the port of Bissau, which handles virtually all the
country's foreign trade, is difficult. The port is located on the estuary
of the Geba River, abbut 80 km from the ocean, and is reached by a channel
constantly threatened by shoals. Navigational aids are inadequate. The exist-
ing port has several deficiencies: siltation and no means for dredging, a
deteriorating quay with little protection against ship impact, inadequate
handling facilities, and poor organization of port operations. The European
Development Fund is financing new handling equipment, which should help to
increase throughput and improve efficiency.
30.       The Kuwait Fund has financed a study for a new port at Bissau.  How-
ever, the initial proposal for a costly new terminal was based on insufficient
data, and did not consider other alternatives, such as, for example,
improving the existing facilities. The Government, the Kuwait Fund and the
Association, therefore, agreed that more work was required before a decision
on a possible port project could be made. The additional information is
expected to be available by mid-1979.
31.       The Kuwait Fund is also financing improvements to the country's
international airport at Bissau. A runway extension (from 2,800 m to
3,200 m), apron improvements, runway lighting and instrumentation will upgrade
the airport to ICAO Class 1 standards (enabling it to serve as an emergency
alternative to Dakar). Guinea-Bissau's international air links are to Dakar,
Cape Verde, Lisbon, Algiers and Moscow. The state-owned Guinea-Bissau
Airlines operates scheduled service to Dakar and Conakry, as well as to
six interior points.
32.       The high percentage (17 percent) of paved roads in Guinea-Bissau's
3,065 km road network is a consequence of the armed struggle, when the provin-
cial military administration paved some sections mainly as a deterrent against
planting land mines. Whereas the network layout as a whole reflects peacetime
needs adequately, portions of the east-west and north-south axes remain as



-9-
earth roads, some less important sections in the center and south are paved,
and some populated areas (especially in the south) lack passable roads alto-
gether. Traffic volumes are low, reflecting the low economic activity. Road
construction projects have been chosen to fill obvious gaps in the network,
though no overall road plan yet exists. Two road segments will be paved by
foreign contractors within the next two years: Jugudul-Bambadinca (AfDF-
financed) and Bambadinca-Quebo (European Development Fund).  These roads tie
in with the works proposed under this project.
33.       Since independence, CPW has undertaken  a limited amount of simple
reconstruction and upgrading on key road sections. But maintenance is
sporadic and concentrates on paved roads in the form of surface patching.
Work output and quality is low, because of inadequate equipment and work
methods, and shortages of spare parts and materials. The proposed project
addresses these deficiencies.
34.       The country has no complete accounting of road expenditures.  Total
1977 CPW expenditures were about US$2.0 million (just over 2 percent of the
Government's current budget expenditures). About US$800,000 represents
outlays for maintaining roads and bridges. Another US$475,000 was spent on.
materials, supplies and spare parts. Most purchases for new equipment and
related spare parts have been financed by bilateral aid. The Government has
agreed to accord priority to maintenance outlays in recurrent expenditures.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       IDA's objective in the transport sector is to assist the Government
in providing basic road infrastructure in all regions of the country, thus
supporting rural development, and improving public works and transport admin-
istration and services. The proposed road project promotes this objective in
two ways. Its primary impact will be in establishing, in the Commissariat of
Public Works, the capacity to rehabilitate and maintain Guinea-Bissau's road
network. At the same time it will preserve the extensive investment in paved
roads, provide basic road infrastructure in the south, and support agricul-
tural development in the north.
36.       The project was identified in December 1977 and prepared by IDA
staff and consultants, with the cooperation of the Government. It was
appraised in July 1978. Negotiations were held in Washington, from December
5 to 8, 1978. The Guinean delegation was led by Mr. Alberto Lima Gomes,
Commissar of Public Works, Construction and UJrban Affairs. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 2215-GUB, dated January 10, 1979 has been circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Supplementary project data appear in
Annex III.



- 10 -
37.       Project Description.  The proposed project consists of a road
rehabilitation and maintenance program to be executed from late 1979 to late
1982. Three field brigades would be established and operated under the
project for a period of up to three years. A total of 226 km of asphalt roads
would be patched, re-sealed, and maintained, and 388 km of gravel roads would
be rehabilitated and maintained under the project. One of the gravel road
brigades would be serving the groundnut growing area in the north and the
other the major rice growing area in the south. The proposed project provides
for the purchase of highway maintenance equipment, spare parts for new and
existing equipment (rehabilitation of existing equipment is part of a training
program for mechanics), materials and supplies for the civil works, trans-
shipment installations at three river ports in the south, and workshop
equipment and tools. Technical assistance (216 man-months at a total cost,
including housing, transport, etc., of US$9,600 per man-month) would be
provided to the CPW for project execution and to train Guinean staff. A
portable axle-weighing device would be purchased and the Government has agreed
to begin, by January 1, 1981, enforcement of axle-load regulations appro-
priate for the technical and geometric charactristics of the road network.
(Section 4.05 of draft Development Credit Agreement).
38.       Project Execution.  CPW would be responsible for the implementation
of the project. Owing to the lack of experienced Guinean staff, the technical
assistance team would initially take up line functions in project execution.
As the Guinean staff gain experience, they would take over the responsibilities
from the expatriates, so that in the final year of the project, the remaining
members of the technical assistance team would act as advisors.
39.       Civil works would be done by force account by CPW employees
assigned to the project (Schedule 3, Part D of draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). The list of roads to be improved was agreed at negotiations. The
important training and institution building aspects of the project could not
be addressed if this component were to be executed by an international con-
tractor. The work of the brigades would cover about three working dry seasons:
patching on the paved roads would begin in October 1979, work on the laterite
roads in the south in early 1980, and the brigade in the north would start in
October 1980, one working season later than the first two. This would avoid
overtaxing CPW's technical and administrative capacity and allow CPW tech-
nicians to acquire basic technical skills. A condition for placing the orders
for equipment for this third brigade and for disbursing funds for this equip-
ment would be that the first two brigades shall operate satisfactorily for a
period of at least four months (Section 3.01(b) and Schedule 1, paragraph 4(b)
of draft Development Credit Agreement). CPW would experiment with the use of
village labor for routine ditch clearing and brush-cutting operations, essen-
tial complements to the mechanical work. Bidding documents for purchase of
equipment, spares and materials are currently being prepared and equipment
delivery would be expected to begin in mid-1979.



- 11 -
40.       Technical Assistance.  The project would provide a total of 216 man-
months of expatriate technical assistance to cover both the preparation and
implementation periods, with a contingency of a further 36 man-months in
1981-82, if required. The assistance would include the services of a project
manager/highway engineer, an administrator, two brigade foremen and three
mechanics (of which one would be a training specialist) with other specialists
for short appointments (Section 3.02 of draft Development Credit Agreement).
Terms of reference for these services have been agreed upon between the
Government and the Association. The Government invited proposals from a short
list of consultants during the appraisal mission, and a contract with the
selected firm was signed in December 1978. The technical assistance team and
the Government will jointly carry out on-the-job training programs for key
personnel, road maintenance operations, equipment operations, maintenance
and repair, stock control, works planning and execution. For the first
eighteen months of the project, a special training program for mechanics on
equipment rehabilitation would be carried out. The consultants would be
required to detail a practical training program for each trade group and a
complementary program of classroom training.
41.       The technical assistance has started prior to field works to permit
preparation of bidding documents and an early start on equipment rehabilita-
tion. An advance of up to US$300,000 under the Project Preparation Facility
is financing up to 30 man-months of mechanical and highway engineering
assistance.
42.       Project Cost Estimate.  The total cost of the project, net of taxes,
is estimated at US$10.1 million including physical and price contingencies.
The taxes amount to US$40,000 equivalent, mostly on motor fuel. The foreign
exchange component is about US$9.0 million or 89 percent of total project costs
net of taxes, and local costs are estimated at US$1.1 million equivalent.
43.       Financing and Disbursements.  The proposed IDA Credit would cover
the entire foreign exchange cost of the project, US$9.0 million. The Govern-
ment would finance all local costs, mainly wages totalling GP 34.1 million
(US$975,000), and GP 1.4 million (US$40,000) in taxes. To ensure timely
availability of funds, a project Revolving Fund would be established in the
Central Bank (Section 2.02(c) of draft Development Credit Agreement). The
Government's opening of an account for this fund would be a Condition of
Effectiveness (Section 5.01 of draft Development Credit Agreement). IDA would
deposit in the Fund the equivalent of US$150,000 in Guinean Pesos representing
the estimated cost over a three-month period of locally-purchased imported
goods (mainly fuel and cement) and directly imported spare parts. The account
would be replenished on the basis of supporting documentation. The opera-
tional details of the Fund were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
44.       The IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows, for:
(a) highway equipment and spare parts, the transshipment
facilities, radios and the weigh-bridge, 100 percent of
foreign expenditure;



- 12 -
(b) spare parts for the repair of existing CPW equipment,
100 percent of foreign expenditure and 50 percent of local
expenditures;
(c) fuel, materials and supplies, 100 percent of foreign
expenditures and 94 percent of local expenditures;
(d) consulting services, 100 percent of foreign expenditures;
and
(e) for civil works for workshops and buildings, 74 percent of
total expenditures.
US$1.0 million would remain unallocated. Disbursements should be completed by
March 31, 1983.
45.       Procurement.  Bitumen, steel culverts, some building materials,
equipment for the field brigades and workshops and the transshipment facili-
ties would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines (US$3.6 million). In evaluating the bids for
equipment, consideration would be given to the availability of after-sales
service and spare parts. Field workshop equipment, survey and laboratory
equipment and radios would be procured following quotations from suppliers
or bought off the shelf, provided the aggregate of such purchases does not
exceed US$200,000 equivalent. Spare parts for the rehabilitation of existing
equipment would be bought from the original suppliers (up to an aggregate
amount of US$100,000). Fuel and cement would be procured locally, through the
Commissariat of Commerce and the Directorate for Imports of Petroleum Products
and Lubricants (DICOL), the two agencies that centralize purchases of these
goods for the Government (up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million).
Their purchases are based on international tendering satisfactory to the
Association. Technical assistance and training to CPW for project execution
is provided by a consulting firm acceptable to the Association.
46.       Economic Analysis and Project Beneficiaries.  The overall economic
rate of return (ERR) of the project is 33 percent, taking into account the
quantifiable benefits derived from the three brigades through vehicle operat-
ing cost savings and incremental agricultural production and all project costs
including the technical assistance, the specific benefits of which cannot be
quantified. With a 15 percent increase in all costs, the ERR remains an
acceptable 31 percent. Each component is economically justified by itself:

47.       The Government would be the principal direct beneficiary of the
project. The rehabilitation of paved roads would defer expensive reconstruc-
tion, a potentially serious drain on the development budget. Vehicle operat-
ing savings will accrue mainly to the Government and the two state-owned
trading companies. These firms should be able to reduce their trucking costs
and in the south, improve the quantity and range of goods available to farmers
at their rural outlets. The development impact of the roads would be shared
by the rural population which would enjoy increased cash incomes through im-
proved access to markets. The Government would increase its foreign exchange
earnings from groundnuts and cotton through better farm to market roads.
Also, foreign exchange earnings would accrue due to greater domestic production
of rice, maize, and sorghum. The project also would have a substantial
institutional impact on the Commissariat of Public Works by creating the basic
management and technical skills necessary for managing the road sector and by
improving the skills and productivity of about 180 CPW staff.
48.       Project Risks.  The project has been designed and phased so as to
minimize the major risk to the project, the country's limited absorptive
capacity. The disbursement condition (para. 39) would guard against this
risk. In addition, the Government and the Association have worked in close
collaboration on the preparation of this first operation in the country,
and key project staff have been appointed. Close supervision is planned, both
to help smooth project execution and to acquaint the Government with IDA's
methods and procedures.
49.       A risk to physical implementation could arise from slow ordering and
delivery of equipment which might delay the start of the southern laterite
rehabilitation brigade. The first year output of this brigade has, therefore,
been conservatively estimated at 30 km and the overall ERR of the project and
of the southern brigade has been calculated on this basis. A delay in equip-
ment delivery would not affect the paved road rehabilitation, since the neces-
sary preparation and patching prior to resurfacing could begin as scheduled.



- 14 -
IDA's financing of fuel and materials through the Revolving Fund would help
ensure their timely availability, a key factor for optimum use of the equip-
ment. The Revolving Fund would also expedite ordering of and payment for
spare parts from overseas suppliers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau and the Association and the Recommendations of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
51.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest are listed in Section III of Annex III. The opening of an account
for a Revolving Fund is specified as an additional Condition of Effectiveness
(para. 43 of this report).
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
