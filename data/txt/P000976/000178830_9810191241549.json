rehabilitation and maintenance program to be executed from\n            late 1979 to late 1982 by three field brigades established\n            for the purpose of the project. A total of 226 km of asphalt\n            roads would be patched, resealed and maintained and 388 km\n            of gravel roads would be rehabilitated and maintained under\n            the project. The proposed project provides for the purchase\n            of highway maintenance equipment and spare parts for new and\n            existing equipment, materials and supplies for the civil\n            works, workshop equipment, tools and three transshipment\n            facilities in the south. A portable axle-weighing device\n            would be purchased, to initiate a national program of\n            axle-load control. Technical assistance would assist project\n            execution, train Guinean staff and help strengthen the\n            planning and operating capacity of CPW."}, "docdt": "1979-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
