satisfactory, sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was moderate, and the Bank\n            performance and the Borrower performance were both highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1. Adjustment\n            operations should not be complex for countries with weak\n            implementation capacity; 2. Design of the adjustment\n            operations need to be thoroughly worked out to avoid\n            implementation delays; and 3. Expectations should be\n            realistic in the case of transforming the state-run operations."}, "docdt": "2007-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
