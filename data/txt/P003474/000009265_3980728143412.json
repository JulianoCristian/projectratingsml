is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Northern Irrigation Development Project\n            in China. The main objectives of the project were to\n            increase the efficiency and profitability of agricultural\n            production in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and to\n            alleviate absolute poverty in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.\n            IDA's performance in project preparation, supervision\n            and management was considered adequate and satisfactory. The\n            project's overall outcome is Satisfactory with the\n            Yinnan Component rated as Highly Satisfactory and Hetao\n            Component as Satisfactory due to the latter two-year delay\n            in completing the water management monitoring system on the\n            Trunk Canal. The key lessons learned include: (a) poverty\n            reduction through land settlement is a viable long-term\n            intervention when planned and executed systematically; (b)\n            successful land settlement requires careful selection of\n            settlers based on well-informed process, suitable settlement\n            sites, provision of essential basic infrastructure and\n            social services, and government preferential policy\n            incentives and support in the initial years of settlement;\n            (c) appropriate cost recovery policy over a reasonable\n            period from settlers will induce a sense of responsibility\n            and obligation to succeed in the new environment; (d)\n            water-saving technologies should be used in irrigation areas\n            supplied with multistage pumping of water at a high cost so\n            as to maximize the economic return and use of water; (e)\n            consultant services provided jointly by foreign and local\n            consultants were economical and efficient, as evident in the\n            planning and design of the Hetao Trunk Canal Water\n            Management Monitoring System; and (f) foreign exchange\n            losses can be minimized by timing procurement of imported\n            goods at the time when foreign exchange rates were stable."}, "docdt": "1998-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
