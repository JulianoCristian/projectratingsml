Re:
Coastal Lands Development Project
Amendments to Loan and Development Credit Agreements
Dear Mr. Minister:
Thank you very much of your Ministry's letter dated November 12, 1988 proposing 
separate billing arrangements under the Coastal Lands Development Project 
(Credit-1887/Loan 2924) and the Northern Irrigation Project (Credit 1885).
We are pleased to inform you that our Accounting Division will be able to make 
necessary arrangements to accommodate your proposal. Separate accounts will be 
established by the Accounting Division as follows:
(1)   Part A (Jiangsu Province)     Loan 2924-O
(2)   Part B (Zhejiang Province)    Loan 2924-1
(3)   Part A (Jiangsu Province)     Credit 1887-O
(4)   Part B IZhejiang Province)    Credit 1887-1
(5)   Part A (Nei Monggol Component) Credit 1885-0
(6)   Part B (Ninxia Component)     Credit 1885-1
We appreciate your understanding that there is no need to separate already 
signed legal documents for these projects. Therefore, we do not propose to make formal 
amendments for this purpose, except for the adjustments in the Amortization Schedule 
to the Loan Agreement as well as the correction of the disbursement percentage in 
Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement, both for the Coastal Lands Development 
Project.
Accordingly, the following amendments are proposed for your agreement:
