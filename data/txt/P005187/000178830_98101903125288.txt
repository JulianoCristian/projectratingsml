UI'IDER THE GUARANTEE OF IRAN
1.        I submit the folloiing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $40 million to the
Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (If'DBI).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        DADBI was established in 1959 to provide long term finance to
private industry in Iran. The WIorld Bank group assisted in its formation
and provided a first loan of P5.2 million in November 1959.  Subsequent
loans were made by the Bank in 1965, 1966 and 1968 bringing the total to
$64.7 million (net of cancellation of unused balances).
3.        The first two loans are fully disbursed and the third loan ft.lly
committed. The fourth loan was made in June 1968 for $25 million and about
`6.1 million remained to be committed at the end of lMarch 1969, It is
expected to be fully committed in a few months, since IvDBI itself has
already approved projects covering this balance. Negotiations took place
in lashington during the week beginning I'larch 31, 1969. The Managing
Director of TIADBI, Fir. A. Gasem Kheradjou, represented ILDiDBI, and Mr. E.
Shapoorian of the Iranian Economic ljission in Washington represented the
Government as guarantor.
5.        The proposed loan would be the Baikts thirteenth loan in Iran
and the second loan in the Bank's current fiscal year, the earlier loan
of $30 million being for the Dez Irrigation Stage I project, which was

6.        Loan 160-IRI is fully repaid and Loans 227-II, 240-IR3A, 247-IRW
and 422-IPRj are fully disbursed. Of the undisbursed balance of $79.2 million
for the remaining loans, some $431.2 million is for the three road projects
made in 1964 and 1965. Delays in disbursements have been due mainly to
initial delays in the award of contracts and the poor performance of a fewy
contractors. A supervision mission wdhich visited Iran in February recommended,
and the Bank has agreed to, a second postponement of the Closing Date of the
Second Highway Loan (381-I1N).  In the case of the Third Highway Loan (410-IRN),
where some $23.2 million remains undisbursed, the mission has also recommended
that the Bank give favorable consideration to an expected request for post-
ponement of the present Closing Date of September 1, 1969. The last eight
contracts were awarded recently and the mission estimates that a reasonable
time for the completion of the remaining wzorks is twenty-four months from
now. Construction is proceeding satisfactorily on the first Feeder Road

project (411-IRN) and a supervision mission is currently reviewing the
progress of work on the Ghazvin Project (517-IRN).
7.        A mission is at present in the field appraising a possible loan
to the Agricultural Development Fund of Iran. The Bank is also considering
aM education project and financing for further road and irrigation projects.
81        IFC has so far invested in two companies in Iran. In 1965 a loan
of $300,000 was made to S. S. IKahkashan (ceramic tiles), and in February 1969
a loan of $3 million was made for the Ahwaz Steel Rolling Mill, together wi-th
an equity investment of $800,000.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOANi
9.        Borrower:                  Industrial and Mining Development Bank
of Iran.
Guarantor:                 Iran.
Amount:                    Various currencies equivalent to USS40
million.
Purpose:                   To assist IMDBI in financing the foreign
exchange cost of projects mainly in
manufacturing, undertaken by private
industry in Iran.
Amortization:              The initial amortization schedule provides
for repayment over 15 years, in 30 sem&
annual payments beginning December 15, 1971
and ending June 15, 1986, but is subject t,
change in order ultimately to conform slb-
stantially to the aggregate of the araioti-
zation schedules for subloans and invest-
ments for uihich withdrawals from the loan
account are approved or requested.
Interest Rate:             6-1/2 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:         3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Industrial and Mining Develop-
i^.ent Balk of Iran" (DB-47b) dated April 22, is attached.



11.       IMDEI was established in October 1959 by Iranian and foreign
investors to finance private industrial development in Iran through medium
and long-term loans and investments in share capital. Resources available
for its own operations nowz amount to about $123 million, of which share
capital, recently increased, is $13 million. Approximately 20 percent of
the shares are held by foreign investors. Rial resources have been obtained
from Government loans equivalent to $41 million, including an interest-free,
subordinated loan equivalent to $8 million. In addition to its own funds,
IMDBI manages a further $76 million equivalent on behalf of the Govemnment
for investment in private enterprises.  Apart from a loan of $5.2 million
made in 1959 by the United States Development Loan Fund, the Bank has been
IMDBI's sole source of foreign exchange.
12.       INfBI's business has been expanding rapidly. Approvals of
financial assistance during 1968/69 amounted to $51 million equivalent, far
exceeding $34 million for 1967/68. This is attributed not only to the general
buoyancy of the Iranian economy, but to the fact that IMDBI has become quite
active in identifying investment opportunities, in promoting new companies an6
in finding technical and financial partners. The promotion of new projects
is one of BfDBI's major contributions to the Iranian economy.
13.       LKDBI is a well-managed company. lHowever, the number of promotion
projects and the increase in business is putting strain on staff resources.
1EDBI has invited management consultants to advise on organization and
procedures, but the strengthening of staff is bound to take time. As a
result, appraisal and follow-up procedures, although generally satisfactory,
need further improvement.
14.       Profits are increasing satisfactorily thereby enabling DMBI to
increase its dividend rate to 10% on increased share capital on the one hand
and to build up reserves on the other. EIDBI's loan portfolio is well
diversified and generally sound. The equity portfolio is still unseasoned
but appears to be of good quality. The debt/equity ratio as defined in the
Bank's loan agreements is now about 2.0:1 and is estimated to rise to about
3.7:1 by hIarch 1971 as against the limit of 4,5:1. IMDBI remains credit-
worthy for a loan of W4i0 million.
15.       The appraisal report showrs that IILDBIs existing line of credit
from the Bank will be fully committed by mid-1969, and that TDMBI is in need
of replenishment of foreign exchange resources. A loan of $40 million would
be appropriate to cover LMDBI's projected requirements for the next 1-1/2 to
2 years. However, at the present juncture, uhen private investor confidence
is extremely buoyant and IMDBI has a long pipeline of projects, some of them
quite sizeable, in course of promotion, it is difficult to predict require-
ments with any certainty. ,IHDBI may therefore be in need of further resources
within a shorter period.  Bank exposure in IMDBI would be somewhat reduced
should IMDBI succeed in obtaining foreign exchange resources from other sour^es,
a new policy whlich the Bank is encouraging.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUME4TS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and IMDBI, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Iran and the Bank, the Report of the Conmittee
provided for in Article III Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distrib-
uted to the Executive Directors separately. The agreements follow closely
the forms currently in use for loans to development finance companies.
PART V - THE ECOiiOMY
17.       An economic report entitled "The Fourth Development Plan and the
Economic Prospects of Iran" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 6, 1969 (R69-43).
18.       In recent years the economy of Iran has been booming, with real
income growing at 8.6% per annum. The major impetus to economic growth was
the increase in investment from 13p of GNiP in 1962 to 19o in 1967.  This was
largely made possible by the rapid increase of oil revenue during the period.
This remarkable economic expansion has been accompanied by relative monetary
stability, and the rate of growth of prices was contained at less than 2% per
annum. The overall prospects for maintaining a high rate of growth in the
economy are favorable. The main constraint is likely to be a shortage of
capital, and even if the rate of domestic saving is much improved, Iran will
have to rely on foreign capital inflows. Debt service is projected to rise
to 18% of export earnings in 1972 and could continue to increase thereafter
if large-scale foreign borrowiing is undertaken as planned. Iran is considered
creditworthy for the borrowing envisaged during the next year or two, but
maintenance of Iran's creditworthiness depends largely on future expansion
of oil revenues and on the terms of newi borrowings, both of which should be
watched carefully to ensure that debt service does not rise too rapidly.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE TUITH *iRTICLES OF AGREEMENT
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOifliNiDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
