APPRAISAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPMENT BANK OF IRAN
Summary
i.        The Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI) has
been associated with the World Bank Group ever since its creation in 1959.
It has obtained four loans from IERD totalling US$ 65 million. The last
loan of US$ 25 million. granted in June 1968. is being utilized expeditiously
and INDBI is now seeking a new loan.
ii.       The Iranian economy is booming. During the Third Five-Year Plan
period (1962/63-1967/68)- it ar-w at an average annual rate of nearly 9%.
The growth during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period is expected to continue
to be high.  Industrial prrubir-on acouints for nnlvy 1% of PD? and con-
centrates mainly on consumer goods.   However, industrialization is progress-
ing smoothly and privnte imrestme.n.t in industry iS substanti21  amnnting
to Rls. 46 billion during the past Live years and being expected to amount
to about R     nls. 10 biion du erilnng the coming five years (1968/69-1972/73).
iii.     IBI has bsen taking fu-l advantage of the favorable environment
to expand its business.   Approvals of financial assistance during the last
finan^ial year  --A ended on March 2                0         ,to . 3.8 billion,
far exceeding the Rls. 2.5 billion approved during the previous year.

investment in industry.   Its contribution to the economic development of
the country is the more significanr in that it often promotes important
projects which entrepreneurs are either unable or unwilling to promote, and
it is helping to develop the capital market by setting up the Tehran Stock
Exchange and. being active in equity investment.
iv.       IMDBI's total assets (inc:Luding the Managed Funds) amounted to
Ris. 8.3 billion as of October 22, 1968.   Its resources amounted to
Rls. 14.9 billion at the end of 1968 as a result of substantial replenish-
ments rmade during the year.  These replenishments totalled Rls. 7 billion,
including Rls. 0.5 billion raised by means of an issue of shares, the IBRD
loan of Ris. 1.9 billion ($ 25 million), a Government ioan of Rls. 1.7
billion and additional Managed Funds amounting to Rls. 3.2 million.
v.        The Managed Funds made available by the Government to IMDBI have
an important bearing on its operations. These funds represent about one-
third of IMDBI's total assets. They not only enhance the profitability of
IMDBI, but enable it to lessen its risk in financing large projects and
projects in difficulty.
vi.       INDBI's management is capable and energetic and the morale of its
staff is high.  However, some strengthening of its staff is needed in view
of the rapid expansion of business. IMDBI's procedures need to be improved
by a refinement of its appraisal methods and a more systematic follow-up of
projects under supervision. The management is aware of these weaknesses and
is taking steps to deal with them.

General
3.        The Iranian econom is booming. During the Third Five-Year Plan
period (1962/63 - 190(/68) -°, the economy grew at an annual rate of nearly
9%, far exceeding the target of 6%. Private consumpt-ion increased at an
annual rate of 5.6% during that period, accompanied by the expansion of
government expenditures for investment and consumption (at 26.4% and
16.9%, respectively) as well as private investment (11.0%). This growth
was accomplished with relatively stable prices, with the wholesale prices
and cost of living indices increasing by 6% and 8%, respectively, over
the entire period. The balance of payments position was comfortable,
owing mainly to substartially increased oil revenues.
4.        The year just ended on March 20, 1969, is the first year of the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. The Plan envisages a 9.3% average annual growth
of GNP (10% in GDP) with GNP per capita increasing from US$257 in 1967/63
to US$355 in 1971/72. The Bank considers that this might be too ambitious
since oil and agricultural production may not reach planned targets.
Nevertheless, the last year's economic growth is estirnated to be more than
11%, following the 11.5% growth registered in 1967/68.
-1  For detailed discussions on the economic environment, see Report Eia-3a,
dated February 25, 1969, "The Fourth Development Plan and the Economic
Prospects of Iran".

2   The Iranian year 1967/68 covers; the period from March 21, 1967 to
Mkarch 20, 1968. The Third Plan starUed in tlle second nal  of 1962/6:3
and covered a 5-1/2 year period.



- ii -
vii.      I14DBI's profitability is at a satisfactory level.  Its portfoli.o
is well divorsified and generally sound.
viii.      IDBI is a suitable and creditworthy borrower. A Bank loan
of US$ 40 million should cover its foreign exchange resources over the two
financial years until March 20, 1971.
ix.       The terms of the pronosed loan should be similar to those applied
to the last loan to IINDBI, except that, in accordance with the Bank's most
recent nolicv  the rate of interest should be fixe-d at the time of approval
by the Executive Directors.

Industryr
5.        Iranian industry (including electricity and minine but excluding
oil) achieved an annual growth rate of 10.3% during the Third Plan perio(i.
Its value added in 1967/68 amounteri to Rls. 65 hillionr representing 119
of GDP. Growth was higher in such new industries as metal fabrication
and machinprv aS well as C         hUt lowr in t       n1 i             s
as food processing and textiles.
6.        However, industry is still essentially in its infant stage.    Its
total tn+jri+      +o~ G(TP is  -1        4it-hi inusry  food processing -an

tivly. /- c  e *-LJ induVs+y  oLQJ.siet ranlyJ  UofLth  asser,,b.y ov durab1le
consumer goods such as refrigerators, heaters, and recently motor vehicles.
According +o the 196,/66 industrial census (the latest avai'l-e), thr
were about 113,000 industrial establishments in urban areas, of which less
than  ,000 employed 10 or more persons, and less than 30 (mainly in
textiles and food processing) had output of more than Rls. 1 billion.    Most
of the com,,anies are famil.y o-wnled. Enteprepneurs are former traders or
importers and many of them lack modern management skills.   Although the
c n l±y -hig gr-wuh of uile euonomy gives them confidence in the future
prospects of industry and also makes their existing business very profit--
able, they Cappear to be reluctant to invest on a large scale in new lines
of business, unless a quick pay-back of their investment is assured.
7.        However, aside from such large projects as the steel milL and
the petrochemical complex being implemented by the Government, there has
been private investment in new industry such as car assembly, tires and
steel-rollizg.  Total prlvate investment during the Third Plan period
amounted to Rls. 46 billion, far exceeding the target of Rls. 30 billion.
Industrial Finance and IMDBI's Role
8.        Source of Finance.   Besides commercial banks and bazaar finance,
11"IDB1 and the Government-owned Industrial Credit Bank (ICB) are major
institutions providing industrial finance. ICB places more stress on
small loans and it finances Government enterprises as well as private.
During the T'hird Plan period, total financial assistance disbursed by IMtBI
and ICB amounted to about Rls. 7 billion and Rls. 4 billion, respectively.
These account for about 15% and 9%, respectively, of total private invest-
ment in industry. Credit by the 21 commercial banks to the private sector
expanded in the past four years by an average of about Rls. 13 billion
each year (i'igures for industry alone are not available). The capital
market has Just started to develop, and the share capital of companies is
owned usual]y by families and in some instances by such institutions as
IMDBI and ICB.  Private foreign investment (excluding oil) is not large.
amounting to Rls. 3 billion 1/ during the five-year period.

9.r Tbe Governm".eM.ntIS Policy.    It is the Governm.ent I  -1 poly to
promote the rapid industrialization of the economy. The present emphasis
is on import substitutiorn inadustries, and new industries are protecte 
from competition through flexible tariffs and import quotas. Tax con-
cess ions and. financial assistance (thuouugu IvMDBI anu IrJB) are also given.
In order to avoid excessive profit the Government tries to have at least
two marnufacturers in the same industry, ev-en at the cost- of diseconomies
of scale. Foreign investment is encouraged, where it is necessary to
induce desiraDie technology, but majority Iranian control is insisted
upon. The CGovernment directly undertakes only those industrial projects
which the private sector cannot undertake because of the magnitude of thE!
investment or otherwise, such as the steel mill, the petro-chemical
complex and the aluminium smelter.
10.       It is difficult to assess whether these broad policies of the
Government are designed and carried out in such a way as to ensure the
most efficient use of resources. Industrialization is certainly helping
to create new employment of labor and to increase domestic production.
Foreign exchange savings can also be expected in the future. On the other
hand, the relatively low productivity and the limited scale of production.
often result in ex-factory prices substantially exceeding the landed cost
of competing foreign, goods. Tariffs usually range up to 40%, but are often
higher. Sometimes imports are restricted or prohibited. Nevertheless,
there has been no significant rise in prices charged to consumers. There
are several reasons, such as substantial mark-ups previously made by
importers and various incentives to new industry given by the Government.
Above all, industrial production is at present mainly in consumer goods
and not in capital or intermediate goods. Therefore.it is not to any great
extent affected by the cumulative high cost of feeder industries, but it
benefits from the tariff exemption on imported eapital and-intermediate-
goods granted to it by the Government.  Eowev6r, as industrializPtion and
the degree of domestic manufacturing progress, the high cost of production
could cumulate. On the other hand, those industries which started
earlier could scale up production and improve efficiency, thereby becoming
able to reduce their costs. Whether industry as a whole can approach
international competitiveness is, therefore, dependent upon the balance
between these two developments.  Although it is difficult to predict the
outcome, the high rate of economic growth in Iran and the ability of the
Iranians to adapt to rapid change, as demonstrated in the past years,
should be a factor for reasonable optimism.
11.      ID2BI's Role.   IMDBI's role in the industrialization of the
Iranian economr is important. It not only gives financial assistance to
prospective entrepreneurs but it helps clients to shape in projects by
giving advice or by finding foreign collaborators. Furthermore, in view
of the lack of initiative on the part. of entrepreneurs, DMBI itself often
makes feasibility studies, obtains governmental licenses, finds local and.
foreign partners and promotes companies.   Its equit-y investment is to some



extent filling the gap created by t;he undeveloped capital market. It also
helped to promote the Tehran Stock Exchange. With the outgoing attitude
of its management, it is taking fuLl advantage of the current favorable
conditions to expand its business. Its relationship with the Government
and other financial institutions continues to be cordial and its practical
knowledge of industry is highly respected.
12.       In making an investment decision, .Bi nas to be guided by the
broad policies of the Government.  However, by excluding proposals for projects
of obviously low priority and by a thorough examination of the viability
of individual projects, rIDBI helps to channel investment into economically
sound fields.
II. RESOURCES, ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES
13.       IMDBI has now been in existence for more than ten years and is
one of the largest development finance companies associated with the World
Bank Group. Its resources, organization and procedures are described in
the following paragraphs with particular emphasis on dJevelopments during
the past year.
Share Capital
14.       During 1968, share capital was doubled from Rls. 480 million to
Rls. 960 million in two steps. In January, there was a rights issue (at
par) of one for every two shares, and in December another rights issue
(at par) of one for every three shares. Both issues were successfully
completed. The nresent shareholders list, as shown in Annex 1, reflects
substantially the same distribution as before.  The shares are widely
distributed with 2,129 shareholders holding an average of 395 shares
(Rls. l,OOO par) and a maximum of 58,000 shares (6%).  This operation has
enabled IMDBI to enlarge its borrow-ing base and also its limit of eauitv
investment. Under the latest loan agreement with the Bank, IMDBI's
borrowing is limited to l.5 times itsq share onnitali - reserves and late
maturities of the Government advancel/, which now leaves ample room for
additional borrowing- since its nrnsent borrowings stand at only two times
the borrowing base. Its self-imposed limit of total equity investments
which is equnl to the share c-anital and reserves is now approximatelv
Rls. 1.3 billion as compared with the existing equity portfolio of Rls. 0.6
'hi I I in nr% +Inn iinAi c1ii-r.ctr ^nwvwn4+mrni+. r-f Ple A 9 'hillirnn-
billion, and -> undisbursed co....it.-Uer. of Rl1s. 0.2 billion..
Now Bo^rronwi n
15.       In addition to the Bank loan of US$ 25 million signed in June
1968, agreements were signed in December with the Plan Organization, under
which the latter is making available to IMDBI, during the Fourth Five-Year
Plan period, a loan of Rls. 1,750 million for general operations, a
Managed Fund of Rls. 2,000 million for lending and another Managed Fund
of Rls. 1,250 million for equity investments.

the last maturity of any sub-loan.

resources need further replenishment and this is dealt with later in
ldadragrapih 'U and 71.
i4anaged rund.s
i0.       Te availability of managed funds has an important bearing on
the operations of IMDBI. They not only contribute a third of its total
resources, nut also give fVIDBI exceptional maneuverability in its opera-
tions. Different categories of managed funds are described in Annex 3.
1/ Includes provisions for losses which are shown in IMDBI's balance
sheets as dpductiblp items in assets,
/ Of which Rls. 2,1.50 million is earmarlced for equity investments.

The original managed fund simply works as an additional fund for rial
loans on which IMDBI realizes a spread of 3% per annum (in other words,
funds to be borrowed at a cost of 5% per annum) and on which IMDBI bears
no risk. The Plan Organization funds for lending have the same impact on
profitability and, in addition, they can be used in a strategic way as
they can be directed to specific transactions. Thus, when the amount of
finance required by a single company exceeds the policy limit (15% of
equity and quasi-equityv that is about Rls. 290 million at present), the
excess amount can be financed with these funds. If a foreign exchange loan
is involved. IMDBI obtains a guarantee from the Plan Organization for the
excess amount. The Plan Organization funds for equity investment do not
at present contribute anvthing to the Drofitabilitv of IMDBI as its fee of
1-1/2% per annum is to be retained from dividends received and capital
gains realized and no actual gains have so far been realized.   However.
these funds enable IMDBI to lessen Lts risk in promoting projects and also
to Drovide its reAular cliant onmnanies with the enqity thpv need to
enlarge their borrowing base and to provide working capital in case of
financial stringeny   rlt.hermnora +.he innitlized porFion of the mnnnope
funds (which amounted in the past months toover Rls. 500 million) earn

addition, helps IMDBI to dispense with the need of keeping cash reserves
for its commitments.

Mr. A. Gasem Kheradjou, a former staff member of IBRD/IFC, has been
1Mkinaging Director since December 1963. Mr. Reza Amin, wno was Deputy
Managing Director, left IMDBI in August 1968 on his appointment by the Shah
as the President of Arya Amehr Tachnuological University.  The post he held
has since been left vacant.   Ar. Fereydoun Mahdavi, Assistant Managing
Director and head of the Economics Department, is now next in line.
21.       Total staff (all iranian) as of October 22, 1968, numbered 7f3
(excluding 24 service staff), as comnpared with 66 one year before.  Excluding
a clerical and secretarial staff of 30 and four professionals on official
leave of absence, professional staff on active duty numbered 39, compared
with 38 one year before, and included 10 who had joined IMDBI during the
past 12 months. The turnover of personnel is thus rather high, although
it does not appear to reflect low morale, but rather the rapidly growing
demand for trained staff by new industrial establishments in Iran.   Also,
except for Mr. Amin, IIDBI has apparently been able to retain its key
personnel.



- 7 -
22.       Individual staff members are generally inte'Lligent and capable,
and their morale is high under the energetic management.  However, many
are still new in the institution and senior staff are too deeply involved
in promoting projects and handling proijcts in difficulty, to give
sufficient training to new staff members. The strengthening of staff is
at present tending to lag behind the expansion of business.
Appraisal Procedures
23.      IThe Economics and Projects Departments are in charge of appraisal.
The usual procedure is that,when management decides to go ahead with an
appicCation, the Economics Department first looks into the .market a_,znects
and the credit standing of promoters. Then an engineer in the Projects
Department studies the technical aspects of the project.  Finally, an
appraisal report is prepared, usually by a financial analyst in the
Projects Departl-tent. T'hus appraisal work is divided into three major
stages, each being handled by different people. At each stage, management
receives a report, gi.ves ad-vrice and m,akes. decisions.  .Alt   ti pr
cedure gives the management opportunity to make a timely decision and also
to train Junior staff, no one on t1he working level is responsible for
making a comprehensive assessment of all the aspects of a project. The
,,appraisal report" is thus often prepared after decisions have been taken
as far as management is concerned.  It sometimes lacks consistency,
reflecting assessments made at different times by different people.
24.       In the case of promotion projects, after a project is identifLeA
from the market angle by the Economics Department, one or two staff
members are assigned to implement the project. Under the constant super-
vision of the management, they obtain government consents, organize
local promoters, locate foreign collaborators and work out the details
of the project. 1Ihen the appraisal report is prepared after all this, iLt
is difficuLt to make an objective assessment of the project.
25.       En doing appraisals, VVBI's staff have to work under adverse
conditions. Apart from the fact that some of them Lack enough experience
and the wo:rk load is heavy, reliable statistics on industry are not
readily available in Iran and local entrepreneurs are very reluctant to
disclose the real state of their business. The profitability of a project
often depends on the amount of Government protection from imports, whicha
cannot be determined beforehand due to the flexible tariff policy of the
Government. For industries new to Iran, the staff have to rely heavily
on information provided by foreign collaborators. These handicaps are
somewhat offset by laborious field work, practical experience in industry
obtained through involvement in promotion projects and projects in trouble
and the guidance of the able and experienced management. Thus, IMDBI is
able to make generally sound investment decisions.



26.       Follow-Up Procedures. The Loans Supervision Department with a
professional staff of seven is responsible for follow-up of projects.
Although follow-up has been given particular attention by management during
the past years and improvements have been made, systernatic and comprehen-
sive work has still to be developecl. Reports from clients are difficult
to obtain arnd if available seldom reveal the real condlition of the companies.
Many clients are delinquent in servicing their loans.  Follow-up is in
practice limited to about one-fourtsh of the total of 160 client companies.
These 40-50 companies need attention either because proj ects are still
under construction or because loans are not regularly serviced. Extensive
efforts are exerted to make collections. Besides the usual reminders,
post-dated cheques or promissory notes are accepted in lieu of cash,
rescheduling is wiorked out when this is considered necessary, and management
is taken over by IMDBI in serious cases. Also in the case of promotion
projects, officers of IMDBI sit on the Board although they are usually not
involved in day-to-day onprations. At nresent nine officers are on the
Boards of 28 companies, of which 11 are promotion projects and 5 are
cornmnanieS in difficnilty.
27.       Evaluation of Procedures;  The relative size nf TMnBT's experienced
staff compared with the increase iLn the volume of busiLness as well as
prevailing conditions in Iran make th  apra ni-sl and follow-un work of IMDBI
extremely difficult. IIvDBI has so far managed to deal with this matter in
a practical way, byr concentrating on the immediate and essentil nproblems.
However, with the growing volume of new business and the growing portfolio
of projecs requiring superrision, its procedures need to be imnroved bv
a refinement of its appraisal work and more systematic follow-up which
permits detection of potential problem projects.  IBI is awJare of this;
and, in a move in that direction, it has recently retained for a term of
about half a year a British consulting firm to help improve its organiza-
tion and procedures.

Recent Trends in General
28.       Reflecting the favorable investment climate in the country and
its own efforts in promoting projects, iljDBi's business has been expanding
satisfactorily. As shown in the table below, its approvals (including
Managed Funds operations) during 1968169 &mounted to Rls. 3.8 billion or
50% over Rls. 2.6 billion for 1967/68.

29.       As seen in the above table, in 1967/68, the increase in business
was solely attributable to large amounts of projects promoted by IMDBI,
but in the last year its brisk business appears to reflect mainly the
active investment activity prevailing in the country. Another feature
during the last year is that IMDBI for the first time made an underwriting
operation and provided a guarantee on a supplier's credit. although under
special circumstances.
Promotions
30.       There are twelve projects totalling Rls. 3 billion which had been
nromnt.M1 hy TMnRT andr nprnvzr' hy tho Boanrrid hy Ocrtor+hon 22  it968.  Of these
projects (which are described in Annex 7) one sugar company has already teen

and stationary diesel engines) are under construction. A bicycle and motor
cycle projct is Lat the StaSge of fin4alizing nego+a IS        foreign
collaborators. These projects have been implemented along the lines of
the development policy of the  -ovenment, but I.BI has exercised its owT1
business judgment on them. Although it is premature to assess the

investment decisions on these projects have been ill-judged.
31.       In some of the above mentioned cases, the Government first
identified the project and asked iIVIBi to imIplemenL it.  DUt usually, iiLI.BI
was solely responsibile for the identification of the project, the
feasibLlity stuuy, arLd the financial and technical arrangements .  ThMBI
always takes an equity interest in such a company and is represented on the
ouard.  However, it s the policy of IwBI to find management from outside
and not to be involved in the day-to-day operation of the company.



- 10 -
32.       Aside from these promot:ion projects, IMDBI helps promoters
without enough financial and technical means to implement large projects.
Sometimes its involvement is as great as in projects promoted by itself.
It takes the initiative in working out financial and technical arrange-
ments, and makes substantial equity investments. During the last year,
there have been two such projects (lamps and sheet glass) involving total
assistance from IMDBI to the extent of Ris. 607 million.
Lending Operations
33.       Since it commenced operations and until October 22, 1968, fl'DBI
has approved loans for 271 nrolects, totalling Rls. L1,065 million. Of
this amount, Rls. 9,682 million has been committed for 255 projects.
About one-third of its total commLtments (Rls. 3,768 milLion, equivalent
to US$ 50 million) represent foreign currency loans.  Local currency com-
mitments amount to Rls. 5 914 milLion. including Rls. 1.859 million
financed by Managed Funds.
34.       Interest Rate. Since 1963, IMDBI has charged the same interest
rate of 7  nlnl 1% service charge per annimm on all its loans, whether from
its own or Managed Funds, or whether on rial or foreLgn currency loans.
(The only exception is a loan to Arya Shipping Company granted out of Plan
Organization funds, which bears no interest but carries a small service
fee of 1/2% per annum to LDiMBI.) This means a spread of l.5% on foreign
exchange loans (at the current IBRD rate), 4% on local currency loans (on
the new Plan Organization loan), a.d 3% on managed fu,nds loans. The com-
mitment fee is nmow 1% per annum, up from 0.5% per annum in March 1968.
35.       Security and Exchange Risk. Loans are generally secured by a
mortgage over fixed assets.  The exchange risk on foreign exchange loans
is passed on to borrowers.
36.       Size of Loans. The maximum exposure in a single enterprise is
.LJJ1it.U   to '5  o  qu-L y plus G-overnmen,t ardvance  viz. abu  Rls. 290
million at present. However, as stated earlier, f'DBI may use Managed
Funds 'to finance larger projects.  There are, at present, six such cases
the largest of which is the financing of a paper project amounting to
Ris. 520 million comprising Hls. 220 million f rom uw-J aunds and Pls. 300
million from Managed Funds. The minimum size is set at Rls. 5 million.
An analysis of loans is given in unnex 8, which shows a fairly even dis-
tribution among loans of different sizes. However, the recent trend
appears to be towards more larger loans in view of DOWBI's involvement in
promotion and "semi-promotion" (as referred to in Paragraph 32) projects.
37.       Purpose of Loans. Annex 8 gives a breakdown of loans by purpose,
and shows that 53% of the total amount has been utilized for new facilities,
44h% for expansion and 3% for working capital. A rev:iew of individual loans



approved during the 19 months preceding October 22, 1968 indicates that
60% of the total amount is for new projects leaving 40% for expansion and
working capital. About half of the amount in new projects represents
promotions.  The ratio of new projects apart from IMDBI's promotions
appears to be small, considering the stage of industrial development in
Iran. This could be an indication that Iranian entrepreneurs are genera:Lly
cautious in making investments in new industry, and emphasizes the pro-
motional ro:Le of INDBI. Investment, as seen from regular applications, is
usually made by an importer to produce goods he has dealt with in the past,
to meet an ascertained market and with a minimum degree of domestic pro-
cessing. Business is expanded later, only step by step both in terms of
volume of production and degree of domestic manufacturing. Of recently
approved loans new projects from clients include such industries as woollen
textiles, car assembly, lamps, sheet glass and electric fans. Expansion
projects are spread over various industries such as food processing, shoes,
textiles, metal fabrication etc.  The breakdown by industry of IMBI's
portfolio is discussed in Paragraph 41.
38.       Duration of Loans.  As shown in Annex 8, the duration of loans
is rather short, although the weight of longer term loans is increasing.
Loans for 5-7 years represent 49% (in amount) of the total and over 7 years
only 31%. the bulk of which are related to promotion projects.   The short
average duration of loans appears to be primarily the reflection of the
pattern of private investment in Iran, namely, investment which is not very
capital intensive and promises quick return. Also, as noted in the
preceding nnragranh, investment.s are usually made only step bv step.
Furthermore, on the part of IJDBI there appears to be a tendency to have a
short amort:ization neriod of loans, which  although not so intended; helps
to minimize the effects of shortcomings in appraisal and follow-up.
39.       Geographic Distribution.  According to the Government's policy
of decentralizing industrial activities, I.'BI is t-ring to divert. mnrp of
its activities away from Tehran. Promotion projects are always located
outside Tehan.   The present. Grvernment policy prohnihit  in general anv new
industrial establishment within a 120 Km radius of the capital. Neverthe-
less, the weight of projects in Tehran in ITMBI's portfolio has not sien:Lfi-
cantly decreased, as loans are being granted for the expansion of businesses
in Tehran.  As of October 22, 1968, it was 67%   S coapared wirth 721 as of
June 21, 19657. The geographical distribution of loans is given in Annex 9.
40.       Mlnaged Loans. As of October 22, 1968, there were managed loans
amoun.ting to R1S. 1,M6 million and consisting of: (1) loans transferred to
IDBI in 19!,9 and managed on behalf of Industrial Credit Bank and Bank
Melli Iran, totalling Pl-s. 2094 .i11 -1 on (-includaing anboutRii+ P.ls. 185 milli,on in

loans byr wa  of a parti 4.cipat 4  JIflflBT loan, total,ing DRs. 890

41.       QuLality of Loan Portfolio.  Loan portfolio is well diversified as
shown in Annex 10.  By order of importance, the main industries are metal
products (14.%), transport equipment (12%), sugar (9%). cement (6%), food
processing (6%), wood and paper products (5%), electrical goods (5%),
petroleum products (5%), and chemicals (5%).   The breakdown shows the
emphasis placed on newer industries compared with traditional ones. Under
the booming economy all industries are faring well at nresent. It is un-
likely that there will be structural problems with any industry, assuming
the continuance of the Governmentt?s induistrisli zation policies-
iq2-      As of September 22, 1968, arrears over 3 months amounted to
Rls. 133 million in principal repayments and Rls. 39 million in interest on
14 loans, with the total outstanding principal of Rls. 387 million.   (These
figures include about 16% participation by Managed Funds.) Compared with
the total loan nortfolin nf Rls. K., billion (including +he Managed FindA
participaticn), these loans represent 7% of the total. Besides these, there
was a substantial nummber of minor arrears of less than 3 months and a
loans on which extensions had been granted. Arrears occur, in the first
instances, simply duel to lax repaymewnt habits Jn the coun-try. 'hen, there

are companies which are ploughing back earnings, including funds for amor-
t.ing (debt, to expand business Instead ofi coming back to flwBI for new
Linance.  Finally, there are several serious cases where the difficulty
or_i_ginates fror. bad  -1ra ae-4t rather than genera-l m,ar-wet conditions or
technical problems. At present there are nine such projects with the total
outstanding loans of RIs. 232 million.  Three are in Lood processing, two
in bricks and one each in leather, 'Lumber products, ceramic tiles and
chemicals. These cormpa.iies are under the strict supervision of INDBI, which
.has taken over the management of four companies and initiated legal action
6against uLrE!e cowpanies.
143.     In general, there does not appear to be any substantial amount of
Probable losses in IMDBI's loan portfolio at present.
Other Operations
144.      Equity Investment.  As stated earlier, the present guideline
a(dopted by ICBI!s Board limits its aggregate investment in equity to the
total of share capital and reserves, viz. Rls. 1.3 bil:Lion at present. It
Piso limits equity investment in a single company to 10% of the share
capital and reserves viz. Rls. 130 million. These limits are related to
investments with IMDBI's own funds, and the Plan Organization equity funds
-an be used to supplement IMDBI's own funds when it desires to make a larger
equity investment. Approvals of investments (including Managed Funds) in
recent years amounted to Rls. 610 million for 1964/65, Rls. 200 million for
96-W66, Rls. 506 million for 1966/67 and Ris. 448 million for 1967/68.
f5.       As of October 22, 1968, Ii'BI's own equity portfolio amounted to
Rls. 610 milLioni/ in 25 companies, about half of which (Rls. 306 million in
11 companies) represented investments in companies promoted by IJMBI_/.   The

rest, with minor exceptions, were in large new companies, in which IDDBI
had been involved from the promotion stage. In these cases, IMDBI's
presence was essential to provide enough capital for majority Iranian con-
trol.
46.       These investments are not as yet seasoned and dividends received
on them are small. However, there appears to be no particular difficulty
iith these investments at Dresent. 12MBI has so far sold shares in seven
companies totalling Rls. 8i.5 milLion at book value at a profit of Rls. 16
million on three companies. (The other shares were sold at cost.) It
appears that fIDBI's portfolio as a whole has already appreciated beyond
lX7. UTndert!riting and Guarant.ee. At prsn stg of developme~i,nt o~f th~
Iranian capital market, equity investment is taking the place of underwrit-

ones.  However, they show the effort of fIDBI to diversify its activities.
48.       Encouragement of Capital Market.   IMDBI was the driving force for
the establishment OI Tehran Stock Excnange in January 1968 and its stock
was one of the first four listed there (the others are two Government bond
issues and one iubricating oii company).   However, progress has not been
significant so far.  Transactions are negligible.   OIly one additional
share (a cement companyj nas been listed since.   IiII nas for some tim-
been thinking about establishing an investment company to stimulate the
capital market, to mobilize savings from the public, and to help distri-
bute its equity portfolio.   Although the plan has yet to be crystallized,
it appears to have good prospects in view of the growfing income of the
middle class in Iran.

assets in Annex 11.
50.       As shown above, total combined assets now amount to Rls. 8.3
billion (U3S$ 110 million) showing a 58% increase over Rls. 5.2 million



about one and a half years ago. Of these,    v1DBIjs own assets have
increased by 66% with the result that the Managed Funds now account for
33/ of the total as compared with 36% before.   As regards sources of
funds, the bulk of the requirements have been financed through borrow-
ings, especially from IBRD. Bank ioans outstanding now amount to
Rls. 2,144 ,iillion (US$ 29 million) and have increased by Rls. 1,262
miillion during this period.  Shareholders' equity has increased substan-
tially due to retained earnings as well as the share issue of Rls. 240
million in February 1968. (The last issue of Rls. 240 million is not
included in the above table.)
51.       As of October 22, 1968, the total debt/equity ratio was 4.0:1
(excluding the Managed Funds). The debt/equity ratio as defined in the
Bank's loan agreements was then 2.11,:l and after the :Latest share capital
increase should be about 2.0:1.   During this period f DBI managed to meet
its conmitments without any liquidity reserves of cash and short-term
investments. This is due to the excess funds in the IManaged Funds and
the credit facility from the Central Bank, both of which flDBI can draw
on as and when needed. As of October 22, 1968, DIDBI had drawrn Rls. 358
million from the Managed Funds and Rls. 192 million from the Central Banlc.
As of the same date, the 1fanaged Funds held Rls. 276 million in deposits,
in addition to the above advance to the IiDBI s own account.

54.        As regards own fund operations, financial expenses are increas-
ing as borrowing from the Bank, which is more expens:ive than interest
free quasi-equity and low-interest Plan Organization loans, is increasi,:Jg.
This results in the diminishing spread from 5.1% to !4.2% during the per:iod.
(A slight decrease in gross earnings is attributable to the increasing
Tgeight of equity portfolio.) The Managed Funds operations also show a
declining trend of profitability, mainly due to the -increase in equity
investments, on which IMDBI cannot at present earn agency fees as they are

not yet paying dividends.   (The average income of l.LZ per annum at pre-.
sent roughly indicates that IMDBI is drawing its 3% fees on loans totalling
about half of the total manazed portfolio.)   In overall operations; the
moderate decline in administrative cost is not enough to offset the
decrease in eross spread and profitability is showing a declining trende
Nevertheless, the present level of profit still appears to be at a satis-
factory level.  Also; there are prospects for improvement as equ+ity invest-
ments start yielding profits.
Reserves and Dividends
55.       As of March 20, 1968, IMDBI's reserves totalled Rls. 154 million,
consisting, of a TLgal Reserve of R.ls. 56 million, an Investment Reserve of
Rls. 9 million, a Share Premium Account of Rls. 2 milLion, a General Reserve
of Rls. 75 million and undistributed profits ,amounti   toJ-i    ±I.C 1  l L .
The Investment Reserve and Share Premium Account were set up for the first
ti;me in the account for 1968, and, by Board resolution, are not available
for dividend payments. The former represents a portion of the capital
nains rea'4Izedu on sP-1-es LfromIII tMBIV.D.1 S shpare portfoplio, and was cre"' d po
this account directly (not through the income accounts). The residual
(RIs. 2 millIon),  hich  4DBI considers current income, was credited first to
income and then a similar amount wals charged to expenses as provisions for
losses.  The Share Premium- Account represents the premium on shares not taiken
up at the rights issue in February 1968 and sold by IMDBI. In addition to
these reserves and provisions for losses on investmeni., 10% of gross income
from own fund operations is now set- aside as provisions for losses on loans,
which anount to Ris. 133 million as of March 20, 1968.. There have so far
been no write-offs of loans from these provisions, but each year a small
aoount of interest that has accrued on certain defaulted loans is not
credited to income.
56.       Te practice mentioned irn the preceding paragraph makes IMDBI's
presentationi of net profit conservative, but somewhat arbitrary. It wou:Ld
be better i:f the capital gains were! credited in total to the income
accounts but were segregated from ciperating profit. iLS to the provision,
for losses, the fornula appears to be proper in the circumstances, but the
gross income on which 10% is calculated should be clearly defined and
consistently followed.  Finally, interest accrued on certain loans should
be charged to income and adequate provisions should bei made specifically.
57.       The position of reserves and provisions as of March 20, 1968, is
su=marized below.  As noted before in Paragraph 42: IMDBI's loan portfolio
includes Rls. 232 million for projects in difficulty. However, the ulti--
.-,ate loss to IDBI should be considerably less than that amount, in view
of the security backing taken by IMDBI and the participation by Managed
bunds which is included in that amount. Furthermore, IMDBI's equity port-
4'olio appears to have appreciated over its book value. The position
of reserves and provisions appears to be satisfactory.

V. FUTURE PROSPECTS
The Setting
6'.       The Fourth 5-Year Plan of Iran, of which the 1a$t yeair wias
the first year, is examined in detail in Economic Report EMA-3a.    The Bank
considers thlat the target of 9.4% rate of growth in GNF is too ambitious
chiefly because of possible shortfalls in agricultural and. petroleum
production. A 7TS grow^Jth has been assumed in the Report. Private invest-
mernt in industry, which is projected in the Plan at Rls. 120 billion
(a'.ainst Rls. 46 billion during the actual Third Plan) is also considered



- 19 -
too high and about Rls. 100 billion is estimated as a realistic figure.
NevertheLess. on the basis of the Bank's projections, the growth of the
economr and of private investment will continue to be high.
62.         Last year's economic growth is estimated to be over 11%.
A sign of overheating has been seen in the balance of payments position,
which showed current and overall. deficits of US$ 2C)8 million and US$ 95
million, resnpetivelvy during the first half of the vear.  Precautionary
measures have been taken, which include the raising of liquidity requlire-
mennts of commercial banks and of' the Central Bank's lending rate.  How-
ever, the authorities are extremely cautious lest private investment and
industrialization 'h discouraed. At present it appears reasonable to
assume that the present high level of private investment, as evidenced by
the brisck hbsinpzq nf TMT)RT, will continue for the time being.
IMBIIS 1>iinnss Forecast
63         ITMBI has given to t-he mJ.isinn its financial nronictions for
the five years sltarting 1968/69, which are showwn in Annexes 13 through
16. These projections assln-e that I.MiBI -.ril apprcmvr financial assiLs1tante
totalling Rls. 21.2 billion during the period. On a disbursement basi,s,
it will almount+ to RIs. 19 .4 1 biion or 19 o  +ttl. pv '   nvT
projected by the Bank. The rise! in IMDBI's share of total investment
from L5% during the Third Plan does not appear to be unreasonablh, since
its promotion projects have only recently been coming to fruition.
64.         In these projections, IMDBI estimated that its business would
reach RL;3. 4 billionl  in 19681/69 WLId Wuou±ld remain au that level throughout
the period, with a notional increase of Rls. 0.1 billion each year. The
actual result for 1968/69 turned out to be somewhat below the expectatUion,
amounting to Rls. 3,580 million-/. Nevertheless the rise was remarkable
compared with Ris. 2,50 million for the previous year.   Promotions
accounted for Rls. 865 million in 1968/69 compared with Rls. 1,685 million
in 1967/68, and regular applications rose to Ris. 2,715 mili'on from
Rls. 865 million.
65.         Recently, IMDBI has changed its forecast and contends that its
probable approvals during 1969/70 could amount to over Rls. 9 billion as
against the previously projected Rls. 4 billion. Of this Rls. 9 billi.on.
regular applications would amount to only Rus. 1.5 billion, not mucn
more than half those of the previous year.  But IDBI's contention is
that it would carry through all its pending promotions totalling Ris. 5.9
billion for 20 projects within the year, as well as new promotion projects
of nearly Rls. 2 billion.  The reasons for this upward revision of business
expectations are two. IMDBI states that there has recently been considerable
Y Exclu-Lng garantes and     nderwrting aountin      to R/. 228  illion
_/ Excluding guarantees and underwriting amounting to Rls. 228 million,



- 2( -
progress -in several of the projects it has been promoting, and also that
the Government has recently asked it to take over responsibility for
certain petro-chemical projects which were previously conceived to be
public sector projects.
66.       The capacity of IMDBI to complete the processing of all these.
projects in short order is in some question, given the staff lim-tationl
previously referre,d to. However, IIVDBI has been at work on the bulk of
pending promotion projects for some time and further progress towards
their approval by ID-DBI's Board and the commitment of funds to them mainly
depend on the attitude of prospective foreign collaborators.   Wh-at is
therefore chiefly in question is the speed with which foreign collaborators
will make their decisions.  Also, in view of the past experience of INTDBI,
it would still take considerable time for a project to come to fruition,
even after the foreign collaborator has in principle decided to go ahead.
Thus, comTpared with the 12 projects totalling Rls. 3 billion promoted by
IITRI and approved over four years, as mentioned in Paragraph 30, INDBI:As
latest est;imate of prospective business of this kind in the year just begun
appears to be too large.
67.       Bearing in mind these general factors and after reviewing
individual projects under study by I1IDBI, a more realistic estimate is
that IMDBI s approval of promotion projects will be in the order of
Rls. 3 billion representing about 10 projects in each of the years
1969/70 and 1070/71.  This means that promotion projects approved in
the coming two years will be equal in amount to the total of pending
projects.  As regards regular, "walk-in" applications, IMDBIIs present
expectation may turn out to be too pessimistic, in view both of last
year's business and of the current favorable climate. However, given
the general uncertainties in the economy, this could be a realistic
figure as an average for the coming two years. Total approvals would
then be R:!s. 4.5 billion for each of 1969/70 and 1970/71.
68.       The difference between this expectation and the estimates
previously made by IHDBI is not substantial, and does not materially affect
the financial projections previously given by I DBI. However, the increased
proportion of promotion projects would change the composition of commitments,
since promotions usually involve larger equity investments and larger
foreign exchange loans. The revised estimates are shown below in
comparison with those shown in Annex 13:

G9.       nDMlBI has already concluded agreemen4s wit4- 4-th 'DI  Org0nz-t-+n
which provide for Rls. 1,750 million to be made available for its own
operations and RIs. 3,250 mrllion for Managed Fund operaions.   These
amounts, together with IMDBI's own funds including loan collections, etc.
should cover the requirement for Rial resources throughout thre Plan
Period.
70.       On the basis of the revised estimate of commitments shown in
raragraph 68, the position of foreign exchange resources would be as
follows:
(in million dollars)
Available at       New Commitment     Balance (Gap)
Period        Beginning of Period     During Period   At End of Period
Mar. 21, 1969/             6.1                24.0              (17.9)
Mar. 2C, 1970
Mar. 21, 1970/           (17-9)               25.3              (43.2)
Mar. 20, 1971
-In view of the foregoing, a Bank loan of up to US$ 40 million could be
appropriate.  If approved, this should carry IMDBI for about two years.
71.       ]CMDBI has in the past several years relied solely on the Bank
for its foreign exchange requirements.   Since the Government will need
an increasing amount of foreign exchange resources from bilateral aid
for its public investment, IMDBI will probably continue to need Bank
funds for the bulk of its foreign exchange requirement.   Nevertheless,
I"4DBI should be encouraged to develop other sources of external capital
and to seek financial partners for more projects. This should be feasible,
given the strong position of Iran and the good financial prospects of
I1ADBI. This matter has been discussed with IMDBI.
'Financial Prospects
72.       DIDBI's future earnines are orolected in Annex 16.   The
projection is made on conservative assumptions. Operating profits are
expected to arow from Rls. 156 million for 1967/68 to Rls. 182 million,
Rls. 276 million and Rls. 385 million for three years from 1968/69,
respectively. (These are on a before tax and provisions basis.) These
increases are mainly attributable to the growth of total assets.    Profit-
on equity and on shnre cnait-al i.ll declinp for 1968/69 due to the shar'
capital increase, but will recover substantially in the following years.

in the coming year and to approve Rls. 4.5 billion during the succeeding
year, the overall debt/equity ratio wouid rise at tne end of 1970/71 to
more than 10 and the debt/equity ratio as defined by the Bank would be
about at the limit of 4.5.   These would necessitate the strengthening of

period collections on loans are expected to amount to about two times
the CUount c,f repaymllents on debt, and pro-it betore financLal expenses
will be more than two times interest payable. In the long run, these
ratvios would come down but not below 1.5 i A es, assuming the p.resent
pattern of operations.
76.       TIDBI's present policy is to limit the aggregate of its invest-
ments (including commitments for investments) in equity to the amount oI
its net worth, now about Rls. 1.3 billion. It intends to amend its policy
by adding to tnis limit Rls. 0.6 billion, the amount of its subordinated
government advance. IMDBI's reason for wanting to raise its ceiling on
equity investments is that it is promoting a number of projects simultanet-
ously, whichl will involve substantial equity commitments; and the company
does not want the limit to inhibit its ability to make those investments,
even if the bulk of them come to fruition in the near future. IMDBI cannot
be confident- of rolling over substantial parts of its portfolio in the
short run, arid hence must raise the ceiling on aggregate equity investmerits,
if it is not; to slow down.
77.       Raising the ceiling by Rls. 0.6 billion beyond net worth would
not be imprudent.  The quality of INDBI's portfolio is generally sound.
The Government advance is subordinated to all debt and ranks pari passu
with the share capital. It requires no interest payment. The annual
repayments of Rls. 40 million, beginning in 1975, will call for only a
small fraction of expected earnings (which would already amount to about
Rls. 500 million by 1972-73).
VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECODSMNDATIONS
Conclusions
78.       IMiDBI has been successfully promoting its business, taking full.
advantage of the favorable environment that now exists in Iran. Its
outgoine attitude and diversified activities have made it a vital insti-
tution for the industrial development of the country.
79.       The expansion of its business has been so rapid during the past
few vears that somn strengthening nf staff' is now nAeded and anoraisal
and follow-up procedures have to be improved. As the comparative weakness
of staff strength is the refle-1tnri nf thp lack of educated and experienced
human resources in Iran, IiDBI has to-try to improve its work mainly by
training its existing staff.   The able and experienced management should be
able to overcome these shortcomings in the long run.

80.       LXji,gnBIs f.nancial  J.sit,on and proftabV~ -. 'it  are s atisfactoJr,
and its portfolio is generally sound.
81.       The position of local currency resources is comfortable, but
foreign currency resources need replenishmlent.
Recommendations
82.       flvDBI continues to be a suitable recipient for Bank loans.
A Bank loan of up to US$ 40 million is recommended. If approved, it
would probably cover f!ADBI1s foreign exchange requirement for the next
two financial years.
83.       The terms of a new loan should be similar to those applied to
the last loan to IlIDBI, except that, in accordance with the Bankis most
recent policy, the rate of interest should be fixed at the time of approval
by the Executive Directors.
84.       In view of the rapidly growing investment by the Bank in    MEDBl,
the Bank's visits for supervision should be more frequent, possibly twice
a year, and IMDBI should be continually urged to seek additional sources
of external capital.

MATIAGED FUNDS
1. Managed Funds from ICB and BHI
In November 1959, the Government transferred to IMDBI 83 loans
totalling Rls. 1,100 million from the portfolio of its two agencies, the
Industrial Credit Bank (ICB) and Bank Melli Iran (BMI). One loan of
Rls. 93 million was returned in l965- reducing the fund to Rls. 1.307
million.  Up to the end of 1967/68, 62 loans totalling Rls. 982 million
had been comoletelv repnaid.  Collections on managed loans are relent
pro rata with IMDBI's own funds on each new Rial loan made by IMDBI. In
recent months- narticipation by the managed funds in each loan has been
20-25% of the total.
These funds were scheduled to be repayable in seven years
star+ing June 1968, but IITMBI is now negotiating exensions, which it
expects to be granted.
IMDBI receives a fee of 3% per annum on the outstanding amount
of the loans which have not been in defaul,+4 for three mornths or more.  On
the cash balance of the funds, IMDBI pays interest at 1-1/2% per annum.
2. Managed Funds for Lending from Plan Organization
Two funds have been made available from the Plan Organization
for lenrding, one for Rls. 250 m llLon given in Janua-y 1966 and another
for Rls. 2,000 million given in December 1968. Disbursements are made
in instalments and repayments are to be made i0 years after disbursements.
IIMBI can grant the whole or part of any loan it makes out of these funds.
IMDBI receives a fee of 3% per annum on loans out of the
interest it collects.  No interest is payable on the cash balance Of
these funds.
3. Equity Funds from Plan Organization
IMDBI has received two funds from the Plan Organization for
investing in share capital, one for Rls. 900 million given in June 1964
and another for Rls. 1,250 million given in December 1968. A major
portion of each fund is earmarked for equity investment in new, large
companies in the strategic industries and the rest for equity in existing
but faltering companies.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Unlike the other managed funds, ITDBI has to apply to the
Plan Organization for approval of each equity investment, which, in
practice. is eiven automatically. Upon aDproval, IMDBI receives funds
and disburses when called upon. IlDBI is obliged to try to sell those
shares (with the consent of the Plan Organization and at prevailing
market prices) within five years from the date of each investment. The
proceeds from such sales are to be returned to the Plan Organization.
IT@BI recrives a fee of 1-1/2% per annum on investments, nppvqhl
only from dividends received and capital gains realized.

Assumptions: 1. Rates of interest and Lees receivable anu payable are
based on current rates.
2.  LIwIBUi has proposed a conservative estimate of interestl
and fees receivable to cover defaults (7% deduction on
rial loans and 5% deduction on foreign exchange loans).
This is followed. in the above table.
3. Provisions for losses are disregarded.



ANNEX 1.6
Page 2
4. Taxable income is profit after deduction of
(ij dividends from approved industries (50% assumed);
(ii) 15% for registration with Stock Exchange; and
(iii) dividends declared.
Tax rates are 25, on the first Rls. 100 million and 50%
on the balance.
5.  Profit before tax as shown above is operating profit
plus capital gains. In INDBI's financial statement as
