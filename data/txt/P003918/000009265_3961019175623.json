The overall objective of the RE I project was to\n            support the development and implementation of an efficient\n            rural electrification program in Indonesia. Overall, the\n            Bank's performance has been highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower Performance was satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows: (a) effective strategy for\n            increasing the efficiency of RE I delivery and its\n            developmental impact is to incorporate in programs that will\n            directly help increase local participation; and (b) to\n            facilitate that State Electricity Corporation achieves rural\n            electrification delivery in an efficient and least cost\n            manner, it is necessary to establish transparency and\n            financial accountability for the rural electrification program."}, "docdt": "1995-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
