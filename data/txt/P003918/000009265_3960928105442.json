The project will consist of two\n            components : a) PLN - involving implementation of the RE\n            investment program which includes construction of 33,00 kmc\n            of MV and LV power lines, installation of 571,000 kVA\n            transformer capacity and the connection of 1.3 million new\n            consumers; b) MOC - development of an action plan to\n            strengthen village cooperatives; institutional development\n            of MOC which includes an organizational and management\n            study; and training for relevant MOC staff."}, "docdt": "1990-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
