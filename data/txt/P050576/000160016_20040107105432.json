Some of the lessons learned include:\n            While Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs) are designed to\n            be exploratory instruments, objectives must be precise in\n            order to obtain interpretable results. A strong monitoring\n            system and rigorous evaluation are indispensable to derive\n            useful lessons for future interventions. If the purpose of\n            LIL is experimentation, careful consideration must be given\n            to project duration as 3 years is very short to elicit and\n            measure behavior change. A participatory approach including\n            all key actors and potential beneficiaries, particularly\n            peers, school teachers and parents increases the\n            effectiveness and impact of youth services and activities,\n            by ensuring relevance, ownership and accountability.\n            Participatory approaches to design and implementation of\n            programs are feasible but need to be carefully directed and\n            focused on clear objectives. The role of participation needs\n            to be stated up front. To be effective, service integration\n            implies a break with past service delivery paradigms,\n            considerable coordination and joint planning, and a process\n            of learning by doing. Building local capacity of Municipal\n            Governments to execute subprojects and having municipalities\n            contribute with a share of the subproject financing proved\n            effective. It ensured the relevance of the intervention in\n            the local context, promoted ownership, facilitated a\n            decentralized learning process, and contributed to the\n            sustainability of improved youth activities and services.\n            Interventions seeking to change youth's aspirations and\n            behavior require a much longer time frame.  Youth enter\n            programs with different vulnerabilities, a factor which\n            affects the extent to which they can benefit from a less\n            individualized approach. Youth with lower risk backgrounds\n            can benefit more fully from the type of services that can be\n            offered to youth as a group. However, in cases of youth with\n            higher risks/problems, a more costly individualized approach\n            will be necessary. Efforts must be made to identify risks\n            early on to ensure youth receive the appropriate care.\n            Although reproductive health/sexuality issues do not\n            generally surface as one of the key problems that concern\n            youth, once the problems of employment and violence are\n            being addressed, they gain importance. Programs addressing\n            youth should not assume youth are already organized.\n            Subprojects delivering school or training center based\n            interventions were able to work with a semi-captive\n            audience. However, subprojects working to reduce street\n            violence had no \"institutional\" home and had to\n            rely on youth organizations. However, it was incorrect to\n            assume youth would necessarily be organized, and much less,\n            organized for community change. Nonetheless, schools are\n            ideal vehicles to deliver youth services and promote youth\n            activities involving students and out-of-school youth."}, "docdt": "2003-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
