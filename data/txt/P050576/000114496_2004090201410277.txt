Re:

Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sirs:
We refer to the Loan Agreement between Republic of Colombia (the Borrower) and 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated August 12, 
1998, with respect to the above-captioned Loan. Said Loan Agreement has been already 
amended by the letter from the Bank dated September 27, 2000 (the First Amendment), 
countersigned by Republic of Colombia on October 13, 2000. A copy of said letter is 
attached hereto as Annex C.
We are pleased to inform you of our agreement to amend again the original Loan 
Agreement as amended by the First Amendment (the Second Amendment), as indicated in 
Attachment A to this letter (double-underlined text in bold in such attachment 
represents language added by the Second Amendment and crossed-out text in such 
attachment represents language deleted by the amendments accepted to the First 
Amendment. With the same technique, we have shown in attachment B hereto, the language 
added by the First Amendment to the original Loan Agreement and the language deleted 
therefrom by said First Amendment.  Consequently, as a result of the First Amendment, 
and of the Second Amendment we are proposing now to you, (as shown in the Attachment 
A), the Loan Agreement, with the consolidation of the two amendments, will now read in 
its entirety as set forth in Attachment D to this letter.
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the two originals of this letter in the space provided below, and returning one to us. 
The Second Amendment shall enter into effect as of its date first above-written, upon 
receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed by you.

SCHEDULE 5
Implementation Program
1.
The Borrower, through the Vice Ministry or Colombia Joven, as the case may be, 
shall:
(a)
maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable the monitoring and 
evaluation of the carrying out of the Project and the achievement of the objectives 
thereof, on the basis of an ongoing review of indicators, discussed with and 
acceptable to the Bank, and which have been included in the respective Subproject 
proposal and may be amended from time to time with the approval of the Bank; 
(b)
prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish 
to the Bank, on or about June 30 in each year, a report integrating the results of the 
lessons  learned and the monitoring and evaluation activities performed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this Section, on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the 
Project during the period preceding the date of said report and setting out the 
measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the Project and the 
achievement of the objectives thereof during the period following such date; and
(c)
review with the Bank, by September 30 in each year, or such later date as 
the Bank shall request, the report referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section, and, 
thereafter, take all measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the 
Project and the achievement of the objectives thereof, based on the conclusions and 
recommendations of the said report and the Bank views on the matter.
2. 
The Borrower has conducted an initial preselection of a group of 16 
Municipalities (Pre-selected Municipalities) based on: (a) population size, where 
priority was given to Municipalities with larger areas where Project impact may be 
substantial; (b) need (e.g. incidence of poverty); and (c) demonstration that they 
Page  17
possess the required technical ability to discharge their respective obligations for 
purposes  of the carrying out of Part B of the Project. Out of the Pre-selected 
Municipalities, not more than eight of such Municipalities shall be selected as 
demonstration sites under the Project, after being determined by the Borrower as the 
Pre-selected Municipalities having the best potential to pilot test the new 
participatory and integrated approach to working with youth (Selected Municipalities). 
Such determination shall be made by a technical group in the Ministry of Education and 
a committee comprised of representatives of various stakeholders, including 
representatives from the Borrowers Ministries of Health and Culture and Employment, 
DNP and the national confederation of non-governmental organizations, on the basis of 
proposals to be submitted by the Pre-selected Municipalities to the Vice Ministry or 
Colombia Joven, as the case may be, and addressing the following key criteria: 
diagnosis of key issue(s) affecting youth; integrated and participatory approach; 
financial and technical viability; and sustainability. The remaining eight 
Pre-selected Municipalities would have access to information generated by the learning 
network to be established under Part A. 2 of the Project. Each of the Selected 
Municipalities shall, through its authorities or the corresponding Municipal Committee 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Manual, choose an area, rural or urban, 
within the jurisdiction of the Selected Municipality in question (Selected Local Area) 
where, or in respect of which, the activities under Part B of the Project related to 
such Selected Municipality shall take place. 
3.
The Borrower shall prepare, for purposes of paragraph (b) of Section 6.01 of 
this Agreement, a model to be used for entering into each Municipality Agreement. Once 
that model has been adopted by the Vice Ministry or Colombia Joven, as the case may be
, in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, the Borrower shall follow it without 
introducing, to the extent possible, changes therein. Without prejudice to the 
preceding provisions, the Borrower shall seek the approval of the Bank in respect of 
each modification that the Borrower, or the Managerial Entity or the Selected 
Municipality in question, may  wish to introduce to said model in connection with the 
corresponding Municipality Agreement before the execution and delivery thereof. 
4.
Once a Municipality has been selected for purposes of participating in the 
Project, following the procedures, criteria and guidelines provided for in the 
Operational Manual, the Managerial Entity shall, as agent of the Borrower, enter with 
such Selected Municipality into an agreement on terms and conditions which, unless 
otherwise agreed by the Bank, shall not depart in substance, in the opinion of the 
Bank, from the Model. Each such agreement shall be acknowledged and approved by the 
Borrower, through the Vice Ministry or Colombia Joven, as the case may be, and shall 
obligate the Managerial Entity to request prior approval of the head of the Unit and 
of the Bank before departing, in a substantial way, from such Model.
5.
Unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, the Borrower shall ensure that at all 
times during Project execution: (a) the number of Selected Municipalities, with which 
the Managerial Entity shall have entered into the corresponding Subsidiary Agreement 
shall not be higher than eight; and (b) each such Selected Municipality shall maintain 
only one Selected Local Area as demonstration site within such Municipality for 
purposes of Part B of the Project.
