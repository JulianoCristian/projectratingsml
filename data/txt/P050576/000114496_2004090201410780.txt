SCHEDULE 5
Implementation Program
1.
The Borrower, through the Vice-Ministry shall:
(a)
maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and 
Page  16
evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators provided for in the 
Manual, acceptable to the Bank, the carrying out of the Project and the achievement of 
the objectives thereof;
(b)
prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish 
to the Bank, on or about June 30 in each year, a report integrating the results of the 
lessons  learned and the monitoring and evaluation activities performed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this Section, on the progress achieved in the carrying out of the 
Project during the period preceding the date of said report and setting out the 
measures recommended to ensure the efficient carrying out of the Project and the 
achievement of the objectives thereof during the period following such date; and
(c)
review with the Bank, by September 30 in each year, or such later date as 
the Bank shall request, the report referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section, and, 
thereafter, take all measures required to ensure the efficient completion of the 
Project and the achievement of the objectives thereof, based on the conclusions and 
recommendations of the said report and the Bank views on the matter.
2. 
The Borrower has conducted an initial preselection of a group of 16 
Municipalities (Pre-selected Municipalities) based on: (a) population size, where 
priority was given to Municipalities with larger areas where Project impact may be 
substantial; (b) need (e.g. incidence of poverty); and (c) demonstration that they 
possess the required technical ability to discharge their respective obligations for 
purposes  of the carrying out of Part B of the Project. Out of the Pre-selected 
Municipalities, not more than eight of such Municipalities shall be selected as 
demonstration sites under the Project, after being determined by the Borrower as the 
Pre-selected Municipalities having the best potential to pilot test the new 
participatory and integrated approach to working with youth (Selected Municipalities). 
Such determination shall be made by a technical group in the Ministry of Education and 
a committee comprised of representatives of various stakeholders, including 
representatives from the Borrower’s Ministries of Health and Culture and Employment, 
DNP and the national confederation of non-governmental organizations, on the basis of 
proposals to be submitted by the Pre-selected Municipalities to the Vice Ministry and 
addressing the following key criteria: diagnosis of key issue(s) affecting youth; 
integrated and participatory approach; financial and technical viability; and 
sustainability. The remaining eight Pre-selected Municipalities would have access to 
information generated by the learning network to be established under Part A. 2 of the 
Project. Each of the Selected Municipalities shall, through its authorities or the 
corresponding Municipal Committee and in accordance with the provisions of the Manual, 
choose an area, rural or urban, within the jurisdiction of the Selected Municipality 
in question (Selected Local Area) where, or in respect of which, the activities under 
Part B of the Project related to such Selected Municipality shall take place. 
3.
The Borrower shall prepare, for purposes of paragraph (b) of Section 6.01 of 
this Agreement, a model to be used for entering into each Municipality Agreement. Once 
that model has been adopted by the Vice-Ministry in form and substance satisfactory to 
the Bank, the Borrower shall follow it without introducing, to the extent possible, 
changes therein. Without prejudice to the preceding provisions, the Borrower shall 
seek the approval of the Bank in respect of each modification that the Borrower, or 
the Managerial Entity or the Selected Municipality in question, may  wish to introduce 
to said model in connection with the corresponding Municipality Agreement before the 
execution and delivery thereof. 
4.
Once a Municipality has been selected for purposes of participating in the 
Project, following the procedures, criteria and guidelines provided for in the 
Operational Manual, the Managerial Entity shall, as agent of the Borrower, enter with 
such Selected Municipality into an agreement on terms and conditions which, unless 
otherwise agreed by the Bank, shall not depart in substance, in the opinion of the 
Bank, from the Model. Each such agreement shall be acknowledged and approved by the 
Borrower, through the Vice-Ministry, and shall obligate the Managerial Entity to 
request prior approval of the head of the Unit and of the Bank before departing, in a 
substantial way, from such Model.
5.
Unless otherwise agreed with the Bank, the Borrower shall ensure that at all 
times during Project execution: (a) the number of Selected Municipalities, with which 
the Managerial Entity shall have entered into the corresponding Subsidiary Agreement 
shall not be higher than eight; and (b) each such Selected Municipality shall maintain 
Page  17
only one Selected Local Area as demonstration site within such Municipality for 
purposes of Part B of the Project.
