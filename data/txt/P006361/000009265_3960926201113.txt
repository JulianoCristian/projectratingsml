MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.       The followlng memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federative Republic of Brazil for US$300 million is submitted for
approval. The prrposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable intre st rate and help finance an agricultural credit project.
2.       Background.  All credit in Brazil is of two major types: official,
which is interest rate-controlled and administratively allocated; and
commercial, which is voluntarily supplied at market determined rates.
Official (subsidized) credit comprises the bulk (nearly 90Z) of all farm
credit today. Historically, farm credit in Brazil has been a subsidized
activity. Strong political constituencies have supported these subsidies.
The main sources of this official credit to farmers have been:
(i) Government resources channelled mainly through the federal coumercial
bank -- Bank of Brazil (BB); (ii) the discount facilities of the Central
Bank (CB), often with assistance from bilateral and multilateral funds;
(iii) compulsory applications, which require all commercial banks
(government and private) to apply a fixed percentage of their sight
(demand) deposits to official rural credit; and (iv) more recently (since
1987), the interest-bearing rural savings deposits held in BB and a few
other federal and regional banks. The availability of subsidized credit
has not only adversely affected resource allocation decisions and imposed a
significant fiscal burden on the Government, but contrary to stated
objectives, it has not bencfited the small farmers.
3.       Faced with majox fiscal problems and unable to sustain large farm
credit subsidies, the Government is prepared to undertake agricultural
credit reforms and has asked tr.e Bank for assistance in implementing a
strategy aimed at shifting dependence from official to commercial credit,
while gradually limiting the former to specifically well targeted and
justitis; cases.  The Government, in support of this strategy, has already
begun implementing a three-year program (1988-1990) to contract the supply
of official credit to the agricultural vector, including agro-industries.
The main features of this program include real reductions in official
credit, which in 1990 compared to 1987 (a year in which official credit had
already been substantially cut in real terms) amount to 222 for total long-
term (investment) rural credit, 12Z for total short-term (inputs and
marketing) rural credit, 192 for agro-industrial investment credit supplied
by the federally-owned National Economic Social Development Bank (BNDES),
and the complete elimination of the Government's discount facility for
supplying subsidized agro-industrial credit.  The Government's own
contributions to long- and short-term official rural credit are planned to
be cut by 80X and 15X, respectively. This program will be updated
annually, with a view to achieving deeper cuts, and is intended to become a
three-year rolling plan, aimed eventually at limiting official credit only



-2 
to those special cases which can be well justified and targeted.
Furthermore, in its efforts to exercise greater control over the supply of
official credit, the Government recently enacted a decree which transfers
the management of all official credit lines to the Treasury (STN). 1I
addition, all such credit lines will now be included in the Government's
fiscal budget -- a measure aimed in part at more effectively controlling,
as well as increasing the transparency of credit subsidies.
4.       Rationale for Bank Invclvement.  The Bank's overall strategy in
Brazil is to support macroeconomic adjustments that contribute to
sustainable economic growth. An important element in that strategy is the
reduction of the fiscal deficit, which is needed to control inflation,
restore business confidence and provide a generally favorable investment
climate. The proposed operation, which is the first step towards
implementing a strategy to replace most subsidized farm credit with
commercial lending at market rates should contribute substantially to
reducing the fiscal deficit as well as to improving the efficiency of
investment decisions. Because of the politically sensitive nature of farm
credit, the Bank's involvement in this process can be particularly
beneficial in helping the Government maintain a consistent policy course in
the face of continued pressures from interest groups.
5.       It is envisaged that future Bank support for credit in the
agricultural sector would come through a single credit line.  While the
proposed project does discontinue the practice of earmarking credit for
particular farmers or investment purposes, and, therefore, moves
significantly in the,direction of consolidating credit markets, it still
reserves the funds for farm investment. Another proposed operation (the
Fourth Agro-Industries Credit Project), having a similar design, provides a
line of credit to agro-industries. These two projects, therefore,
constitute an interim step towards eventually providing a single credit
line for the agricultural sector.  This interim step is needed at this
stage to consolidate and build up support for a commercial approach to farm
credit following a long historical legacy to the contrary. After the
proposed project is firmly on track and commercial credit begins to replace
official credit, the Bank is planning to merge all its support for
agricultural credit into a single credit line to support the Government's
objective of integrating credit markets in the agricultural sector.
Together the proposed project and the Fourth Agro-Industries Credit project
represent an important part of Brazil's attempt to reform its financial
sector, an endeavor in which the Bank is integrally involved.
6.       Pro4ect ObJectives.  The main objectives of the project are to
support productive on-farm investments and to initiate the process of
liberalizing farm credit. The project is part of a credit strategy aimed
at having Brazil's relatively well developed commercial banking system meet
most of the agricultural sector's credit requirements at market-determined
rates, while simultaneously contracting the supply of official credit.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project would be the first
Bank-assisted free-standing farm credit project in Brazil. The Bank has
financed farm credit in Brazil before but only as components in larger
projects. Furthermore, that assistance has always been provided through
the official credit system (i.e., at controlled interest rates). Under the



-3
proposed project, credit funds would be channeled through the full banking
system on totally commercial terms.
8.       Under the project, Bank loan funds would be used by the Government
to refinance subloans made by accredited osrticipating banks (PBs) to
farmers and farm contractors to finance the latter's investment and
associated working capita8 requirements. The terms on which the Government
would refinance these subloans have been designed to enable the Government
to recover from the PBs the full costs of obtaining and administering the
Bank loan. The onlending terms to final subborrowers would be a market
outcome as these would be the result of negotiations between the PBs and
their customers. All banks in Brazil which are accredited by the Central
Bank (CB) as being financially sound and having the appropriate loan
appraisallmanagement capability would be eligible to participate as PBs.
The Bank's funds would finance up to 501 of subproject investment and
associated working capital costs, with the balance being freely negotiated
between the PB and the subborrower. No Government counterpart funds would
be used. With a Bank loan of US$300 million, the total cost of the project
would be US$600 million. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.
9.       It is estimated that annual on-farm investment over the next
several years would be at least US$3 billion and could be considerably
higher if the country's microeconomic situation improves as expected.  In
this context, the demand for farm investment credit should be in the order
of at least US$1.5 billion per annum. The size of the proposed Bank loan
to support an investaient credit line for farmers has been dimensioned
accordingly.
10.      Loan funds are expected to be disbursed over a five-year project
implementation period. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. The
main management function would be provided by the PBs, which would review
and approve subloan applications and monitor investment and repayment
performance after the subloans are given. STN would manage the refinancing
of subloans and be responsible for overall monitoring and coordination of
the project. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7199-BR, dated May 23, 1988,
is attached.
11.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained on
the following actions: (a) the Government would prepare and submit to the
Bank quarterly reports on the status of implementation of its program to
contract official credit to the agricultural sector and meet with the Bank
on an annual basis to review and update this program; (b) the CB would
accredit PBs on the basis of agreed criteria with respect to financial
soundness and loan appraisal/management capability; (c) below a free limit
of US$1.0 million, PBs would be solely responsible for approving subloans
for refinancing; subloans at or above that limit would require the approval
of the Bank; (d) refinancing terms would be set in order to enable the
Government to recover from the PBs the full costs of the Bank loan, plus
administrative costs; and (e) agreed internal procedures for disbursing
credit funds to PBs and for repaying the Government would be adopted.

12.      Benefits.  The major benefits that would derive from the project
are the reduced fiscal burden and improved efficiency in reeource
allocation resulting from the liberalization of credit and the net value of
additional primary production stimulated by the availability of credit.
13.      Risks.  At present the demand fcr investment farm credit, as for
most investment credit, although positive and potentially high, is
depressed due to the uncertain economic environment. However, these
factors were taken into account in determitring the size of the loan.
Furthermore, recent Government commitments to reducing the fiscal deficit,
in its efforts to stabilize the economy, and the renewed dialogue with IMF
are encouraging signs. Another risk is possible competition from official
subsidized credit which could also reduce the demand for the project's
commercial credit funds; however, the Government is committed to reducing
the supply of official credit to the agricultural sector and has begun to
implement a program to this end. This program would be carefully monitored
and the Bank would meet with the Government on an annual basis to review
and update the program (para. 3).
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Procurement and Disbursements
Procurement:  The range of goods to be financed under the project would be
varied.  Vehicles and computers, being reserve procurement, would be
exeluded from Bank financing. In the case of most subprojects, the items to
be financel under the project would not be suitable for bulk procurement.
AC"ordingly, procurement for most subprojects would be in accordance with
st&ndard practice for loans of this type and would follow the normal
commercial practice of private sector enterprises -- the ultimate
beneficiaries of the proposed loan. The possibility of packaging contracts
large enough to attract foreign bidders is extremely unlikely;
nevertheless, to allow for this possibility, international competitive
bidding procedures would apply in the case of contracts of US$3 million or
more. Brazilian contractors and suppliers would receive a 152 preference
over foreign suppliers.
