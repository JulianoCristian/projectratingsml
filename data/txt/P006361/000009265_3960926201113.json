Under the project, bank loans will be used by the\n            Government to refinance subloans made by participating banks\n            to farmers and farm contractors to finance the latter's\n            investment and working capital requirements. Unlike the\n            administrative allocation of official rural credit to\n            particular crops, regions or groups of producers, the\n            application of project funds will be determined by market\n            demand based on producers' estimates of returns on investments."}, "docdt": "1988-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
