 increase population access to public water supplies; to\n            improve the efficiency of water supplies and strengthen the\n            Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC).  To that end, the\n            project entails (a) expanding water supply facilities; (b)\n            tranmission and distribution systems; (c) rehabilitation of\n            existing systems; (d) administrative infrastructure; and (e)\n            institutional support.  On implementation, the project will\n            improve the present water supply to many of the 2.9 million\n            (1985) people presently served.  Most importantly, the level\n            of access will increase to 6.51 million people in 1995 or\n            from 47 percent to 65 percent of the population."}, "docdt": "1988-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
