Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Lagos State Water Supply Project of the\n            Republic of Nigeria. The project objectives were to: (a)\n            increase population      access to public water supplies by\n            doubling production capacity and more than doubling the\n            number of direct connections;( b) eliminate recurrent\n            subvention from the Lagos State Government ( LASG) to Lagos\n            State Water Corporation( LSWC) for recurrent expenditures;\n            and (c) strengthen LSWC including its management, operations\n            and maintenance training facilities and programs, manpower\n            development, accountability, economic efficiency, financial\n            performance and future viability. Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) pressures to\n            come up with estimates at the time of project appraisal on\n            indicators such as unaccounted-for-water(u -f-w), number of\n            existing connections etc lead to the creation of weak\n            databases from which to forecast expectations; (ii)\n            expectations for project startup should be carefully made in\n            line with an implementing agency's prior experience\n            with Bank projects; (iii) very weak institutions should be\n            assisted incrementally with projects that are modest in\n            design and objectives; (iv) close attention needs to be\n            given to consumer connections and customer management in\n            project design to ensure adequate cash flows; and (v) the\n            question of continuity in leadership and management of water\n            authorities needs to be addressed at the state and federal levels."}, "docdt": "1998-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
