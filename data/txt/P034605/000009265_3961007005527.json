supporting the\n            financial and private sector, and to facilitate the\n            effective implementation of policy measures supported by the\n            private sector development adjustment credit. The project\n            will achieve these objectives through the following\n            components. The first component will seek to strengthen\n            financial sector operation and regulation through: a)\n            support to the Central Bank in banking supervision through\n            regulatory advice, training and equipment; b) support the\n            Central Bank in improving monetary management through\n            assistance in developing procedures and related staff\n            training; and c) support in restructuring of state-owned\n            financial institutions. The second component seeks, through\n            privatization, to transfer public ownership of a majority of\n            public enterprises to private hands and in this manner, to\n            also stimulate investment. The third component aims to\n            strengthen the business environment through support to the\n            Office of GO-INVEST (the Guyana Office Investment) with\n            training of staff to help simplify procedures for foreign\n            investors, and b) consultant support in the development of\n            regulations under the Companies Act and training of staff of\n            the Registry of Companies to strengthen its capacity to\n            implement this Act."}, "docdt": "1994-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
