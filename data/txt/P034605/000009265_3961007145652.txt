GUYANA - FINANCIAL SECTOR AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX - THE PROJECT
Introduction
1.          The objective of the Financial Sector and Business Environment (FISBEC) Project is to
establish an appropriate regulatory framework in the financial sector, and to encourage private sector
development, through assistance in (a) the strengthening of banking supervision and monetary
management functions, (b) privatization of public enterprises, and (c) facilitating foreign and domestic
investment in Guyana. The total project cost is estimated at US$ 4.0 million, of which, up to US$ 3.5
million would be financed through an IDA Credit and US$ 0.5 million would be funded by the
Government of Guyana. Based on discussions with other cofinancing sources during appraisal, some of
the project costs would likely be financed from other sources, namely the IMF and the U.K. The figures
shown in the cost tables below are therefore provisional and will be confirmed once the availability of
cofinanced funding is firmed up. The project would cover a three-year period, and would be completed
by end-1997.
Strengthening Banking Supervision
Background and Sector Strategy
2.           Supervision of the financial system  had been very limited until an institutional
strengthening program in the Banking Supervision Department (BSD) of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) was
initiated with IMF support in 1991. Inspection had been infrequent, reporting limited, scrutiny of
information provided and account reconciliation limited, and staff largely untrained. Moreover, the
supervisory capacity via the Cooperative Financial Institutions Act (COFA) has been limited to exercising
some input through positions in the management of individual institutions. Accomplishments since 1991
include: (a) development of improved information submission from commercial banks to the BOG for
purposes of tracking prudential variables; (b) development of a performance tracking system for offsite
analysis; (c) review of the 20 largest borrowers in each institution; (d) initiation of one round of credit
portfolio examinations in each institution, with loan classification in accordance with the criteria proposed
by the Center for Economic Studies in Latin America and the Caribbean; (e) completion of 3 full-scope
inspections: (f) recruitment of approximately half of the staff needed for the BSD, and (g) on-the-job and
external training of staff.
3.           The draft Financial Institutions Act (FIA) to be presented to Parliament would broaden
BOG authority to include all deposit-taking institutions, strengthen BOG's regulatory authority, mandate
minimum capital requirements and impose prudential standards including, inter alia, capital adequacy
requirements, limits on lending concentration, and limits on lending to related parties. Two fundamental
effects of the implementation of the Act would be the expansion in the scope of prudential regulations
applied and a similar expansion in the scope of institutions subject to BOG authority. The Government
has agreed to pass and begin implementation of the FIA prior to negotiations of the Private Sector
Development Adjustment Credit (PSDAC). In the draft Letter of Development Policy (LDP) of the
PSDAC, the Government would agree to strengthen the institutional capacity of the BOG.
4.           In order to ensure public confidence in the financial system and encourage efficient
financial intermediation, the program for institutional strengthening of the BOG's supervisory capacity
will be continued and expanded, including expansion of supervision to select non-bank financial
institutions in accordance with the revised FIA. To strengthen banking supervision on a sustainable basis,

mechanisms for retaining qualified staff are under consideration, such as salary enhancement. In addition,
the continuity of this function would also need to be strengthened and eventually be made self-sustainable
via the establishment of banking supervision fees charged to financial institutions. These fees are aimed
at compensating the Government for the considerable oversight and risk identification/amelioration
responsibilities benefitting the banking sector as a whole, and would also be used to cover credit risk
information services provided to banks, as would be available once the central credit risk system was
established under the project.  In the meantime, BOG has set out a long term  budget plan for
implementation in BSD, with a substantial staffing complement of 18 individuals.
Technical Assistance Requirements
5.            Technical Assistance for the BSD will support a three-year program  to strengthen
supervision, including the following:
* A Banking Supervision Policy Advisor would continue to provide guidance in the development of
prudential norms through implementing regulations and circulars, develop prudential criteria for a
surveillance system with reports based on CAMEL indicators and industry and sectoral analyses; assist
in strengthening the management of BSD; and assist in the specific responsibilities of the BSD
including licensing of new institutions.
* An Operational Advisor and Inspector/Trainer would train staff in on-site and off-site examination
techniques including credit evaluation, account reconciliation, risk concentration and collateral
assessment.  Such individual would lead and provide guidance in general and specific on-site
examinations and in off-site operating procedures;
* A Legal Advisor would be engaged on a short-term basis to assist in the drafting of implementing
regulations;
* Overseas Courses would be used to supplement on-the-job training provided to staff by the two
advisors above, including the course program offered by the Federal Reserve of the U.S. and the
Center for Economic Studies of Latin America and the Caribbean;
* Select financing would be available for office equipment--desktop computers for offsite analysis, laptop
computers for onsite analysis, a laser printer and a fax machine; and
* The BSD will install a Credit Risk qualification system, whereby the outstanding credits by individual
exposure (individuals and companies) would be centralized across the financial system.  Such
information would not only greatly assist in prudential control of the financial system -- select
dissemination of the exposure of individual clients would also assist banks in managing their own
prudential risks. A specialized consultant and a desktop computer with significant capacity, application
software and specialized training would be financed for this purpose.
Cost Estimate
6.            The total estimated cost of the program  outlined below is US$ 996,800 of which
US$ 966,800 would be financed under the Credit. Potential IMF financing would likely fund about
US$ 200,000 of these costs.
Support to Strengthen Monetary Management
Background and Sector Strategy
7.            The IMF has to date provided significant support to the BOG in monetary management.
In April, 1993 a Technical Assistance Mission of the Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department
conducted an in-depth assessment of these specific needs and carried out a follow-up mission in January-

Supervision Department of the Bank of Guyana (US$)   provided support for an advisor to the
Research Department from 1990-
1993, is currently supporting a

Credit Risk Sys. & Advisor  70,500              70,500   also includes measures to improve the
Computers/Equip./Sys.      62,100               62,100   tender process and to improve the
Total               996,800    30,000   966,800   overall treasury management through
the  introduction  of  longer-term
instruments. Most important, the report indicates a process for initiating fluid and transparent open-
market operations and strengthening foreign exchange market integration through the establishment of
a foreign exchange trading unit.
Technical Assistance Requirements
8.            The Project would support assistance by two short term consultants with experience in
monetary management to work with the Central Bank's Research Department according to the strategy
developed with IMF assistance. The individuals' Terms of Reference would be to:
* Develop open market operations within a monetary programming framework, and establish a money
market unit with front office (dealer) functions and back office support;  develop systems and
procedures for Treasury Bill tenders, as well as secondary markets in T-Bills and other money market
instruments, and communication of such procedures to market participants;
* Develop and implement a schedule for the use of a separated portfolio of Treasury Bills for monetary
policy objectives, and develop improved monetary forecasting and reserve money programming
techniques; and
* Develop improved procedures, and train BOG staff in money and capital markets, and foreign
exchange trading.
9.            Consultant advice and training would be carried out through visits by experts on short-
term contracts. Selected office and computer equipment would be financed to enhance the execution and
analytical support for the above functions. The expected outcomes would include training of staff,
operationalizing the afore-mentioned processes, and preparing detailed manuals and technical guidelines
delineating implementation steps for carrying out and sustaining the above procedures.
Cost Estimate
10.          The estimated cost of the program outlined below is US$ 102,000 which would be
financed under the Credit. Potential identified IMF financing would likely cover about $30,000 of these
costs.

11.   Guyana's banking system has until  Item              Total    Counter-  Proposed
recently been dominated by State-owned                     Cost      part    for IDA
institutions.    The  Guyana  National                             Financed    Credit
Cooperative Bank (GNCB), established by   Dev. of Open
the Government in 1970, holds 55% of the    Market Oper.    51,700              51,700
deposit accounts in the country. GNCB has   Foreign Exchg.
faced significant difficulties including large    Operations  43,300            43,300
portfolio  losses   despite  repeated   Equipment           7,000                7,000
recapitalization.  Most important, GNCB
has suffered from a small level of earning    t
assets when compared to its large and
increasing deposit base. In 1990 the Government installed new management at GNCB and took measures
to financially and operationally restructure the institution. The institution has suffered from weak credit
control procedures, information systems and a potentially overdimensioned infrastructure. While GNCB
again faced severe losses in 1992, it returned to profitability in late 1993. The tightening of credit
procedures addressed many of the worst abuses. While the Government has initiated measures to improve
loan recovery, GNCB requires further financial and operational restructuring in order to place it on a
viable footing while seeking to minimize the fiscal exposure which the Government faces to cover
depositors and maintain depositor confidence.
12.          The Guyana Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (GAIBANK) was
established as a development bank to provide credit and related advisory services for agricultural and
industrial projects. The institution has been prohibited from taking public deposits, and funded its lending
from donor funds, and more recently from Government resources and loan recoveries. Loan conditions
generally reflected the specified conditions mandated by the agency lending funds to GAIBANK. It has
had seven branches and 277 employees. GAIBANK has experienced severe financial difficulties, owing
primarily to the poor quality of its loan portfolio. The latter has reflected fluctuations in the spread
between its borrowing and lending rates, sharp changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities from
exchange rate depreciation, and problem loans.
13.          While GAIBANK has not suffered from high administrative costs, it has been very
inefficient. It reduced its branch network in 1992 from eight to seven branches and reduced the size of
selected branches. GAIBANK began a process of restructuring in 1990, including staff reductions and
improvements in operating procedures. A capital injection of G$100 million was provided in 1991 to pull
GAIBANK out of its negative equity position. However, the restructuring process did not go far enough.
A team of consultants was scheduled to begin development of a restructuring plan in early 1992, but
never started work. In early 1993, measures were adopted to monitor and improve loan recovery,
including improved tracking of loan arrears.
14.          The Government has agreed prior to negotiations of the PSDAC to announce the merger
of GNCB and GAIBANK into a new institution. The institution would be commercially run and would
undertake first-tier development banking only through a special window financed directly from the
treasury and managed as an off-balance sheet agency account. An Action Plan for the merged institution
has been agreed-to in the context of the PSDAC and progress has already been achieved in beginning the
classification and segregation of the loan portfolios, and the completion of 1993 audits for both
institutions. In addition, the capitalization and financial structure of the Loan Recovery Agency (see



- 5 -
below) will need to take into account the level of non-performing loans which it can administer while
simultaneously allowing the merged bank to function within a viable financial structure with positive net
worth and net earnings.
15.           Loan Recovery Unit. The Government has agreed to establish a Loan Recovery Unit
which would be expected to pursue loan recovery measures including negotiation with client parties
(according to guidelines to be established at start-up) and to initiate legal action for: (i) judgement against
loan collateral; (ii) judgement against a business' or individual's cash flow; and/or (iii) judgement against
other assets securing loan. Moreover, such Unit would be charged with tendering assets received in loan
recoveries through a process to be established upon start-up. Finally, the Unit would be charged with
maintaining up-to-date accounts and, where loans have been renegotiated, to maintain vigilance over
collections.
16.                  For other public sector financial institutions, the Government intends to implement
reform measures including privatizations where appropriate, as set out in its Policy Framework Paper for
1994-1996. For those institutions earmarked for privatization, technical assistance under the Privatization
Unit component (described below) would be provided.
Technical Assistance Requirements
17.           Under the Government's plan to merge GNCB and GAIBANK, and within the framework
of policy measures specified under the PSDAC, the project would support advisors as follows:
* A credit policy advisor would assist the merged institution in: (i) adopting uniform credit policies; (ii)
ensuring that such policies allow the effective control and management of portfolio risks; and (iii)
developing loan review and approval procedures that ensure that the credit policies are effectively
implemented.
* An accounting and financial control advisor would assist the merged institution in: (i) establishing a
uniform accounting system for the merged entity; (ii) developing new accounts and procedures manuals
for implementing the new accounting system; and (iii) developing existing, and purchasing new
computer equipment to implement the accounting and financial control system.
* A restructuring and rationalization advisor would assist the merged institution in: (i) establishing and
carrying out a strategy for staff rationalization; and (ii) establishing and carrying out a strategy for
branch rationalization based on a cost-benefit assessment of each branch.

Strengthening the Privatization Process
Background anid Sector Strategy
20.           The State has dominated most aspects of economic life in Guyana, accounting for more
than three-fourths of GDP. In addition to its presence in public infrastructure, the Government of Guyana
(GOG) controls major industries such as sugar processing and bauxite mining as well as a myriad of other
commercial enterprises across sectors. The former Government began under the Economic Recovery
Program to privatize public corporations, privatizing or liquidating 14 enterprises between 1987 and
October 1992. However, the lack of clarity of the transaction process contributed to considerable public
dissatisfaction with privatization. The program was subsequently halted by the PPP/Civic administration
in November 1992. The new government has moved cautiously; the first announcement on privatization
was made in July 1993, when a policy framework for Privatization was passed by Parliament. This was
followed in August with the setting up of a Privatization Board--a Cabinet-level Committee--that would
oversee privatization and in January 1994 by a public announcement of the first entities to be privatized
under the new policy.
21.           The GOG, with the assistance of IDA, has adopted a framework which sets out the
organization and procedures for continuing the privatization process. The objectives of the privatization
policy, are to transfer to the private sector the management, ownership and control of all commercially-
oriented public enterprises. The GOG has put in place a special executing authority or "agent" to restart
the program and to work on behalf of the Government. A Privatization Unit (PU) within the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) has been set up for this purpose, which reports to the Privatization Board, chaired by
the Minister of Finance. The PU has prepared operational guidelines to ensure that each privatization
transaction adheres to a standard set of procedures that is transparent and subject to public scrutiny.
Under the Privatization Policy, the entities to be privatized are decided by the GOG through the
Privatization Board, supported by the PU. The aim of the first phase of the privatization program is to:
(a) bring to point-of-sale a group of four or more wholly-owned state companies; (b) sell Government-
owned minority shares in a further three companies; and (c) establish an action plan for bringing to the
point-of-sale the remaining enterprises with intermediate targets that form the basis for the second and
third tranches of the PSDAC. At this time, Government participation in one bank has been sold and
work is nearing completion in the other entities slated for privatization this year.
22.           The GOG has also decided on the selection and the sequencing of the enterprises to be
privatized in the first phase of the privatization program. The GOG intends to explain the scope, goals,
procedures and pace of the privatization program to the populace as one of the institutional safeguards
necessary to generate consensus for the program and ensure its success. GOG is therefore taking steps
to set up a public communication program. IDA has supported this effort through a grant from the
Participation Fund to mobilize resources for the campaign. The public launch of the program was
recently conducted and will provide an ongoing regular communication of privatization activities to the
public. The publicity campaign is under the purview of the PU.
23.           To date, the institutional results in the Privatization unit have been limited. While the
Unit has followed the procedures established, limited resources and weak institutional capacity has
resulted in a slow and cumbersome process. As a result of this process, the Government has decided to



- 7 -
request assistance under the FISBEC to draw upon the expertise of a firm to provide advisory support
in this process. While IDA would provide guidance and supervision of the privatization component as
part of the overall project, the bulk of the advisory services have been proposed to be funded by the U.K.
Overseas Development Administration (ODA). In addition, Japanese Grant funds are currently being
used to fund an Executive Secretary, Financial Analyst and Corporate Lawyer. This funding will be
terminated once the FISBEC becomes effective.
Technical Assistance Requirements
24.           The aim of the technical assistance program is to assist in the process of institutional
support for the Privatization Unit. Support would consist of:
* Assistance by a Privatization Advisory Team who would be charged with guidance and technical support
of the privatization process. The Team would be responsible for overseeing the preparation of initial
audits of each company, expediting the legal process of preparation for privatization, overseeing the
process of and tender documents, and undertaking financial analysis on behalf of the Privatization
Board. The scope of work would include, for each of the 20+ enterprises: (i) legal due diligence; (ii)
financial due diligence; (iii) indicative valuation; (iv) recommended privatization strategy; (v)
preparation and mailing of bidding documents; and (vi) advice on implementation and conclusion of
sale;
* An Executive Secretarn would be supported under the Credit to manage the privatization process under
the guidance of the Privatization Board. The Secretary would be responsible for meeting the PU's
work program objectives, including reviews of each enterprise;
* A Finanicial Analvst would be contracted for a period of 30 months and would analyze the financial
position of public enterprises working under the guidance of the Advisory Team. This would include:
financial valuation, preparation of pro-forma financial statements and preparation of pro-forma financial
projections,
* A full time Accountant would assist in financial analysis and evaluate the valuation work undertaken;
* A Corporate Lawyier would be contracted for a period of 24 months to assist in the evaluation of legal
liabilities, design tender contracts, draft Ministerial Orders as appropriate or other legal documents as
needed. This lawyer would also review the legal position of each company to ensure that all legal and
contingent liabilities have been remedied so as to ensure the institution is saleable and not compromised
by contingent risks or obligations to the buyer; and
* Select financing would be available for office equipment--desktop computers a laser printer and a fax
machine.
Cost Estimate
25.    The total estimated cost of the program outlined below is US$ 785,100 of which US$ 765,100
would be financed under the Credit. Cofinanced funding for these costs is being sought from U.K. ODA,
who have expressed an interest to contribute to this component of the project.
Guyana Office of Investment (GO-INVEST)
Background and Sector Strategy
26.    The GOG disbanded the largely ineffective business promotion agency, GUYMIDA, in December
1993. A key role of GUYMIDA had been to decide on fiscal incentives on a firm by firm basis, a
practice which the Government decided to eliminate. The 1994 Budget replaced tax holidays and other
discretionary fiscal incentives with statutory tax and duty exemptions on specified capital goods available

to all firms operating in Guyana. The

PuJblic anFd Labor   30,000                30,000      27.            In March 1994 the GOG
Relations Erperts                                      established  the   Guyana   Office   of
Corporate LaiwYer    30,000                30,000      Investment (GO-INVEST) to speed private
Office Equipmtient   12,500                12,500      investors through government regulation
and facilitate investment in Guyana.  A
Total             785,100     20,000    765,100      blueprint for the Agency was adopted, the
head for the Unit appointed and in place,
and enabling legislation and a budget approved. A staffing structure has been established, and a schedule
for operations in place. Funding for the GO-INVEST director has to date been provided by a Japanese
Grant administered by IDA. The Unit also received approval for assistance from the Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS). As of late September, 1994, GO-INVEST had progressed in its mandate to
promote Guyana for foreigni investment purposes.  Various private investor contacts and official
trade/investmenit promotion representatives have been contacted overseas, and the agency has been
providing support to interested individual investors through assistance on investment opportunities and
related regulations, and by liaising with other government agencies to expedite or resolve obstacles in the
establishment of investment enterprises. In addition, pamphlets and briefs on domestic industry and
sectoral developments have been produced, and GO-INVEST is now in the process of developing an
investor procedures guide in coordination with the Ministry of Finance. An intensive training program
is underway, covering a broad range of issues from customs and taxation regulations to industry-wide and
sectoral developmiients.
28.           The Government has agreed in the context of the PSDAC to strengthen the environment
for private sector development, and provide support across the relevant ministries and agencies to
facilitate GO-INVEST's role in attracting foreign investment.
Technical Assistanice Requiremtletnts
29.           Assistance would be provided to GO-INVEST to establish staffing and institutional
procedures, acquire equipment, and train Investment Service Officers. In coordination with IDA, FIAS
is providing technical assistance to streamline investment procedures, as well as providing limited
strategic guidanice.
Financing would be provided for the Advisor/Director of GO-INVEST who would develop institutional
procedures, lead and manage the operation of the Unit, and coordinate with Cabinet-level officials;

* Four Investment Officers would be contracted for a period of 36 months each. Such individuals would
guide potential investors through administrative procedures, develop and maintain informational and
promotional materials, and investigate investment opportunities. A Specialist in Investment Promotion
and Public Relations would also be contracted to provide guidance on the materials developed, GO-
INVEST's strategy and its procedures;
* Staff Training would be provided, in the form of learning trips to effective regional one-stop shops
and courses outside the country; and
* Select financing would be available for office equipment--desktop computers, a laser printer and a copy
machine.
30.          In order to expedite the execution of the overseas training component for the above (as
well as under the Banking Supervision component), a commitment from the Government would be sought
for one-year block approvals of training/travel requests which are financed under this project.
Cost Estimate
31.           The total estimated cost of
the program outlined in Table 5 below is   Table 5 - Estimated Cost of Support to GO-INVEST
approximately US$ 532,100 of which US$                         (US$)

environmental audits of the companies
identified.   Based on the preliminary
evaluation, 11 public enterprises were recommended as requiring either an environmental audit or
assessment for specified issues.  The objective of each audit would be to evaluate the identified
environmental issues. The objective of each environmental assessment would be to identify environmental
liabilities of selected enterprises of the Government prior to their privatization. The Government of
Guyana is also currently undertaking discussions in these areas with the ODA, which is prepared to
provide funding for the afore-mentioned activities. Therefore, while the norms and procedures which
would guide the progress of this component, would be based on IDA standards which are being used in
the development of Guyana's own environmental guidelines, the financing and expenditures of this sub-
component would be administered by the U.K. ODA.

Technical Assistance Requirements
33.           The Government has agreed to contract with one or more environmental consulting firms
to conduct the environmental audits and assessments needed for the 11 companies above.  The
consultants' work shall consist of (i) identifying mitigatory measures for environmental issues associated
with current operating practices; (ii) environmental issues associated with past practices and inadequate
design features which may result in environmental liabilities; and (iii) building-up institutional capacity
in Guyana to supervise the implementation of agreed-upon clean-up or mitigatory measures. The
contractor will visit each facility and assess current and future compliance with expected national
environmental regulations, and IDA environmental guidelines which are being used in the formulation
of Guyana's regulations. The contractor shall conduct the necessary environmental characterization to
assess the scope of the environmental issue (eg. size of the contaminated area), develop the cleanup
criteria for the contaminated areas, and train local staff with documented procedures for supervision of
a clean-up plan. The output shall be a work plan, field investigation plan, and, most important, field-
specific reports.  These field specific reports should contain a detailed strategy for clean-up of
environmental liabilities, including an estimate of the costs of such a clean-up.
Cost Estimate
34.    The estimated cost of the audits
and assessments, and institutional capacity   Table 6 - Estimated Cost of Technical Assistance to
building above is US$ 470,000. Part of           the Office of the President -- Environmental

implementing regulations as well as a lack
of the implementation capacity to enforce such regulations. The current Registry of Companies which
is under the Deeds Registry, does maintain a registry of public and privately held corporations, and is
also responsible for registering deeds. However, the Registry does not enforce the Companies Act and
lacks organized cataloging and record-keeping systems. In accordance with the PSDAC, the Government
has agreed to draft and issue the implementing regulations to the Companies Act (as amended in 1991)
as well as to have the Act and such regulations under implementation. The Government has requested
support in the development of these regulations and subsequent implementation capacity.
Technical Assistance Requirements
36.           Support would be provided to assist in developing the regulations and implementation
capacity for the Companies Act as follows:
* A Corporate Lawyer with experience in Companies Law in the Commonwealth will be contracted to
draft the implementing regulations for the Companies Act.

financing the costs under this component,  Total               150,000              150,000
would be for the Government to first
designate an adequately staffed Registry responsible for executing the required functions, and in addition,
to put in place a sustainable budget and staffing complement to carry out the necessary institutional tasks
and enforcement of regulations. The consultants funded under the component, would train such staff in
operationalizing the regulations pertaining to the Companies Act, and in implementing institutional
procedures, as well as record-keeping mechanisms and controls, to carry out the Registry's functions
effectively.
Cost Estimate
38.           The estimated cost of the program above is US$ 150,000, all of which would be financed
under the Credit.
Credit Administration - Operation of the Ministry of Finance Project Unit
39.           A Project Unit will be established in the Ministry of Finance with the responsibility for
coordination and oversight of: (i) procurement of goods and services supported by the FISBEC; (ii)
disbursement of funds under the FISBEC, and (iii) periodic auditing of the project accounts. The Unit
may also take on similar responsibilities with respect to cofinanced funds under the project.
40.   In order to support the Unit, uss    Table 8 - Estimated Cost of Technical Assistance to
77,800 of the Credit would be used to               Support the Project Unit (US$)

41.    Procurement under the Project
will be according to IDA guidelines and
subject to normal IDA review procedures. The Credit would finance USS 3.5 million equivalent (87%
of total project costs of US$ 4.0 million), including 100% of foreign exchange costs and the remaining



- 12 -
US$ 0.5 million in local costs would be financed by Government counterpart resources. Consultant
services would be procured according to IDA procedures and would be subject to prior review for
contracts of US$25,000 equivalent and above. For consultant contracts, terms of reference for most of
the major activities to be financed under the proposed Credit have been prepared and are available in the
Project Files. IDA's standard forms of consultant contracts would be utilized, including a short-form
letter for direct contracting of individual consultants for short-term assignments. Goods/equipment valued
at less than US$25,000 would be procured through international shopping procedures acceptable to IDA.
Goods costing over US$25,000 equivalent are not expected to be financed under the project. However,
in the event that a contract package would exceed this amount, procurement procedures would be agreed
in consultation with IDA. Prior review would be mandatory for the first contract procured through
shopping.
42.           Disbursements will be administered by the Project Unit in the Ministry of Finance. A
Special Account would be established within the Bank of Guyana for the activities financed by this Credit.
The Special Account will have an authorized allocation of US$300,000 (equivalent to four months of
estimated disbursements). Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) in
the case of goods and consultant services below US$25,000 equivalent for which detailed documentation
evidencing expenditures will be reviewed and kept by the Project Unit and made available for the required
audits and to IDA as needed. Credit disbursements would be made against 100% of the net-of-tax costs
of local and foreign consultants; 100% of training expenses; 100% of the CIF cost of imported goods
and of the ex-factory cost of local goods; and 85% of the cost of locally-procured goods. No retroactive
financing for consulting activities and related equipment is expected. The Project is expected to be
completed by end-1997. The closing date would be June 30, 1998.
43.           Project Implementation. The project would be a technical assistance facility managed
through the Project Unit to be established in the Ministry of Finance. The Project Unit would be
responsible for coordinating the requests from each of the counterpart agencies, ensuring that proper
procurement procedures are followed and oversee the disbursement process. Consultant contracts would
be directly procured and a procurement specialist would be contracted for the purchase of equipment.
The project implementation period is expected to last for a period of three years--the same as that for the
PSDAC. Project administration would be in close coordination with the proposed IMF, and U.K. ODA
parallel financing.
44.           Records and Auditing will be the responsibility of the Project Unit, which will establish
separate accounts for each component and will monitor all expenditures financed by the project. The
Ministry of Finance will maintain separate records and accounts for all transactions under the credit. The
Government will carry out annual audits of the Project accounts, the special account and statement of
expenditures and furnish the reports to the Association no later than three months after the close of the
financial year.  In addition to this financial reporting, a full progress report will be prepared and
submitted to IDA every six months. This report will detail all project and related activities, report on
progress in relation to agreed schedules, and identify any problems which may have been encountered
and which could adversely affect the overall impact of the project.
