outcome was\n            satisfactory: the goals of reducing the state s role in the\n            economy, improving the solvency and efficiency of financial\n            intermediation, and strengthening banking supervision were\n            satisfactorily met. On the other hand, the restructuring of\n            the new Guyana National Cooperative Bank was unsatisfactory;\n            and the goal of enhancing the business environment was\n            adjudged marginally unsatisfactory. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory overall. The\n            following are the main lessons learned: Inter-agency\n            arrangements both financial and institutional and, in\n            particular, the absence of documentation delayed the\n            privatization process. Wide disparity in the value of the\n            same asset base made it difficult for the Privatization Unit\n            to arrive at the true value of enterprise assets. Although\n            worker participation was a key objective, the financial\n            status of many workers and the large asset base of most\n            enterprises made this difficult. The investment agency\n            (GO-INVEST) has not been as effective as expected due to\n            several changes in the leadership, thereby delaying capacity\n            building. When the financial situation of the newly merged\n            Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) deteriorated, the\n            government decided to contract a new management team, which\n            has been able to stem further losses of the bank's portfolio."}, "docdt": "1999-12-25T00:00:00Z"}
