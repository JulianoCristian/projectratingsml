satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: national universities in\n            Africa are an under-used resource for the critical task of\n            government capacity development; programs enlisting the\n            intellectual resources of universities for government\n            capacity building in Africa can stimulate positive change\n            within the universities themselves, and lead to increased\n            relevance and quality of education; local government\n            officials benefit from intensified interaction with\n            educational institutions on many level; public officials,\n            upon completion of long-term training, will return to their\n            employers; the benefits of World Bank-Foundation\n            partnerships can outweigh the management costs; and\n            monitoring and evaluation of the contributions of knowledge\n            institutions to human
