SUNvARY
i.        Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota requires the equivalent
of US$25.o million to complete the financing of a project consisting of
the installation of the final three 50 MW units of El Colegio hydro plant,
the construction of the Canoas hydro plant with one 50 NW unit installed
and normal distribution and transmission expansion. The cost of the project,
estimated at the equivalent of US$h3.7 million including interest during
construction of about US$4.4 million equivalent, represents about 87 percent
of Empresa's planned construction investments during the project construction
period. The external financing is required to cover the foreign exchange
cost of imported goods necessary for the project. This would be provided
by the Bank and major industrialized countries under arrangements described
herein if the proposed loan is approved.
ii.       The additional generating capacity is needed to meet reasonable
load growth estimates for the Bogota area and comprises generating plant
additions approved for early construction in anticipation of electrical
interconnection of the Bogota, IIedellin and Cali power systems.
iii.      A loan for this program has been under discussion for more than
a year but processing of the application was delayed until satisfactory
arrangements were made to proceed with the Interconnection Project.
iv.       This would be the Bank's third loan to Empresa.  The first was
made in 1960 (246-CO) and the second in 1962 (313-CO); the two Loans totalled
US$67.6 million equivalent. Work under both Loans has been completed and
both Loans have been fully disbursed.
v.        There should be no unusual problems in carrying out the proposed
program. Similar and more difficult work has been successfully completed
in the past by Empresa and its consultants. The cost estimates contain
provisions for local price increases and contingencies and should prove
reliable.
vi.       Empresa's financial position has been difficult during the past
three years due to increases in operating and construction costs and delays
in applying for and obtaining needed tariff adjustments. However, it is
now much improved, and the financial plan provides for payment of current
obligations resulting from recent cash difficulties and for a substantial
increase in working capital. It is intended to be conservative and forms
a satisfactory basis for financing the proposed project.
vii.      The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$18.0 million
equivalent, for a term of 20 years including about 3½ years of grace on
amortization payments. Under the proposed joint financing arrangements, the
balance of the foreign exchange required for the project of US$7.0 million
equivalent would be provided through credits to be arranged between Empresa
and major supplier countries.



APPRAISAL OF
THE THIRD EXPANSION PROGRAM4
EiPREaA DE ENEIGIA ELECTRICA DE BOGOTA
COLOMBIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota applied for a loan of
US$34.4 million equivalent late in 1966 toward the cost of system expansion
during the period 1967-71. However, during appraisal the required external
financing was found to be US$25.o million equivalent, the estimated foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment, supplies and services.  The total cost
of the project is estimated to be US$43.7 million equivalent including
interest charges on borrowed funds of about US$4.4 million equivalent. The
external financing proposed would represent about 57 percent of the total.
1.02      The project would include the installation of three 50 IW units
to complete El Colegio hydro plant and the construction of the new Canoas
hydro plant with one 50 INW unit, together with the necessary expansion of
transmission line and distribution system facilities to meet load growth
during 1968-71. The cost of the project wculd represent about 87 percent
of the cost of new planned construction investments during the period
1968-71. Procurement is well advanced and major contracts have been awarded
following procedures approved by the Bank.  The Bank would reimburse up to
the equivalent of US$2.5 million from the proposed loan to cover down pay-
ments providing reimbursements would not cover payments made more than four
months prior to the date of loan approval.
1.03      This would be the third loan to Empresa.  The first (246-CO)
was rmade in January 1960 and the second (313-CO) was made in Nlay 1962.
Both Loans have been fully disbursed. Amortization of the first Loan
started in 1963 and the second in 1966. The work financed by the first
Loan was completed in 1963 and work under the second Loan, though delayed
by problems described in paragraph 4.02, was substantially completed in
mid-1967. Included were hydro and thermal generating capacity additions
of about 300 PM, one major reservoir plus improvements to another and
transmission line and distribution system extensions.
1.04      This report was prepared by E. B. Arnold, Paul Geli and
I. A. Menezes from information obtained during investigations and dis-
cussions in Bogota in February 1967 and revised by Messrs. Arnold and
J. P. Vigie in January 1968. The delay of approximately one year in
processing the loan request was necessary to complete institutional arrange-
ments for the electrical interconnection of the Bogota, Medellin and Cali
power systems (see paragraph 2.02) and because Empresa's financial plan was
affected by interconnection arrangements.
2. INTERCONNECTION WITH OTHER MAJOR SYSTEMS
2.01      The Bank has been participating in financing power development
in Colombia for more than 15 years. While Bank operations have been con-
centrated in the three systems serving the major cities of Bogota, Cali



- 2 -
and Medellin, a substantial contribution has also been made to the expansion
of the Manizales system, which is roughly in the center of the triangle
formed by the other three. All told, 12 Loans with an aggregate initial
amount of nearly US$200 million have been made to these four systems, which
in 1966 produced some 65 percent of all the electric power generated in the
nation.
2.02      Potential benefits to be gained from interconnecting these power
systems became apparent to Bank staff several years ago and these were
discussed extensively in Colombia early in 1963. Later that year, economic
studies were made in Colombia which confirmed beyond doubt that very signifi-
cant savings could indeed be realized and the Bank made it known that further
power loans for generating plant additions in the area to be served by the
interconnection would not be considered unless they were for facilities
clearly compatible with interconnection and until satisfactory progress had
been made toward carrying out the interconnection.
2.03      In spite of the Bank's efforts, progress toward organizing a
company to own and properly operate the interconnection facilities has been
disappointing. However, it was agreed that a new company would be formed,
owned jointly by the local systems serving Bogota, Cali and Medellin and by
the national Government which controls the IManizales system. During 1967
statutes were drafted and a new company, Interconexion Electrica, S.A.
(Interconexion) was incorporated. Engineering has progressed to the point
where bid invitations for the transmission lines and substations have been
issued. The estimated cost of facilities to connect the four systems is
equivalent to about US$32 million, of which about US$24 million would be
in foreign currencies.
2.04      The benefits of the proposed interconnection accrue through
economies of scale: for example, larger generating plants will be justified
for the interconnected system with capital costs significantly lower than
the sum of similar investments required if the component systems were
operated independently. Reserve capacity requirements would also be much
lower and operational savings attained by taking advantage of differing
hydrological conditions between areas within the interconnected system.
Interconexion's initial task will be to construct and operate a transmission
system by which power transfers between the component systems, its sponsors,
can take place. Following this, with the exception of a few generating
projects reserved for construction by the sponsors, Interconexion will fi-
nance, construct and own major new generating stations. The formula for
financing this work is complicated but, in essence, the local costs are
expected to be financed through equity and debt investments by the sponsors
and the foreign costs through foreign loans. Operating costs and debt
service on foreign loans incurred for the initial interconnection facilities
will be borne by the sponsors. Interconexion would operate initially on
a break-even cash basis and later, when it owms generating facilities, would
be expected to generate revenues sufficient to cover all its cash require-
ments including dividend payments to the sponsors.
2.05      To determine the most economic addition of generating capacity
in the interconnected system, various construction programs were prepared



-3-
and examined several years ago in Colombia and all included the capacity
for Bogota included in the project appraised in this report. A condition
of paragraph 2.02 above, that generating facilities considered for loans
must be compatible with interconnected operations is therefore met.
However, the condition that satisfactory progress be made in the carrying
out of the interconnection itself was met only late in 1967. A loan
request for the interconnection project is being processed.
3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be Empresa de Energia Electrica de Bogota
(Empresa), an autonomous municipally-owned public utility which serves the
capital city of Bogota and Vicinity. The Bogota area has a population of
about two million.
3.02      Empresa is a juridical entity with legal capacity to borrow from
the Bank. It is an autonomous enterprise under the direction of a Board of
Directors who appoint a manager responsible for day-to-day operations. The
appointment must be approved by the lMayor of Bogota. The manager in office
since 1951 retired at the end of 1967 and a new manager with past utility
experience has been recently appointed.
3.03      The present Board consists of seven members, including the Mayor
of Bogota or his representative. Two members are selected by the Bogota
Municipal Council and four are chosen by a consortium of Bogota banks under
the authority of a trust agreement with the Municipality of Bogota. This
agreement was executed in 1951 w¢hen a consortium of four local banks fi-
nanced the acquisition by the Yiunicipality of the outstanding stock of a
private corporation, Empresas Unidas de Energia Electrica de Bogota, S.A.,
the predecessor of Empresa de Energia Electrica. This trust agreement will
expire in mid-1968.
3.04      In connection with the first Bank Loan (246-CO) the Municipality
agreed that, after the expiration of the trust agreement, the seven members
of the Board would be: the M4ayor of Bogota, two members elected by the
Municipal Council, three members chosen by the Council from lists submitted
by associations representative of banks, commerce and industry of Bogota,
and one member chosen by the President of the Republic (Acuerdo No. 129 of
1959). During negotiations the 11unicipality agreed to continue this under-
taking in connection with the proposed loan.
3.05      Erapresa's management includes a General Auditor, appointed by
the 1Mbyor of Bogota from a list of candidates nominated by the Banco de la
Republica. The auditor reports directly to the Board, is on Empresa's
payroll, and mainly performs the functions of an internal auditor. Conse-
quently, in connection with the previous Loans, Empresa agreed to an annual
audit by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations,
Erapresa agreed to continue this undertaking for the duration of the proposed
loan.



3.06      The management and staff of Empresa, with the assistance of
consultants, are capable of satisfactorily carrying out the proposed project.
Existing Facilities
3.07      Empresa's generating facilities include 361 MW of hydro and 75 NW
of thermal capability.  As will be seen from the HIap, the hydroelectric
generating facilities consist of a series of plants located along a 25 km
stretch of the Bogota River a short distance downstream from Bogota. The
steam plant, with two 33 PnW units, is located at Zipaquira, about 44 km
north of Bogota. In addition, Empresa owns and maintains a very old thermal
plant capable of about 20 MW for short periods. This plant is used only for
reserve and emergencies.
3.08      Empresa also owns two important reservoirs.  The Tomine reservoir
on the Siecha River, an irmportant tributary of the Bogota River, is the
largest storage reservoir in the Bogota River watershed and is used for
annual regulation of river flow. The i*iuna reservoir provides daily regu-
lation and is essential in the operation of the system since it provides
the close control of water releases necessary for the correct series
operation of the generating facilities. Both reservoirs have facilities
for pumping storage wiater from the Bogota River.
3.09      Empresa also owns the transmission and distribution facilities
necessary to interconnect its various generating plants and properly deliver
power to its customers in the city of Bogota and vicinity. Empresa's plant
facilities are modern and well maintained.
3.10      The Bogota system is presently linked with a relatively small
thermal power installation near Paipa which serves the department of Boyaca
and the Paz del Rio steel rill. The connecting transmission line, about
115 km long, is owmed by the Instituto de Aprovechaniento de Aguas y Fomento
Electrico, a government agency, which in addition to other functions, is
responsible for general power development in Colombia.
4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project includes the completion of the existing
El Colegio hydroelectric plant, the construction of the Canoas hydro plant
needed for system control as well as for the energy it will provide, and
normal expansion of transmission and distribution system facilities
scheduled during the period 1968 through 1970 and required to meet the
market development and to provide the necessary outlet for planned generating
capacity additions. On a cost basis, the project represents about 87 percent
of the scheduled new construction during the period 1968-71.
El Colegio
4.02      The existing El Colegio hydro plant would be completed, by the
addition of three 50 FITW units, to its final 300 IIW capacity. The first



-5-
stage with a capacity of 150 MgW was put into operation in February 1967
after five full years of construction, about 18 months more than originally
scheduled because of problems encountered in tunneling and in stabilizing
a vast soil mass affecting both the penstocI and powerhouse.  The problems
were severe and successful completion of the work is to the credit of Empresa
and its engineering consultants and contractors.
4.03      It is difficult to compare estimated and final costs of the
first stage because of deteriorating exchange rates during the construction
period. But conversion of pesos to dollars at the average prevailing rates
during the construction period leads to the following comparison (excluding
engineering and financial charges):
---------------------- -Lillions ----------------------
Foreign Cost         Local Costs              Total
US Dollars      Col$        Ex. Rate        US Dollars
1961 estimate            20.7         84           6.7:1            33.3
Final                    22.5        172 Varied 9:1 - 17:1          35.2
Adding engineering costs of about US$2.5 million leads to a final cost of
about US$37.7 million before financial charges.  This is equivalent to about
US$250 per kilowatt which is an attractive price for hydro power, particu-
larly as completion of the plant will reduce the unit costs for the total
300 IEW installation to about US$158 per installed kilowatt.
4.04      Completion of the plant involves a second penstock, three 50 MW
turbines and generators and associated transformers, switchgear and other
items. There would be only minor civil works. The cost is estimated at
US$7.5 million and Col$37.8 million or the equivalent of US$9.8 million.
This would average about US$65 per kilowatt for the second stage 150 MW
installation. The second stage installation should be completed by the
end of 1971.
Canoas
4.05      Operation of a series system of hydro plants requires the release
of the precise amount of water required to meet ever changing system power
demands. Full use of water is rarely attainable but the present Bogota
system is particularly wasteful of water and difficult to control because
releases from the Ituna reservoir at the head of the series of plants
presently require about 1½ hours to reach the intake of the Salto plant.
Canoas, upstream of Salto, is required to complete the series of plants and
to eliminate the 1¼ hour time lag.  It was scheduled for construction at the
time of both previous loans, but postponed because of the need to use avail-
able funds for other higher priority construction.
4.06      The Canoas plant would include a 2,740 m long pressure tunnel,
892 m long penstock and a surface powerhouse with one 50 NW unit. The net
head is about 141 m and average annual generation would be about 226 Gwh.
Canoas would discharge directly into the Salto intake, the next downstream
plant.



- 6 -
4.07      The cost is estimated at US$5.8 million and Col$105 million, or
the equivalent of about US$245 per kilowatt. Construction would require
about 3½ years.
Transmission and Distribution
4.08      Expansion of Empresa's 115 kv and 57.5 kv primary substations and
transmission lines would be continued to meet the growing demands of the
system as would the installation of new distribution facilities and street
lighting in Bogota to meet the rapidly expanding urban area's needs.
Summarized Cost Estimate
4.09      The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of about US$39.3
million before interest charged during construction. The direct foreign
exchange cost would be equivalent to about Us$25.0 million. The estimate
is summarized below and shown in more detail in Annex 3.

Method of Financing
4.15      During the past year the Bank has taken the lead in arranging
with major industrialized countries for the joint financing of three
Colombian public utility projects--the proposed project covered by this
report, the Power Interconnection project and the Bogota Water Supply
project. Substantial agreement on a financing formula was reached at a
meeting in Paris on October 26, 1967 of interested countries. Financing
would be provided on a 50/50 basis between the Bank and the country in
which contracts are placed, provided that:
(i)  Individual contracts amount to at least the equivalent
of US$200,000 to qualify for joint financing; and
(ii)  The country must receive qualifying contracts aggre-
gating at least the equivalent of US$1 million before
being called on to participate in joint financing.
4.16      The value of contracts awarded and bid evaluations completed
indicates that joint financing can be expected with the following countries:
Value of
Qualifying Contracts
Country                         (US$ millions)
Germany                               1.2
Italy                                 5.8
Japan                                 1.0
Total                      8.0
In addition, of contracts yet to be awarded totalling about US$11 million,
it can be assumed that about US$6 million will qualify under the financing
formula. Thus, of the estimated US$25 million equivalent total foreign
exchange costs of the project, financing for 50 percent of the value of
qualifying contracts or about US$7 million equivalent, can be expected from
the supplier countries. This leaves US$18.0 million equivalent to be
financed by the proposed Bank loan. However, as results of further bidding
become known and if more than the assumed value of contracts qualify for
joint financing, the amount of financing required from the Bank would be
reduced and a corresponding amount of the proposed loan would be cancelled.
Engineering and Supervision of Construction
4.17      Empresa satisfactorily carries out engineering activities in
connection with general system operation, maintenance and distribution
expansion. It relies heavily on its consultant, Ingetec Ltda. of Bogota,
for assistance in long-range planning as well as detailed project design,
procurement assistance and supervision of construction. Ingetec in turn
engages consultants in specialized fields when necessary. These arrange-
ments, are generally acceptable, and an allowance for modest foreign
expenditures on engineering has been included in the cost of the project.

5. POI!UR MPRKET
5.01      The city of Bogota and its suburbs presently account for the
greater part of Empresa's sales although wholesale sales to other utilities
will become increasingly important in the future. W4hile the Bogota market
has good potential, past restrictions in supply have prevented its normal
development and it was only with the completion of the 150 MW first stage
of El Colegio in February 1967 that Empresa management felt free to begin
a modest promotional campaign.
5.02      Annex 1 gives past market statistics and estimates for the future.
During the period 1961-67 average annual growth rates for the residential,
commercial and industrial sectors were respectively 13.8, 8.2 and 12.0 per-
cent with total sales increasing at an average of 11.7 percent. While these
growth rates were lower during the last three of the six year period,
Empresa, in view of general forecasts of improved economic performance for
the country as a whole, has based its system and financial planning on a
10.7 percent growth rate beyond 1967. This rate approximately averages the
1961-67 and 1964-67 results, which is reasonable for planning purposes.
Empresa's forecast has been therefore accepted with only minor adjustments
for this report.
5.03      Wholesale sales to small utilities serving towns outside of the
Bogota system can be expected to increase rapidly as a result of recent
transmission line extensions and improvements in the distribution systems
in some of these towns. The principal agency of this type in the region
is Corporacion Autonoma Regional de La Sabana de Bogota y Valles de Ubate
y Chiquinquira (CAR) which received as a sub-borrower of Empresa US$1.7
million under the last Bank Loan for expansion of its rural sub-transmission
system. Sales to this category of the market were about 73 Gwh in 1967 and
can be reasonably expected to increase to 275 Gwh by 1974. In addition,
sales to the Cali region are expected in 1971, 1972 and 1973 through the
facilities of the proposed BogotaMvledellin/Cali interconnection.
5.04      System losses have shown a decreasing trend during the past few
years reducing from 12.2 to 8.9 percent between 1961 and 1966 while system
load factor has varied between about 52 and 56 percent. Since there are
practical limits beyond which neither losses nor load factor will improve,
losses of about 8.5 percent of gross generation and an annual load factor
of 55 percent have been assumed for this report. On this basis the system
peak demand is expected to increase from 295 MW in 1967 to 610 14W in 1974.
5.05      Annex 2 gives a graphical representation of expected load growth
and system capability. It can be seen that existing system capacity will
become inadequate during the first half of 1971 but the deficiency will be
made up by power purchases from Paipa (paragraph 3.10). Canoas and El
Colegio II are scheduled to come into operation during the second half of
1971 as is the proposed interconnection. Although Empresa's own generation
sources would become inadequate again within the period of the forecast,
other new generation sources in other parts of the interconnected system are
expected to make up the deficiency.



- 10 -
Justification for the Project
5.o6      As discussed above, the capacity to be provided by Canoas and
El Colegio II is needed to meet market conditions and this need exists for
the Bogota system considered either in isolation or interconnected. These
two installations will complete the planned development of the Bogota River
and the only reasonable short-range alternative to either one would be a
thermal development. Competent studies made in Colombia and agreed to by
the parties to the interconnection include the construction of both plants
as scheduled in every alternative system development program examined. The
reason for this is easily seen for El Colegio II,considering that 150 Nw
can be added to the system at the low unit cost of about US$65 per kw.
5.07      The present undeveloped section of river between the Muna reservoir
outlet and Salto intake should be controlled to save water and improve system
response (paragraph 4.05). This would be accomplished by the Canoas develop-
ment with water savings estimated equivalent to about 60 Gwh annually in the
downstream plants. In addition, Canoas would produce about 226 Gwh annually.
The cost of this energy (286 Gwh annually) if it could be produced by
Empresa's existing modern Zipaquira thermal plant would be about 12 centavos/
kwh with interest and depreciation charged at 6½2 percent and 3 1/3 percent
respectively. However, the alternative to Canoas would be a new thermal
plant.  A 50 SW unit with the same interest and depreciation rates and with
capital costs assumed 25 percent less than those for Zipaquira would produce
energy at about 7.8 centavos/kwh.  Again, at the same interest rate but with
depreciation at 2 percent to reflect the longer life of hydro plants, the
same amount of energy from Canoas would cost about 6.5 centavos/kwh. This
saving in unit production cost of about 17 percent provides ample justifi-
cation for the Canoas investment.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
6.01      The seven years during which the Bank has enjoyed close relations
with Empresa have been characterized by almost continuously increasing
domestic price levels, and periodic devaluations of the peso. At the same
time, Empresa has tripled its generating capacity. Thus, the primary task
of Empresa's financial management has been to assure the timely availability
of funds adequate to acquire assets at a very rapid rate in the face of
rapidly increasing costs. The two Bank Loans defrayed only the foreign ex-
change costs of the expansion programs, and Empresa has had to finance the
local currency costs, as well as operating expenses and debt service. Local
sources of capital are quite limited, and Empresa has never obtained fi-
nancial support from the National Government or the lHfunicipality. Its
principal recourse when funds from operations have been inadequate has been
to the local commercial banking system. Local credits, however, are
generally available only on relatively short terms, are frequently difficult
to arrange quickly, and in any event have provided only about 10 percent of
expansion requirements.



- n -
6.02       The importance of Empresa's. ability to contribute substantially
all the local currency component of its expansion was recognized in both
previous Loans which contain as a principal performance criterion a re-
quirement that Empresa contribute 40 percent of its expenditures on new
power facilities, but which also provided that compliance be measured over
rolling four-year periods starting in 1963. This has proven impractical to
measure quickly, and has been difficult to enforce for two principal reasons:
Empresa was unwilling to request adjustments when needed, and the Government
subsequently did not live up to its undertakings to permit Empresa to swiftly
adjust its tariffs to the changing conditions in the economy. As a conse-
quence, Empresa's current position has in the past deteriorated, and certain
investments which would otherwise have been made were postponed because of
inadequate financial resources. Empresa's contribution to its expansion has
fallen short of the target, both as measured over rolling four-year periods
or in any given year except 1967, when there was a sharp fall in construction
expenditures. The average contribution during 1963-66 was about 23 percent.
6.03       Empresa, as an instrumentality of the Municipality, has been re-
quired to make investments in, and to operate and maintain, a public street
lighting system in Bogota, as well as provide electric power service to
certain municipal offices. The amount of Empresa's contribution through 1967
was fixed at a level equal to 10 percent of Empresa's income calculated before
crediting interest charged to construction. Expenditures above this level were
in theory to be reimbursed to Empresa by the Municipality, but in practice
were not. In an arrangement approved by Empresa's Board of Directors in 1967,
the costs of operating and maintaining the public lighting system, the
electric energy associated with it, and that furnished to the city's offices
will be defrayed by Empresa and charged as an operating expense. The invest-
ments to be made in expanding the public lighting system will be equal to 10
percent of the net income (before crediting interest charged to construction)
of the prior year.
6.o4       The rate of return on the investment could not realistically be
applied to Empresa as a measure of performance because the local currency
component of its investment is stated at historic cost which greatly under-
estimates its value. The rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
during the last five years has been of the order of 20 percent, which would
appear high excepting that this level of earnings on historically-valued
assets has failed to generate adequate cash. The debt/equity ratio has
been about 60/40, but this, of course, is distorted by the effect of currency
devaluations. As already noted, Empresa's contribution to construction has
been considerably short of the targets agreed in connection with the previous
Loans. Thus it must be concluded that financial performance in the past has
been far from ideal. However, there have been significant improvements
recently and, there are reasonable expectations that performance will improve
further. Among these are the presence of a competent financial manager, and
a realistic attitude towards tariff adjustments on the part of the Government.
Condensed Income Statements and Balance Sheets for 1963-67 are included in
Annexes 5 and 7.



- 12 -
The Tariff Situation
6.05       The tariffs charged by all public service enterprises in Colombia,
including Empresa, can be changed only with the approval of the Superin-
tendencia de Regulacion Economica, an agency of the central Government under
the direction of the Ministry of Development. At the present time there is
no uniform policy and adjustments have frequently been conditioned by other
than financial considerations. In a number of instances in the electric
power field, serious and persistent financial difficulties have been caused
by inadequate and/or tardy approval of badly-needed tariff adjustments.
6.06       Tariff regulation in Colombia should be simplified. A mechanism
should be established for periodic rate review, say once a year, and adjust-
ments based on objective criteria should follow, if required, within a reason-
able period. For determining the adequacy of tariffs, a realistic rate of
return criterion should be used, since it provides a satisfactory measure of
performance and can be easily applied. This implies, however, that arrange-
ments would be made for periodic revaluation of assets with an objective
mechanism for doing so, and for uniformity in accounting and the institution
of national standards to that purpose.
6.07       The subject of public utility regulation has been discussed at
length between the Bank and officials of the Government. The Government
agreed to study modifications along the above lines with a view to formulating
by mid-1969 a new national public utility tariff policy. Bearing in mind that
it will take at least until that time before a suitable policy is adopted that
includes provisions for the revaluation of assets and other factors indicated
above, the loan documents contain a rate covenant based on a minimum rate of
return on reasonably valued assets, and an agreed method for periodic review.
6.08       Empresats tariffs have been increased four times in the past eight
years a total of 151 percent to the present level of 18.6 centavos. This
level appears to be adequate for the foreseeable future (see paragraph 6.22).
Annex 4 gives details of the past and present tariff structures.
Present Financial Position
6.09       The present foreign exchange system, introduced on March 22, 1967
provides for a fixed rate of Col$16.30 = US$1 for capital transactions,
including debt service payments, and a floating exchange certificate rate
for imports and exports. The certificate rate applicable to Empresa's trans-
actions was CoI$15.61 at the end of 1967; for purposes of preparing the
forecasts in this report a rate of Col$16.30 = US$1 has been used throughout
for 1968 and later years.
6.10       In presenting its situation as of December 31, 1967 Empresa has
stated its outstanding foreign debts at the rate of Col$15.61 = US$1 and
commensurately increased the value of the corresponding assets. Empresa's
adjustments still leave the assets undervalued because of increases in
domestic price levels which have affected the reproduction cost of the local
currency component of assets. Empresa's year-end position, adjusted as
discussed, is presented on the next page.

6.11       Empresa's current position has improved greatly from the precarious
situation which had developed in 1964-66 when Empresa was forced to borrow
on short-term finance for the construction of the first stage of El Colegio
hydroelectric development. This had resulted from failure to anticipate the
need for and make timely application for a tariff increase. Empresa's
current ratio was 1.00, 0.64, and 0.93 in 1964, 1965, and 1966, respectively.
Its cash positions for the same years were Col$4.1, 4J4, and 5.5 millions.
At the end of 1967, the current ratio had improved to 1.5 and cash to
Col$41.4 million. These satisfactory levels reflect not only the better
financial management Empresa has enjoyed in the last two years, but also
the slackening of construction expenditures in 1967 with the completion of
El Colegio.
6.12       As the table on page 13 shows, Empresa's debt consists mainly of
the two Bank Loans, both of which have been fully disbursed and are being
repaid. The loans with Colombian banks and with the Venezuelan bank were
initially incurred to complete the financing plan in connection with the
second Bank Loan, and subsequently to finance increased construction costs.
All local loans were to have been repaid by 1969, but have been extended to
1971. The Venezuelan loan will be repaid in 1969.
6.13       Empresa's equity accounts include accumulated retained earnings,
and reserves which arose principally from obligations to employees for
benefits associated with service. The debt/equity ratio at the end of 1967
was 67/33 on the basis of the book-value of Empresa's accounts and is over-
stated because of distortions introduced by various exchange rates and price
levels.
6.14       As a result of the arrangements concluded in 1967 for provision of
street lighting and other services to the Municipality, Empresa assumed future
obligations amounting to Col$14.3 million at the end of that year. Empresa
will account for these separately and charge them against income as an opera-
ting expense.
Revaluation of Assets
6.15       Before the formulation of the policy discussed in paragraph 6.07,
and in order to estimate future performance and determine broadly whether
tariff adjustments appeared to be needed in the near future it was agreed
it would be reasonable to increase net asset values by about 30 percent over
the year-end figures determined by Empresa (see paragraph 6.10) and to state
foreign debts at Col$16.30 = US$1. These adjustments are incorporated in
the Balance Sheet for 1967 presented in Annex 7, which forms the basis of
the projections through 1974.
Construction and Investment Programs 1968-1974
6.16       During 1968-74 Empresa will be carrying out the Project described
in Chapter 4, further expanding its transmission, distribution and street
lighting systems; engineering in connection with these activities, and
future planning. In addition, it will be required to invest in the trans-
mission, and later generation, facilities of Interconexion. The total ex-
penditures on all these accounts are estimated at the equivalent of about



- 15 -
US$78 million during the next seven years. This represents an increase in
Empresa's investments of somewhat more than 50 percent as compared to 1967
year-end, an annual average rate of increase of 61 percent. This compares
with the increase of nearly 16 percent per annum during the last four years
and indicates why a rate of return concept can be realistically applied as
a measure of performance now that capital requirements are leveling off.
The total investment needs during the seven-year period, 1968-74., are shown
below.

6.17       Based upon the income projections of Annex 5 and estimated invest*

sources and uses of funds is given in Annex 6, and summarized in the following
table immediately below. The results of these projections are shown in the
estimated balance sheets of Annex 7. As can be seen, the preponderance of
fund requirements will be met from operations.

The apparently large amount of cash shown generated in the last three years
covered by the projections must be viewed in context. For example, growth
in the interconnected market greater than assumed would require increased
investment expenditures. Moreover, the projections are based upon assumed
exchange rates and price levels which may prove unrealistic. As with all
projections, the earlier years can be viewed with more confidence than the
later.
6.18       It has been assumed that present tariff levels will be continued
throughout the period covered by the projections, although the average
realization on sales will fall somewhat as the mix of sales to different
categories of customer varies. The proposed foreign financing of US$25
million equivalent has been assumed to be for 20 years including 32 years
grace on repayments, at 6&4 percent interest. The cost of providing street
lighting and electric power service to the Municipality is included as an
operating expense of Empresa, and amounts to 7 percent of all expenses in



- 17 -
the period. Empresa will, as a sponsor of the interconnecting transmission
system, contribute to its operation amounts which over the period total
about 1 percent of all Empresa's operating expenses; Empresa will also have
to make payments in behalf of Interconexion for debt service. These latter
amounts are included in Empresals investments in the interconnection.
6.19       In brief, the financial plan consists of only the proposed long-
term foreign financing, and reinvested retained earnings and depreciation.
It is satisfactory.
Estimated Future Performance
6.20       As can be seen from the Sources and Applications of Funds (Annex 6)
and the Balance Sheets (Annex 7) Empresa wiU operate with cash deficits
during 1968 and 1969, relying upon drawing down the substantial cash-on-hand
at the beginning of 1968. There would seem to be no difficulty for 1968;
if during 1969 a need for short-term borrowing arises, there is no reason
it should not be undertaken provided repayment could be arranged for no
earlier than 1971. Empresa should contribute 56 percent of all its expendi-
tures on construction and investment in Interconexion from net internal
sources during 1968-71.
6.21       In connection with the last Bank Loan, Empresa covenanted not to
incur debt without the Bank's agreement unless net revenues at incurrence
were 1.3 times the maximum debt service in any future year. This covenant
will be continued in connection with the proposed loan. Under the terms of
the assumed financings Empresa would meet this requirement. Annual debt
service coverage should be 1.7 times in 1968, and increase to nearly 3.0
times in 1974.
6.22       On the basis of the approximate asset revaluation discussed in
paragraph 6.15, during 1968-71 Empresa should earn an average of 9.4 percent
on its net plant in service. Annual rates of return would be 7.4 percent
for 1968, increasing to over 12 percent in 1974. This level of earnings
is satisfactory and tariffs are also satisfactory subject to confirmation
during periodic review to be undertaken by Empresa. Empresa agreed during
negotiations to earn a rate of return of at least 9 percent measured against
assets reasonably valued. Earnings at the level forecast, together with the
proposed borrowings should result in satisfactory debt/equity ratios:  54/46
in 1968, decreasing year by year to 34/66 in 1974.

7. CONCLTJSIOS
7.01       The proposed project is well planned and the cost estimate is
reasonably firm. The power and energy to result from the generating plant
additions would be needed by the Bogota system alone and also form part of
the agreed plan of system expansion required for interconnection of the
Bogota, Medellin and Cali areas.
7.02       Empresa's management is capable of carrying out the project and
continuing the day-by-day activities of the company.
7.03       Past financial results have not been as good as expected at the
time of earlier Loans, in large part because of increased construction costs.
Empresals past cash position has consequently been tight and tariff adjust-
ments were clearly called for earlier than made. That there were delays is
due in part to failure of the management and Board to take appropriate
action when required and by an inadequate system on the national level for
handling tariff matters. However, the present situation is much improved as
regards Empresa's current position, and the Government has undertaken to
study the tariff regulation situation with a view toward formulating a new
national policy.
7.04       The proposed financing plan is sound and includes provisions for a
significant increase in working capital. Debt service would be satisfactorily
covered, and the earnings test required in connection with past Loans would be
met.
7.05       The project would be partially financed by supplier countries under
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. Based on the results of bidding re-
viewed to date and on the value of individual contracts yet to be awarded, it
appears that financing of about US$7.0 million equivalent will be available
from the supplier countries, leaving US$18.0 million equivalent to be financed
by the proposed Bank loan. However, as further contracts are awarded it is
possible that more of them will qualify for supplier country financing and if
that should happen the Bank loan would be reduced by cancellation of a
corresponding amount.
7.06       During negotiations in April 1968:
(i) the Municipality agreed to continue the undertaking of
Loan Agreement 2h6-CO regarding the manner of selecting
Board members (paragraph 3.04);
(ii) Empresa agreed to continue the use of independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank for preparation of annual audits
(paragraph 3.05);
(iii) the Government and Empresa agreed to a redefined earnings
test of at least 9 percent rate of return on currently
valued assets, and to an interim procedure for asset re-
valuation (paragraphs 6.07 and 6.22); and
(iv) Empresa agreed to continue the present debt limitation
covenant (paragraph 6.21).

7.07       The project would be suitable for a loan of up to US$18.0 million
for a period of 20 years including about 3½,2 years grace on amortization.
