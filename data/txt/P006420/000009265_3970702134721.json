The\n            project objectives are to: (a) increase agricultural\n            production and productivity in the State of Ceara; (b)\n            generate employment opportunities for low-income rural\n            families; (c) increase Ceara's institutional capacity\n            to provide efficient agricultural services for small\n            farmers; and (d) promote water-resource development and\n            technology generation and diffusion. This latter component\n            aims to decrease small farmer vulnerability to recurring\n            droughts. Consequently, the project supports water resource\n            development for both agriculture and domestic use, fish\n            hatcheries, agricultural research, agricultural extension,\n            investment credit, marketing services, funding for community\n            subprojects and project administration and training."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
