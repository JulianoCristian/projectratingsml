"The audit reviews the assessments of the\n            Northeast Rural Development Program for both the Ceara\n            (NERDPC) and Paraiba (NERDPP) projects, concurring with the\n            Implementation Completion Report satisfactory outcomes of\n            the NERDPC, and highly satisfactory rating of the NERDPP.\n            Furthermore, performances of both the Bank, and borrower are\n            upgraded to highly satisfactory, in light of the success of\n            the projects' restructuring, and flexible supervision\n            responsiveness by the Bank, in addition to the strong\n            government commitment, enhanced by the extension\n            agency's technical assistance (TA) provision for\n            subproject preparation, and implementation. Lessons reflect\n            on the superior performance of the NERDPP, partly due to the\n            preponderance of electrification - the least problematic of\n            all subprojects, but also because of its higher accuracy in\n            beneficiary accountability, larger percentage of\n            associations with TA, leading to higher proportion of\n            technically sustainable projects. Based primarily on the\n            proven technical viability of subprojects, and reliability\n            of cost recovery from the rural electrification component,\n            sustainability of both projects is likely. Similarly,\n            evidenced by the subprojects contribution to social capital\n            formation, and the diversification of funding sources for\n            subproject investments, institutional development is rated\n            as substantial."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
