       enterprise projects nationwide in nearly all economic\n            sectors.  It is expected that through the provision of\n            credit, additional employment opportunities would be created\n            and the incomes of small entrepreneurs would be improved.\n            Approximately 173,000 subloans would be made.  The working\n            capital (KMKP) financing is expected to particularly help\n            small entrepreneurs to keep their businesses functioning\n            during the present prolonged recession.  The credit\n            component of the proposed loan helps to finance KIK/KMKP\n            subloans committed over a two-year period.  The technical\n            assistance component is designed to:  (a) strengthen\n            BI's management of the KIK/KMKP program by providing\n            appropriate advisors; and (b) improve the capacity of the\n            handling banks to implement the KIK/KMKP program, with\n            particular attention being given to the needs of BRI."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
