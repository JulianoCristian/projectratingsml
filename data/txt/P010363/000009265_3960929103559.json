road transport cost and delays of passengers\n            and goods by restoring major trunk roads to better\n            operational condition; (b) help to restore priority road\n            infrastructure damaged by flooding and landslides in\n            May/June 1989; (c) enhance the institutional capabilities of\n            the Road Development Authority (RDA); and (d) upgrade\n            RDA's capacity to supervise and execute rehabilitation\n            works and to stimulate the local road contracting industry.\n            The project includes: (a) rehabilitation of about 420 km or\n            primary and secondary trunk roads and strengthening, repair,\n            widening, redecking or replacement of 24 bridges; (b) urgent\n            repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction of selected roads\n            and associated structures damaged as a consequence of the\n            1989 floods and landslides; (c) procurement of vehicles,\n            microcomputers, survey equipment, computer software and\n            office equipment to facilitate road works monitoring and\n            control; and (d) technical assistance and consultancy\n            services to strengthen RDA's capabilities to monitor,\n            control and execute contracts more effectively, and\n            implement key operational and institutional reforms through\n            special studies."}, "docdt": "1990-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
