   Project is satisfactory with an uncertain sustainability.\n            The objectives to reduce road transport costs and delays,\n            and to help restore road infrastructure damaged by flooding\n            were met, after some delays, by the physical achievements of\n            the project. The projects institutional development\n            objectives, however, were only partially achieved. Lessons\n            learned follow. Institutional reform is needed to enable the\n            Road Development Authority to move from a public oriented\n            agency to an mixed agency. The government should empower the\n            Tender Committee and revise the clearance procedures for bid\n            document approval. Greater attention should be placed during\n            project design on a) investments; b) holistic designs; c)\n            monitoring and evaluation systems; and d) sustainability.\n            Support for local contractors needs to be improved,\n            especially when fostering development of a new set of\n            private sector companies. Decentralization of responsibility\n            for the road network - if not well orchestrated - is likely\n            to have an adverse effect on the sustainability of the\n            strategic road networks and the smooth function of road\n            transport. Reforms in the road user charging system are\n            critical to ensure sustainable financing of road\n            maintenance. Bridge opening delays have a major effect on\n            users by creating prolonged traffic bottlenecks in key locations."}, "docdt": "1999-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
