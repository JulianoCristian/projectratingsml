Agency
Financing Data    IBRD Variable Spread Loan, US$300 million

Operation Type    The second single tranche operation of a multiple year programmatic development policy loan series.
Main Policy
                  Institutional Strengthening, Domestic Transport and Trade, and International Trade
Areas
                  The proposed Second Connectivity Development Policy Loan (DPL) continues to support the reform efforts
                  that were initiated through the previous Connectivity DPL. The proposed operation is expected to deepen the
                  reform efforts towards the following targeted outcomes by 2014:
                   Strengthened National Coordination and Regulation, as demonstrated through increased Government
                     effectiveness and rapidity in supporting infrastructure development, and use of the Viability Gap
Key Outcome          Financing;
Indicators         Strengthened intra-island connectivity, as measured by effective application of the legal and regulatory
                     frameworks for land acquisition, clear PSO compensation for the railway operator and use of performance
                     based contracts in the national road network;
                   Improved inter-island connectivity, as measured through increased share of Indonesian population with
                     broadband access and informed policy-making on sea port development; and
                   Improved international connectivity through improved customs and border management in facilitating
                     trade.
                  The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 supports the broader goal of the 2013-15 CPS, which is to enhance
                  Indonesia’s domestic capacity for reducing poverty and boosting equitable and sustainable prosperity. The
                  CPS highlights the Connectivity DPL program as a key World Bank Group instrument, particularly in the
                  pro-growth engagement area, by promoting prosperity through enhanced connectivity, strengthened
                  competitiveness and promotion of infrastructure development.

                  The overall goal of the proposed Connectivity DPL program is to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI)
                  to strengthen the policy framework for improved national trade logistics, transportation, ICT, and trade
                  facilitation. Policy reforms supported by this operation will focus on the following pillars:

                  (i)   Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation through establishment of regulatory and
Program
                        institutional frameworks for improved coordination and effectiveness in implementation of the
Development
                        connectivity agenda;
Objective(s)
                  (ii) Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity through improved connectivity among and between growth
and
                        poles, with improved regulatory framework for land acquisition for public purpose development and
Contribution to
                        optimal use of resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of island-transport network;
CPS
                  (iii) Improving Inter-island Connectivity through improved access, efficiencies and service performance
                        in ICT and domestic shipping; and
                  (iv) Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation) by strengthening the institutions and
                        processes in handling traffic and trade volume.

                  The proposed Second Connectivity DPL (Connectivity DPL-2) continues the reform efforts supported by the
                  previous Connectivity DPL, which emerged as part of the revamping of the core DPL series that had been
                  implemented since 2004. With that, three separate DPL series emerged in 2012: Institutional Strengthening
                  and Social Inclusion (INSTANSI-DPL), Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and Investment Climate
                  Reform and Modernization DPL (FIRM -DPL). To date, the GoI has made formal request to continue with
                  only two of these DPL series, namely the Connectivity DPL-2 and INSTANSI DPL-2.


                                                          i
                    Macoreconomic risks could disrupt the potential to implement the reforms supported through the
                     Connectivity DPL-2 Recently, Indonesia has seen increasing pressures on its external accounts, with the
                     current account deficit widening after a negative terms-of-trade shock and international financing
                     conditions becoming more uncertain. Recent shifts in market sentiment have resulted in sudden, large
                     and potentially disruptive reversals of capital inflows. The external accounts and growth outlook remain
                     sensitive to softening global commodity prices and demand, particularly from China. With portfolio
                     investors focusing on near-term policy responses, there is a risk that this diverts attention from longer-
                     term reforms. However, the GoI has adopted key policy measures aimed towards improving national
                     connectivity, as supported by the ongoing DPL series, which are expected to help shield the risk of a
                     crisis, and mitigate the impact of any economic downturns on households. The Government has
                     developed a track record in precautionary and proactive measures to try to counter such shocks. This
                     includes, for example, policy measures supported under the PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012,
                     which, along with parallel facilities from other development partners, also explicitly aims to mitigate
                     GoI financing concerns in the face of a crisis. The Government has also been quick to introduce a
                     package aimed primarily at longer-term structural measures to support exports and employment,
                     moderate import growth, while limiting food price pressures. This has been accompanied by a tightening
                     in monetary policy. There remain questions over the implementation of the policy package and it is
                     likely that further policy adjustments will be required. However, there is the potential that the current
                     macro-economic pressures that Indonesia is facing could allow policymakers the opportunity to make
                     progress on medium-term structural reforms, although this must be offset against the political pressures
                     in the run-up to the 2014 elections.
                    Bureaucratic complexity can hinder coordination and implementation of the reform agenda in
                     Connectivity, which may exacerbate as the election period approaches. First, the multiplicity of
                     implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities could create a challenge in coordinating
                     and implementing the reform efforts. Second, overlapping authorities among national and local
                     governments in setting policies affecting domestic connectivity, such as infrastructure investment and
                     transport policy, can slow down or even derail policy reforms. Although the proposed Connectivity DPL
Risks and Risk
                     is expected to help address this critical issue, the results of such a reform process will largely depend on
Mitigation
                     priorities that were developed and consensus involving the various agencies and stakeholders. Third, the
                     Connectivity DPL will engage agencies that have not been regularly participating in previous DPL
                     programs. All of these challenges will increase as the election period approaches and uncertainty over
                     institutional roles in the next administration increases. To mitigate those risks, the proposed actions
                     under the first pillar of this DPL are expected to strengthen inter-agency coordination and effectiveness
                     in the policymaking process. Equally important, the Connectivity DPL series has been benefiting from a
                     high level support from the Vice Minister of Bappenas, who is also the Chair of the Connectivity
                     Working Group, to ensure that the reform agenda spelled out in this DPL is on track. Past experience
                     also indicates continued GoI commitment to reforms overall, regardless of election outcomes.

                    Inconsistencies in implementing regulations could potentially disrupt the Government’s
                     achievement of its medium-term development objectives. Regulatory certainty is a key driver of
                     investment, as firms need to rely on a consistent policy environment in order make decisions on whether
                     to invest or expand their businesses. As such, it is critical that the Government ensure a consistent policy
                     environment if Indonesia is to meet its medium-term economic development and poverty reduction
                     goals. In recent years, however, recent policy announcements have raised some concerns about the
                     direction of trade and investment policymaking. These measures include, for example, restrictions on
                     imported horticulture products, and new divestment regulations and processing requirements in the
                     mining sector. While the aims of these policies may originate in the development objectives of
                     promoting domestic productivity, jobs and growth, their presentation, which has often been changing,
                     highlights coordination and communication issues. As well as the uncertain effectiveness of these
                     policies to meet the stated objectives, there is concern that the expansion of such policies could weaken
                     the confidence of investors in the domestic economic outlook. The risk to the Connectivity DPL is that
                     the continuation of such policies, along with other perceived "policy missteps", could weaken some of
                     the confidence of investors in domestic policymaking, potentially offsetting some of the benefits of the
                     reforms supported in this operation. In August 2013 the Government overturned import volume
                     restrictions on horticulture and beef as part of efforts to curb inflationary pressure. The Government also
                     seeks to relax restrictions on exports of raw minerals. Given that the Indonesian economy is adjusting to

                                                          ii
                   recent external and macroeconomic pressures, the DPL program, along with the Bank’s technical
                   assistance on trade and investment climate, is expected to strengthen policy dialogue with key GoI
                   counterparts, contributing to stronger GoI coordination and consultation in key reform areas.

                  While the new regulatory framework on land acquisition for public use represents a substantial
                   improvement over the previous process, and should make a positive contribution to development
                   objectives, there are some risks associated with the coordination of executing agencies to fully meet
                   the spirit of the new legal framework, including interpretation of the new legal framework among
                   the various government levels. For acquisition of private lands for public infrastructure, the new
                   regulatory framework deals only with legitimate owners of such private lands and not with people living
                   without formal title on private lands. Although the regulatory framework mentions cash or relocation as
                   options for compensating squatters living in state lands, the absence of a clear process for the
                   government to facilitate relocation will likely to cause the government to rely mostly on cash
                   compensation. Nevertheless, the new legal framework for land acquisition for public use provides
                   greater certainty, due process, and compensation for people whose land is acquired by the Government,
                   pursuant to the referred framework, including recognizing squatters in good faith on state lands. The
                   implementing regulations that were recently issued also provide more clarity over implementation of the
                   new legal framework. While these represent positive developments, many challenges remain. Several
                   civil society organizations voiced concerns over aspects of this framework and brought a legal challenge
                   to the Constitutional Court, which was ultimately ruled against. That challenge, which itself is a sign of
                   the maturation of Indonesian institutions, may well result in an even more inclusive and transparent
                   implementation of the legal framework for land acquisition for public use by the Government. The
                   National Law Agency (BPN) has been selected as focal point for implementing the process of land
                   acquisition for public use. The Government of Indonesia is improving BPN’ s capacity through
                   development and training programs to strengthen the implementation of the land acquisition process for
                   public use at all levels.

    1.    The proposed Second Connectivity Development Policy Loan (Connectivity DPL-2) to
Indonesia for US$300 million is aimed at supporting the Government’s reform agenda on
connectivity. Enhancing domestic connectivity within and between the different islands of the archipelago
and further strengthening Indonesia’s global connectivity are crucial to the realization of Indonesia’s
development objectives. The Government’s ambitious Master Plan for the “Acceleration and Expansion of
Indonesia’s Economic Development 2011-2025” (MP3EI) considers connectivity as the lever to: (i) unleash
the growth potential and prosperity across various economic corridors in Indonesia; (ii) connect lagging
regions to urban growth poles to share prosperity more widely; and (iii) reduce poverty by increasing
opportunities, market reach and economies of scale. Improving connectivity is also crucial if Indonesia is to
gain the most from the process of regional economic integration. Indonesia is embracing full implementation
of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015 and is actively exploring a framework to promote
more integration with Asia through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and with
countries in the Asia Pacific through APEC. Improved connectivity will increase Indonesia’s capacity to
respond to opportunities, boost cost competitiveness of businesses, and strengthen its attractiveness to
investment.

    2.      The Government’s ambition and efforts are, however, strongly hampered by complex
institutional and regulatory issues. Specifically, difficulties in coordinating the actions of multiple
government agencies and other stakeholders, regulatory weaknesses in many areas (e.g., land acquisition for
public infrastructure projects) and insufficient mechanisms for private sector participation are key
hindrances. Annual budget allocations to infrastructure development are often left largely unspent due to
these challenges. Addressing them upfront is therefore expected to accelerate connectivity. The proposed
DPL thus aims to support the deepening of the policy, regulatory and institutional framework for improved
national trade logistics, transportation, information and communication technology (ICT) and trade
facilitation following the first phase of the operation completed last year.

    3.     Significant progress has been achieved since the launch of the Connectivity DPL program
last year. The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 continues the series of the single-tranche Connectivity DPL-1
that began in 2012. The program has contributed to strengthening policy dialogue by bringing key
government agencies to support a series of reform packages on connectivity. This Second Connectivity DPL
is envisioned to continue to deepen the reforms that were initiated since the onset of the Connectivity DPL
program last year. To ensure full ownership of the program, a detailed mapping of the programmatic series
has been developed jointly with Bappenas, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and relevant line
ministries/agencies.

       4.     As in the DPL-1, the proposed operation is structured around four pillars:

i)          Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation through the establishment of regulatory
            and institutional frameworks for improved coordination and implementation of the connectivity
            agenda;
ii)         Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity through improved connectivity among and between
            growth poles, with an improved regulatory framework for land acquisition for public purpose
            development and the optimal use of resources for sustainable improvements to, and maintenance of,
            the island-transport network;
iii)        Improving Inter-island Connectivity through strengthened ICT connectivity between eastern and
            western Indonesia and more competition in broadband services; and improving the efficiency of
            domestic shipping, which is crucial to lowering logistics costs in an archipelago like Indonesia; and
iv)         Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation) by strengthening the institutions and
            processes in handling traffic and trade volume.

                                                         1
    5.    The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 operation is fully consistent with the World Bank’s
strategic goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. Indonesia has made significant
progress towards reducing poverty, with the national poverty rate halved from 24 percent in 1999 to 12
percent in 2012 thanks to sustained strong economic growth. However, despite robust growth the rate of
poverty reduction has been slowing in recent years, and the degree of vulnerability among many non-poor
households remains high, thereby highlighting the relevance of the World Bank’s strategic goals to end
extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. In this respect, as mentioned above, the Connectivity DPL
is expected to be among the key instruments to achieve these goals, by accelerating growth to 7 percent and
above, facilitating a structural transformation, and linking lagging regions with their nearest growth centers.
Reforms supported under this DPL operation are expected to lead to improvements in Indonesia’s public
services and institutional capacity to advance the connectivity agenda, which can translate available
resources into better development outcomes.

    6.    The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 operation forms an integral part of Indonesia’s broader
program lending. Supporting Indonesia’s relatively ambitious policy reforms is at the core of the World
Bank’s program in Indonesia. In light of the deepening engagements in several priority areas, three sectoral
DPLs emerged in 2012 at the request of GoI (INSTANSI DPL, Connectivity DPL and Financial Sector and
Investment Climate Reform and Modernization/FIRM DPL). The sectoral operation is an integral part of an
approach that aims to maximize synergies across the Bank’s program in Indonesia, increase ownership of
the reforms by the relevant institutions, and improve targeting of complementary technical assistance
programs. The proposed operation also builds on previous policy reform support such as the Infrastructure
DPL (closed in FY11), and the Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF DDO) and the PERISAI DPL-
DDO, both of which provide critical support to Indonesia during periods of heightened global financial
uncertainty. Furthermore, the proposed operation also continues to complement the World Bank assistance
to Indonesia, which is provided through a variety of instruments (i.e. investment projects, technical
assistance, and advisory services).

     7.    As elaborated below, the implementation of the proposed operation occurs as Indonesia’s
economy and policy settings are now adjusting to a number of external and macroeconomic pressures.
These include weak export performance contributing to the notable deterioration in the current account
balance; volatile external financing conditions; higher subsidized fuel prices and associated temporary
inflation; and a moderation in domestic demand growth. Monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy
adjustments so far have been significant, but more may be required, combined with strong communication
and coordination of policies. Ongoing pressures on the external balances, and the prospects of a less
supportive international environment with higher global interest rates and less buoyant commodity demand,
underscore the need for more policy reforms in a number of areas to support faster and more inclusive
growth and poverty reduction, notably the regulatory environment and in manufacturing and trade policy.
Nevertheless, the overall macroeconomic policy framework is proving to be generally responsive to the risk
of macroeconomic imbalances, thereby remains adequate for continued support through a development
policy operation. Policy buffers, although reduced, remain ample, and the structural underpinnings of
resilient growth remain in place, suggesting a favorable medium-term outlook for Indonesia. The reforms
supported by the proposed operation are expected to also support Indonesia’s medium-term outlook, for
instance by enhancing private sector confidence in the regulatory framework for participation in Indonesia’s
ambitious infrastructure projects aimed at strengthening connectivity. More generally, in an environment in
which external pressures are affecting emerging economies such as Indonesia, improvements in
infrastructure and the investment climate can help strengthen the path to recovery such that inflows are put
to productive use and are shifted towards more stable forms such as FDI.

    8.    The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 was previously envisioned to be the second of a two-year,
programmatic DPL series. Notwithstanding, the Government has recently indicated the possibility of
continuing the engagement through a follow-on Connectivity DPL operation. Ideas on policy reforms in

                                                      2
connectivity have emerged and will need to be adjusted and refined as progress is made and discussions with
the GoI counterparts evolve.

                                       II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

    A. The Current State of the Indonesian Economy

    9.     Following a resilient economic performance since the global financial crisis, Indonesia’s
economy and policy settings are now adjusting to a number of domestic and external pressures : weak
export performance contributing to a notable deterioration in the current account balance, volatile external
financing conditions, higher subsidized fuel prices and associated temporary inflation, and a moderation in
domestic demand growth. Monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy adjustments so far have been quite
significant, but more may be required, combined with strong communication and coordination of policies.
Ongoing pressures on the external balances, and the prospects of a less supportive international environment
with higher global interest rates and less buoyant commodity demand, underscore the need for more policy
reforms in a number of areas to support faster and more inclusive growth and poverty reduction, notably the
regulatory environment and in manufacturing and trade policy.

    10. The Indonesian economy has performed strongly over the past decade. Real annual GDP
growth averaged 5.7 percent from 2003 to 2012, lifting real GDP per capita by 54 percent to US$ 3,563 (in
2012 US dollars). This solid performance was underpinned by sustained domestic private demand growth,
fueled by favorable demographics (a growing labor force and falling dependency ratio), accompanied by
rapid urbanization and a growing domestic market. Consumer and investor confidence levels, and the
availability of investment funding, were supported by prudent macroeconomic management which, along
with strong economic growth, resulted in greatly improved private and public sector balance sheets.
International demand for Indonesia’s abundant natural resources, particularly from emerging economies
such as China, also played its part, with around two-thirds of exports commodity-related.

     11. The economy proved resilient to the 2008/9 global financial crisis and the subsequent slow
and uneven recovery in high-income economies. Growth slowed from 6.0 percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent
in 2009, but subsequently rebounded and has remained in the 5.8-6.5 percent range in every quarter since
the beginning of 2010. This resilience can be attributed to strong initial conditions going into the crisis, the
related availability and deployment of sizable fiscal and monetary buffers to cushion the shock, and
Indonesia’s lower dependence on external demand relative to many of its regional peers. Consumer inflation
also moderated, from an average of 8.7 percent per year in 2003-08 to 4.9 percent in 2009-12, helped by the
absence of any major food or administered price shocks through mid-2013. This solid performance, which
contributed to Fitch and Moody’s returning Indonesia to investment grade status in late 2011 and early 2012,
attracted strong investor interest, fueled by abundant global liquidity. However, portfolio investment
inflows, although generally strong, were prone to bouts of significant volatility, providing a reminder that
Indonesia remains susceptible to external shocks through the financial channel, given high foreign
ownership shares of both stocks and bonds. Inbound foreign direct investment also trended higher,
contributing to rapid investment growth rates through 2012 (with fixed investment expenditure reaching one
third of nominal GDP).

    12. Indonesia’s economy, having been hit by a negative trade shock as global commodity prices
and demand have fallen since 2011, is now showing signs of a slowdown. Over 2012, the major drag on
growth was net exports, with export volumes rising just 2.0 percent but import volumes increasing by a
more robust 6.7 percent, reflecting the strength of domestic demand; net exports consequently reduced
growth in 2012 by 1.5 percentage points. Investment growth also fell over the second half of 2012, and by
the start of 2013 had become the main driver of the overall GDP growth moderation, decelerating from 12.5
percent yoy in Q2 2012 to 4.7 percent yoy in Q2 2013. The main cause of weaker investment growth has
been a sharp slowdown in machinery and equipment spending, reflected in falls in capital goods imports.

                                                       3
Fixed investment has shown a strong historical link with commodity sector conditions, and the softening in
international commodity prices since early 2011 has likely now filtered into investment. On the production
side, weakness is concentrated in commodities sectors, such as mining and quarrying (contracting 1.2
percent yoy in Q2 2013), compared with more robust performance in manufacturing (up 5.8 percent),
construction (up 6.9 percent), and especially the services sector (up 7.5 percent).

     13. The negative commodity-related shock to exports has resulted in a sharp weakening in the
trade balance. The annual goods trade balance declined from US$ 34.8 billion in 2011 to US$ 8.6 billion in
2012, reflecting weaker merchandise export values (down 6.0 percent in 2012) coupled with ongoing growth
in merchandise imports (which rose by 8.0 percent in 2012). Pressure on the trade balance has persisted so
far in 2013, with export revenues down 6.1 percent yoy in H1 2013, and import values down a more modest
2.2 percent yoy, resulting in a cumulative trade deficit of US$ 3.3 billion (compared with a US$ 512 million
surplus in H1 2012). Initially, most of the swing in the trade balance could be attributed to the erosion of the
non-oil and gas trade surplus, but since mid-2012 the oil and gas trade deficit has also widened substantially,
having previously tended to be close to neutral.

     14. This has contributed to a marked deterioration in Indonesia’s current account balance since
2011. In 2012 Indonesia recorded its first annual current account deficit since 1997, of US$ 24.2 billion or
2.8 percent of GDP, compared with a small surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Pressure on the current
account has persisted in 2013, with quarterly deficits of US$ 5.8 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) and US$ 9.8
billion (4.4 percent of GDP) recorded in Q1 and Q2. While the bulk of this swing has been due to the
erosion of Indonesia’s historically strong goods trade surpluses, sizable structural deficits on the services
trade and, especially, income sub-accounts, which have been broadly flat over recent quarters, also continue
to weigh on the overall current account balance.

    15. The re-emergence of current account deficits has placed an increased focus on the
availability and quality of external financing, with Indonesia having tended to run a basic balance of
payments deficit on a quarterly basis since late 2011, despite robust FDI inflows (of US$ 20 billion in 2012
and US$ 8.3 billion in H1 2013). Portfolio investment remains volatile and reported private external debt
has also risen significantly, almost doubling since 2008 to be US$ 131 billion in May 2013, and while
external debt solvency metrics remain sound (with total external debt to GDP standing at 28.7 percent of
GDP at the end of 2012 according to official estimates), gross external funding needs have consequently


                                                              4
increased significantly. External debt disbursements and principal repayments totaled US$ 184.4 billion and
US$ 164.3 billion, respectively, in 2012.

    16. Indonesian asset markets have been significantly affected by the recent pullback in emerging
asset markets globally, following the pricing-in of QE “tapering” in the US since early May.
Particularly sharp falls in Indonesian asset prices were seen from mid-August (with an 8.6 percent decline in
the equity market over 19-20 August). The rupiah has been under pressure, depreciating by 12.2 percent
over August and September, to IDR 11,532 per US dollar (down 19.2 percent since the start of the year).
Rupiah-denominated government bond yields have been volatile and, though off their recent peaks at the
end of August, remain up 220 to 300 basis points since the start of 2013). The context for these market
moves has been one involving the release of weak domestic data, particularly on the second quarter balance
of payments, and ongoing domestic and international policy adjustments.

    17. The macro policy adjustments to these recent pressures are ongoing, but have been seen in
both fiscal and monetary policies. On fiscal policy, the revised Budget for 2013 increased the targeted
deficit by 0.7 percentage points to 2.4 percent of GDP, on the back of weaker revenue growth (in line with
moderating nominal GDP growth and weak export revenues). Most notably, the Government increased
subsidized fuel prices in June for the first time since 2005, increasing the subsidized petrol price by 44
percent to IDR 6,500 per liter and the subsidized diesel price by 22 percent to IDR 5,500 per liter (still well
below the market price at the time of over IDR 9,000 per liter). This price rise, which followed the missed
opportunity to follow through on proposed reform in 2012, marked a major step forward in increasing the
quality of public spending and safeguarding fiscal sustainability. The impact on the poor was cushioned by a
significant temporary compensation package for 2013, amounting to just under IDR 30 trillion.

    18. The increase in subsidized fuel prices, while welcome, has contributed to a rise in inflation.
Headline inflation rose sharply to 8.6 percent yoy in July and then 8.8 percent in August, up from 5.9
percent yoy in June and well above the ceiling of Bank Indonesia’s 3.5-5.5 percent target band. These
moves also reflected the seasonal impact of Ramadan. Prices fell and yoy inflation came down to 8.4 percent
in September. The one-off impact of the subsidized fuel price increase is expected to abate fairly rapidly in
the coming months (in month-on-month terms, before dropping out of the base by Q3 2014) although

                                                               5
pressures may remain from second-round effects or from the exchange rate pass through. Core inflation,
although moderate, has picked up somewhat, moving to 4.7 percent yoy in September, from 4 percent in
June.

    19. In response to the deterioration in financial markets, and significant pressure on the rupiah,
the Government announced a policy package in mid-August. The package has four pillars: (1) Improving
the current account balance. This involves measures to encourage exports, such as fiscal incentives for
export-oriented firms in labor-intensive sectors and relaxing the quota on mineral exports, and measures to
reduce import growth, such as increasing the required use of bio-diesel in the domestic energy consumption
mix. (2) Maintaining economic growth and employment, including fiscal incentives to support labor-
intensive sectors, aiming to limit lay-offs. Notably, revisions are also proposed to the setting of the
minimum wage in support of a more rational process and fairer outcome. (3) Lowering inflation, including
replacing quotas with tariffs for imports of beef and horticulture products. (4) Enhancing investment to
support both growth and capital inflows, including measures to simplify licensing, to expedite the approval
of the Revised Negative Investment List, and to move forward with “debottlenecking” key strategic
investment projects. While focused on many of the important structural issues faced by the economy, the
implementation, both in terms of timing and substance, will clearly be key in determining the impact of the
package.

    20. Ahead of the recent period of adjustment, monetary policy was highly accommodative . Key
policy rates remained unchanged from February 2012, when Bank Indonesia cut the lower bound of its
interest rate corridor to a record low of 4 percent, and June 2013. In mid-2012, however, BI announced new
loan-to-value limits for vehicle and real estate lending, and this appears to have contributed to a decline in
credit growth from a peak of 26 percent in May, to a still robust 22 percent in August 2013. These macro
prudential adjustments also reflected the pronounced price pressures in some pockets of the property market
(e.g. residential apartments, commercial office, and industrial space, in Jakarta up 45 percent, 43 percent and
22 percent, respectively, yoy in December 2012). The macroeconomic stability risks posed by such sharp
property price increases are mitigated by the fact that overall property-related exposures in the banking
system remain comparatively small at 14 percent of total bank assets, and by BI’s prudential measures.

    21. Since June 2013 the monetary policy stance has shifted markedly towards tightening , in line
with the focus on facilitating the adjustment in external balances and limiting inflationary pressures. Pre-
empting the increase in subsidized fuel prices, and with pressure on the rupiah intensifying since May, BI
surprised markets on June 11 by increasing its overnight deposit facility (FASBI) rate by 25 basis points,
followed by a 25 basis point increase in its reference rate at its subsequent June policy meeting. This was
followed by a 50 basis point increase in these key policy rates in July. However, policy rates were left
unchanged in August and this raised some concerns in the markets, even though new macro prudential
measures were also announced. Following the release of weak second quarter balance of payments statistics
and intensifying downward pressure on the rupiah, the FASBI and reference rates were lifted by a further 50
basis points at an extraordinary policy meeting held on August 29 (in addition, the upper bound of the
interest rate corridor, the BI lending facility rate, was also increased by 25 basis points). This was followed
by a further 25 basis point increase in the FASBI, reference and lending facility rates at the scheduled
meeting on September 12. Thus, since June 2013, BI has raised its overnight deposit facility (FASBI), and
reference, rates by 150 basis points (to 5.5 and 7.25 percent, respectively), and its key lending rate by 50
basis points (to 7.25 percent). A number of macro prudential measures with a tightening bias, and steps to
facilitate liquidity management, have also been taken: loan-to-deposit limits have been lowered from 100 to
90 percent, both government bonds and BI certificates of deposit have been allowed to be counted against
banks’ secondary reserve requirements, and shorter tenor BI deposit securities have been introduced.

    22. Exchange rate policy has remained flexible in as much as the rupiah has been allowed to
depreciate through mid-2013, but improving currency market liquidity and transparency remains a
challenge. Foreign currency reserve growth stalled in 2012 (compared with growth of US$ 14 billion in

                                                      6
2011), and the rupiah has weakened materially, with the nominal effective exchange rate trending lower
since late 2010, to lose 11.8 percent between its late 2010 peak and July 2013. August has seen further,
pronounced currency weakness, as also seen in many other major emerging markets (such as Brazil, India
and Turkey), taking the rupiah’s depreciation over 2013 through the end of August to 15 percent, and 19.2
through the end of September. While the depreciation has mostly been gradual and orderly, there have been
some periods (in mid-2011, early 2012, early 2013 and July and August 2013) of very tight foreign currency
liquidity, leading to a wide spread between official and market-quoted rupiah spot rates. Foreign currency
demand in the commercial currency markets was cut early in 2012 by BI’s decision to meet the US dollar
needs of the state-owned oil company (Pertamina) directly, a move which coincided with a stabilization of
the US$/IDR exchange rate, but was also followed by a substantial drawdown in currency reserves, which
fell from US$ 112.8 billion in December 2012 to just below US$ 105 billion in March 2013. Following the
bout of global emerging market volatility and outflows beginning in May and continuing into the third
quarter, reserves have subsequently fallen further, to US$ 93 billion in August 2013.

    23. Recent measures by BI may help somewhat to improve currency market conditions . These
include: initiating US Dollar swap auctions to deepen hedging opportunities and, potentially, dampen spot
US Dollar demand at times of market uncertainty, reversing the 2011 regulation that imposed a minimum 6-
month holding period for foreign investors purchasing BI bills (SBIs) by cutting the required holding period
to 1 month, and increasing official foreign exchange buffers, by extending a US$ 12 billion-equivalent swap
facility with the Bank of Japan (in late August) and US$ 16 billion-equivalent swap facility with the
People’s Bank of China (in October), and announcing a new US$ 16 billion-equivalent swap facility with
the Bank of Korea (also in October).

     24. Despite the recent pressures in the financial markets, slowdown of growth and depreciation
of the rupiah, Indonesian banks have shown resilience to the impact of recent developments. Bank
credit growth is slowing with the rise in new loan approvals weakening. Overall aggregate level banking
health indicators remain sound, with low non-performing loans of 2 percent, and high capital adequacy of 18
percent have proven to serve as buffers. Another factor limiting the impact has been banks’ relatively low
foreign-currency exposures. However, despite this sound financial performance to date, the banking sector
could still face pressure from further decelerating growth or additional market turmoil in upcoming months.
Such pressures may well impact on smaller banks more markedly, with reports of some tightening in their
liquidity in recent months, leading them to raise deposit rates. Substantial efforts have been made to improve
crisis communication and protocols among the various institutions (BI, MoF, the new unified financial
supervisory authority, OJK, and the deposit insurance agency). However, the transition to the new unified
financial supervisory agency, OJK, and the absence of a financial sector safety net law do raise potential
risks on the policy response should any systemic bank enter liquidity difficulties. Financing conditions for
non-bank corporates have also tightened. Again, while leverage levels remain low, the concern is more of
the potential for increased borrowing and repayment costs, particularly for those corporates with external
debt without a natural currency hedge, or who have been impacted by declines in global commodity prices.

B. Macroeconomic Outlook

    25. Growth prospects have dimmed appreciably and risks to the outlook have risen. In the base
case, GDP growth is expected to shift down fairly moderately, responding to weaker terms of trade, higher
interest rates and the negative impact of higher inflation on consumption. This expected, moderate
deceleration would be broadly positive for safeguarding macroeconomic stability, and particularly for
reducing the current account deficit to more sustainable levels in the context of subdued export performance
and tighter international liquidity conditions. However, a more severe growth deceleration cannot be ruled
out, with specific risks including a more disorderly currency adjustment and financial market volatility
having a more pronounced impact on real economic activity.

                                                           8
    26. GDP growth in 2013 is projected to be 5.6 percent, down from 6.2 percent in 2012, and
moving down to 5.3 percent in 2014. Private consumption is expected to remain the main driver of growth,
potentially boosted by early pre-election spending towards the end of 2013 and into 2014. Investment is
expected to expand at a much more moderate pace than in 2012. Unlike 2012, net exports are not expected
to be a significant drag on growth over 2013, as import volume growth decelerates in line with slower
investment growth, and export volume growth remains positive, albeit sluggish. The 2013 growth projection
of 5.6 percent is higher than the IMF assessment letter projection of 5.4 percent, reflecting a difference in
the profiling of the feed-through of recent policy tightening, moderation in credit growth and financial
market developments to growth (with the IMF figure expecting a sharper slowdown in the second half of
2013). Based on recent higher frequency data, the World Bank expects such impacts to flow through with a
slightly longer lag. Looking forward to 2015, growth is expected to rise to 5.8 percent, although there is a
substantial range of uncertainty around this baseline and risk of moving to a lower growth trajectory. Such
risk could materialize in the absence of progress in addressing well-known impediments to medium-term
growth in Indonesia and sufficiently supportive external conditions (in terms of trade and FDI inflows in
particular).

    27. The current account deficit is expected to widen in 2013, to US$ 29 billion, or 3.4 percent of
GDP, before narrowing in 2014 to 2.6 percent of GDP. The overall balance of payments is expected to
record a sizable deficit in 2013, reflecting a shortfall in net investment inflows relative to the current account
funding need, and resulting in a drawdown of about US$ 20 billion in foreign currency reserves. The overall
balance of payments deficit is expected to shrink significantly in 2014, reflecting a smaller current account
deficit and sustained overall net investment inflows.

    28. Inflation pressures are expected to abate after the mid-2013 price surge triggered by the
June subsidized fuel price increase and the seasonal impact of Ramadan. Headline inflation in Q4 2013
is projected at 9.8 percent compared with 4.4 percent in Q4 2012, and inflation to average 7.3 percent in
2013 and 6.7 percent in 2014. This base case assumes that second-round inflation will remain contained,
allowing the price impact of the June fuel price increase to drop out of the base by mid-2014. However,
while core inflation has so far remained little-changed, there is a clear risk of some second-round effects
from the recent spike in headline inflation, particularly given other cost-push inflation pressures.
Exceptionally high minimum wage increases for 2013 were granted (including 44 percent for Greater
Jakarta), and while the direct impact of this on the CPI basket is very small, such increases may feed into
higher wages across the economy and hence spill over into consumer prices, particularly if reinforced by
sizable additional minimum wage increases for 2014. More pass-through from the significant nominal
depreciation of the rupiah can also not be ruled out. A further uncertainty for inflation is the possibility of
additional reforms to administered prices, notably fuel subsidies. While welcome on equity, efficiency and
fiscal grounds, the possibility of additional measures adds upside, albeit largely temporary, inflation risk.
Bank Indonesia will need to gauge the risk of these supply-side factors feeding through into higher
generalized inflation, which may necessitate further tightening monetary policy.

    29. Risks to the growth outlook are to the downside, given uncertainties over consumer and
investor confidence, and downside risks to domestic demand growth. While domestic demand has
remained resilient so far, the headwinds have mounted since June: higher fuel prices and higher generalized
consumer price inflation in recent months (eroding purchasing power and consumer confidence), higher
interest rates (dampening hitherto rapid credit growth), and potential negative wealth and corporate
investment activity impacts from the stock price declines seen since May. These increased challenges are
occurring against the backdrop of a continued weakening in international commodity prices, with the US
dollar price basket of Indonesia’s top six commodity export products declining by 8 percent in 2013 through
August (down 35 percent from the post global financial peak reached in February 2011). Commodity prices
are a key driver of domestic demand conditions, due to their importance for export revenues, company
profits, and for household incomes in parts of the country where the resources sector is important for labor

                                                        9
income, such as oil palm growing regions. Looking further ahead into 2014, investment is likely to face
some headwinds from the ongoing failure to address regulatory issues, some policy missteps, and general
uncertainties surrounding the electoral process and outcome as the 2014 elections draw nearer. Indonesia
also continues to face competition from its peers in the region for export-oriented investment, at a time when
labor costs, at least for minimum wage workers, have risen sharply.

     30. Indonesia’s fiscal and monetary policy settings will need to continue to adjust to a shifting
macroeconomic outlook. Monetary policy faces the challenge of recalibrating interest and exchanges rates
so as to improve the external balances, and guarding against a build-up of inflationary pressures due to
supply-side price increases (from higher subsidized fuel prices and the weaker currency), without unduly
crimping economic growth and weakening public and private sector balance sheets. The interest rate and
exchange rate increases seen so far over 2013 argue that the monetary policy stance has indeed been shifting
in the right direction, although more will likely be needed. On the fiscal side, policy planning will need to
account for the persistence of slower revenue growth and higher nominal debt-financing costs, placing
further focus on the need to lift the quality of spending, in terms of its technical and allocative efficiency,
and so as to meet the Government’s development objectives. The 2014 Budget, scheduled to be approved by
late October 2013, will provide an important gauge of how fiscal policy is adjusting, with the adoption of
realistic macroeconomic assumptions, continuation of the hitherto prudent overall fiscal stance, and
continued emphasis on redirecting spending away from energy subsidies and towards capital expenditures,
being desirable (including a move towards further subsidy reform, although this may prove difficult to
achieve given the 2014 elections).

    31. Management of the external balance will be a particularly key challenge and the projection
of stable macroeconomic performance is predicated on the avoidance of significant policy missteps in
this area, as well as more clarity and implementation progress on the Government’s response package
(outlined above). With many of the policies likely to realize an impact only in the medium term, many
investors and commentators felt they did not go far enough to bring about a near-term adjustment in the
external balances through dampening domestic demand. These fears appear to have been allayed, at least in
the short term, by the subsequent rate increase by BI. However, more information on the substantive content
of the proposals is still needed, and the degree to which they are seen as being mutually consistent across
government, and the manner in which they are implemented, will matter. Investor risk perceptions will
likely hinge, in particular, on the extent to which policymakers are seen to be tolerant of somewhat lower
domestic demand growth in order to ease balance of payments pressures, making policy coordination and
communication paramount, particularly against the backdrop of an intensifying political cycle. Should they
be implemented, a number of specific measures mooted in the policy package to encourage investment, such
as a less restrictive negative investment list (DNI, governing the restrictions on foreign investment by
sector), have the potential to send a positive signal to the market by helping create positive expectations in
terms of future FDI flows, and thus bring more stability to the currency market.

    32. In the event of further negative external shocks, Indonesia will feel the effects through the
trade, financial and domestic confidence channels, but is in a relatively strong position to respond.
Monitoring and coordination mechanisms are in place to facilitate a flexible response to major market
dislocations, with the Forum for the Coordination of Financial Sector Stability having met to discuss
developments since financial market conditions began to deteriorate in May 2013, and the BOP monitoring
task force of the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia having been reactivated to monitor bank liquidity,
FX liquidity and short-term debt exposures.

    33. On both the fiscal and external sectors, the focus is more on ensuring adequate near-term
financing than concerns over medium-term debt sustainability. Private external debt has trended
upwards, but was under 30 percent of GDP at the end of 2012, supporting external debt solvency metrics.
However, as mentioned, Indonesia’s gross external financing needs are substantial, and those arising from
the servicing and repayment of external debt are considerably larger than those generated by the current

                                                      10
account deficit. Gross external debt repayments in Q2 2013 totaled US$ 43.1 billion versus a quarterly
current account deficit of US$ 9.8 billion. Tighter external financing conditions and Rupiah depreciation
make for a more costly and challenging environment for refinancing existing external debt, over half of
which (or 15 percent of GDP) now consists of private external debt. This is particularly the case for
corporates without access to natural currency hedges (through US Dollar revenues) and those heavily
exposed to the recent weakening in global commodity prices. Official gross reserves of US$ 95.7 billion at
end-September, while well down from their recent high of US$ 124.6 billion in August 2011, remain more
than sufficient to cover Indonesia’s short-term external financing needs, despite the ratio of short-term
external debt to official reserves having risen from 40 percent to around 50 percent at end-2011. However,
more importantly, external liquidity risks have risen, with the debt service ratio rising to 80 percent in June
2013, from around 30 percent in mid-2011. Bank Indonesia projects that repayments of external debt
excluding trade finance, revolving loans and currency and deposits will total US$ 32.6 billion over August
to December 2013, of which US$ 28.8 billion is private debt, with a further US$ 33.4 billion in gross
repayments expected in January-July 2014. As mentioned above, in support of contingency arrangements,
Bank Indonesia has recently extended bilateral currency swap arrangements with China, Korea and Japan.

    34. Gross fiscal financing needs do remain substantial but the overall fiscal balance sheet
remains strong. Central government debt was just under 24 percent of GDP at the end of 2012, with its
downward trajectory in recent years supported by strong nominal GDP growth, exchange rate appreciation
and relatively low deficits. Debt sustainability analysis points to the debt-to-GDP ratio picking up somewhat
(by 2-3 percentage points) over the next couple of years due to declining nominal GDP growth, the weaker
exchange rate and projected higher fiscal deficit (albeit still less than 3 percent of GDP). The baseline
projection is for debt-to-GDP to remain in the range of 25-30 percent of GDP over the medium-term, absent
significant shocks. Turning to fiscal financing risks, in the event of major disruption to local or international
bond markets, crisis management protocols and continent financing facilities with development partners
have been set up to support financing of critical public expenditures. The World Bank PERISAI DPL-DDO
operation, in addition to supporting short-term policy measures aimed at enhancing crisis preparedness,
provides contingent budget support through end June 2014, which the Government intends to draw down
only in the event of a significant worsening of the financing conditions. The Government has also secured
additional contingent financing of around US$ 3 billion from the Government of Japan (JPY 120 billion),
Australian Treasury (AUD 1 billion) and the Asian Development Bank (US$ 500 million). The Government
continues to view the contingent budget support as last resort financing to be used only if the required
financing cannot be raised due to a fiscal financing crisis. For 2013, as of 8 October, the Government had
reached 82 percent of its revised annual securities issuance target of IDR 331 trillion. Efforts are also being
made to support the financing position through, for example, additional funding via program loan operations
such as the World Bank DPLs.

    35. Overall, Indonesia’s macroeconomic framework is adequate for the proposed operation.
Economic growth is moderating, and in the base case this is projected to stabilize at a pace which is still
solid but more commensurate with a sustainable current account deficit. The key risk is that external funding
needs continue to place a strain on the rupiah or reserves, for example due to a further weakening in key
export commodity prices or weak net inward investment dynamics, requiring additional monetary policy
tightening, denting confidence and further crimping growth. The risks of such a scenario resulting in a loss
of macroeconomic stability are mitigated by the fact that the policy framework is proving generally
responsive to the risk of macroeconomic imbalances. Policy buffers, although reduced, remain ample, and
the structural underpinnings of resilient growth remain in place, suggesting a favorable medium-term
outlook for Indonesia, predicated, as discussed above, on the implementation of supporting reforms, for
example on the investment climate, on enhancing skills and improving infrastructure provision.

C. Poverty, Vulnerability and Shared Prosperity

     36. Sustained growth has allowed poverty reduction to continue, with the national poverty rate
falling to 11.4 percent in 2013, but the rate of reduction in recent years has slowed. Since recovering
from the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), Indonesia’s national poverty rate has halved from 24 percent in 1999
to 12 percent in 2012.1 Despite sustained strong economic growth, however, the rate of poverty reduction is
slowing. The 0.5 percentage point fall in poverty between 2011 and 2012 was the smallest decline in the
past six years. One of the reasons for a slowing rate of poverty reduction in recent years is that the poverty
basket inflation has been considerably higher than both headline and core inflation. In 2013, the fall in
poverty picked up slightly as the rate dropped to 11.4 percent, 0.6 of a percentage point from 2012 levels.
Even so, about 28 million Indonesians—out of the current population of 246 million—still live below the
poverty line (for 2013, the poverty line was set at IDR 271,600 per person per month). Approximately half
of these households can be considered as being chronically poor, or consistently measured as poor in three
consecutive years.

    37. Extreme poverty has also been falling, but at a slower pace. Indonesia identifies those
households living below 0.8 times the official poverty line as being extremely poor. Since the AFC, the
national extreme poverty rate has fallen from 9.39 percent in 1999 to 3.79 percent in 2012. This reduction

                                                                     12
has occurred at a slower pace than the drop in the official poverty rate. Based on international comparisons,
however, the rate of extreme poverty is higher. In 2010, 18 percent of households in Indonesia fell below the
international benchmark for extreme poverty set at PPP$1.25 per day.2 Despite methodological problems
with calculating an international comparable rate of extreme poverty, this indicates that Indonesia continues
to face challenges in eradicating extreme poverty.3

    38. The falling poverty rate masks a high degree of vulnerability among many non-poor
households in Indonesia. Despite a relatively low official poverty rate, much of the population is clustered
near the poverty line. In 1999, 39 percent of households lived below the official near-poor line of 1.2 times
the poverty line. This fell to 23 percent by 2012. Despite this drop, about 55 million people lived below the
official near-poor line as of March 2012, at which point the line was set at IDR 298,400 per person per
month. More alarmingly, 94 million Indonesians lived below 1.5 times the poverty line (IDR 373,000 per
person per month). This bottom 40 percent of the population is highly vulnerable to small shocks, such as
food price increases, that can send these households into poverty. Consequently, Indonesia experiences a
high rate of churning in and out of poverty. Half of the poor in 2010 were not poor in 2009, with over 80
percent of them coming from the poorest 40 percent the year before. As such, many households have
experienced poverty: during the past three years a quarter of all Indonesians have been in poverty at least
once.4

    39. Female-headed households, in particular, experience much more volatile poverty rates than
the male-headed households. Currently, the labor participation rate of women is substantially lower than
that of men (Female: 51.2%; Male: 76.3%, based on WB data), and there is a large gender wage gap with
women earning only about 70 percent of what men earn. While poverty rates for female-headed households
(FHH) and male-headed ones (MHH) experienced a similar reduction over the 2000s, the FHH poverty rate
was much more volatile than the MHH rate over the first half of the decade. This suggests that FHH interact
with labor markets differently to MHH, face different risks to income and consumption, or have differential
access to coping mechanisms and are less able to smooth consumption when shocks occur. The Maternal
Mortality Rate (MMR) is still high, and there is a risk that this key MDG target may not be reached (MMR
2015 target of 102 per 100,000 live births, vs. 220 in 2010, according to WB data). Data also suggests that
FHH tend to adopt the negative coping strategies through child labor. Despite tangible progress (e.g., gender
parity in enrollment rates at all levels of education), persistent gender disparities remain.

    40. Inequality of household consumption has been increasing since 2000. The Gini coefficient fell
from 0.33 in 1997 to 0.30 in 2000 with the AFC having a more deleterious effect on the non-poor.5 The
Gini, however, has steadily increased since 2000, reaching 0.41 by 2012.6 This level is high by OECD
standards, and while around the lower middle income average, is high for the East Asian region and amongst
the fastest rising. This recent increase in equality is being driven by stronger consumption growth at the top
end of the distribution. After the equalizing effects of the AFC and recovery, the 90th percentile of household
per capital consumption had fallen from 3.7 times the 10th percentile in 1996 to 3.1 in 2003, and 2.1 times
the 50th percentile to 1.9. However, since then, the trends have reversed, with the 90 th-10th ratio increasing
to 4.7 by 2012, and the 90th-50th to 2.5. The relatively stable ratios for the 50th-25th and 50th-10th indicate that

  The calculation of extreme poverty in Indonesia for 2010, based on the PPP$1.25 measure is likely an overestimation due to
methodological challenges related to the survey data used to calculate the CPI. The data was predominantly based on Jakarta prices,
and some of the survey data was collected during a period of high inflation following an increase in the price of subsidized fuel in
the fourth quarter of 2009.
4
  Further analysis and discussion on the nature of poverty and vulnerability in Indonesia, and the effectiveness of social assistance
programs in addressing them, can be found in recent World Bank's major reports (2012), Targeting the Poor and Vulnerable in
Indonesia, and Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable in Indonesia.

it is the increasing consumption at the top end of the distribution relative to the rest, which is driving most of
the increase in the Gini coefficient, rather than the middle also pulling away from the bottom.

    41. The relatively low consumption growth of Indonesia’s poorest 40 percent, and resulting
inequality, may begin to adversely affect social and political cohesion. Despite strong economic growth,
and official poverty approaching 10 percent, there is still a strong public perception that many more
Indonesians are not well-off, and that growth has not been shared by all (a perception supported by the data).
Moreover, around half of poor and vulnerable households do not receive major social assistance programs,
while half of benefits go to the non-poor. There is some evidence that these inequities in access to social
assistance have increased crime and decreased social capital.7

D. The Political and Social Context

     42. Over the course of 15 years of political and institutional reforms, Indonesia has made
remarkable progress towards the goal of becoming a vibrant multi-party and decentralized
democracy. However, at this particular juncture the country is moving towards an election year in 2014.
Next year will see the election of a new president by direct vote for only the third time in Indonesia’s reform
era, and this forthcoming changeover of power is creating tensions within the political system. For most of
the life of this second Yudhoyono administration, tensions within and between the three branches of
government—the legislative, judicial and executive branches—have been building. Nevertheless, there is
commitment by reformers within the Government to push forward on important reform agendas.

    43. The political outlook is clouded by uncertainties over who might become the next president.
Adding to the uncertain political outlook is the limited choice of potential candidates for the post of
president in 2014 and uncertainties over the prospects for the continuation of market-oriented policymaking.
The current Jakarta governor has increasingly gained popularity, as a clean governance reformer with a
focus on improving public service delivery, especially to the poor. However, despite the relatively strong
political support for presidency, his formal candidacy has yet to be declared. Meanwhile, as election year
approaches, the political pressure for the government to take more populist policies is mounting. Resistance
for reduction in fuel subsidies, regulatory uncertainties in the extractive sectors (i.e., mining, oil, and gas),
and pressure to increase regional minimum wage rates are among the politically sensitive issues that the
government is currently confronting.

    44. There has been a trend towards more interventionist policy making, many of them have
involved restrictive measures. In the past couple of years, economic policymaking has become more
driven by aspiration to increase domestic value addition through facilitating investments in agro-industry
and downstream processing of commodities and natural resources. Given Indonesia’s large pool of labor and
increased exposure to commodity and natural resources activities, such aspiration has a strong development
dimension. However, many of the policy instruments used to promote the aspiration may have caused
adverse results on trade and investment. The decision to restrict exports of minerals by the mining sector
together with the forcing of mining companies to invest in high-investment downstream processing in
Indonesia had the effect of stifling the mining sector—one of Indonesia’s most important drivers of
investment and earners of foreign exchange. Furthermore, interventionist policies in the agricultural sector,
especially restrictions on imports of beef and horticultural products, had served to stoke inflation and eroded
consumer purchasing power at a time when the economy was largely being driven by consumer spending.

    45. As a result of the recent market downturn, the Government responded with a package of
measures to reassure market on the medium-term economic reform agenda. Given the potential costs
and consequences of not following a reformist path in policymaking, a silver-lining could be that the
reformer agenda has been strengthened in the short term by recent macro volatility. In August 23rd, 2013 the

government announced economic stabilization package containing measures intended to achieve the
following: (i) improve current account; (ii) safeguard purchasing power and facilitate growth; (iii) contain
inflationary pressure; and (iv) maintain investment flows. Some the reform measures involved retracting
interventionist policies on trade and proposal for improving certainty in business environment. However, it
remains to be seen whether the measures go far enough to achieve the required adjustment in the external
balances to alleviate financing pressures and provide confidence to financial market investors. Strong
political interests in policymaking as the election approaches may undermine confidence in the reform
process.


         III. THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM AND BANK SUPPORT

A. Indonesia’s Overall Development Agenda

    46. A series of five-year development plans has provided the framework for reinforcing
economic stability and initiating structural reforms. Within the first five years after the 1998 crisis, both
economic and political stability were largely in place. When President Yudhoyono came to power in late
2004, plans for macroeconomic and fiscal consolidation and a series of structural reforms to restore
confidence in the Indonesian economy were included in the National Long-Term Development Plan for
2005-2025. In its second term, the GoI adopted Indonesia’s Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN)
2010-2014, with responsibility for monitoring progress assigned to the newly established Presidential
Delivery Unit (UKP4). With the target of increasing economic growth to 7 percent and reducing the poverty
rate to 8-10 percent by 2014, the RPJMN highlights the need for growth with equity and a range of cross-
cutting policies to ensure that development is both sustainable and inclusive. The RPJMN gives a special
emphasis to increasing investments in infrastructure and strengthening the poverty agenda. Further, it
commits the Government to a more equitable and inclusive development for, among others, women and
children. The Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection embodies this commitment.

    47. The Government’s approach to economic policy is based on its four strategic objectives of
pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-poor and pro-green development. Equity remains a basic principle for
balancing economic growth and development amongst large cities and smaller cities and more isolated parts
of the country to deliver more even economic development in collaboration with the private sector and job
creation across the country. It also includes a focus on reaching Indonesia’s poorest. The Government
concentrates on 13 programs, which include education, health, poverty reduction, employment creation,
infrastructure development, food security, energy, good governance, electoral reform, anti-corruption
enforcement, inclusive and equitable development, climate change and environmental protection, and
cultural development. Collaboration with the private sector to complement the Government’s efforts through
investments, job creation and innovation is prioritized. Reducing reliance on external finance and
maintaining a low debt-to-GDP ratio is also a key GoI priority. In some but not all of these areas, the
Government has sought assistance from the World Bank Group.

    48. The Master Plan for Economic Development seeks to accelerate growth and increase equity
with a goal of becoming one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2025. In May 2011, the GoI
launched the Master Plan for “Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development 2011 -
2025” (MP3EI) based on three strategies: (i) fostering centers of growth across economic corridors by
faciliting industrialization; (ii) strengthening national connectivity to link growth poles across and within
economic corridors; and (iii) complementing connectivity by improving human resources capabilities and
increasing investments in research and development. The plan sets an ambitious target for Indonesia to grow
beyond 7 percent annually and achieve a status of an emerging industrialized country by 2025. Under the
plan, the private sector has a central role in driving economic development, particularly in generating
investment, creating employment opportunities and fostering innovation. Meanwhile, the plan also states the

                                                     15
responsibility of the Government for creating conducive macro-economic and regulatory conditions for the
acceleration and expansion of investment.

relatively more expensive. Such a situation constrains businesses from developing downstream activities
with locally sourced materials and reduces the opportunity for raw material producers to tap growing
opportunities in regions with high manufacturing activities. To the extent that remote regions in Indonesia
have higher incidence of poverty (see Annex 1), lack of connectivity limits opportunities for those lagging
regions to link themselves with their nearest growth centers. Households in remote regions are also
relatively more exposed to higher risk of food insecurity as food prices tend to fluctuate more in remote
regions. Therefore, poor connectivity has significant adverse impact for inclusive growth.

Box 1 Examples of the implications of Indonesia’s poor connectivity

      The price of a bag of cement in certain parts of Papua is 20 times that in Java. The price of a gallon of water in
       Medan is double that in Jakarta. Oranges shipped from China are cheaper than oranges from Pontianak
       (Kalimantan). High domestic transport costs are the main reason.
      70 percent of the differences in rice prices across provinces can be explained by the degree of remoteness, which
       in turn is a reflection of poor logistics and inadequate transport infrastructure (World Bank, 2010).
      Availability and prices of basic commodities fluctuate widely in remote areas. For instance, gasoline prices in Di
       Kisar Island are three times higher in the rainy season than in the dry season.
      High quality products with great potential, such as shrimps from eastern Indonesia, cannot be commercially
       processed in Java, and commodities, such as pineapples, are canned abroad because it is cheaper to transport
       them to Malaysia than to ship them to Java.
      Indonesia’s manufacturing sector is poorly integrated into internatio nal production networks because of
       unreliable transport and high logistics costs. According to the World Bank Enterprise Survey, transport
       problems rank as the third most important constraint to doing business for manufacturing exporters after
       electricity and corruption.
      The costs of bringing a container from Jakarta’s main industrial sites are double th ose in Malaysia and Thailand.
      Some 10 percent of Indonesian exports leave ports too late and consequently do not reach the regional
       transshipment ports on time. Ships destined for local destinations are frequently delayed.
      In some export sectors, such as cocoa, rubber and coffee, more than 40 percent of total logistics and transport
       costs come from pre-shipment and inland transportation expenses in Indonesia before international shipment.
      About 70 percent of freight in Indonesia is transported by truck. The majority of the trucks on the roads in
       Indonesia are old and poorly maintained.
      A truck making a round-trip from Bandung to Jakarta may spend up to 75 percent of its time parked due to
       customs processes, warehouse delays, and lift-on and lift-off queues.
      Trade and transport logistics are still mainly ‘paper-based systems’, which increases logistics costs in addition to
       illegal fees.
      Different national and regional authorities continue to issue laws and regulations without any clear assessment
       of their impact on trade flows and logistics costs.

    50. The biggest connectivity challenge is weak infrastructure development, which has been
undermining Indonesia’s economic growth and poverty reduction efforts. Indonesia’s infrastructure
investment fell sharply after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, and has still not recovered to pre-
Asian crisis levels. Indonesia’s level of investment during the 2010-11 period was still lower than 4 percent
of GDP, or less than half of that reported during the 1994-97 period of almost 8 percent of GDP (
    51. Figure 6). Such low levels of investment are attributed to the GoI’s focus on fiscal consolidation
and cutting of public debt, as well as the decline in infrastructure spending by the private sector and state-
owned enterprises. When compared with other fast-growing countries in the region, such as China, Thailand
and Vietnam, all of which reported infrastructure investment rates of more than 7 percent of GDP,
Indonesia’s infrastructure investment is among the lowest in Asia. This signifies the major challenges faced
by Indonesia towards meeting the demand for infrastructure necessary to enhance competitiveness, growth
and poverty reduction.

    52. From a regional and global competitiveness perspective, poor connectivity undermines
Indonesia’s trade and investment competitiveness. Indonesia will be fully joining the ASEAN Economic
Community (AEC) by 2015 where single production networks and equitable development are two of the
four main pillars. Meanwhile, economies in the region are stepping up their efforts to forge closer economic
integration through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which is expected to
include ASEAN countries + 6 (Australia, China, Japan, India, South Korea and New Zealand).
Improvements in connectivity are fundamental if Indonesia is to fully benefit from any initiatives on
economic integration. In addition to improving domestic connectivity, better infrastructures in trade
facilitation can attract more investment, both domestic or export oriented, to Indonesia. The need to improve
connectivity becomes even more important when seen in the context of compensating for increases in
nominal wages and rising costs that are undermining competitiveness of Indonesia’s economy.

B.2. The Agenda for Reform in Connectivity

     53. To address its connectivity challenges, the Government needs to coordinate with
stakeholders and identify priorities for reforms that address the most critical issues. Addressing
connectivity challenges involves various government agencies at multiple levels and active consultation
with the private sector. Thus it is important to develop a structured approach that encompasses the different
initiatives, prioritizes reform actions, and promotes a high level of coordination between government
agencies. In this regard, appointing key reform champions in the Government to lead the coordination effort
has been proven to be effective. The identification of appropriate priority activities to improve connectivity
at the intra-island, inter-island and international levels will facilitate a higher level of integration between
the different blueprints and master plans. To the extent that infrastructure development plays a key part in
improving connectivity, better capacity to mobilize and optimize fiscal resources plays a significant role in
boosting investment and improving maintenance of public infrastructure. Given the financing needs for
infrastructure investment and the provision of efficient logistics services, attracting the private sector’s
participation will work only if there is clarity and certainty in the regulatory environment. Therefore, reform
actions in connectivity will have to incorporate the following aspects:




                                                               18
       Establish strong inter-agency coordination mechanisms to identify, synergize, implement, and
        monitor an action plan to address connectivity challenges;
       Improve incentives and clarity in the decision-making process for using public funds for
        maintenance and provisions of connectivity infrastructure and services;
       Strengthen confidence and inclusiveness in the mechanism in the land acquisition process for
        public connectivity infrastructure; and
       Improve the institutional set-up and regulatory regime to encourage efficiency and growth in trade
        logistics and logistics services.

     54. The Government has stepped up efforts to address connectivity challenges by introducing
master plans to guide policy reforms. A key strategy underpinning the MP3EI is the connectivity agenda
that focuses on improving inter-connectedness of different economic corridors. Achieving the goals of the
MP3EI will not be possible without improving Indonesia’s connectivity, i.e. the supply chain linking
producers to consumers. Increasing connectivity between domestic producers and domestic consumers in
dispersed locations across Indonesia will need strong intra- and inter-islands links. The improvement of
logistics and connectivity has been high on the GoI agenda for several years, and has been supported by the
World Bank. The connectivity challenges identified in the MP3EI will need to be addressed in a more
comprehensive and holistic manner, linking connectivity explicitly to regional development plans, as well as
the improvement of competitiveness of the business sector through R&D and technological capacity.

    55. The first phase of implementation of the MP3EI aims to integrate different national,
regional and sectoral plans into a single roadmap for action. In the first phase, different existing
national, regional and sectoral plans are being integrated into a single roadmap for action (Table 3Error!
eference source not found.). In particular, to strengthen national connectivity, components from four
different Government plans will be integrated: (a) National Logistics System (Sislognas), (b) National
Transportation Systems (Sistranas), (c) Regional Development (RPJMN and RTRWN); (d) Information and
Communication Technology (ICT). In order to ensure effective implementation of the various strategies,
policy coordination is a key challenge that the MP3EI needs to address. Therefore, the plan mentions a new
dedicated committee chaired by the President to enhance efficiency in coordination, monitoring, evaluating,
and strategic decision-making.

    56. Engagement in regional economic fora is also strengthening the agenda on connectivity.
Indonesia is a member of ASEAN, which has committed to the successful implementation of an ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint in 2015. This is expected to further enhance trade and investment
integration among member states through the formation of a regional single-production base. To support this
objective, Indonesia and other member states have committed to step up trade facilitation by establishing a
Single Window that enhances customs data exchange, increases the use of ICT for border agencies, and
increases transparency in border clearance processes. In addition to forming a single production base,
ASEAN members also agreed to form a competitive and economically resilient region. In this respect,
ASEAN has introduced an ASEAN Connectivity Master plan to further support commitments to establish
the AEC. The Master plan aims to accelerate implementation of cooperation initiatives and investment
projects across ASEAN that can better connect member states through: (I) physical connectivity (ICT,
infrastructure, and energy); (ii) institutional connectivity to facilitate trade and investment; and (iii) people-
to-people connectivity.

    57. Strong support for implementing and monitoring the reform progress is important to ensure
steady progress towards achieving the aims of the connectivity agenda. Various laws and regulations
have been issued, which have major ramifications for advancing the connectivity agenda. The Law on Land
Acquisition for Public Infrastructure (Law No. 2/2012), a Minister Finance Decree on Viability Gap Fund
for public infrastructure, a Minister of Communications and Information Regulation on the use of the ICT
Fund to develop broadband services in remote areas, the Presidential Regulation on Restructuring in the
Railway Sector, and the Presidential Regulation on the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) are some
of the high-level regulations that have been issued recently and acknowledged by Connectivity DPL-1. The
next challenge is to drive for effective implementation of the connectivity agenda. This partly will involve
reforms through the change of existing, or issuance of new, implementing regulations and technical
guidelines to establish certainty for relevant agencies in implementing policies, and the private sector to
increase participation in the provision of infrastructure and logistics services.

C.       Analytical Underpinnings for Connectivity Agenda Support

    58. Underpinning the policy dialogue and the design of support to Indonesia’s connectivity
agenda is a series of analytical and advisory activities (AAAs). There have been a number of studies in
recent years that underpin the connectivity policy dialogue and design. These include:
         A connectivity study was conducted to identify priorities to integrate Indonesia as a whole,
            focusing on intra-island, inter-island and international connectivity issues (Connecting
            Indonesia: A Framework for Action (2010)). The Bank has also provided extensive support to
            the Go to clarify the objectives of the connectivity framework using the WDR 2009 on
            Reshaping Economic Geography and identify a detailed plan of action in priority areas.
         The Bank has hosted a series of logistics roundtables bringing together government officials and
            the private sector to discuss various facets of connectivity issues. The Bank has also undertaken
            a study on Indonesia's Logistics Performance Index 2012, a study of regulatory reform to
            support the upgrading of logistics service providers, and the Bank is also developing a
            monitoring system to track the implementation of the logistics blueprint.
         The Bank undertook the Sub-National Public Expenditure Review 2012 that shows that
            decentralized service delivery and finance has not resulted in major improvements in service
            outcomes, including in infrastructure. The weak service delivery outcomes can be explained to
            a large extent by inefficient subnational government spending. First, subnational governments
            spend too much on administration and not enough on other sectors. The latest subnational fiscal
            data show that local governments spend more than 25 percent of their budgets on general
            administration (the international standard is around five percent). Second, subnational
            governments allocate too much to personnel across all sector budgets and not enough to

                                                            20
           operations, maintenance, and capital (spending on personnel now makes up over 40 percent of
           total expenditure budgets). Hence infrastructure spending has not kept pace with the rate of
           Indonesia’s urbanization and the resulting congestion has severely constrained growth. One of
           the policy recommendations suggested by the study is to move toward performance incentives
           designed with a view explicitly improving infrastructure service outcomes. Such outcomes
           could potentially reflect those stipulated under the connectivity agenda.
          The Bank conducted a study on Constraints on Productivity and Investment in Indonesia’s
           Manufacturing Sector: Survey-based Analysis of Business Constraints (2012). The findings
           suggest that problems with transportation are among the worst business constraints for
           manufacturing firms, particularly export oriented firms, in Indonesia.
          On transportation issues, the Bank’s ongoing Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review has
           produced extensive policy notes on Rail (2011) and Road (2012), which help highlight critical
           infrastructure issues and challenges. As one of the priority areas under connectivity, the Bank
           has commissioned a study to better understand the inter-island transport market and ways to
           improve the provision of transport services. An assessment of the road construction industry in
           Indonesia was recently undertaken by the World Bank to gain a better understanding of the
           constraints and issues, and to identify opportunities for improvement of the investment climate
           of the sector.
          The Bank is also providing technical assistance on reform actions in ICT. With an AusAID
           facility, the Bank provided policy input to Bappenas and the Ministry of Communications that
           shapes the reform agenda on ICT investment.
          The Bank is also engaged in policy dialogue on improving port efficiency and trade facilitation,
           through on-going technical assistance via the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Investment
           Climate (MDFTIC) and AusAID facility. The Bank has conducted several analyses on
           improving ports, including dwell time surveys, a domestic shipping study, a study on the use of
           the newly established dry port in West Java, and development of a SAP for dry ports.
          On gender, the Bank’s study of Making Infrastructure Work for Women and Men: A Review of
           World Bank Infrastructure Projects (1995-2009) provides a tool for more effective and efficient
           implementation when the different needs and interests of, as well as possible benefits that can be
           obtained by, women and men are taken into consideration in project design and implementation.
           Success stories include women’s increased access to finance due to the joint titling of resettled
           households in Mumbai, India and in Aceh post-tsunami areas in Indonesia; increased school
           enrollment of girls from 30 to 50 percent in Morocco; and a more effective maintenance due to
           women’s participation in Peru.

D. Other Related Reform Priorities and Areas of Development

    59. Outside of the main pillars of reform covered by the DPL, there are three major areas of
reform in which the World Bank is also involved that are relevant to the success of this DPL series.
These areas include infrastructure finance/Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), trade competitiveness and
decentralization. The Government is actively addressing the challenges of reform in these areas, with
support from development partners.

   D. 1. Infrastructure: Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)

    60. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) offer a potential partial solution towards addressing
Indonesia’s infrastructure gaps. Inadequate infrastructure currently acts as a constraint to Indonesia’s
growth potential and with it, efforts to reduce the nation’s poverty. Indonesia experienced a significant
decline in infrastructure investment as a share of GDP in the years following the Asian financial crisis,
which it is only now beginning to recover. The decline in spending was reflected in a deterioration of


                                                    21
services across many sectors.8 PPP can potentially offer a new source of capital for infrastructure
development—a window for infrastructure financing by the private sector—aside from that by national and
subnational governments, and SOEs, for example. More importantly, it can provide increased efficiency
from the resources available, using the competitive and management efficiencies of the private sector to
achieve the cost reductions, speed of completion and life-cycle oriented maintenance that the Government so
desperately needs in its infrastructure program. The use of private sector capacity also provides the
Government with the additional human and technical resources needed to achieve an increase in
infrastructure development, including for example in a technologically complex and difficult projects.

    61. The GoI has a strong commitment to delivering the sector reforms and institutional
arrangements needed to improve private investment in infrastructure. For example, the GoI is changing
many of its infrastructure laws, by dismantling public monopolies and opening the infrastructure sector and
market to private sector investors. Under the new legal framework, the private sector can invest in the
development and operation of financially viable infrastructure projects, without being obliged to enter into
joint ventures with state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

     62. The Bank’s engagement with the GoI on infrastructure finance during recent years includes
a significant effort dedicated to PPP, focused primarily on institutional, legal and capacity reform .
The Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure TA Loan (PPITA) provided capacity support and
institutional reform support to the different line ministries and helped to design Perpres No. 67/2005
(amended by President Regulation No. 13/2010, and President Regulation No 56/ 2011), the legal
foundation for the PPP program, and create the Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the MoF, a team dedicated
to resolving the fiscal risks associated with PPP and helping the MoF become a more proactive party to the
PPP program. The PPITA also helped set up two key units in Ministry of Public Works to handle
preparation and transaction in toll and water infrastructure projects, namely the Toll Road Authority Board
(BPJT) and Drinking Water Advisory Board (BPPSPAM)-. These reforms were then reinforced and
developed through the Infrastructure DPL series 1-4, the creation of and Bank lending to the Indonesia
Infrastructure Finance Facility (IIFF) and the Bank’s support for the Indonesia Guarantee Fund (IGF). While
private investment in public infrastructure is important for Indonesia’s growth, it should not be over-sold as
a panacea for the country’s infrastructure needs. In 2010, private investment in public infrastructure was
below 1.5 percent of GDP in such large middle-income countries as Thailand, the Philippines and Russia,
and below 1.0 percent of GDP in others (including Brazil, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia). Improving
Indonesia’s infrastructure endowments will require an increased effort by national and subnational
governments, as well as SOEs and private investors.

      D.2. Trade Competitiveness

     63. Trade is an important part of the Indonesian economy, driving growth and productivity
improvement. The export of goods represents 22 percent of nominal GDP, while the export of services has
started to expand. Indonesia exported about US$200 billion of goods in 2011, which would rank Indonesia
within the top 25 exporters in the world. Excluding oil and gas exports, more than 70 percent of Indonesia’s
exports are natural resources and manufacturing products. Within Indonesia’s manufacturing exports, almost
half are natural resource-based manufacturing products, such as palm oil, processed rubber, and processed
minerals. Although markets in the EU and the US remain important, Indonesia is increasingly trading with
emerging markets and countries in the region such as China, India, Malaysia, and South Korea.

    64. Indonesia has been reforming its trade policies to make them more effective and responsive
in promoting growth and competitiveness. Significant reform has taken place in improving trade
facilitation and promoting more inclusive and evidence-based trade policymaking. As a member of ASEAN

  8
   Total infrastructure investment fell from 8.2 percent of GDP in 1997 to a low of 3.1 percent in 2002, and recently averaged 3
  percent in the course of 2011 and 2012.

                                                                22
and the G20 process, Indonesia has been embracing openness to trade and investment and leaning towards
greater integration in the global economy. Indonesia took a bold step in harmonizing the structure of its
import tariffs and Indonesia’s current average import tariff is one of the lowest among emerging
economies—the simple average tariff is about 5 percent. On trade facilitation, Indonesia has made progress
in improving customs clearance and transparency on trade regulations through the Indonesia National Single
Window (INSW). Meanwhile, Indonesia is developing a process to increase transparency in reviewing non-
tariff measures that affect trade flows.

    65. With the support of Multi-Donor Facility for Trade and Investment Climate (MDFTIC), the
Bank is working with the Government to foster a more transparent trade regime that will contribute to
improvements in competitiveness, economic productivity, and job creation; making informed policymaking
on strategic food commodities that contribute to food price stability; and strengthening the reform agenda to
improve connectivity in order to lower transportation costs of goods across the country, improve
competitiveness, and reduced inter-regional economic inequality. This program also seeks to strengthen
policy dialogue around trade and investment climate through AAA work and just in time briefing notes to
inform the opportunities from continuing process for economic integration and priorities to address
challenges in trade and investment competitiveness.

       D.3. Subnational Development

     66. With the ‘big-bang’ decentralization of 2001, Indonesia went from being one of the most
centralized countries in the world in administrative, fiscal and political terms, to one of the most
decentralized; but the transition is far from complete. While some surveys show an improvement in
satisfaction with local service delivery, significant challenges remain. Overlapping responsibilities without a
coordinated decentralization framework undermine effective service delivery, and limit accountability and
transparency mechanisms at the subnational government level. Much central funding devolved to the
subnational governments—at around 31.4 percent of budgets—is spent on personnel salaries and other
administrative costs, reducing the incentive to address civil service costs. While the Special Allocation Fund
(DAK) has been growing rapidly, there are still some challenges in the implementation of DAK by local
(district/municipal) governments. Unlike most decentralized countries, Indonesia has not transferred
significant revenue-raising power to local governments, distorting incentives and creating an unhealthy
dependence on transfers. Meanwhile, many local governments misuse the revenue-raising authority they do
have, constraining business development, growth and job creation. Transfers provide the bulk of financing,
but they are rarely used as a strategic instrument to improve local government performance. Given the
important role of subnational governments in public investment, particularly in the infrastructure sector
where the needs are great, amending the law on subnational government taxes and fees, as well as fine-
tuning on-lending and on-granting regulations and application, is urgent. Most regions also need to improve
technical capacity to implement reforms.

    67. To support the reform of the framework for subnational development, the Bank, together
with development partners, will continue to improve the environment within which local governments
operate. The Bank continues its on-going support by providing resources and coordination for both central
level agencies and local governments around analysis and critical-capacity building through various
programs and activities. Beginning in 2010, the Bank has provided resources and assistance to improve the
DAK, with an initial emphasis on enhancing accountability and reporting of the DAK transfer to
infrastructure sub-sectors within pilot local governments, as well as providing incentives for good
performance by local governments. World Bank programs also work directly with local governments to
enhance capacity and improve financing in districts across Indonesia, including through the Urban Sector
Development and Reform Project (USDRP), which aims to change governance behavior in the context of
decentralized public service delivery by targeting reform-minded local governments and encouraging
increased accountability through citizen participation. In addition, the Public Expenditure Analysis and
Capacity Harmonization (PEACH) program carries out subnational public expenditure reviews (PERs)

                                                      23
designed to better inform spending decisions at the local level. Subnational PERs have been completed in 10
provinces with local governments working closely with local academic institutions and local stakeholders to
improve policy and analytical capacity, including mainstreaming gender analysis into expenditure reviews.

D.4. Procurement
     68. In recent years the Government has also made significant progress on the regulatory side of
government procurement, which is a core element of the overall PFM reform agenda. Specific steps
include the creation in 2007, the national procurement policy and regulatory agency (LKPP), enactment of
Presidential Regulations Perpres No. 54/2010 and Perpres No. 70/2012, mandating the establishment of
dedicated Procurement Service Units (ULPs) and use of e-procurement, and the issuance in 2013 of updated
standard bidding documents for e-procurement. The priority now is to enable effective implementation of
the procurement regulations so that the goals of competition, economy, efficiency and transparency
envisaged for the new framework are actually achieved. This would include strengthening oversight
institutions and mechanisms to ensure that procurement regulations are followed, a particularly challenging
objective in such a decentralized government setting; to develop capacity of staff working on procurement
so that executing agencies can get the most benefit out of the procurement rules through a wide range of
implementation options; to introduce modern procurement tools such as framework contracts/e-catalogues
for enhancing efficiency and getting greater value for money; and to establish a procurement performance
monitoring system to enable collection and analysis of actionable and reliable data to inform procurement
policy-making, as well as to monitor and evaluate results. LKPP has initiated work on some of these areas
which are currently at varying levels of progress. Going forward, establishing a fully functional public
procurement system will require the Government to continuously assess the performance and outcomes of
the system, obtaining feedback from stakeholders, and making the appropriate adjustments in policies and
implementation tools for further improvement.

D.5. Governance and Anti-Corruption

    69. The Government has made progress in combating corruption during the second term (2010-
14) of the President. Evidence for this has been identified in a performance review and evaluation reports
of state agencies/institutions, which were undertaken by KPK (Anti-Corruption Commission) and BPK
(State Audit Agency). For instance, the KPK's Annual Integrity Survey highlighted that the Integrity Index
improved substantially from 5.42 in 2010 to 6.37 in 2012. At the same time, BPK's summary of annual
audits during 2010-12 mentioned that the majority of findings reflected mis-administration. Moreover, as
part of efforts to move forward with the National Anti-Corruption Agenda, the heads of the KPK, AGO and
National Police agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2012, outlining the strategic actions
necessary for strengthening coordination, supervision, support to pre-investigation and investigation, as well
as the prosecution proceedings of high-profile corruption cases. To address the human resources challenges
within the KPK, the President also issued an instruction in October 2012 to the KPK, the AGO, and the
National Police, to ensure the availability of investigators in KPK. Specifically, the instruction postpones the
withdrawal of AGO and the National Police investigators from the KPK, and also facilitates the KPK to start
recruiting its own investigators for greater independence.


                 IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

    A. Links to the 2013-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)

     70. The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 supports the broader goal of the 2013-15 CPS, which is to
enhance Indonesia’s domestic capacity for reducing poverty and boosting equitable and sustainable
prosperity. The CPS highlights the Connectivity DPL program as a key World Bank Group (WBG)
instrument, particularly in the pro-growth engagement area, by promoting prosperity through enhanced

                                                      24
connectivity, strengthened competitiveness and promotion of infrastructure development. Complemented by
other WBG financing instruments and knowledge services, the proposed Connectivity DPL-2 is expected to
support development results that will enhance Indonesia’s logistics performance, improve access to
broadband and reduce costs for exporting and importing. The proposed operation will also support the GoI’s
reform efforts to improve the policy framework, regulatory environment and coordinated interventions for
productivity, competition and innovation. Further, the proposed operation will support efforts to reignite
investment in infrastructure, which are aimed at increasing public investment and promoting private sector
participation. Overall, the CPS recognizes that the key to addressing connectivity challenges lies in policy
coordination and implementation across multiple levels of government and consultation with the private
sector, which is a key thrust of the proposed operation.

    B. Relationship to Other Bank Operations

    71. The Bank is supporting the Government’s connectivity agenda using mutually supportive
instruments. While with the DPL series the Bank supports the Government’s ownership and commitment
towards the achievement of reform milestones, with other technical assistance and financing instruments it
supplements that support through the necessary advisory, human and financial capacity to carry out the
reforms. Various types of Bank investment lending support of the connectivity agenda., including: (i) the
US$300 million Western Indonesia Roads project (WINRIP) which is upgrading key sections of the
Western Sumatra road corridor (from North Sumatra to Lampung) to increase travel speeds and capacity; (ii)
US$660 million for the Upper Cisokan Pumped Storage power plant in West Java and US$300 million in
lending for geothermal power plants in south Sumatra and north Sulawesi that increases generation capacity
to keep up with steeply increasing demand; and (iii) US$325 million in Bank lending for power transmission
in FY13 (on top of US$225 million in FY11). The Connectivity DPL is also complemented by other
technical assistance that supports through the necessary advisory, human and financial capacity the

                                                    25
underlying reforms. In particular, the MDFTIC funded by the Netherlands and Swiss Governments supports
institutional and capacity building initiatives, as well as analytical and advisory work that is aimed towards
improving trade and investment climate, which are highly relevant for the operation. These include the
World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) that has helped to make the GoI aware that, compared with
other middle-income countries in the region, Indonesia’s logistics performance still ranks relatively low,
with weak logistics infrastructure and customs clearance processes that are already undermining Indonesia’s
economic competitiveness.9 Through the MDFTIC, the Bank has also provided policy inputs to strengthen
policy coordination on the Indonesian National Single Window (INSW), the flow of cargo clearance, and
the regulatory framework for logistics services industries. Support was also provided to the GoI in its
development of the National Logistics Strategy (Sislognas), which presents a long term strategy to improve
logistics efficiency in Indonesia and includes action plans, an institutional coordination structure, and
mechanisms for private sector engagement.

    72. The parallel INSTANSI DPL-2 supports measures to enhance Indonesia’s capacity and
institutions to enhance poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts, and strengthen public
financial management, which directly contributes to the effective implementation of the proposed
Connectivity DPL-2. In the same way, the DPL series support to the GoI’s Connectivity agenda directly
contributes to the effective implementation of the other investment lending operations in the country.
Support that has been provided through the core DPL series covers the following policy areas that are highly
relevant for the proposed Connectivity DPL:

    Enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts

     73. The GoI’s intention to enhance poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts is largely
consistent with the Connectivity agenda. Since the 2009 elections, there has been renewed commitment
by the Government to intensify policy reforms towards enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity
efforts. The RPJMN 2010-2014 highlights the Government’s aim to lower the poverty rate to 8-10 percent
by 2014. The INSTANSI DPL series supports policy reforms that aim towards improving governance and
institutional accountability in poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts, through better measurement
and targeting of the poor and vulnerable in social assistance programs, as demonstrated by the
comprehensive compensation package for the subsidized fuel price increase, and implementation of a new
national social security system. Overall, these renewed and committed poverty reduction actions are
consistent with the proposed Connectivity DPL’s goal of ensuring inclusive development.

    Strengthening public financial management (PFM)

     74. The reform of public financial management systems will address some of the core problems
faced in the delivery of key investments, including those aimed at strengthening connectivity. The
PFM reforms supported under the INSTANSI DPL series complement the Connectivity DPL efforts, as they
are aimed at improving the medium-term results orientation of the budget process, introducing a more
efficient and effective automated budget and treasury system, and improving accounting, audit, tax
administration and sub-national fiscal management. All of these would greatly contribute to more efficient
delivery of key investments for strengthening national connectivity. Since adoption of a new regulatory
framework in 2003/4,10 the Government has embarked on a broad-based and ambitious PFM reform agenda.
The Government has been undertaking remarkable efforts to improve business processes and systems
throughout the entire budget cycle, including audit, legislative oversight and civil service reform. It has

  Compared to other middle income countries in the region, Indonesia ranks relatively low in the Logistics Performance Indicator
(LPI) of the World Bank. Indonesia ranked 43rd (out of 150 countries) in 2007, 75th (out of 155 countries) in 2010, and 59th (out of
155 countries) in 2012.
10
   The most noteworthy laws issued include the State Finance Law No. 17/2003, the State Treasury Law No. 1/2004 and the State
Financial Audit Law No. 15/2004.

                                                                26
thereby addressed a multitude of risks related to capacity constraints, poor infrastructure, and weak
governance across the PFM institutional and stakeholders’ landscape.

C. Collaboration with Other Development Partners and the IMF

    75. The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 has been prepared in collaboration with the Asia
Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Japan/JICA, which are providing parallel
financing to the GoI in implementing its connectivity agenda. The Bank has liaised closely with ADB
and the Government of Japan/JICA, since the onset of the Connectivity DPL program last year, in order to
ensure harmonization of their support program overall. Such harmonization has allowed the World Bank,
ADB and GoJ/JICA to build upon the natural synergies and complementarities that exists across their
respective portfolios. The harmonized approach to policy-based lending through the DPL program has also
provided a solid foundation to deepen the harmonization agenda in Indonesia with other development
partners surrounding this or other initiatives and programs.

     76. The Bank continues to liaise closely with the IMF. The IMF and the World Bank in Indonesia
continue to consult regularly on macro and sectoral issues, and the Bank coordinates closely with the Fund
in its missions, which help ensure that continued DPL support is warranted. In addition, the Bank, the Fund
and development partners have worked closely on the PFM agenda and the DPL’s indicative triggers have
been developed in close coordination. The DPL has thus provided a platform to push the reform agenda in
these crucial areas where both institutions are working.

D. Lessons Learned from other Development Policy Loan (DPL) Series

    77. Important lessons have been learned over the course of the core DPL and IDPL series,
which are relevant for the Connectivity DPL. These lessons stem from the nature and evolution of the
relationship between the Bank and the Government, and also from the characteristics of the DPL program as
a means of offering policy support, together with the changing policy environment on the ground. Some of
the lessons may be particular to the Indonesian case because of the broad scope and depth of the Bank’s
engagement with the Government, and the range of resources that the World Bank program in Indonesia has
access to through trust funds. As highlighted in the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Reports
for DPLs (7-8), the Indonesian DPLs benefit from a large field team presence that is actively engaged with
the Government through various other instruments in addition to the DPL. The socialization on both sides is
deep and the processing has become standard. As a result, although the task team leaders for the DPLs
change, the lessons learned from previous DPLs are seamlessly incorporated into future operations, and the
series has become more mature and efficient. The following lessons are particularly worth highlighting:

     78. Lesson 1: Strong government ownership and committed counterparts are vital, but just as
important is ownership over the pace of the reform process. As a growing middle-income country,
Indonesia can access domestic and international capital markets, thus offering it a range of financing
choices. While the Bank’s financing is attractive, the driving reason for the Government’s engagement with
the Bank through the DPL program is the utility of the instrument in bolstering, locking in and accelerating
critical reforms. To succeed, DPLs not only need the commitment of the Government at the highest level but
also that of mid-level officials responsible for implementing the reforms and following progress on a daily
basis.

     79. Lesson 2: Reflecting on the previous I-DPL series, ongoing Bank collaboration with
counterparts and support from a high level on policy dialogue are crucial for the success of DPL
operation. The Connectivity DPL has benefited from a high-level support through coordination meetings
chaired by the Deputy Minister of Bappenas to identify areas of policy reform that the Government wants
this DPL to support and to assess whether those reforms are on track. Such a level of government support


                                                    27
also helps increase commitment from the mid-level officials responsible for delivering the policy reforms.
Finally, as in other DPL program, constant dialogue between the Government and the Bank is fundamental
and is best facilitated by a strong field presence across sectors that views policy discussions as a natural part
of ongoing support.

    80. Lesson 3: As in I-DPL and other DPL operations, progress on institutional reforms need not
be linear and there should be sufficient flexibility for modifications and increased complexity as the
reform program evolves. Institutional reforms that involve changing the way the Government works,
especially in the face of entrenched interests and organizational cultures, are complicated, often
unpredictable undertakings for which there are no simple recipes. What is needed in this context is
commitment to reform, a continued sense of urgency, and preparedness so that when the right opportunity
presents itself, reforms that had otherwise been apparently slowed, may be advanced rapidly. This approach
can allow for progress through incremental reform.

    81. Lesson 4: DPLs are only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted
engagement, and the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political context and
the institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable in the Indonesian case because of the size
and scope of the World Bank program here. The Bank program in Indonesia is one of the largest of any
country in terms of number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are working closely on a daily basis
with government counterparts on a wide range of issues from public financial management and trade and
investment, to finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this context the DPL is not the only instrument
for supporting reform, but one of several important tools including analytical work, knowledge sharing, and
technical assistance.

    82. Lesson 5: Policy-based operations provide an important instrument to convene policy
makers, policy implementers, donors and others stakeholders for ongoing dialogue on sector issues.
As highlighted in the previous I-DPL operation, across the board, and particularly in the areas of PPP, the
water sector, and land acquisition, the convening power of the program was important to integrate related
programs and foster peer learning among unrelated activities. The land working group successfully brought
a complex land acquisition law to Parliament through an “action plan” developed by the inter-ministerial
working group (as part of I-DPL). Cross-fertilization across sectors took place in the case of Output-Based
Aid (OBA). The water sector’s success demonstrated to the road sector how OBA could be applied to road
maintenance.

     83. Lesson 6: The application of a set of basic principles has contributed greatly to the
successful implementation of the Indonesian DPL series. Based on earlier experience processing the DPL
series, the Bank team outlined a few principles to guide them when selecting policy areas and prior actions.
First, there has to be a robust engagement and relationship with key high-ranking counterparts who were
“champions” of reform, had reasonably well-defined agendas, and the authority to advance their agenda,
thereby ensuring strong government ownership and execution of the reforms. Second, the GoI counterpart
has to see some value to adding some element of their reform agenda or work program into the DPL process
and would therefore make the time and reform commitment to participating process. Third, there also has to
be a champion on the WB side for including the reform in the DPL process, which incentivized staff to
engage in the DPL if it was in parallel support to their work program. These three basic principles ensured
that the prior actions would be actively monitored by both sides for completion in a timely way.

    84. Lesson 7: For a mature DPL series, a broad program scope limits the breadth of the reforms
that can be taken. Given the coordinating nature of the DPL program across the three distinct pillars, in
order to keep it operational, the number of implementing agencies engaged has to be kept limited. This in
turn affects the policy areas and actions that can be selected. Also, as the key value of the DPL process is in
elevating reforms—a broad DPL is kept manageable by limiting the number of reforms selected. Therefore,
to deepen the reform agenda it makes sense to move to a sectoral DPL, which will allow involving a broader

                                                       28
set of institutions and increase the number of reforms in the policy area. This approach will maximize
synergies across the Bank’s program in Indonesia, increase ownership of the related policy reforms by the
relevant institutions, and improve targeting of complementary technical assistance programs. A similar
action was done in the first DPL series, when the infrastructure component was spun out into its own DPL
series, this allowed the management of the DPL for PREM related actions to be set in the core DPL and the
infrastructure-related items to rest with the SD team.

    85. Lesson 8: The splitting of the DPL series is a positive reflection that the value of the DPL
series extends beyond the financial disbursements. Although the new DPL series will provide a combined
financing similar to the core DPL series, the Government’s willingness to invest more of its time to process
three DPL highlights the benefits gained from the DPL process. DPLs have provided a convening forum for
the various units within the Government, but also within the Bank, to discuss reform priorities, progress, and
cross-agency issues, e.g. M&E. Development partners, even with no financial involvement in the DPL, have
attended the DPL meetings as a useful means of gauging the priorities and issues in the Government’s
reform agenda.

    86. Lesson 9: A gradual approach should be taken when working with newly created
institutions. In the case of DPL-7, there was a great sense that the creation of the new task force TNP2K
would help energize the policy reforms areas of Pillar 3 and an ambitious reform agenda was envisioned.
However, there were complications in the relationship between TNP2K and Bappenas that contributed to a
complex environment for achievement of the prior actions. Moreover, it also served to distract from other
poverty reform areas that the Bank and Bappenas/TNP2K were working on, as more time was spent
resolving DPL issues. Therefore, although Pillar 3 was an established reform area, and both government
counterparts had committed champions, it would have been better to have gradually introduced the reform
agenda to test out the political dynamics of the two units.


                                   V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

    A. Overview of the Connectivity DPL

     87. The GoI has requested that the Bank continues to support implementation of the
connectivity agenda, as outlined in the National Connectivity Strategy and Action Plan, through the
proposed US$300 million Connectivity DPL-2. The proposed operation will continue to deepen reform
efforts that have been initiated under the previous Connectivity DPL, which are aimed at improving the
efficiency of domestic logistics and strengthening inclusive development. The proposed operation is
expected to strengthen the mechanisms and time-bound processes for the GoI to coordinate and identify the
second batch of reform actions that are necessary to unlock key regulatory barriers towards improving
connectivity. The operation will also help facilitate important decision-making processes by the GoI on the
allocation of public resources to improve the access and quality of public infrastructure and public services,
with regards to improving national connectivity. An integral part of MP3EI and the RPJMN 2010-2014, the
National Connectivity Strategy looks at both the physical and institutional arrangements that need to be
strengthened in order to achieve better development outcomes.

    88. This proposed Connectivity DPL-2 is the second of a multi-year programmatic DPL series.
The operation is envisioned to be the second of a programmatic DPL series focused on strengthening
Indonesia’s connectivity. To ensure full ownership of the program, a detailed mapping out of the
programmatic DPL series has been developed jointly with Bappenas, the Coordinating Ministry for
Economic Affairs and relevant line ministries/agencies, since the onset of the Connectivity DPL last year,
which provides a time-bound process for the GoI to coordinate and implement policy reforms on
connectivity. This process is critical to ensure sustained follow-up from recent government and
parliamentary initiatives in issuing high-level regulations to support the connectivity agenda, which were

                                                     29
acknowledged by the Connectivity DPL last year. Given that implementation of the GoI’s connectivity
agenda involves GoI agencies beyond core economic ministries, the proposed operation’s support for the
GoI’s efforts to strengthen the coordination and reform processes among the various agencies, including the
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Public Works, is critically important. The
Government has recently indicated the possibility of continuing the engagement through a follow-on
Connectivity DPL operation. Ideas on policy reforms in connectivity have emerged and will need to be
adjusted and refined as progress is made and discussions with GoI counterparts evolve.

    89. The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 policy actions have been developed based on the program
that was identified in the previous year, with some modifications to ensure consistency with the
ongoing progress in GoI development efforts and initiatives. Aligned with the RPJMN 2010-2014 and
MP3EI, the policy actions surround the following pillars:

i)      Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation through establishment of regulatory and
        institutional frameworks for improved coordination and implementation of the connectivity agenda;
ii)     Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity through improved connectivity among and between
        growth poles, with improved regulatory framework for land acquisition for public purpose
        development and optimal use of resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of island-
        transport network;
iii)    Improving Inter-island Connectivity through strengthened ICT connectivity between eastern and
        western Indonesia and more competition in broadband services, and improving the efficiency of
        domestic shipping which is crucial to lower logistics costs in an archipelago like Indonesia; and
iv)     Improving International Connectivity (trade facilitation) by strengthening the institutions and
        processes in handling traffic and trade volume.

     90. A Connectivity Working Group, chaired by a Deputy Minister of Bappenas, has been
established, which helps put in place a clear coordination structure for implementation of the
connectivity action plan. The Working Group distinguishes issues of intra-island, inter-island and
international connectivity. There is awareness that successful improvements of connectivity in these three
areas will involve a wide range of stakeholders in both the public and private sector. Consequently, the need
for a proper institutional framework and strong coordination in the implementation of the connectivity
strategy has been recognized. This establishment is also expected to strengthen the Bank engagement with
Bappenas on connectivity, which evolved during the preparation of the National Connectivity Strategy.

    91. The proposed prior actions represent critical policy and institutional actions towards longer-
term reforms, over which the GoI has demonstrated strong ownership and commitment. These prior
actions (Table 4) have undergone an extensive consultation and consensus-building process among the key
GoI stakeholders. The GoI has demonstrated strong ownership and commitment over these actions, and their

very inclusion in the DPL helps to ensure sustained focus on the policy issues, the ongoing deliberation of
policy options and the eventual reform breakthroughs. In addition to the prior actions, the operation also
supports a set of benchmark actions that do not pose any conditionality over the disbursement of the DPL
financing. The GoI specifically requested that these benchmarks be acknowledged in order to demonstrate
its pace and the broad scope of the reform process surrounding the connectivity agenda. The distinction
between prior actions and benchmarks helps ensure sustained GoI ownership and commitment, and the
mapping out of a comprehensive and multi-year DPL program. A detailed list of prior actions and
benchmarks is provided in Annex 2: Connectivity DPL Two-Year Program Policy Matrix and Results Framework .

               B. Key Reform Directions and Policy Areas Supported by the Connectivity DPL

B.1. Policy Area I: Strengthening National Coordination and Regulation

a. Background

    93. The Connectivity DPL has supported efforts to strengthen the policy coordination needed to
move forward on the connectivity agenda. The GoI has stepped up efforts to strengthen the inter-agency
coordination and decision-making process on connectivity. Through the issuance of Presidential Regulation
No. 32/ 2011, the GoI appointed the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs (CMEA) as the executive
chairman for implementing MP3EI, which makes connectivity an important pillar among a 3-pillar strategy
to accelerate growth and development in Indonesia. The regulation also provides a basis for the GoI to
ensure that various proposed policies and national strategies around connectivity, such as in the medium-
term development plan (RPJMN), the national logistics strategy (Sislognas), and the national transport
master plan (Sistranas), are coherent. Subsequently, the CMEA has established various inter-ministerial
teams11 involving the private sector in order to coordinate and implement different elements of MP3EI,
supported by a dedicated Secretariat (KP3EI). In this respect, the Connectivity Working Group led by the
Deputy Minister of Bappenas is playing an important role in coordinating policy actions.12

    94. Nevertheless, a weak mandate in resolving bottlenecks on decisions over key priority
infrastructure projects can weaken public confidence to invest in connectivity infrastructure. Ideally,
there should be a cabinet-level institution or a senior minister with a mandate to coordinate and take
decisions on the implementation of large connectivity infrastructure projects. Indonesia had a successful
experience with the Recovery and Reconstruction Agency (BRR), which was responsible for coordinating
and implementing reconstruction efforts in Aceh after the 2005 tsunami. Similar institutional arrangements
applied to key infrastructure projects can help to send a strong signal that the Government is serious about
tackling bottlenecks in infrastructure development, such as the land acquisition process, project preparation,
and conflicting regulations across agencies or between central and local governments. The ability to address
bottlenecks in decision-making is crucial given that some of the projects are already listed as priorities under
MP3EI. The Government currently relies on the Committee for Accelerating Infrastructure Development
(KKPPI), an inter-ministerial coordination facility established by Presidential Regulation No. 42/2005,
designated to promote and champion infrastructure provision and coordination of infrastructure policy and
planning across line ministries, SOEs, and local governments responsible for project preparation and
implementation. However, KKPPI so far has not been able to perform optimally due to the absence of a
strong mandate to take decisions, too many members, and a lack of resources for its Secretariat. As a result,
there have been numerous cases of project delays, poor project preparation, and red-tape, all of which have
hindered the development of key infrastructure projects.


11
   Through CMEA Regulation No.PER-06/M.EKON/08/2011, CMEA Decree No.KEP-35/M.EKON/08/2011 and CMEA Decree
No.KEP-36/M.EKON/08/2011.
12
   These include working teams on: regulation, connectivity, human resources and science technology, and the six economic
corridors (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, and Papua and Maluku islands).

                                                            33
    95. The Connectivity DPL has also supported government efforts to introduce a clear and
transparent mechanism to channel public funds to viable PPP infrastructure projects. Both the
RPJMN 2010-2014 and MP3EI envision public-private partnerships (PPPs) playing a key role in mobilizing
private sector investment for infrastructure development. Despite recent efforts to establish a framework for
PPPs and pursuing several PPP transactions, progress has generally been slow due to various factors. These
include the poor quality of project preparation prior to bidding, a weak pipeline of bankable PPP projects,
and the absence of a consistent framework and procedures on the processing of PPP projects. In order to
address these key bottlenecks, the GoI has in recent years strengthened the institutional architecture
supporting PPPs and established dedicated agencies/policies. These include the Indonesia Infrastructure
Guarantee Fund, Indonesia Infrastructure Finance and SMI, Viability Gap Financing (VGF) program, and
more recently, the GoI is working to establish a PPP Unit and Project Development Facility (PDF). The
challenge now is to make these institutional mechanisms operational and well-coordinated. The
Connectivity DPL-1 supported the issuance of Finance Minister Regulation (PMK No. 223/2012), which
sets up Indonesia’s Viability Gap Financing (VGF) program as a mechanism to provide public sector
financial support to well-prepared PPPs in order to make them financially viable. The key next step is to
develop detailed operational procedures to implement the provisions of VGF PMK No. 223/2012 so that
VGF support can be channeled to well-prepared PPPs. Such an achievement will send an important signal
of the Government’s readiness and commitment to address the private sector’s concerns surrounding project
viability, while also fulfilling the Government’s objective of affordability.


    b. Proposed Policy Actions

    Reform aim: Strengthen policy coordination and reforms surrounding connectivity

    96. The Government is currently working on a draft Presidential Regulation that would allow
KKPPI to accelerate delivery of key infrastructure projects. To this end, the government has allocated
budget in the FY2014 Financial Notes and Draft Budget to support a committee responsible for the
preparation of said priority infrastructure projects. Recently the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs
has been tasked with drafting a Presidential Regulation to empower KKPPI with a more effective process in
making decisions and supporting infrastructure development. In particular, the new process will include only
the Head of Bappenas, the Minister of Finance, and the Head of the National Land Agency as team members
led by the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs. The revised decree is also expected to provide
KKPPI with the necessary mandate to make decisions on the implementation of key infrastructure projects.
To the extent that the Government wishes to increase the private sector’s participation in public
infrastructure investment, KKPPI will also have the resources to do project preparation and the power to
decide on the financing arrangements of proposed infrastructure projects (i.e., government investment, full
private sector, or PPP).
    97. The GoI has established a clear, transparent market-based mechanism to promote
infrastructure PPPs. The World Bank has supported the GoI in developing a Viability Gap Financing
(VGF) program that will provide public sector financial support to well-prepared PPPs to make them
financially viable for greater market uptake. The GoI, with technical advice from the World Bank, is now
developing detailed operational procedures to implement the provisions of VGF PMK No.223/2012 that
established the VGF program in December 2012. The proposed operation provides strong support for the
operation of the VGF through Ministerial signing a Minister of Finance Regulation on operational
procedures to implement Minister of Finance Regulation No. 223/2012 on the channeling of government
funds to public-private partnership projects in infrastructure. The Regulation lays out clear eligibility criteria
for VGF support, VGF approval processes, VGF allocation and disbursement, and procedural and
documentation requirements of CAs and private investors to secure VGF support, as well as contractual and
monitoring arrangements. The Regulation also provides operational rules and procedures to guide the
allocation of public VGF contributions to carefully selected PPPs with high social/economic returns, and


                                                       34
introduce fiscal discipline. The proposed operation is therefore well-aligned with, and provides an additional
push to, the GoI’s efforts to implement the VGF mechanism. Specifically, the corresponding policy trigger
is the submission to the Minister of Finance of a draft MoF regulation on operational procedures to
implement VGF PMK No. 223/2012 for channeling government funds to infrastructure PPPs in order to
make them financially viable. It is noteworthy that the VGF mechanism does not entail contingent liability
to the Government, as the funding is subject to an appraisal process and will be of a specific amount that is
budgeted for annually, with disbursement based on construction milestones.
     c. Expected results

    98. The expected result from this policy area will be enhanced policy coordination and reforms
surrounding national connectivity, as demonstrated by the various GoI authorities taking timely and
appropriate measures to undertake the necessary reforms. This will be measured by:
         Improved guidance in policy formulation in trade logistics reform;
         Increased government effectiveness and rapidity in supporting priority infrastructure development;
          and;
         Establishment of an Indonesian VGF Program to attract private investments in PPP projects that
          improve connectivity

     B.2. Policy Area II: Strengthening Intra-island Connectivity

     a. Background

     99. The first Connectivity DPL supported the strengthening of the legal and regulatory
framework for the land acquisition process for public infrastructure projects. The previous operation
acknowledged the enactment of new Land Acquisition Law No. 2/2012 for Public Infrastructure and
Presidential Regulation No. 71/2012, which set the institutional arrangements for implementing the law. The
law marks an important development and significant improvement in the procedures for acquiring land for
public infrastructure. Areas of significant improvement surround the process for land valuation, the
mechanisms for grievances, and compensation for affected persons.13 In particular, the new regulation
governs the inventory of affected people and assets, the consultation process, compensation, and dispute
settlement. It also sets a specific timeframe for each of the acquisition stages and sub-stages, including the
maximum time that a court may take to resolve disputes related to land acquisition . The issuance of the law
and the Presidential Regulation is expected to promote greater clarity and transparency over the land
acquisition process, which will ultimately help to strengthen public confidence in the Government’s efforts
to push forward with public infrastructure investment, including those efforts aimed at improving
connectivity.

   100. Issuance of technical guidelines, socialization, and capacity building are important
remaining issues in order to effectively implement the new regulatory framework to procure land for
public infrastructure. The Government aims to apply the new regulatory framework on new public



13
   In 2012, the GoI issued several pieces of legislation relating to land acquisition to be carried out for projects of public purpose
(Law No. 2/2012 in January 2012; Presidential Regulation No. 71/2012 in August 2012; and technical guidelines issued by the
relevant ministries). These replaced previous presidential regulations that had been unable to support accelerated infrastructure
development in Indonesia while ensuring that people affected by the negative impacts of associated land acquisition were adequately
protected. Pursuant to Law No. 2/2012, Presidential Regulation No. 36/05 as amended is valid until 31 December 2014. The new
legislations procedure applies to the acquisition of land under the authority and control of the National Land Agency. If land needed
is under the authority of other ministries such as Ministry of Forestry, then before such land can be dealt with under the new
legislations procedure, it must be released from forest zoning pursuant to applicable forestry legislation or other relevant legislation
like mining, natural gas, etc

                                                                  35
infrastructure projects.14 To support that, the government has tasked the National Land Agency (BPN) to
develop technical guidelines to process land acquisition for public infrastructure development. These are
critical guidelines for providing clarity on roles and responsibilities of BPN and relevant government
agencies to organize four stages of processing, namely planning, preparation, implementation, and transfer
of the acquired land. The guidelines are also important for establishing more detailed steps in the
identification and verification of affected persons and their assets, valuation, and payment of compensation.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Home Affairs have issued guidelines for the use of
central government or local government budget to cover operational expenses for acquiring land for public
infrastructure. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs has been coordinating efforts to socialize
the new regulatory framework to regional government agencies. These three guidelines are expected to play
a critical role in paving the way for pushing ahead priority public infrastructure projects, which in turn can
serve as a “demonstration effect” for other public connectivity infrastructure projects.

    101. The first Connectivity DPL operation supported the GoI’s effort to restructure the railway
sector to become more competitive and responsive to public needs. Indonesia is laying the regulatory
foundation for moving from a state run, single railway operator, towards line-of-business railway model
with multi operators, private sector participation, and open access to railway infrastructures. Subsequent to
the enactment of Law No. 23/2007 on Railways, the previous Connectivity DPL operation supported the
Government’s issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 53/2012, which sets the institutional arrangements
and general rules for the provision of subsidized passenger services under public service obligations (PSO),
infrastructure maintenance operations (IMO), and track access charges (TAC) in the railway sector. The
Presidential Regulation serves as an important milestone to encourage operators in the sector to move
towards a line-of-business type of model (i.e., passenger service provider, freight service provider, railway
track operator).15 The new regulatory framework also opens up the Indonesian railway sector to private
investment, which is expected to increase competition levels in commercial cargo and passenger rail
services, and in the maintenance of railway infrastructure.

     102. Nevertheless, there is a need for the Government to provide greater certainty over the sums
to be provided to the railway operator, in terms of PSO compensation. Ensuring minimum access to
reliable rail services for low-income passengers has a desirable impact from an equity standpoint and also
from an economic efficiency point of view as such passengers will be less likely to opt for less energy
efficient road transport.16 The Government requires the provision of PSO on passenger rail services for low-
income passengers at subsidized tariffs that are then reimbursed. However, past experience suggests that
there has been a lack of clarity in the process of reimbursing PSO on passenger rail services. This situation
has deteriorated service levels and undermined incentives for PT KAI and prospective operators to provide
PSO services. More importantly, a lack of credibility in reimbursing PSO services can undermine the
restructuring process in Indonesia’s railway sector as there will be much less incentive for the existing
railway operator to move away from the integrated railway business, which allows cross-subsidization from
cargo services to loss-making passenger services.

    103. The absence of clear guidelines on reimbursing infrastructure maintenance and charging
access to railway track could weaken the restructuring process in the railway sector. Until this year,
these had been uncertainties as to whether the railway operator, PT KAI, would be compensated for
maintaining railway infrastructure, which covers tracks, bridges, railway crossings and signaling systems.
So far, the Government has taken a simplified approach by considering the IMO reimbursement to the rail

14
   Meanwhile, land procurement for infrastructure projects that are currently on-going or were proposed prior to the new regulatory
framework will continue to be accommodated by the old law and regulations mentioned above until 31 December 2014.
15
    This was initiated by the transformation of the state railway agency (Perumka), which operated railway services and owned
railway infrastructure, into a state-owned railway company (PT KAI) in 1999. Today, PT KAI only operates railway services and
maintains railway infrastructure on behalf of the Government.
16
   Government estimated diesel consumption for railway and bus passenger transport are 0.002 litre/km/passenger and 0.012
litre/km/passenger, respectively.

                                                                36
operator, PT KAI, as being equal to the TAC that the Government should receive from PT KAI, without
considering potential increases in wear due to an increase in traffic volume or potential revenues from
providing track access to other prospective railway operators. The absence of any clear guidelines for
reimbursing infrastructure maintenance could seriously undermine the capacity of this railway infrastructure
to function properly, which in turn will also undermine safety. Therefore, the current practice of setting IMO
as being equal to TAC also undermines the process of PT KAI moving towards a line-of-business model and
discourages other prospective operators from participating in the provision of railway services.

    b. Proposed Policy Actions

   Reform aim: Increase investor confidence and stakeholder participation in the national connectivity
agenda

    104. The GoI continues to strengthen the regulatory framework for land acquisition for public
interest projects, which will help improve investor confidence in infrastructure investments, as well as
improve the due process and compensation standards for affected parties. Following the enactment of
Law No. 2/2012 and issuance of Presidential Regulation No.71/2012 on land acquisition for public purpose
development, the National Land Agency has assigned roles to, and has established the processes for, the
relevant agencies of the Borrower when acquiring land for public purpose development through the issuance
of technical guidelines (Regulation of the Head of BPN No.5/2012) to implement Law No. 2/2012 and
Presidential Regulation No. 71/2012. The guidelines stipulate: (i) organizational structure of the land
acquisition implementing team; (ii) compensation in emergency conditions; and (iii) coordination of the
implementation of land acquisition. To the extent that most of the land acquisition process happens at the
local level, the Government also needs to increase the capacity of BPN’s resources and staffing to
effectively implement the process of land acquisition for public infrastructure.

     105. The GoI also clarified the financing mechanisms for land acquisition for public interest
projects. The GoI has issued a Minister of Finance Regulation (No.13/PMK.02/2013) stating which
expenditures related to land acquisition for public purpose development are eligible to be covered by the
national state budget, and a Minister of Home Affairs Regulation (No.72/2012) stating which expenditures
related to land acquisition for public purpose development are eligible to be covered by local government
budgets. Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 13/PMK.02/2013 stipulates: (i) operational and supporting
costs for implementation of land acquisition sourced from APBN (state budget); and (ii) establishment and
honoraria for the team. Whereas Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation No. 72/2012 stipulates: (i)
operational and supporting costs for implementation of land acquisition sourced from local government
budget (APBD); and (ii) determination of the price for implementation of land acquisition sourced from
APBD (provincial/regent/city budget). Altogether, these guidelines and regulations are expected to play a
critical role in paving the way for pushing ahead priority public infrastructure projects, which in turn, can
serve as a “demonstration effect” for other public connectivity infrastructure projects.

     106. At the same time, the Government continues to socialize the new legal and regulatory
framework for land acquisition. In July 2013, Bappenas organized a workshop inviting BPN as the
initiator of the new law, and relevant ministries/state companies as the users of the new legislation, such as
the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and PLN, as well as development
partners (ADB, World Bank, and JICA), to better understand the likely effects of the new legislation. With
respect to the development partner-financed projects in particular, the possibility of using the country system
for land acquisition activities involving development partners’ projects was explored. Although it was found
that there is not much difference between the new legislation and development partners’ policy in
investment lending, there is a need to elaborate on the option for non-cash compensation during project
preparation, particularly in relation with land-to-land compensation or resettlement plans. The valuation of



                                                      37
compensation is mandated to be assessed by independent appraisers under MAPPI,17 with guidelines for
compensation involving market price, transaction and other costs, plus a premium (to cover costs over and
above the valuation, such as emotional loss). The Bank continues to collaborate with CMEA as the
Secretariat of the Socialization and Assistance Team for implementation of land acquisition for public
purpose development, which is responsible in coordinating and monitoring the implementation and
application of the new legislation. Furthermore, the Team organized a national workshop in April 2013 to
disseminate the new law and regulations to state and provincial-level companies, such as the power
company (PLN), gas, and the railway operator (PT KAI). Going forward, the Team plans to disseminate the
new law and regulations to judges at the Supreme Court, and to prosecutors at the Attorney General’s
Office, and policymakers in central and local governments. The Team will also continue to provide
facilitation in handling land acquisition problems and monitoring the land acquisition plan, as well as its
implementation.

       Reform aim: Strengthen progress in restructuring of the railway sector

     107. The Government continues with efforts to alter the incentive structures and regulatory
environment in the railway sector. Despite the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 53/2012 on
provisions of PSO, at present there is no mechanism for calculating and reimbursing a PSO in railways.
Similarly, PT KAI as operator of rolling stock and rail has never received payment for maintaining public
rail track (IMO) from the Government as it has always been considered equal to the access charge that PT
KAI would have paid to the Government. The absence of clear guidelines will deter potential investors in
the railway sector. To address these concerns, the Minister of Transport has issued guidelines (Minister of
Transportation Regulations PM.10/2013 and PM.56/2013) for the provision and reimbursement of a Public
Service Obligation in the railway sector to provide affordable passenger railway services. Subsidies for PSO
per passenger are calculated based on the difference between the tariff per km per passenger (determined
using a MoT Regulation) and the (actual) fare per km charged to passengers (the fares are determined by the
Government) plus a reasonable margin. Meanwhile, the IMO is the cost of railway infrastructure
maintenance and operation that is the responsibility of the infrastructure operator or the Government, and
TAC is the cost of using the track that must be paid by rolling stock operators to the infrastructure operator.
The GoI has issued guidelines for the provision of (i) Infrastructure Maintenance Operation (Minister of
Transportation Regulation PM.67/2013), and (ii) Track Access Charges (Minister of Transportation
Regulation PM.62/2013) to support the restructuring process in the railway sector as mandated by Law No.
23/2007 and by Presidential Regulation (No. 53/2012). The regulations will be the basis for Government to
allocate public funds for PSO subsidies, payments for IMO and for calculating TAC to charge the rolling-
stock operators. For provisions of passenger PSOs in railways, the guidelines establish procedures by which
the Government can procure PSOs, process contracts, and ensure deliverables from railway operators. The
Government is also establishing clear definitions on eligible items or services that can be reimbursed by the
Government on services provided by railway operators for low-income passengers. Guidelines for TAC
establish a methodology for calculating track access charges for railway operators who wish to use public
railway facilities.

       c. Expected results

    108. The expected results from this policy area will be progress in intra-island connectivity that
will be measured by:
     Greater clarity, certainty, and transparency in the land acquisition process for public infrastructure
        projects;
     Improved clarity and transparency in the provisions and reimbursement of a Public Service
        Obligation (PSO) in the railway sector; and

     B.3. Policy Area III: Improving Inter-island Connectivity


     a. Background
    109. Expanding access to information and communication technology (ICT) is an efficient means
for connecting business or personal activities across Indonesia. Access to ICT has improved
considerably during the past decade, as a result of major investments by Indonesia’s
telecommunications/ICT industry. Access to basic telephone services has also improved considerably over
the past decade. Similarly, mobile networks have grown in terms of size, capacity and coverage, with both
Telkomsel and XL reporting more than 95 percent population coverage. As of Q1 2012, the total number of
mobile and fixed wireless had grown to about 282 million, with mobile penetration exceeding 100 percent of
the population.18 Access to broadband is increasing, particularly with regard to mobile broadband, with
about 100 million mobile internet users. Fixed broadband access is also increasing, albeit more slowly, with
PT Telkom being the only company allowed to offer ADSL services over fixed copper lines. The company
is approaching 2 million subscribers. These services are increasingly being offered not only in major cities,
but also at the kecamatan level throughout Java, Bali and Sumatra.
    110. However, Indonesia faces significant challenges in order to meet the rapidly growing
demand for ICT. Demand for broadband internet, for instance, is accelerating throughout Indonesia,
ranging from large and small businesses, to universities, to government institutions. In eastern Indonesia,
Maluku and Papua have no terrestrial (e.g., fiber optic) backbone and are totally dependent on expensive and
limited capacity satellite connectivity. Hence, broadband access is very limited and restricted by a lack of
affordable capacity. Although ADSL and 3G have been deployed as access technology, providers cannot
offer sufficient broadband capacity due to the lack of infrastructure. Other access gaps are found in other
economically disadvantaged or geographically remote areas across the country. In order to meet the rapidly
growing demand quickly, Indonesia requires not only ongoing investments from the telecommunications
industry, but also proactive regulatory measures to increase the competitiveness of the fixed broadband
market. Without these measures, Indonesia’s broadband access gap will continue to grow. Specifically,
Indonesia will need to: (i) close the access gap by extending the reach of broadband internet to rural and
remote areas, particularly those that the industry considers as commercially unviable; (ii) develop “next-
generation” broadband networks, including high-speed communications fiber optic backbone infrastructure,
broadband access networks (including fiber optic access), and mobile broadband services wherever there are
mobile telephony services (over 95 percent of the population); and (iii) stimulate further investment in the
sector, including through private-public partnerships, by enhancing competition, maintaining the momentum
of policy and regulatory reform, and taking into account global trends in communications technology change
and market structures.
    111. The previous Connectivity DPL supported an important mechanism to boost the process of
connecting remote areas with broadband services. The Government established the ICT Fund financed
by a levy on the telecoms industry of 1.25 percent of net revenues to support development of ICT
infrastructure to unserved or underserved areas in Indonesia that the industry considers commercially less
viable. Connectivity DPL-1 supported the issuance of Ministry of Communications and Information
Regulation No. 23/2012 on the use of the ICT Fund to support the development of broadband ICT
infrastructure in underserved areas in Indonesia. The decree marked an important step stimulating public
investment in ICT using fees collected from private operators.
   112. Improving domestic sea freight is another critical area for Indonesia’s national connectivity.
The archipelagic setting of Indonesia means that sea freight plays an important role in logistics chains. A
18
  This reflects multiple SIM card ownership (typically 2), so the actual mobile user base is estimated to be closer to 135 million
persons (55 percent penetration).

                                                                 39
significant proportion of the population and economic output are concentrated on the island of Java.
However, the lion’s share of deposits of natural resources and the production of raw materials are dispersed
in other areas/islands throughout the country. Meanwhile, regions on other islands are also experiencing
rapid urbanization as income per capita increases along with population. However, inter-island shipping
services in Indonesia are currently characterized by high costs and low levels of reliability, creating a major
constraint in the transportation of consumer goods to remote and often poor islands. These high costs are an
important contributing factor to the generally higher and more volatile prices of consumer goods in remote
provinces. They are also a constraint in bringing commodities to processing facilities and bringing products
to market (usually in Java and overseas). In order to improve inter-island connectivity, the key objective
should be to reduce the cost of inter-island cargo transportation and make this transportation more reliable.
For example, shipping a container from Jakarta to Banjarmasin (Kalimantan) on average takes 16 days.
However, there is considerable variation, with actual sailing times ranging from 4 to 47 days. This
uncertainty increases logistic costs of inter-island trade. Therefore, establishing an efficient and reliable sea
freight network across the archipelago is important for the Indonesian economy to facilitate domestic supply
responses to meet the increasing demand for goods. The challenge for Indonesia is to develop the necessary
infrastructure and regulatory framework to improve sea freight services, which help to link different nodes
or poles of production and consumption in different islands across the archipelago.
    113. The Government realizes that upgrading the productivity of sea ports is an important
element in developing a more efficient and reliable sea freight sector. Poor productivity at the country’s
ports is believed to contribute to the high cost of domestic shipping and is likely to have undermined the
incentives for vessel operators to upgrade their fleets. According to Law No. 17/2008 on Shipping, the
Government should put in place incentives and a regulatory structure that facilitate efficiency in port
operations across Indonesia. The Government has since issued guidelines and regulations to restructure the
port sector, such as separating port operators from port authorities. The Government has also put forward a
procedure for tendering port development to the private sector or state-owned companies.
    114. Nevertheless, progress in developing Indonesia’s port sector suffers from uncertainties over
the Government’s plans and priorities. The absence of a baseline assessment on port capacity, traffic
volumes and projection on traffic volumes based on regional and national development prospects have
caused differing views on where and what type of ports the Government should facilitate. The local
government once promoted Bojonegara in Banten as a location for an international port to replace Tanjung
Priok in Jakarta, and offered it for further uptake to potential investors. Meanwhile, there has been
uncertainty over whether Cilamaya in West Java will be considered as an alternative location for future
development of an international port to replace Tanjung Priok and serve the manufacturing belt in Bekasi,
Cikarang, and Cikampek. There is a need for the Government to establish an agenda for port sector
development that can act as a guide to the prioritization and strategy of individual port development plans.


    b. Proposed Policy Actions

   Reform aim: Strengthen ICT connectivity between eastern and western Indonesia, and introduce
more competition in broadband services

    115. Stimulating increased and more equitable access to ICT, particularly broadband internet, in
Indonesia requires a combination of supportive investment and regulatory measures on the part of
the Government. On the regulatory side, the GoI is undertaking various reforms such as: (a) the preparation
of convergent (non-service-specific) licensing to replace Telecommunications Law No. 36/1999; (b) the
introduction of updated regulations on infrastructure sharing; and (c) the revision of regulations on radio
spectrum (frequency) management, including reframing in the light of emerging needs. On the investment
side, as supported under the first Connectivity DPL, the Ministry of Communications and Information
issued Ministerial Regulation No. 23/2012 on the use of the ICT Fund to support the development of
broadband ICT infrastructure in underserved areas of Indonesia. This basically establishes a mechanism to

                                                       40
utilize the ICT Fund financed through a levy on the telecoms industry of 1.25 percent of net revenues, to
stimulate investment in unserved and underserved areas that the industry considers commercially less viable.
To ensure effective implementation of the ICT Fund, the Minister of Communications and Information has
completed the identification of the remote districts (kabupaten) to be covered by the ICT Fund and has
estimated the budget requirements for the first phase of telecommunications broadband projects to be
financed by the ICT Fund.. There is significant progress towards implementing the GoI's universal access
program for broadband, and represents the culmination of substantial work including technical, economic
and financial analyses and regulatory measures to address the country's "digital divide". The program is also
being implemented through a PPP mechanism, in itself a significant achievement.


    Reform aim: Improve the policy environment for domestic sea shipping


    116. Advancing the agenda of port development is an important pre-requisite for improving
domestic sea freight in Indonesia. In MP3EI and the National Logistics Blueprint, the Government has laid
out an ambitious plan to enhance connectivity between economic corridors through improvements in
domestic sea freight. To support this, the GoI has issued Minister of Transportation Regulation No.
KP414/2013 establishing the classification and location of all Indonesian sea ports based on traffic
projections in order to establish development plans for each individual sea port for the next 20 years. The
Regulation will serve as a basis for developing detailed investment plans for each individual sea port across
Indonesia. The Master Plan also indicates some policy changes and regulations needed to implement the
plan. This information is also important for stakeholders to anticipate policy changes and give their input to
the proposed regulations. From a policy sequence point of view, this is an important process for guiding
subsequent actions for prioritizing development, resource allocation, and signaling to the public and private
sectors about plans for the port sector. To support the task, development partners such as AusAID have
been providing technical assistance to help the Government prioritize policy in the port sector based on
projections of traffic demand for containers and bulk freight across regions in Indonesia.


    c. Expected results

   117. The expected results from this policy area will be improved inter-island connectivity, as
demonstrated by:
    Progress made in the development of broadband services to remote and under-served areas in
       eastern Indonesia; and
    Progress made in the development of individual ports.

    B.4. Policy Area IV: Improving International Connectivity

    a. Background

    118. International connectivity is a key factor if Indonesia is to maximize the benefits of
globalization. Improving efficiency in international connectivity enables domestic products to reach foreign
markets at competitive prices. It also enables domestic manufacturers and consumers to obtain imported
inputs and consumer goods at good prices and according to schedule, which is important in the global
economy where just-in-time production and delivery are increasingly valued. Currently, high transaction
costs due to port inefficiencies, congestion, and border transactions are the largest obstacles preventing
Indonesian businesses from fully benefiting from globalization. These inefficiencies also make it necessary
for manufacturers to keep larger stocks in warehouses than would be optimal, driving up inventory costs.
Although Indonesia has demonstrated improvements in facilitating trade, the capacity of physical
infrastructure and public institutions in facilitating the movement of goods across borders is lagging behind

                                                     41
Indonesia’s major regional competitors. The ability to move goods and services across borders rapidly,
cheaply, and with a high degree of predictability, is a critical determinant of export competitiveness.

     119. Growth of the export-import trade and the lack of handling capacity in Indonesian ports
have led to longer dwell times. Currently, the dwell time in the port of Jakarta (which handles more than 70
percent of Indonesia's external trade) is more than 8 days, which is longer than that in ports in other ASEAN
countries. In Indonesia, dwell times are long mainly because of the considerable length of pre-clearance (the
time needed to prepare the Customs declaration). Many processes during pre-clearance have to be done
sequentially and cannot be done in parallel. In addition, there is a delay because most pre-clearance
activities can only be undertaken after the ship has arrived in the port of Jakarta. The Government has
already established an informal team, chaired by Customs, which aims to identify the bottlenecks to reduce
pre-clearance. Subsequently, the team aims at regulatory reform to reduce the pre-clearance dwell time. So
far, efforts have borne little success and it remains necessary for Indonesia to continue learning from
regional practices, given that several neighboring countries have been able to reduce the length of their
dwell times successfully. Key policy instruments used by neighbors include a greater participation by the
private sector in the management of terminals, which has promoted competition, better formulation of
measures affecting trade, and the introduction of dry ports at which some of the import clearance process
can take place, rather than in the congested ports themselves.

    120. In Connectivity DPL-1, the Bank supported the reform initiative on the INSW as the main
portal for facilitating cross-border trade. INSW is part of an ASEAN regional trade facilitation initiative
introduced in 2007 to reduce face-to-face interaction in customs clearance by facilitating data exchange for
import/export documents for clearance across different border agencies. The launch marked a major step
towards reducing the time for importing and exporting, and is expected to strengthen Indonesia’s trade
competitiveness. Further development was conducted in stages, and currently 18 permit/license issuing
agencies (fewer than 15 ministries/government agencies) are participating as they grant permits or licenses
for export or import with at least 48 different export documents, 106 different import documents and 23
supporting documents. Currently, six ports and three airports, which together represent about 80 percent of
Indonesia’s total international trade volume, have implemented the INSW system. About 8,279 users
(exporters, importers, customs brokers) have registered and obtained user-IDs from the INSW system. In
2012, the Government amended the Presidential Decree to make INSW the only single reference portal for
cross-border trade regulations in the Customs clearance process.

    121. Sustaining INSW requires proper institutional arrangements and great participation from
government border agencies. Currently, INSW is temporarily coordinated by an ad-hoc team and
implemented by Customs as the leading agency in border clearance processes for trade. To ensure effective
operation of INSW as mandated by the regulation, the Government has decided to form a dedicated agency
to manage INSW. This arrangement is expected to strengthen the ability of INSW to focus on developing a
system for facilitating trade involving many agencies, not only focused on Customs clearance. Another
important implementation issue is the single-submission and/or sign-on, which provides ease in processing
exportation/importation clearances through a single user-ID. The in-house system of the Food and Drug
Supervisory Agency (BPOM) implemented a single-sign-on (SSO) facility in December 2011. The in-house
systems of two other key permit/license-issuing agencies, the Ministry of Trade and the Agency for Plant
Quarantine (under the Ministry of Agriculture), implemented this in 2012, with other permit/license-issuing
agencies to follow in 2013. A recent review by the Presidential Monitoring Unit (UKP4) shows that the SSO
for procedures of the Ministry of Trade and Plant Quarantine has been succesfully concluded.




                                                     42
    b. Proposed Policy Actions
    Reform aim: Reduce the time needed for and the cost of importing and exporting

     122. A clear organizational set-up for the INSW will be needed as it will play an increasingly
significant role in facilitating trade in the coming years. The first Connectivity DPL supported the GoI’s
effort to provide more clarity and transparency in trade regulations by amending Presidential Regulation No.
10/2008 through the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 35/2012 to make the INSW system the single
reference portal for cross-border trade regulations in the Customs clearance process. This entailed the
issuance of Presidential Regulation No.35/2012 in March 2012 on the usage of ICT in the
establishment/development/implementation of the INSW system. With this, all regulations will be
incorporated into the INSW list of trade regulations and made accessible to the public, and users will be
informed whether or not their exportation/importation requires permits/licenses for clearance. This offers
ease and requires less time to process the clearance. Furthermore, as the INSW needs to be implemented
efficiently, the GoI has decided the legal nature of the agency to be created to manage the INSW system. In
September 2013, discussions were held with relevant public stakeholders to determine the appropriate lay-
out of the agency. This proposal is expected to go through further series of policy dialogues and
consultations involving various stakeholders before being finalized, and is expected to move forward
together with the recently started modernization process in the Customs ICT system.

    123. Single-submission and sign-on are the final goals of the INSW, which will facilitate speedier
import/export clearance processes. In this context, a trader will be able to seek import/export clearance by
submitting all data required by each clearance agency with a single sign-on of the INSW portal. With those
features, the INSW system will significantly improve the efficiency of the cargo clearance process, reducing
costs for exporters/importers and in turn strengthening competitiveness in trade logistics. The GoI therefore
has introduced the Drug and Food Supervisory Agency (BPOM), one of the major issuers of import/export
permits, into the INSW using the Single Sign-On (SSO). This has allowed exporters/importers now using
only a single-user ID to access the INSW/BPOM in-house system, since December 2011. The Coordinating
Minister for Economic Affairs has expanded the Indonesia National Single Window System by linking the
requests for permits made to the Ministry of Trade and the Agency for Plant Quarantine through the Single
Sign-On Mechanism to streamline and make more efficient the export and import processes and the
quarantine procedures. The Ministry of Trade connected its INATRADE portal, which manages the issuance
of trade permits, with the INSW through SSO in 2012. Meanwhile, after establishing an SSO manual in
2012, in 2013 the Agency for Plant Quarantine finally used SSO to connect its portal with the INSW.

    c. Expected results

    124. The expected results from this policy area will improve customs and border management in
facilitating trade as measured by:
     Improvement in the management of the INSW system; and
     Improved processes in submitting documents for customs clearance process through the INSW
         system.

    C. Future Operation

    125. The Government has recently indicated the likelihood of extending the DPL series from two
to three years, thereby continuing the DPL operation in 2014. The Government is presenting its
financing needs and desired composition for 2014, consistent with its debt-management strategy that reflects
macroeconomic volatility. The Government has indicated that it will likely continue the INSTANSI DPL
engagement by extending the series until 2014, when the elections and change in government administration
are expected to take place. In that regard, a set of tentative policy actions for a possible subsequent
INSTANSI DPL operation have been tentatively identified and will continue to be developed in consultation

                                                     43
with the GoI. As demonstrated in the past, the ownership and commitment to these reforms are expected to
continue, despite the imminent change in the administration.

                          VI. OPERATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

      A. Monitoring and Evaluation

    126. Monitoring the implementation and attainment of the Connectivity DPL prior actions is
done through regular meetings between the GoI and development partners, as well as the ongoing
engagement with agencies responsible for different prior actions. The GoI has established monitoring
committees and/or technical groups that are responsible for ensuring the implementation of agreed prior
actions, as well as progress follow-up. In addition, the DPL benefits from regular joint development partner-
Government meetings to discuss interim progress in achieving agreed milestones in the reform agenda and
future triggers for the DPL series and ongoing policy dialogue between the GoI and World Bank teams.

    127. With the overall monitoring plan in place, it is anticipated that assessing the results of the
Connectivity prior actions in achieving their expected outcome will be relatively straightforward in
many cases. Annex 2 provides expected outcome of the Connectivity DPL prior actions and how progress
towards achieving the expected outcome will be measured. The Bank will work closely with the relevant
agencies to monitor and assess reform progress and impacts during the life of the program. In addition to
ongoing monitoring of activities, the Bank prepares an Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) at the end of each series. The ICR, prepared in consultation with the Government and development
partners, is a Bank self-evaluation reporting tool that highlights the key achievements and results, as well as
lessons learned.

      B. Consultations

    128. Democratic consolidation, free media, and decentralization of authority in Indonesia have
translated into a political preference for wide buy-in and participatory, consensus-building
approaches to decision-making, not only in terms of regulatory reforms but also planning and

                                                            44
budgeting processes. While this is believed to have slowed or blunted some reform measures, it is also
believed to mitigate against radicalism, steadily improve public participation, and contribute to more
democratic, accountable, professional and responsive governance. This commitment has been formalized
and endorsed through several regulations (e.g., Law No. 25/2004 on National Development Planning and
Joint Ministerial Decree 2006 and 2007 on Musrenbang), including those institutionalizing the creation of
multi-stakeholder consultation forums, or Musrenbang (Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan) at all levels,
concerning several time frames. Musrenbang is the principal process for negotiating, reconciling and
harmonizing differences between government and nongovernment stakeholders, and reaching collective
consensus on development priorities, including regulatory reforms and the 2012 budget. While challenges
still remain, the instrument is being increasingly adopted at all government levels. Finally, the democratic
environment in Indonesia has significantly strengthened the role of media and civil society organizations in
providing critical feedback on all government programs.

    129. The policy actions supported under the Connectivity DPL-2 have been subject to
considerable consultations with stakeholders. The supported policy actions are drawn largely from the
Government’s overall development program, which had been discussed and had gone through a series of
consultations with stakeholders. The process of democratic consolidation also allows the Parliament (DPR)
to provide checks and balance by holding hearings with the Government and civil society organizations
before passing laws, as in the case of the Railway Law in 2007 and the Land Acquisition Law in 2012. With
decentralization of authority, the central government facilitated a series of consultations with local
governments to refine the draft presidential regulations for establishing an urban transport authority in
greater Jakarta. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) is also actively providing input
on the implementation of the INSW. Kadin is also included as a partner in implementing the National
Logistics Blueprint. Extensive consultations were also held with the relevant government ministries to
discuss the establishment of the Connectivity DPL and to identify prior actions throughout the preparation of
the operation. A roadmap of milestones was then developed, which conforms to the Government’s own
reform agenda, as laid out in the DPL program matrix in Annex 3. This program matrix will continue to be
adjusted and refined as progress continues to be assessed and discussions mature.

    C. Environmental, Poverty and Social Aspects

    130. The specific country policies supported by this operation focus on upstream policy reform,
strengthened processes, improved budgeting, and enhanced national connectivity. Over the medium
term, these policy reforms are expected to lead to specific investments in key infrastructure sectors, which
can have significant environmental and social effects that need to be carefully assessed and managed.

     131. In the Bank’s assessment, the GoI has laws, institutions and systems in place for reducing
adverse effects and enhancing positive effects. The GoI’s legal, institutional and procedural systems for
assessing, addressing, and mitigating environmental effects is well established and adequate under Law No.
32/2009 and its predecessors, as well as through the environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) process.
These systems are being continuously strengthened through ongoing capacity building and technical
assistance. The GoI has long-standing and well-regarded collaborations with the Governments of Germany,
Denmark and Canada on programs of this nature. The Bank also has extensive engagements with the GoI
on the specific policy issues supported under this operation, including at the national coordination level, on
transport and infrastructure, and on environmental issues. The Bank assisted in upgrading the legal and
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Environment through a series of loans in the 1990s and has more
recently provided grant-financed TA on improving the implementation of the AMDAL process at the
decentralized level.

   132. In addition to the environmental effects described above, specific downstream investments
requiring land acquisition for public infrastructure projects may have negative social effects that will
need to be reduced and significant positive social effects that will need to be enhanced. The new

                                                     45
regulatory legislation does not cover squatters without good faith, while renters and laborers are also not
covered. If they are squatting on private land the compensation is the responsibility of the land owner.
Parties in possession on state/public land with good faith are recognized by the new legislation and eligible
for compensation; therefore, final compensation is the result of negotiation. In the past, the relevant agencies
of local government have a right to assess the value of compensation for affected non-land assets, while the
affected land is valued by the licensed appraisal. Local government valuations were frequently below market
price; these low valuations have often been the most significant points of contention between the World
Bank’s, as well as ADB’s, safeguard policy requirements, and local governments and implementing
agencies. MAPPI gave an opportunity to the Bank to share its draft guidelines of compensation and the
Bank supports the guidelines where the value of compensation reflects the market price plus transaction and
other costs, plus a premium (to cover costs such as emotional loss). This approach would make those
affected by land acquisitions better off after the process has been completed.

   133. These processes are being strengthened, including through support by development
partners. ADB, which is also a partner in this policy operation, is establishing a technical assistance
program for capacity building to improve national consistency in the implementation of these rules .
The Bank is also working on land acquisition in several of its investment projects (separate from this
Connectivity DPL), which provide opportunities for hands-on engagement in capacity development to
support land acquisition processes in line with best practices.

     D. Gender

    134. Whilst the proposed Connectivity DPL-2 is considered to be gender neutral as a whole, it
may bring significant changes to women’s lives by providing more access to important public services,
such as education, health, job opportunities and markets. The proposed Connectivity DPL-2 is expected
to further expand households’ livelihoods and incomes. Studies suggest that better connectivity has
increased women’s mobility for better education and work and increased incomes, which in turn assist poor
households, especially female-headed households (FHH), to overcome poverty and in coping with economic
shocks. A recent study using census data 1995 and 2005 (SUPAS) shows that better connectivity has
increased women’s mobility to Jakarta from the Bodetabek suburban areas (Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and
Bekasi).19 The study suggests that better connectivity significantly increased numbers of both women and
men commuters from Bodetabek to Jakarta in 2001-05. Better connectivity provided better access for
women to commute for educational reasons and increased the number of women commuting for work. A
survey on rural women groups in Indonesia shows that women have been able to earn additional incomes
through their increased access to internet through which they acquired skills in manufacturing superior
products or providing services. In addition, better connectivity will further assist in the delivery of support to
women survivors of violence. Indeed, in its most recent reports on cases of violence, the National
Commission on Violence against Women in Indonesia (Komnas Perempuan) identified domestic violence at
the top cause of cases of violence in Indonesia, wherein women are mostly the survivors that need
assistance. Furthermore, the proposed Connectivity DPL-2 also supports the RPJMN 2010-2014 goal of
enhancing gender equality in development. The background study on gender equality for RPJMN IV, to
which the Bank provided technical support, identified increased access to public services, especially health,
and to market and economic opportunities, along with women’s protection against violence, as among the
key priorities.

    E. Fiduciary Aspects, Disbursement and Auditing

    135. Public financial management (PFM) is a central policy area for the GoI that is supported by
the Bank’s ongoing DPL series. The Fiduciary Assessment for Indonesia has been carried out and the
Fiduciary Risk is rated as Moderate. This discussion and the conclusions therein are appropriate for the
proposed Connectivity DPL-2.

    136. In summary, significant strides have been made in recent years in the way Indonesia’s
public finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In the past
three years, progress has been made in the area of budget execution, with the development of a unified
budget and a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to strengthen the comprehensiveness and control over
spending and cash management. In addition, there have been improvements in the coverage of fiscal
accounts, accounting practices, payroll, internal controls and fiscal risk management. Notably, the 2009
audit report was the first to achieve a qualified audit opinion, as opposed to a disclaimer, with around 40
percent of ministries and agencies achieving unqualified audit opinions. Since then, the audit report has
continued to be qualified. However, the number of ministries and agencies receiving an unqualified opinion
increased to over 70 percent for FY 2012. Further improvements are required in several areas including
refinement in performance-based budgeting, strengthening internal and external audit, and improving
spending outturns. Weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually
addressed through the Government’s PFM reform program. Also, key elements of the reforms are supported
by the DPL series, as well as the GFMRAP project and other initiatives supported by development partners.
Furthermore, the Government has also demonstrated increased focus on budget transparency by publishing
the annual budget in a timely manner, through the MoF website.

     137. The borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this operation is a single-tranche IBRD loan
of US$300 million. The loan will be made available upon loan effectiveness, provided that the Bank is
satisfied with the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program and with the adequacy of
the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. The Government has confirmed that Indonesia will
borrow this amount as a Variable Spread Loan (VSL) in US dollar currency with an annuity repayment
schedule linked to commitments.

    138. The loan disbursement will follow the standard Bank procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the borrower at Bank
Indonesia that forms part of Indonesia’s official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent rupiah amount
will immediately be transferred to the General Operational Treasury (SBUN) account of the borrower that is
used to finance budget expenditures, as the loan is intended to be used to support the general Government
budget. This arrangement has been followed for the previous DPLs. The borrower, within 30 days, will
provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and provide to the Bank
any other relevant information relating to these matters, including the exchange rate of the conversion from
US dollars to rupiah, that the Bank may reasonably request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the borrower is
required to comply with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank
loan proceeds, as defined in Schedule 1 to the loan agreement. If any portion of the loan is used to finance
ineligible expenditures as so defined in the loan agreement, the Bank has the right to require the
Government to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund the amount equal to such payment to the Bank.
Amounts refunded to the Bank will be cancelled from the loan.

    139. The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The
country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last
subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That
assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements
of Bank Indonesia. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an

                                                    47
independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank Indonesia’s audited financial
statements. Audited financial statements for Bank Indonesia for 2012 have been reviewed and the audit
report issued by the BPK contained an unqualified opinion.

    F. Risks

    140. Macroeconomic risks could disrupt the potential to implement the reforms supported
through the Connectivity DPL-2. Recently, Indonesia has seen increasing pressures on its external
accounts, with the current account deficit widening after a negative terms-of-trade shock and international
financing conditions becoming more uncertain. Recent shifts in market sentiment have resulted in sudden,
large and potentially disruptive reversals of capital inflows. The external accounts and growth outlook
remain sensitive to softening global commodity prices and demand, particularly from China. With portfolio
investors focusing on near-term policy responses, there is a risk that this diverts attention from longer-term
reforms. However, the GoI has adopted key policy measures aimed towards improving national
connectivity, as supported by the ongoing DPL series, which are expected to help shield the risk of a crisis,
and mitigate the impact of any economic downturns on households. The Government has developed a track
record in precautionary and proactive measures to try to counter such shocks. This includes, for example,
policy measures supported under the PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, which, along with parallel
facilities from other development partners, also explicitly aims to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the
face of a crisis. The Government has also been quick to introduce a package aimed primarily at longer-term
structural measures to support exports and employment, moderate import growth, while limiting food price
pressures. This has been accompanied by a tightening in monetary policy. There remain questions over the
implementation of the policy package and it is likely that further policy adjustments will be required.
However, there is the potential that the current macro-economic pressures that Indonesia is facing could
allow policymakers the opportunity to make progress on medium-term structural reforms, although this must
be offset against the political pressures in the run-up to the 2014 elections.

    141. Bureaucratic complexity can hinder coordination and implementation of reform agenda in
Connectivity. First, the multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities
could create a challenge in coordinating and implementing the reform efforts. Second, overlapping
authorities among national and local governments in setting policies affecting domestic connectivity, such as
infrastructure investment and transport policy can slow down or even derail policy reforms. Although the
proposed Connectivity DPL is expected to help address this critical issue, the results of such reform process
will largely depend on priorities that were developed and consensus involving the various agencies and
stakeholders. Third, the Connectivity DPL will engage agencies that have not been regularly participating in
previous DPL programs. All of these challenges will increase as the election period approaches and
uncertainty over institutional roles in the next administration increases. To mitigate those risks, the proposed
actions under the first pillar of this DPL are expected to strengthen inter-agency coordination and
effectiveness in the policymaking process. Equally important, the Connectivity DPL series has benefited
from a high level support from the Deputy Minister of Bappenas, who is also the Chair of the Connectivity
Working Group, to ensure that the reform agenda spelled out in this DPL is on track. Past experience also
indicated continued GoI commitment to reforms overall, regardless of the election outcome.

    142. Coordination problems and inconsistencies in implementing regulations could potentially
disrupt the Government’s achievement of its medium-term development objectives. Regulatory
certainty is a key driver of investment, as firms need to rely on a consistent policy environment in order
make decisions on whether to invest or expand their businesses. As such, it is critical that the Government
ensures a consistent policy environment if Indonesia is to meet its medium-term economic development and
poverty reduction goals. A key challenge in this area is policy coordination among various government
agencies. In the past year, however, recent policy announcements have raised some concerns about the
direction of trade and investment policymaking. These measures include, for example, restrictions on
imported horticulture products and new divestment regulations and processing requirements in the mining

                                                      48
sector. While the aims of these policies may originate in the development objectives of promoting domestic
productivity, jobs and growth, their presentation, which has often been changing, highlights coordination
and communication issues. As well as the uncertain effectiveness of these policies to meet the stated
objectives, there is concern that the expansion of such policies could weaken the confidence of investors in
the domestic economic outlook. The risk to the Connectivity DPL is that the continuation of such policies,
along with other perceived "policy missteps", and could weaken some of the confidence of investors in
domestic policymaking, potentially offsetting some of the benefits of the reforms supported in this
operation. The DPL program, along with the Bank’s technical assistance on trade and investment climate , is
expected to help put in place the platform for policy dialogue with key GoI counterparts, contributing to
stronger GoI coordination and consultation on key reform areas, thereby providing more regulatory
certainty.

    143. While the new regulatory framework on land acquisition for public use represents a
substantial improvement over the previous process, and should make a positive contribution to
development objectives, there are some risks associated with the coordination of executing agencies to
fully meet the spirit of the new legal framework, including interpretation of the new legal framework
among the various government levels. For acquisition of private lands for public infrastructure, the new
regulatory framework deals only with legitimate owners of such private lands and not with people living
without formal title on private lands. Although the regulatory framework mentions cash or relocation as
options for compensating squatters living in state lands, the absence of a clear process for the government to
facilitate relocation will likely to cause the government to rely mostly on cash compensation. Nevertheless,
the new legal framework for land acquisition for public use provides greater certainty, due process, and
compensation for people whose land is acquired by the Government, pursuant to the referred framework,
including recognizing squatters in good faith on state lands. The implementing regulations that were recently
issued also provide more clarity over implementation of the new legal framework. While these represent
positive developments, many challenges remain. Several civil society organizations voiced concerns over
aspects of this framework and brought a legal challenge to the Constitutional Court, which was ultimately
ruled against. That challenge, which itself is a sign of the maturation of Indonesian institutions, may well
result in an even more inclusive and transparent implementation of the legal framework for land acquisition
for public use by the Government. The National Law Agency (BPN) has been selected as focal point for
implementing the process of land acquisition for public use. The Government of Indonesia is improving
BPN’s capacity through development and training programs to strengthen the implementation of the land
acquisition process for public use at all levels.

Annex 4: Environmental and Social Review of Connectivity DPL-2



The consideration of environmental and social aspects of this operation has been carried out following the
provisions of OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) which mandates the Bank to determine whether
policies supported by the operation are likely to have significant poverty and social impacts or significant
environmental effects. For policies with likely significant effects, the Bank summarizes analytic knowledge
of these effects and of the borrower’s systems for reducing adverse effects and enhancing positive effects,
also describing how any significant gaps would be addressed before or during program implementation. This
review relied on Bank guidance on analysis of “likelihood of significant effects,” including the (i) Good
Practice Note: Using Poverty and Social Impact Analysis to Support Development Policy Operations; (ii)
Assessing the Environmental, Forest, and Other Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending –
A World Bank Toolkit (2008), (iii) Good Practice Note on Environmental and Natural Resource Aspects of
Development Policy Lending. A broader overview of Indonesia's environmental and social issues is updated
annually for the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).

In the Bank’s assessment, policies supported by Pillar 1 of this DPL (Strengthening National Coordination
and Regulation for Improved National Connectivity) are not likely to have significant negative effects. In
general, improved connectivity typically involves increasing access to services and information, stimulating
growth and employment, and linking less developed regions with more developed regions, thus reducing
both poverty and disparities. Action under this pillar will further strengthen transparency and governance
arrangements by strengthening the capacity to implement and coordinate the national logistics system
blueprint. The definition of the operational procedures to implement the Minister of Finance Decree on
Viability Gap Fund will also add operational certainties on fund flows, together with better transparency and
improved planning procedures. The strengthening of planning, monitoring and coordination arrangements is
expected to lead to better investment decisions.

Actions under Pillar 2 related to strengthening intra-island rail and road connectivity are mainly focused on
improving planning, budgeting and efficiency. Efficiency increases will add benefits to the country in terms
of reduced costs and potentially more economic operations with benefits to the poor. Road construction has
the potential for significant social and environmental effects, if not mitigated through appropriate design,
assessment and mitigation measures. The Bank has substantial experience with road infrastructure projects
in Indonesia and there is evidence that the Ministry of Public Works/DG Highways has significant and
increasing capacity for AMDAL/environmental review of projects. The Connectivity DPL program also
recognizes the importance of the Environmental Impact Assessment/AMDAL process at the national and
local levels. The previous IDPL series recognized the substantial improvements to the environmental
management and accountability framework through Law No. 32/2009 on Environmental Management and
Projection. Implementation of the new framework has been accompanied by substantial capacity building
from development partners, including GIZ, DANIDA, CIDA and others.

In general, improved rail access and capacity should lead to improved services, operations and maintenance,
which will benefit rail users and has the potential to reduce GHG emissions. It will therefore support the
national Climate Change Action Plan (RAN-GRK). Increased rail capacity can provide a more
environmentally friendly transportation alternative and reduced congestion. Over the medium term, specific
investments that may emerge on individual railways can have negative environmental and social impacts in
specific locations, if not managed and mitigated through systems and procedures of the Ministry of
Transport (MoT). The Bank’s review indicates that the MoT’s strategies and plans for these sectors include
recognition of the environmental and social issues, appropriate mitigation efforts, and capacity building
efforts to ensure that environmental and social impacts are identified and mitigated by rail authorities and
operators. The Bank has discussed with counterparts and reviewed the National Railways Master Plan (April

                                                     68
2011) and the MoT’s Strategic Plan for Railways 2010-2014 to assess the MoT’s systems and capacity for
addressing environmental issues, for reducing adverse effects and enhancing positive effects.

Under this pillar, the World Bank policy support for guidelines for Public Service Obligations (PSO), the
Infrastructure Maintenance Operation and the Track Access Charges (TAC) will essentially strengthen the
operational capacity and governance of the railway sector by setting clear procedures on how to engage with
and compensate for services provided by the private sector. It is not expected that these policies will have
any adverse social or environmental impacts. The Railways Master Plan recognizes environmental issues
and has programs for addressing them. Increased implementation capacity for maintenance operations and
more clarity on track access charges are further strengthening the railway system with all the inherent
environmental benefits by improving governance, transparency and efficiency.

In 2012, the Government was successful in issuing several pieces of legislation relating to land acquisition
for projects destined for public purpose (Law No. 2/2012 in January 2012 (Law No. 2/12); Presidential
Regulation No. 71/2012 in August 2012 (PR No. 71/12); and technical guidelines issued by the relevant
ministries.20 The new legislation clearly recognizes that principles of justice, transparency, agreements and
participation are important, and is also aimed at balancing the interests of development and society, and
ensuring that land necessary to support development efforts is acquired in a timely manner. Compensation
covers the loss of land and assets, and also other losses that can be accounted for that are caused by the
acquisition of land for a public project. Affected parties are given opportunities to comment on project
proposals, to negotiate the size and form of compensation, and to seek legal redress in the courts in the case
of grievances that cannot be otherwise resolved.

The new legislation provides compensation mainly in cash, although this must include loss of business time
and transaction restitution and could consist of land-for-land compensation. Although resettlement is an
option for compensation and once fair compensation has been provided, further consideration and impact
mitigation are not elaborated. Nevertheless, the new legislation mandates that the value of compensation
must be assessed by licensed appraisal. Indonesia has an independent organization for appraisal called
MAPPI (Indonesian Society of Appraisers) which is a professional organization of appraisers. MAPPI has a
standard for property valuation in Indonesia called SPI (Indonesian Valuation Standard).. Cash
compensation is a very efficient approach if social impact caused by land acquisition is minor or relatively
straightforward. For more complex projects, non-cash compensation and livelihood restoration should be
elaborated. It depends on the social assessment of the proposed project to determine the complexity of the
social impact covered in a feasibility study as required during the preparation stage.

Squatters with good faith on state/public land are eligible for compensation, while squatters are squatting on
private land the compensation is the responsibility of the private owner.

A Bank conducted AAA on Forest and Non-Forest Lands in Indonesia, highlighted the fact that there was
very poor public awareness of the new regulation, and a similar lack of awareness also applied to national
and subnational authorities. As a result, the capacity to apply this regulation within an already weak
institutional context is very poor. Recognizing the need for dissemination and information, the Coordinating
Ministry for Economic Affairs and other relevant institutions organized a national workshop in April 2013
to disseminate the new legislation for strengthening capacity at the provincial level, and for state companies
such as PLN, PT. Gas, and PT. KAI. The Coordinating Team will also disseminate the new legislation to
judges at the Supreme Court, prosecutors at the Office of the Attorney General and the police at the central
level. In a following phase, more discussion with district/city level entities will be promoted, as well as the

   facilitation of handling land acquisition problems and strengthening the monitoring arrangements for the
   implementation of the new legislation.

   Under Pillar 3, the DPL supports implementation of the Information Communication and Technology (ICT)
   Fund, which should help improve access and communication. There is also the potential to improve the flow
   of goods and services, and improve access to information and data management. No adverse environmental
   or social impacts have been identified.

   Under the same pillar, the DPL will strengthen the regulatory environment to facilitate long-term port
   development, and increase handling efficiency and reduce costs of domestic shipping, by using a Ministerial
   Regulation classifying the hierarchy of sea ports around Indonesia. Increased efficiency of ports, more
   transparency, and improved governance should lead to a reduction of waste and pollution in port operations
   both on- and off-shore.

   Finally, actions under Pillar 4: Improving International Connectivity is expected to have overall governance,
   institutional development and capacity benefits, and have no significant effects on the environment. It is
   expected that increased efficiency and quicker handling of goods will reduce the overall pollution impact at
   and around sea ports.
