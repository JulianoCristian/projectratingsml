for Relevance and Efficiency Project for Indonesia\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: institutional autonomy of higher education\n            institutions is a complicated goal, requiring substantial\n            and often difficult and always lengthy legal, financial and\n            accreditation changes. Instead of focusing on autonomy as a\n            goal, the monitoring framework could have explored\n            indicators related to governance and accountability instead.\n            Project outcome indicators should not be based on the\n            results of a political process over which the project has no\n            control. Clear definitions of indicators and the data to be\n            collected, and the methods of collections have to be\n            established early and consistently used during the\n            implementation of the project. Scholarships to disadvantaged\n            students require accurate and effective targeting strategies\n            in identifying good candidates. In this project, inadequate\n            thought was given at preparation as to the target of such\n            scholarships and the mechanism to be followed to identify\n            and support such disadvantaged students."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
