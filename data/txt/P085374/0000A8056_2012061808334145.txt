                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. For reasons outside the control of the project only modest progress has been made towards the development objectives of Component 1 during this reporting period. The
                         cancellation of education law (BHP/2009) in 2010 has slowed progress towards institutional autonomy and the aspirations and actions of institutions may be generally described as
                         "in a holding pattern" while the legislative and regulatory framework becomes clearer. In the last reporting period concern was expressed that the cancellation of the law may have
                         profound implications for subcomponents B.2a, B.2b and B.2c. Observations from the November review mission have provided reassurance that these grant categories are still
                         aligned with current DGHE strategic priorities and are valued by the institutions and by DGHE. Parliamentary Education Commission X has begun circulating for discussion a new
                         higher education law and current expectation is that the new law will be ready to be enacted by the first quarter of 2012. Against the backdrop of this new higher education law

                         progress towards an enabling environment for the evolution of autonomous public higher education institutions is expected to accelerate significantly during 2012.

                         2.       In line with project design no new Grants have been awarded in 2011. Some grants under B.1 and B.2a will require an extension into 2012 to complete procurement actions
                         now in progress, grants under B.2c are still expected to be completed by November, 2012. Disbursement across all grants categories has been slow because of procurement delays.

                         Agreements reached in this review mission to raise the threshold for prior review from USD 200,000 to USD 1 million and accept bids with one responsive bidder (provided
                         documents and procedures are in compliance) and increasing the number of procurement actions post reviewed are expected to address a primary cause of procurement delay.

                         3. Progress against the supplementary indicators continues to show substantial achievement from baseline levels; however concerns over the quality of data remain. This mission
                         has emphasized the need for standardization of data definitions and collection strategies, greater efforts to analyze data to identify trends and more effort in the search for links
                         between cause and effect. Grant recipients have been reminded that reporting percentage achievement of numerical targets is not sufficient, there needs to be a focus on outcomes
                         and impact, and during 2012 reporting the Bank seeks qualitative as well as quantitative review.
