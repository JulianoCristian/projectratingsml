                         Implementation Status Overview
                          1. Solid progress has been made on Component 1 during the reporting period. The national accreditation body (BAN-PT) has shifted focus to institutional accreditation and plans
                         are underway for benchmarking and recruitment of consultants to assist in drafting accreditation instruments. The Open University (UT) has discussed and agreed guidelines for I-
                         MHERE support of its revitalization plans. By the end of this year a graduate tracer baseline will be established and standardized instruments for DGHE to undertake routine tracer
                         studies will be prepared. A study on the modernization of the organization of DGHE is now underway with funding from GOI, with project support for technical assistance. The
                         strengthening of Distance Learning Centres (DLCs) in six universities has started with a capacity development workshop for 46 representatives from across Indonesia in June 2010.
                         The workshop was also supported by the Asia Pacific DLC through the provision of technical assistance and incremental operating costs. DGHE-IU will conduct procurementof

                         take some time for the full ramifications to be apparent. There are implications in this for subcomponents B.2a, B.2b and B.2c, especially in the funding mechanism which may slow

                         project implementation. Essentially progress on this matter is outside the control of the project.

                         2         All Grants to be awarded under Component 2 have now been awarded. Due to some delays in procurement and the budget (DIPA) revisions, the grants under B.1 and B.2a
                         have been extended by 18 months; however all will be completed by 2011, while sub-Component B.2c, Performance Based Contracts, will be completed by November, 2012. At the
                         time of reporting disbursement has increased close to the agreed projection.

                         3       Progress against the supplementary indicators shows substantial achievement from baseline levels, though there are concerns over the lack of clarity in the size of the
                         sample used. Some grantees did not use standardized instruments for collecting data of the indicators.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          1. A cluster support network for grant recipients remains a high priority. DGHE-IU has agreed to provide necessary support to ensure all grantees build their procurement capacity.

                         2. The technical specifications of equipment bids remain an issue. DGHE-IU will provide support to HEI-IUs to develop equipment specification. The Bank will investigate the
                         recruitment of a consultant to assist with the review of technical specifications.

                         3. DGHE has issued a letter advising the 7 autonomous universities (BHMNs) to conduct activities using the regulations which applied before the introduction of the BHP Law.
