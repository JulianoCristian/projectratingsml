1.        This report reviews rhe performance of the Bank's Third Small-Scale
Industry Project (Loan 1834-CO) made to the Banco de la Republica (BR) for
onlending to the Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP). The loan, in the
amount of US$32.0 million, was intended to assist CFP's onlending and
technical assistance operations with the small-scale industrial sector.  The
project was appraised in April/May 1979, approved by the Board of Executive
Directors in April 1980, declared effective in July 1981; following a
nine-month extension, the final closing date was established as March 30,
1984. Final disbursements were made on November 1, 1984, and the undisbursed
balance of US$1.3 million, resulting mainly from foreign exchange rate
fluctuations, was canceled as of the same date.
2.        This report is based upon the data obtained during the Bank mission
to Colombia in December 1985. It reviews the progress made toward
achievement of the loan's direct and sectoral objectives. Since much
information on CFP's operational and financial performance during 1979-1983
is available in the Completion Report for the second loan (1451-CO) issued in
April 1983 and in the Appraisal Report of June 1984 for the fourth loan
(2464-CO), this report concentrates mainly upon those aspects about which the
Bank expressed concern in the appraisal report or during the course of
project implementation. This report also brings some institutional aspects
up to date, focusing upon CFP's Action Program for 1984-1987, aimed at
strengthening CFP's institutional and organizational aspects, which was
agreed upon with the Bank under the fourth loan (2464-CO).
3.        In accordance with the re'rised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. A copy of their response is
included as an Attachment.

PROJICT COMEl,TION REPORT
COLOMBIA - TIIRD SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJICT (ClP)
(LOAN 1834-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Given the relatively favorable experience under the first two
small-scale industry (SSI) projects (Loans 1071-CO and 1451-CO), the Bank
continued to support CFP through a third SSI project (Loan 1834-CO) for
US$32.0 million in 1980. This report not only deals with the results of the
loan under review but also examines the developments that have taken place in
CFP's operations and the Bank's strategy during project implementation.
2.        Building upon the achievements of the previous loans, the third
loan was designed to carry out five main objectives: (a) improve SSI's access
to credit by providing funds on reasonable conditions for the establishment,
expansion, or relocation of privately controlled small industrial firms;
(b) assist CFP in building up a sounder resource base for its operations
through 1982; (c) further build up CFP's technical and operational capability
for allocating scarce development funds efficiently and for coordinating
technical assistance to SSI; (d) continue to support, through a wide
distribution of CFP's onlending, the Government's industrial diversification
and regional development policies; and (e) help to promote Government
policies that are responsive to SSI's financial and technical assistance
needs (paras. 2.03-2.05).
3.     Overall, the loan achieved most of its objectives.  The third loan
continued the success of the twi. prior loans 4n efficiently transferring
resou,ces to the intended target group of smaller enterprises. Of the 1,270
subprojects financed with the loan proceeds, only 36 subloans were over the
US$100,000 free limit establishe.d under the loan (para. 3.07). The average
subloan size of US$24,000 was slightly above the appraisal estimate of
US$22,000. The geographical dispersion of Bank-assisted enterprises was in
line with expectations, with 851 (67.2% of the total) accounting for firms
located outside of Colombia's r.ost indu3trialized departments, and
representing 60% of total financing (para. 3.13). The loan assisted 248 new
firms (i.e., about 20% of the total), accounting for 24% of the total loan
amount, and exceeding the results achieved under the first two SSI loans
(para. 3.11).
4.     The economic impact of subprojects financed was overall satisfactory.
The estimated employment generation was 6,i00, with an average investment
cost per job created of US$11,800, as compared to the US$11,000 appraisal
estimate and the average of US$13,500 under the second loan (1451-CO). The
ex-post financial rates of return (FRRs) calculated for alx randomly-selected
subprojects (out of the 36 exceeding the free limit) averaged 29% versus the
ex-ante FRRs, averaging 34%, and the overall range of 15% and 20% estimated
during project appraisal (paras. 3.14-3.16).



5.     During the period under review, while CFP's institutional. development
efforts were adequate, certain institutional aspects needed to be
strerigthened, particularly its appraisal and supervision work and its
portfolio management. Notwithstanding the generalized nature of the arrears
probl6m in Colombia, inadequacies of these three institutior,al aspects
undoubtedly also contributed to the deterioration in the quality of CFP's
portfolio. CFP's overall arrears position (20%), which is high in absolute
terms, is in line with that of the private DFCs (22%) and substantially lower
than that of' Colombia's whole banking system (29%)~ Throughout project
implementation, CFP has maintained its debt/equity ratio well below the
established ceiling of 6.0:1, averaging 4.08:1. CFP's leverage ratio is also
well below that of the private DFCs (10:1) and the commercial banks (32:1).
Except for one year, CFP exceeded the targets set for administrative costs
under the loan, averaging 6.7% of average total assets over 1979-1983 (para
5.12). The higher-than-anticipated administrative costs/assets ratio has
been due in part to (a) slower-than-expected growth in CFP's portfolio and
(b) the high relative share of administrative costs of headquarters staff
(44% of total staff and 49% of total administrative costs during 1979-1983),
as compared to costs in regional offices where CFP's income and profits are
generated, and (c) the high cost of operating special programs (e.g.,
micro-enterprises and assistance to amnestied political activists). In
absolute terms, administrative costs grew at an average rate of 27% p.a.
during 1979-1983,  mainly accounted for by salaries and other personal
expenses, which represented about 77% of total administrative costs.
Administrative expenses continued to grow in relation to average total
assets, from 6.7% in 1983 to 7.6% in 1985 (para. 5.12).
6.     On the whole, CFP succeeded in mobilizing adequate funds but was not
able to diversify its resourre base. and it remains unduly dependent upon
Government and other public sector support. The Bsnk has consistently been
the major--and at times--the only source of long-term external funds,
representing about 935  of CFP's total foreign resources.
Recognizing the adverse impacts of short-term, widely fluctuating resource
availability, the Bank recommended that CFP should seek non-traditional
permanent sources of local funds to complement the funds obtained from FFI                  *
and PROEXPO, which are still the principal sources of local borrowing for
CFP's lending programs. As a first step to a possible mobiliza-;on of
domestic resources by CFP, the Bank introduced, under the fourth SS3 loan, an
onlending interest rate svstem, involving two components, one at a fixed rate
and the other with a floating rate (paras. 4.08-4.09).
7.     The project's contribution in inducing the Government to establish a
coordinated policy framework for the SSI subsector development was limited;
however, the Government has started to take a more active approach towards
SSI.  In 1981, the Government established the Fondo Nacional de Garantia to
guarantee loans to small manufacturing and mining firms (para. 5.02), and the
Advisory Council for Small and Medium Industry (CA) to coordinate the efforts
of different institutions in designing specific policies for SMIs
(para. 6.09).
8.     An 4nnovative feature introduced under the loan was the shift in CFP's
approach in providing technlcal assistance (TA) services to SSIs.  Under the
loan, CFP adopted the strategy cf helping to diagnose TA needs of individual
SSI clients and coordlnating the provision of required services by
specialized institutions, such as SENA and FICITEC.   While CFP's new
technical assistance approach was vi-ewed as a positive step toward future
development of the 7S1i sulsectsr, the results were rather limited, partly due

to CFP's lim'-ed institutional ability to coordinate, at the national level,
the technical assistance activities of specialized institutions providing TA
services to SSIs (para. 5.15). However, under its TA programs, at both
regional and national leveis, which are included in its 1984-1987 Action
Plan, CFP has considerably improved its capacity to coordinate technical
aseistance to SSIs with specialized TA institutions (para 5.16).
9.    Tre following events and policies are also noteworthy:
- Introduction of an interest rate review mechanism (para. 4.10);
-  CFP's exemption from Resolution 65, requiring all Colombian
"financieras" to use no less than 10% of their assets in equity
investments or in FFI bonds, which could have seriously endangered
CFP's financial structure and operations (para. 5.07);
-  CFI"s increased involvement in micro-enterprises, in line with
the Government's national plan for micro-enterprise development
(para. 5.06);
-  Special programs of the Government administered by C.FI1, to help
micro-enterprises in several secondary cities and amnestied
political activists (para. 5.05);
-  Change in CFP's operational policies on construction financing,
emphasizing financing of buildings and facilities intended for
production activities, and lending with own resources and tho'4e of
FF'l (para. 5.01); and
-  CFP's Plan of Action for 1984-1987 for its organizational and
instittutional development, dealing with areas that need
strengthening, which have been identified mainly by the PCR for the
second SSI loan and during supervision of the third loan (para.
4.01).
10.       Summing up, appraisal estimates of subproject performance
concerning the loan impact and risks involved in CFP's institutional
development were overall realistic. For the most part, loan objectives were
achieved. CFP's operational and financial performance, which has been
affected by the economic recession that hit -he country during project
implementation, was satisfactory in comparison with that of the overall
Colombian banking system and the private development finance companies.
Notwithstanding certain institutional and organizational areas which need
strengthening, CFP has matured into a sound lending institution through the
successive SSI loans. It is expected that, with CFP's reorganization study,
which forms part of its 1984-1987 Action Plan, the institutional and
organizational aspects of CFP would continue to improve.  Through its
technical assistance programs at regional level, CFP has considerably
improved its capacity to coordinate technical assistance to SSI's with a
number of institutions, including Servicio Nacional de AprendizaJe (SENA),
Asociacion Colombiana Popular de Industriales (AC(F'l) and Fundacion para el
Fomento de la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FICTThC). While CFP
has been able to support the credit demand of SMIs, there exists an evident



- vii -
need to complement its domestic resources. The introduction of an onlending
interest rate system, involving fixed and floating interest rate components,
was a first step toward the mobilization of domestic resources by CFP
(possibly via public savings). In addition, the possible role of other
financial intermediaries, and the possibility of naving a two-tier mechanism
for SSI financing are being explored in the context of a possible fifth SSI
project (paras. 6.02-6.09).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA - THIRD SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT (CFP)
(LOAN 1834-CO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       Industrial Sector Lending Activity.  Bank lending to support the
Colombian industrial sector has been well diversified, encompassing nine
loans, totaling US$583.0 million, to finance industry through private
development finance companies; an agro-industrial loan component of US$19.0
million, mainly for medium-sized and small enterprises; a loan of US$15.0
million for an export processing zone in Cartagena; a loan component of
US$2.0 million for very small enterprises in target areas of the Intermediate
Cities Urban Project; a loan of US$80.0 million for the Cerromatoso Nickel
Project; and the four loans, totaling US$92.5 million, to finance small-scale
industry (SSI) through Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP).  While the
Bank's SSI loans are still small in comparison to total industrial lending,
they have become a significant factor in the development of SSI in Colombia.
1.02      SSI Subsector Lending.  CFP was founded in 1967 by Banco Popular, a
Government-owned commercial bank, partly in response to a study by the
Stanford Research Institute on the prospects and needs of Colombian
small-scale industry. CFP's main institutional objective, as broadly defined
in its statutes, is to assist in the promotion and development of small- and
medium-scale industrial, agro-industrial and mining enterprises
(SSIs) by providing medium- and long-term financing. Since commercial banks
and private tinancieras focus mainly upon medium and large firms, CFP's ro].e
is to develop and help put into effect a broad tange of services tailored so
the characteristics and needs of SSIs.
1.03      The Batik has been associated with CFP since 1973, and the Bank's
first sotall-scale industry (SSl) operation in Latin America was approved in
1975.   This completion report reviews the third loan (1834-CO) of US$32.0
million, approved in April 1980. Because the impact and effectiveness of
CFP's operations have been influenced by the first two loans (1071-CO for
US$5.5 million, approved in January 1975; cn'd 1451-CO for US$15.0 million,
approved in June 1977), this report not only deals with the results of the
loan under review but also examines the developments that have taken place in
CFP's operations and the Bank's strategy during project implementation.
1.04      The OED Performance Audit Report for the first CFP loan, produced
in 1979, examined the operations of CFP in more detail.  It concluded that
the economic benefits expected from the investment financed under the loan
were fully realized and that CFF's organization had been substantially
streamlined. It recommended upgrading the quality and coverage of technical
assistance to SSIs, which was addressed under the second loan. The
Completion Report for the second loan, prepared in 1983, similarly found that
the Bank had been successful in transferring resources for Colombia's
industrial growth, but less successful in encouraging domestic resource
mobilization and in promoting Government policies of particular relevance for
SSI sector delelopment. These points were addressed further under the third



-2-
loan. Complementary measures were also taken under the third and fourth
loans for CFP to coordinate technical assistance to SSIs.1/
1.05      Macroeconomic Setting and Sectoral Performance.2/   Although
increased investment efforts by the public and private sectors provided a
stimulus for improved growth performance in the period 1980-1981, during
which the loan was approved, signed and declared effective, the industrial
sector still faced a series of constraints. The low level of manufactured
exports, the accelerated increment in imports due to export receipts
accumulated during the coffee boom and the persistent slow growth in domestic
and international demand were the principal factors that led the industrial
sector to a negative growth rate in the period 1980-1983. During the early
1980s, when commitments and disbursements were made under the loan, the
growth rate for the sector decelerated to an average of only 1% in 1978-1982,
from an average of 8.6% in 1967-1974 and 5.2% in 1974-1978. Competition from
contraband and substantial devaluation of the currencies of Colombia's
foremost Latin American trading partners led to a decline in manufacturing
production and exports (Annex 1).
1.06      In the second half of 1983, the Government started to stimulate the
economy and designed a national program ("El Plan Cambio con Equidad"), under
which i.t set up and applied some economic measures to halt the recession and
to stimulate the productive sectors. Based upon this program, the Government
took some specific measures in favor of industrial activity. A reversal of
the deteriorating trend had begun to take place beginning in 1984 with the
resumption of growth in manufacturing and expansion in imports.
1.07      Against the above-described environment, the SMI subsector has
continued to play a significant role in Colombia's industrial development
process, employing about 50% of the industrial labor force and representing
close to 36% and to 30% of manufacturing production and its value added,
respectively.3/4/ Compared with large-scale manufacturing, SMIs have
generated tup to about three times as many jobs per Colombian peso of invested
capital; they also absorb a higher share of unskilled workers than do large
1/  CFP's Plan of Action fir 1984-1987, which was agreed with the Bank under
the fourth loan, included technical assistance programs at regional and
national levels.

4/ In 1984, the Government changed the parameters to define small- and
medium-scale enterprises, bringing them up to Col$ 100.0 million in total
assets, with no more than 150 workers and no more than Col$ 150.0 million
in sales, which would increase the SMI subsector's participation In the
above economic ratios. Under Loan 1834-CO, SSIs are defined as
manufacturing enterprises with total assets below USS650,000 equivalent;
this amount was raised to US$750,000 equivalent under the fourth SSI,
loan,



-3-
enterprises. At the same time, they seem to use capital as effectively as
larger firms, and they are self-financed to a much greater degree than large
industry, partly because of their more limited access to funds from the
organized financial system.
It PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL OBJECTIVES
Loan Preparation
2.01      A Bank identification missicn visi,'d Colombia in January 1979 for
initial discussions on the third SSI project. The first two SSI projects had
been successful, and Bank funds continued to be vital in providing fixed
asset financing to the SSI subsector, being the major, and at times the only,
source of SSI lending. CFP expected to commit the second Bank SSI loan fully
by year-end 1979, and the Bank and CFP both felt that it was important to
establish continuity in the latter's access to Bank loans.  To improve the
geographic scope of Bank lending to SSI, the Bank, during project preparation
in January 1979, considered the possible participation of other financial
intermediaries in a third SS1 project. While Caja de Credito Agrario
Industrial y Minero (CAJA) was expected to compliment CFP's operations by
focusing more on SSls in rural areas, its participation in the third loan was
not feasible as it would involve a very substantial and time-consuming effort
to rebuild CAJA's industrial lending capacity.5/  The third project was
appraised in April/May 1979.  Several issues were identified during
appraisal, including the introduction of an interest rate review mechanism
and "free standing" working capital financing.  These issuies were dealt with
properly, and the project advanced smoothly through the Loan Committee stage
and negotiations.
2.02      The Bank loan of US$32.0 million was made to Banco de la Republica
(BR), Colombia's Central Bank, on April 17, 1980, for onlending to CFP in
local currency. The loan had two components, consisting of USS 31.4 million
for SSI subloans, including US$9.0 million for working capital investments,
and US$0.6 million for technical assistance to CFP and its clients. Under
the lending component, to help insure financing on reasonable terms, all
fixed investment subloans were subject to a minimum four-year maturity, and
working capital subloans to a minimum of three years, with one-year grace
period in both cases. The nominal interest rate (paid in advance) for
sub-borrowers was originally 26% p.a. (about 30% p.a. effective), with CFP's
spread of 4.75% per subloan to enterprises located in Bogota, Medellin and
Cali, and 5.25% elsewhere. This interest rate was kept positive in relation
to inflation rate, averaging about 22%, throughout the loan's commitment
period (para 4.13). Technical assistance subloans carried an interest rate
of 15% p.a., (about 17% effective) and CFP's spread was 3%. Maturity and
5/ During the appraisal of the fourth SSI project, the Bank explored again
the possible role of other financial intermediaries in the loan, and
having the loan structured as a two-tier mechanism for SSI financing.
However, given the then recently initiated financial sector reform which
appeared to suggest the specialization of commercial hanks into
short-term lending institutions and development finance companies (DFCs)
into medium- to long-term lenders, the Bank approved the loan with CFP as
a first-tier lender.



-4-
approval conditions were similar to those applied under the fixed investment
lending component. All subloans were in Colombian pesos, with BR bearing the
foreign exchange risk.
Appraisal Objectives
2.03      The first two SSI projects aimed at assisting CFP to expand its
credit aid technical assistance to SMI in order to support the Government's
objecti.ie of increasing employment and promoting more balanced regional
growth. Similar objectives were pursued under the third SSI project, which
had five specific objectives: (a) to improve SSI's access to credit by
providing funds, on reasonable conditions, for the establishment, expansion,
or relocation of privately controlled small industrial firms; (b) to assist
CFP in building up a sounder resource base for its operations through 1982;
(c) to further build up CFP's technical and operational capability for
efficiently allocating scarce development funds and for coordinating
technical assistance to SSI; (d) to continue to support, through a wide
distribution of CFP's onlending, the Government's industrial diversification
and regional development policies; and (e) to help to promote policies
responsive to SSI's financial and technical assistance needs.
2.04      In connection with the third objective, agreement was reached
during negotiations on a statement of CFP's technical assistance strategv. to
be implemented through annual technical assistance plans, which '.;ould, inter
alia, emphasize cooperation at the regional level between CFP and SENA
(para. 5.13).
2.05      To further promote industrial decentralization, it was agreed
during negotiations that CFP shotuld present to the Bank a draft policy for
financing construction which should concentrate subloans more in areas
outside major cities and should emphasize the financing of production
facilities.  Permanent working capital expenditures were also financed under
the third loan, a feature which had been expressly excluded from the first
and second loans (para. 3.04). Of the aggregate amount of US$9.0 million
allocated for working capital financing, US$5.0 million was made available
for production facilities located outside Bogota, Medellin or Cali and for
SSIs with total assets not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 as of the
sub-borrower's fiscal year immediately preceding its subloan application.
2.06      The socio-economic benefits resulting from the project were
expected to be substantial.. It was estitrated that the project would provIde
financing to some 1,500 SMI enterprises for carrying out productive
investments and that it would create some 6,000 to 7,500 new direct jobs,
with another 2,000 jobs created indirectly through forward and backward
linkages. The average investment cost per job created as a result of the
proJect was expected to be around US$11,000 (in 1976 prices). The financial
rates of return on the investment projects financed under the third loan were
expected to average between 15% and 20%, with the economic rates of return
estimated to be higher since the project was expected to generate substantial
additional employment.
2.07      The extent to which the appraisa  ohjectti.es, inciuding the
specific institution-building objectives, were ech.eved is described and
reviewed in Chapters 1V and V.



III. UTILIZATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS
Resource Transfer
3.01      Rate of Utilization.  After a considerable delay in the
congressional approval of the loan, it became effective on July 9, 1981, 15
months after Bonrd approval. The first Bank disbursement was made in
September 1981. Originally, the commitment and closing dates were December
31, 1982 and June 30, 1983, respectively. However, partly as a result of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations, some US$1.4 million equivalent remained
undisbursed, and it was necessary to extend both the commitment and closing
dates twice to September 30, 1983 and March 30, 1984, respectively. This
extension also reflected the banking system's additional liquid resources
during that time resulting from the freeing, by Banco de la Republica, of 10%
of the commercial banks' "Encaje Marginal," thuis affecting the use of the
loan proceeds.
3.02       After the initiial delay in declaring the loan effective,
commitments and disbursements proceeded at a fast pace. As of March 30,
1984, dishursenments were completed, except for the US$288,367 that was
finally disbursed on November 1, 1984, and tie amount of US$1.3 million that
was canceled, as of the same date.  At this point, UIS$30.7 million had been
disbursed by the Hank, representinlg 96/- ot the original loan amrount (Annex 2),
3.03       CFP's credit operations in 1982 considerably suirpassed those of
1981, with 3,153 subloans, totaling CoIS 4,341 million, approved in 1982, as
compared to 2,322 operations for ColS 3,074 million in 1981.  However, durinlg
the first ser,ester of 1983, the trend was reversed; at this point, only 1,052
subloans were approved for a total amount of Col$ 1,482 million, down to 3.2%
and 0.bY, respectivelv, from the first semester of 1982.  As of year-end
1983, the loan procQteds were committed at CFP level, and the Bank was at that
time co,isidering a new loan. Meanwhile, the Bank agreed with BR for CFP to
participate in the Eighth Development Finanice Companies Project (Loan
1857-CO), applying to CFP the dishursement percentages set up for small-scale
enterprise financing under the third SSI project.  Out of the proceeds of
Loan 1857-Co, CFP used a total of LUS$846,000 to finance 15 subprojects.
3.()4      Loan Components.  The loan p,roceeds were intended to assist CFP in
financing investment credits and technical assistance subloans, as follows:
(a) USS13.2 million for lending to firms with less than US$300,000 equivalent
in total assets, with Up to US$2.0 million of this amount available to
finance permanent working capital; (b) USS13.2 million for lending to
enterprises with less than UIS$650,000( equivalent in total assets, with up to
LUS$2.0 million of this amournt available to finance permanent working capital;
(c) US$5.0 million to finance the permanent working capital requirements of
investment enterprises with production facilities located outside the
metropolitan areas of Bogota, Cali and Medellin, and with less than
,USSiOn,('0 equiivalent in total assets; and (d) !'SS600,(')000 for technical
assistance, in( liding USS12i()  for (FP to help finance consulting services
related to institutional development and continuation of the ongoing
computerizatio,n of th,-e information ~;vstem.

components during implementation of the project.  The total allocation for
the credit component for firms with less than US$300,000 equivalent in total
assets was increased from US$13.2 million to US$23.5 million. The additional
resources came from the corresponding reductions in the credit components for
firms with total assets between US$300,000 and US$650,000 equivalent and the
"free-standing" permanent working capital, from US$13.2 million to US$6.2
million and from US$5.0 million to US$1.7 million, respectively. The
technical assistance component was also adjusted to increase the allocation
for CFP's computer equipment from US$100,000 to US$360,000, leaving
US$24O,000 for technical assistance subloans. The reallocation of a total of
USS10.3 million to the credit component for smaller enterprises shows a
greater-than-expected impact of the project, reaching the intended target
group of smaller enterprises. The above reallocations were authorized by the
Bank at the request of BR and CFP.
Characteristics of Lending
3.C)6       CFP financed, through the Bank's three SS  loans, ahout 2,30(
subprojects, of whlich 1,270 (55%) represent the share of the loan under
review. This reflects the incremental trend in CFP's SMI financing with
Blank sulpport, as well, as the favorable impact of the project within the SMI
stuhsecrtor. The 1,270) suhprojects financed under the loan for a total of
ColS 2,174 milliorn represented abotut 12% of the 10,494 subprojects approved
by CFP durinig project execution, arnd 22% of the Co1$ I U,04() milliorn CFP's
total lending. In general terms, the original loan targets were almost
reached since the Bank subloaris provicied term financing for 1,27(0
suhprojects, as compared with the appraisal estimate of around 1,500
(Annex 3).
3.X7      Stiblnan Size and Maturities.  The average subloan size of aro,lt
U'5'24,( ()h,! slightly exceeded the appraisal estimate of US$22, 000.  Oit oi
the I ,270 subloanis approved, only 36 were over the US$100,000 free limit
established tinder the loan.  About 66.67 of the subloans were helow
l' 5i S  .",  00()  
3.08      One of the project objectives was to provide credit to help a group
that genera11v has inadequate access to term financing. In this regard, of
the 1,27(0 suibprojects financed, only 1.4% were approved under the maturity
range (of one to two vears.  On the other hand, only 5% of the subprojects
benefited from longer periods of over six years. The bulk of subprojects
(71(%) have maturity terms mostly concentrated within a period of three to
five years, which, for small credits, could be considered adequate.  However,
1.5;% of the subloans were provided with less than three years of maturity,
which contributed to difficulties in subloan repayment (paras. 4.04 and
5.10). CFP claimed that there is a reluctance on the part of small-scale
entrepreneurs to incur long-term debt. The results are basically similar to
those obtained under the two previous Bank loans.  In response to the Bank's
recommnendation, CFP is paying more attention to stubprojects' repayment
capacity analsis.   Improvements in the adequacy of the maturities and grace
periods o, CFP credits are expected  under the ongoing Bank loan (2464-CO).

3.09       Subproject Characteristics.   The total cost of the third SSI
project amounted to Col$ 4,218 million or US$72.2 million,7/ as compared to
the US$83.0 million estimated at appraisal (Annex 4). The average total cost
per project amounted to US$56,850 equivalent, which is in line with the
appraisal estimate. The Bank's participation in total project cost amounted
to 42.6%, as compared to the original forecast of 38.60, because of domestic
currency resource constraints experienced during the project execution
(para. 4.09). With the exception of CFP, the contribution of other local
sources of funds was less than expected. Such other local lending sources,
including institutions and extra-bank market, contributed only about 15.6% of
the total project cost, as compared to 22.9% expected; sub-borrowers
contrihuted 27.6% versus the estimated 28.9%; and CFP contributed 14.2%, as
opposed to the 9.6% estimated.  Of the total project cost, 56.1% was for
fixed asset investments, which is higher compared to the 49.9% appraisal
estimate; on the other hand, for the working capital needs, it was 42.2%
versus 49.4% appraisal estimate.
3.10       Subloans approved for machinery and equipment represented 47.6% of
total subloans and 65.8% of total financing.   In terms of subproject number,
the working capital category comes second in importance, with 429
subprojects, equivalent to 33.8% of the tota'.  In monetary terms, however,
it represented only 15% of the loan proceeds versus 28% appraisal estimate.
About US$0.15 million were used to finance 26 technical assistance
subprojects, accotinting for (.5% of total loan amount.  About 50% of the
technical assistance subprojects were for accounting and administrative
assistance, 25% for assistance related to prodtuction processes and the
balance for technical assistance regarding marketing, financial managemnenlt
and organization.  Industrial constrtuction expen(ditures accouinted for 16.8,/
of the total financing under the loan, as compared to 37% under the second
loan.  This decrease in construction financing resulted partly from CFP's new
policy for industrial construction financing, which was started under the
third loan (para 5.Ofl.8/
3.11       The project appraisal recognized the limited export capacity o, thez
Colombian SMI subsector, and estimated 10% of the financed subprojects to
produce for the external market. However, the hutlk of the subprojects
approved gear their production toward the local market, while only six
enterprises are producing for exports.    SSIs need to be encoturaged to make
some efforts to orient their output toward foreiga markets. Out of the 1,27t0
enterprises assisted with Bank f,,nds, 801.5% were existing firms and the
remaining 19.5% (representing 24% of total loan amount) were newly
established firms, which exceeded the 10% appraisal estimate. It also
exceeded considerably the results achieved regarding the number of firms and
the amount of funds channeled to those enterprises under the two previouis S'Sl
loans.  Since the first SSI loan, CFP has increased its focus on new
enterprises, assisting 70 new firms, i.e. over 10% of the total population,

accounting for 7.5% of the total loan amount, from less than 4% and a little

3.12      Sub-borrower Characteristics.  A wide range of industries have
benefited from the project, but none of the industrial subsectors represent
more than 20% of the subloans.  Food and beverages is the most benefited,
with 244 credits (19.2%) of the total subloans. The remaining 80-0% is
distributed to 12 subsectors: paper and printing, 10.6%; metallic products,
10.5%; apparel and footwear, 9.7%; wood and furniture 9.4%;, and others with
smaller participation. With the exception of food and beverages which
received 20.4% of the total financing, none of the other subsectors received
more than 11.4%, which is well in line with expectaticns.  About 70% of the
assisted enterprises have less than three owners/shareholders, wY-le about
65% have total assets below Col$ 5.0 million (around US$70,000); 79%
employed fewer than 20 people, and only 10 firms have had more than 100
employees. In terms of both size of firm and number of employees, the impact
of the project is favorable since the figures are far below the national
parameters established to define SMI enterprises (assets of no more than Col$
100.0 million and workers numbering up to 150).
3.13       Industrial Decentralization.  Given the expected wide geographical
distribution of sub-borrowers, the prcject was also aimed at supporting
Government policies to decentralize industrial growth.  The geographical
dispersion of Bank-assisted enterprises has been in line with expectations,
with 854 subprojects (67.21 of the total) accounting for firms located
outside the most industriailied departments of Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and
Valle.  These subprojects represent 60  of total financing, as compared to
501 appraisal estimate.
Impact of Subprojects
3.14       Emplcynent qeneraticn and Investment Cost per Jot.  Bcth the
employment creaticn and the average ?apital, (cost per job created met the
expectations.  'he 1,270 subprojects financed under the loans were expected
to create about 6,100 new direct jobs, with an average expected 4.9 new ',bs
per subproject and an average investment cost per job created of
UJS$11 ,800, as compared rs the  GS$1 1 ,)00 estimated at aTpraisa! and the
UJS$13,500 uinder the seeonid SSI project.
3.15      The results of a survey of 127 Bank-assisted enterprises (including
32 new enterprises) conducted by rFP are shown ,n Annexes 5, 6 and 7.  The
survey shows that employment grew by 71 .5t for Ire small sub-borrowers with
total assets below 'US$300,000, and by v        for firms with total assets
between US$300,000 and US$650,00.  It also shows a relatively small increase
in investment cost per job with the increasing size of the enterprise, from
1TS$6,956 to US$7,q75, which, based on the two previous Bank's loans is
normal9/ (Annex 6).  The increased capacity of the larger firms to create
new jobs, as compared to the results of the seccnd SSI loan, was due tc ac

new jobs.  Wide variations, however, can be observed across different
subsectors. Basic metals show an Pmployment growth of a high 304.4%, while
non-metallic minerals show a negative employment growth. High employment
growth is also evident in leather goods and textile industry, which was one
of the activities expected by the Government to help recover economic
growth. The investment cost per job in these sectors averaged about
US$5,(00.
3.16       Sales Growth and Increase in Productivity  Ba-ed upon the results
of the above survey, the average sub-borrower's annual sales during
subproject implementation grew by 53.0%10/ in real terms, and the relatively
larger enterprises (over US$300,000 in total assets) show an average sales
growth of 55.6% (Annex 7). Both results compare favorably with the Bank's
expectations. In this respect, the preceding loan (1451-CO) had 24% and
15.2% in real terms, respectively. The above results were stimulated by the
Government's measures enforced in early 1983 to halt the recessional period,
showing a considerable increase in sales vis-a-vis the subprojects' original
estimates. However, there are wide differences among the various subsectors,
with basic retals showing, the highest sales growth in real terms of 514.3%.
Satisfactory sales performance is also evident for the average subptojects in
leather goods and chemical products, while food and beverages as well as
transport materials show a rather Modest sales performance. However, these
results comrare favorably with the results under the second SSI loan, and
reflect the reeovery of the Colombian economy during 1983 to 1985.
3.17       The average labor productivity (sales per worker) growth
increased bv 2().8,Z, which exceeded the labor productivity results (9%) under
the provi.ous project.  The productivity growth is considerably higher for
siib-hurrower; with total assets between US$300,n00 and US$650,00() than for
firms with total assets not exceeding US$300,000 (24.9% and 3.4%
respertivelv), Durinig the recession, some of the larger firnms reduced their
woitz force and expanded their production through complementary equipment.
11nder an improving investinent climate, these same enterprises keep the same
labor force and make new investments for plant modernization.  On the other
hand, while capital productivity (sales per dollar value of assets) for small
suh-borrowers increased by 7.9', it decreased by 14.4% for larger
subprojects.  Since our estimate for capital productivity is not adjusted for
capacity utilization, the overall decrease in capital productivity implies
that the rate of capacity utilization may have decreased over the two-year
period.  The entrepreneurs prohably huilt capacity ahead of demand or the
expected growth was not fully reali7ed withini the two-year period under
review.  An increase in capital produictivity was achieved for only four
sub-sectors. For the average sub-borrower in the electrical machinery
sub-sector,  sapital productivity increased by 3.2,,, in leather goods
subsector by 44.9%, in basic metals subsector by 68.3% and in non-electrical
machinery by 29.3%°.  These subsectors also experienced tremendaus sales
growth (25.li %, 127.6;., 514.3% and 62.52, respectively) and succeeded in

Current Status of Selected Subprojects
3.18      Based upon the above results of the survey of a sample of 127
subprojects undertaken by CFP, the overall performance of the subprojects
financed under the loan can be considered satisfactory. To further gauge the
actual impact of the loan, the mission visited a randomly-selected sample of
19 enterprises (Annex 8). Eight of these subprojects are now expariencing
production/sales problems and/or working capital shortage. The 1984-1985
financial statement3 of this sample of 19 subprojects indicate that 10 have
tight liquidity position. CFP, which has identified these problems during
its latest supervision visits, has helped these enterprises by either
refinancing their subloans or providing working capital financing. In
addition to financial assistance, over 10 of these enterprises require
technical assistance in various areas, including organization, production,
marketing and accounting. Only one of these enterprises has received a
subloan for technical assistance in production and four have received
technical assistance in administration, project preparation, production and
marketing.  This shows that, while CFP has continued to increase its
technical assistance activities, greater focus is placed on the financial
needs of client enterprises. The recent coordinated efforts to identify the
technical assistance needs of SMIs, under the Government's national technical
assistance plan for SMI, should complement CFP's efforts in this respect
(para 5.16).
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPNENT
4.01        As mentioned earlier, much of the data and analyses of CFP's
institutional development as well as operational and financial performance
during most of the period covered by the loan under review (1979-1983) are
available in the Completion Report on the second SSI loan and the Appraisal
Report on the fourth SSI loan. This chapter and the one following
concentrate mainly upon those aspects about which the Bank expressed concern
in the appraisal report or during the course of project implementation,
bringing some institutional aspects up to date in line with CFP's Action
Program for 1984-1987, aimed at strengthening CFP's institutional and
organizational aspects, which was agreed upon with the Bank under the fourth
SS1 loan.
Management, Staffing and Organization
4.02         In line with discussions between the Bank and CFP under previous
Bank loans, CFP's Board of Directors has continued to delegate increasing
authority to CFP's management in carrying out its lending operations, while
focusi%g upon financial, trade, investment, technical assistance and other
policy matters. It was also the Bank's intention, under the loan, to
concentrate its efforts more upon external issues, and to have CFP continue
the internal development of the institution, with only occasional advisory
assistance from the Bank. Between July 1978 and March 1981, CFP was also
assisted by a US$300,000, 30-month UNDP project in a wide range of
institutional aspects, including subproject appraisal and supervision as well

as information system.ll/ However, CFP's top management underwent frequent
changes during 1979-1985, which affected the overall institutional
development of CFP.   A general manager, who had been appointed in September
1978, moved the institution toward greater cost-consciousness and
profitability, halted staff turnover and improved staff morale. However,
because of differences of opinion with the Minister of Economic Development,
he resigned in October 1981 and another manager was appointed in December of
that year. Differences of opinion soon emerged between the new general
manager, who espoused an ambitious program of CFP involvement in industrial
parks, and staff at different levels, affecting the institutional performance
in 1982.By early 1983, however, another general manager was appointed who
succeeded in maintaining a satisfactory institutional working environment and
relationship with CFP's staff.12/ He also agreed with the Bank on limiting
considerably any CFP involvement in industrial parks.
4.03         Since 1975, CFP has maintained 14 regional offices to support the
Governmertt's industrialization policy, adding three promotional offices
(Popayan, Florencia and Villavicencio) in 1983. During 1984, another
promotional office (Cundinamarca) was added, ai,d the Popayan promotional
office was upgraded to a regular regional office. During the same year,
given CFP's increasing involvement with micro-enterprises, a new Department
of Micro-Enterprises was established under the "Subgerencia de Operaciones."
However, while CFP's total staff has been relatively stable during the period
under review, there has been a continued concentration of staff in the
headquarters.  During project implementation, the Bank continued insisting
upon the need to achieve a better balance between headquarters and regional
office staffing in order to obtain a more rapid operational growth at lower
unit cost. CFP succeeded only in reducing the relative share of its
headquarters staff from 45.5% in 1979 to 41.4% in 1983 and 39.5% in 1984.
Agreement was reached between the Bank and CFP during negotiations of the
fourth SSI loan on general guidelines for a CFP reorganization study and on
an action plan to strengthen the operating capabilities of its regional
offices as part of the overall 1984-1987 Action Program.13/ With the
implementation of the reorganization study, sonie regional-offices have
started to improve their operating efficiency.
11/ The UNDP-financed and UNIDO-executed technical assistance program was
designed to strengthen its capabilities, providing experts in
cooperatives, marketing, subproject appraisal and supervision, financial
systems, industrial parks and information systems. However, because of
problems during the implementation stage, the end result of the program
was modest compared to initial expectations.
12/  CFP's General Manager changed again as of October 1985.  It is too early
to predict the impact of this change.
13/  In line with the reorganization study included in the Action Program,
CFP issued, in 1985, a "Manual de Funciones," based upon a review during
1984 of the functions of all staff in the headquarters and the regional
offices.

Systems and Procedures
4.04         Loan Approval and Supervision.  The Bank has continued to
encourage CFP to make an important contribution to efficient resource
allocation through sound evaluation of investment proposals. As indicated
earlier, a UNDP-financed UNIDO-executed technical assistance program carried
out between July 1978 and March 1981 also assisted CFP in strengthening its
appraisal and supervision capabilities. The evaluation of subprojects has
been strengthened further by the preparation of a new credit manual and
appraisal guidelines, which was a condition for effectiveness of the third
SSI loan. The appraisal work of CHP has gained in depth and coverage;
however, some deficiencies still remain in subproject appraisals,
particularly in market and repayment capacity analysis of subprojects and/or
enterprises, the latter contributing to CFP's arrears problems (para. 5.10).
These deficiencies were identified under the third loan and further addressed
under the ongoing fourth SSI loan. The average subproject processing time
was about four to five months, from subproject preparation to first
disbursement.14/
4.05         CFP's supervisioni capabilities have improved through the
successlve Bank loans.  Under the third SSI loan, CFP introduced a more
effective supervision and followup system: (a) control of investment,
following the last disbursement of subloan; (b) followup on individual
subprojects at least once a year; and (c) supervision of subloans in
arrears.  However, the quality of supervision activities started to
deteriorate in 1982, with a decline in the nuLmber of annual supervision
visits from 52% of CFP's total. clients in 1981 to 33% in 1983 and 37% in
1984. This situation was caused partly by CFP's focus, during 1982, on
lending to industrial parks and partly because of staff constraints in
regional offices and lack of headquarters' control over regional managers'
supervisory activities.  Inadequate supervision activities contributed to
accumulation of new arrears, and negate the efforts of CFP in debt recovery
(para. 5.10).  During the second half of 1983, CFP reassigned eight
additional staff to improve its supervision work, and established the
Regional Supervision Committees, which have responsibility for m)nthly
reviews of supervision work and recommendation of action to be taken.  The
implementation of CFP's 1984-1987 Action Plan should further strengthen CFP's
supervision procedures.
4.06         Information Systems.  The information requlred by the Bank in the
form of periodic reports on CFP's financial and operational performance tinder
the successive SSI loans has been useful in improving the quality and scope
of statistical information on CFP's operations. While CFP has started
computerizing most of its accounting and statistical reports as early as
1980, its electronic data processing system needs further strengthening to
improve, particularly, portfolio management anid appraisal capabilities of
regional offices.  Tn this regard, the Bank, during the execution of the
loan, insisted upon the introduction of a monitoring system to make the
14/  A recent analysis of CEP's suhprolect prc_.Fsing time undertaken hv
ACOPI shows that it takes, cn average, a total of 165 days t:, process a
subloanl, as follows   52.5 for subproject preparation, another 92.5 days
to establish the guarantee, 37.5 for r7FP's subproject approval and .22.5
days for BR tn effect disbursements.

status and results of subprojects financed readily available.  The lack of
detailed information about a firm's financial position and viability, as well
as the absence of an effective client and loan monitoring system, was
identified as one of the main reasons for the deteriorating quality of CFP's
portfolio (para. 5.10).  As provided in its 1984-1987 Action Program, CFP, in
1985, has started preparing a study of its el-eztronic data processing
requirements. The data processing equipment financed under the third SSI
loan in 1984 would be complemented by computer terminals for regional offices
to be finarnced undier the cechnical assistance component of the fourth SST
loan.  These comptuter terminals are expected to strenRgthen and enhance CFP's
infvrmation systerm with updated portfolio information and to expedite
subproject ap.)praisal process.
4.0r7        Accounting Svstem and Procedures.  CFP has continued to mAintain
satisfactory records of its operational and finacncial situation, including
the separate accounts kept for the loan, as well as the relevant
dIocumentation supporting disb:irsement applicatioris processed under the
statement of e-xpenditure (SOE1) procedure.  PTxce)t f'or its 1tAX financial
3tatements, which were nudited by Deloitte liaskins 1 2ells, CFP's accounts

domestic resources (possibly via passbook savings) by CFP, the Bank
introduced, under the fourth SSI loan, an onlending interest rate system,
consisting of two components, one at a fixed rate and the other at a variable
rate.
e
Interest Rates
4.10         CFP's onlending interest rates hAve differed among themselves
depending on the source of funds used to finance a particular subproject
(para. 4.12). The interest rate has been fixed more in line with lending
development purposes than with CFP's resource mobilization. Given this
variation in CFP's onlending rates under its several credit lines, the Bank
recommended, during project preparation, a review of CFP's interest rate
policy to make it more compatible with the effective interest rate structure
in Colombia.
4.11         Through the second SSI loan, the 24% p.a. nominal interest rate
on subloans (almost 27% p.a. effective), was above the inflation rate most of
the time. During the negotiation of the third SSI loan, expectations were
that inflation could rise from 24% to 28%. CFP admitted that a situation
could occur wherein a rate of 24% would no longer be advisable, particularly
if rates on other lines would change, and acknowledged the advisability of an
interest rate review mechanism. It was, therefore, agreed to establish a 26%
per annum nominal interest rate for fixed assets and working capital and 15%
per annum for technical assistance subloans. The nominal 26% p.a. interest
rate was collected quarterly In advance, resulting in an effective rate of
about 30% p.a.. It was also agreed to review, twice a year, the adequacy of
the annual nominal interest rate on subloans in order to maintain it at a
positive level with regard to inflation in Colombia.  The onlending interest
rate of 26% was maintained throughout project implementation.
4.12         The following table shows the evolLtion of CFP's onlending rates
under its most impo-tant credit lines vis-a-vis commercial banks' interest
rates and inflation.

Source: CFP
The interest rate under the loan was lower than the lending interest rates
applied by commercial banks and was kept in line with CkP's irnterest rates
under other credit lines. With inflation down to 16.6% in 1983 and 18.3% in
1984, from 24% in 1982, the nominal onlending rate of 26% p.a. (about 30%
p.a. effective due to payment of interest in advance) under the loan was
maintained at a very positive level with regard to inflation. It is,
however, below the commercial banks' rate.
4.13         The above interest rate review mechanism has been continued
through the subsequent loan, with some modification.16/
V. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORIIANCE
Operations
5.01         Consistent with the ohJective of Lhe second SSI project, CFP
reviewed its policies and operations under the third SSI project.  At the
time of project appraisal and negotiations, the Bank felt that a clearer
policy on CFP's construction subprojects was needed. In the past, severa]
subloans financed mainly materials and 'Inventory storage space for the
enterprise involved. While the construction was clearly justified in terms
of improving the financial performance of the firm, the subloans, in some
cases, did not result directly in increases of output or employmelnt. As a
condition for loan effectiveness, CFP proqented a policy statement onl
construction financing which, inter alia, directed such financing into areas
outside Colombia's main cities and emphasized the financing of buildings and
facilities intended for production activities. During the period under
review, CFP also 'increased the maximum total assets of enterr.rises eligible
for financing by CFP from Col$ 35.0 million to Col$ 60.0 million, which would
be applicable only to FFI and CFP's own funds. The Bank agreed to the
increase given that (a) the Col$ 35.0 million limit had been maintained since
1973, while the average inflation rate over the period had been about 25% per
annum; (b) CFP needed to compensate its higher operating costs for lending to
the very small-scale enterprises; (c) some entrenreneurs graduated from CFP
16/  Under the fourth SSI loan, the Bank introduced an onlending interest
rate system, consisting of two parts: (a) 15% of the subloan bears
interest at the rate for 90-day certificates of deposit (CDTs), at such
rates established through an index calculated and published by BR, plus
3 percentage points during each 90-day interest payment period; and (b)
85% of the principal financed bears interest rate at a fixed rate which
is reviewed semi-annually by the Bank with BR and CFP to maintain a rate
that is compatible with other local term interest rates and positive in
real terms.

were still toc small to be financed by commercial banks/financieras; and
(d) FFI increased the limit of eligible enterprises' total assets to US$60.0
million from 1977.
5.02         Another important development during the c:;urse of project
implementation w&s the establishment in 1981 of a guarantee fund called
"Fondo Nacicnal de Oarantias" (FNG), by IFi and CFP. FNG guarantees loans to
small manufacturing and mining firms. In addition to IFI and CFP, the other
shareholders are PROEXPO, CARBON0ORTE, CARBOCOI and ACOPI. FNG, which starteri
operations in 1982, guarantees up to 1001 of the subloans approved by a
financial intermediary. As of October 1985, it had approved 839 guarantee
certificates, totaling Ccl$ 625.4 million for subprojects which were expected
to generate 2,875 new jobs and establish 418 new enterprises. CFP subloans
represented more than two-thirds of all these operatiorns. CFP has received a
total of 117 payments, amounting to Ccl$ 38.0 million, on guarantee
certificates issued by FNG.
5.(7!       v'easured against the projections made at the time of appraisal,
CFP met the expectaticns regarding the growth of its lending operations, with
commitments and disbursements, during 1979-19P7, showing annrual orowth rates
of' ahuut ?6f and 25,9  in nominal terms, respectively (Annex 1().  CFP lendinp
corntinued tc be widely dispersel geographically and over industria]

5.06        Micro-Enterprise Financing.  An important new development during
the implementation of the project was CFP's financial involvement with
private foundations and micro-enterprises (MEs), representing very small
firms in the informal sector of the economy. CFP's credit lines for this
purpose, introduced in 1982 with some Bank financing, included working
capital and fixed asset financing to firms with less than 15 employees and
IJS$25,000 equivalent in total assets. CFP's lending to MEs under its various
lines of credit increased considerably from Col$ 40.7 million in 1979 to Col$
259.9 million in 1983 and Col$ 436.5 million in 1985.18/ Between 1979 and
1985, it approved 7,670 ME subprojects, totaling US$1,089.5 million.  In
1984, a revolving fund ("Fondo Rotatorio") was established in CFP (the
Naticnal Planning Department (NPD) and CFP contributed equial amountsof Col$
40.0 million) to provide financial assistance to the foundations for their
technicql. assistance programs for MEs. The fund has benefited 8,635 MEs
which have received training in accounting and project preparation.
Financial Position and Results
5.07         During the appraisal of the project, the Bank had expressed
concern about the effect of the Monetary Board's Resolution 65 upon CFP's
financisl soundness. Resolution 65 required all Colombian "financieras",
including CFP, to use no less than 10% of their assets in equity investments
or in FF'  bGnds.  The Bank had intimated to the Government its desire to
protett ('FP from the undesirable effects of Resolution 65.  Given CFPI9 low
:r,;fitability (due in part to its specialization in SSI), the revenue losses
,ind capital loss risks resulting from Resolution 65 requirements seriously
endarn.erei 2FPs9 f.inancial structure and operations.  Tn December 1979, the
Monetriry Pcqrd modified Resolution 6f5 in a wav that virtually exempts CFP
nehrefr-m tfr the foreseeabJe future.
.71.      The 19Th-1984 financial staterLentg, with key finaneial
-.~cnl o rat(, CI' CFP are shown in Annexes 11-13.  At the time of project
pr+ra.s, ^FP's dect'eq-uity ratio was projecte(d to be well. within the 5.5:1
c>iling over the nexn five vears, which was the debt/equity limit agreed upor
betweei tine Bank alnd CFP since 1977.  The Bank, hcwerer, recognizing the
4ncreasing proportion of long-term bcrrowing by CFP and in order to allow
somo flexibility, relaxed CFP's debt/equity iimit to 6:1 under the third
joan. 'he same ratio has been maintained under the fourth SSI loan. The
GoverVment equ.ty contribution, as iequired under the loan, kept CFP's
4eit'equity ratio substantially below the maxinum ceiling of 6.0:1 during the
implementation cf the loan (being at all times below 5.5:1).  The ceiling on
shcrt-term loarns of two times equity, which was required under the seccnd S3I
lcan to oheck a possible rapid growth in short-term lending, was not
cor.sdered necessary under the third SSI loan, and CFP has since

5.09         As projected during appraisal of the third SSI project. the
growth rate of income started to decline after 1979 as CFP's debt/equity
ratio and its average cost of funds gradually rose. The cost of borrowings
showed an increasing trend since 1979 when the financial margin as a
percentage of portfolio was decreasing. During project preparation and
appraisal, the Bank asked CFP to review its interest rate policy, taking into
account increases in its cost of borrowing and the overall interest rate
structure in Colombia. Profits also did not compensate for the erosion of
CFP's equity by inflation during 1979-1983, and the net income/equity ratio
declined from 7.4% in 1979 to 2.7% in 1983. However, low leverage, expenses
of other programs and CFP's inability to maintain the value of its equity in
real terms through profits are made up, to some extent, by periodic increases
in equity by the Government.
Portfolio Quality
5.10         Notwithstanding iEs dynamic growth, the quality of CFP's
portfolio improved consistently through 1982, with portfolio affected by
arrears amounting to 12% of the total loan portfolio, compared with 20% when
the Bank made its first loan in 1975. However, a serious reversal occurred
in 1983, with arrears affecting 17.3% of the total portfolio by the end of
the year (Annex 14).    Concerned with the increasing arrears, CFP, in that
year, prepared a detailed analysis of its portfolio based upon a survey of
1,611 clients who were in arrears, indicating the main causes for the
deterioration and making some recommendations to reverse the unfavorable
trend. The main reasons for this situation, in addition to the economic
recession and financial difficulties affecting sub-borrowers, were inadequate
subproject repayment analysis and portfolio supervision by CFP and lax
collection procedures. As initial steps to solve the problem, CFP, during
the second half of 1983, (a) established a special credit program (US$2.5
million equivalent) to assist those enterprises with liquidity problems whose
operations are financially sound and viable; (b) started to strengthen its
subproject supervision activities by increasing the number of supervision
visits, intensifying their scope and setting up regional supervision
committees; and (c) gave specific responsibilities to regional managers to
improve their respective portfolios.
5.11         As the economy improved and as a result of CFP'S above efforts,
CFP's arresrs position started to improve during the last quarter of 1984.
At the end of August 1984, total portfolio affected by arrears represented
about 24.4% of lending portfolio; this ratio dropped to 20.9% by year-end
1984. By year-end 1985, the overall portfolio affected by arrears amounted
to 20.3% of CFP's lending portfolio. Arrears for over 360 days represented
about 9.2% of CFP's total lending portfolio as of December 31, 1985 (about
the same level as in 1984). Out of 1,270 subloans financed under the third
loan, 228 have arrears problem as of December 31, 1985, which amounts to
Col$ 195.3 million, representing 22.7% of the loan, or about 2.4% of CFP
total lending portfolio and 12% of total portfolio affected by arrears. Some
of the decrease in the percentage of portfolio affected by arrears was due to
CFP's increased supervision and collection efforts. The improving situation
also resulted from an increase in CFP's operation and the favorable
performance of some regional offices.  Although CFP's overall arrears
position (20%) is high in absoltite terns, it reflects the credit problems
afflicting Colombia's overall financial sector, and is in line with that of
the private DFCs (22/) and substantially lower than that of Colomhia's whole



- 19 -
banking system (29X).19/ Moreover, CFP's exposure is also protected since
about 80% of its portTilio has real guarantees. CFP continues to intensify
its portfolio recuperation activities in line with its 1984-1987 Action
Program.20/ As part of the Action Plan, CFP now establishes debt recovery
targets TWr both existing and new loans.21/ Also, with the further
improvement of it's electronic data processing system, its debt recovery
efforts should improve.
Administrative Costs
5.12         The level of CFP's administrative costs has been a major concern
of the Bank and of CFP. At the time of project appraisal, CFP expected
relatively higher administrative cost ratioE in 1980-81 because of the
start-up cost of its new technical assistance programs (para. 5.15), and
lower-than-expected growth in total assets in 1979. It was, therefore,
agreed during loan negotiations that CFP would maintain administrative costs
at 7.5% of average total assets in 1980, 6.9% in 1981 and 6.0% in 1982, and
onwards. Although CFP managed to reduce its administrative costs/average
total assets ratio from 7.1% in 1981 to 6.5% in 1983, it exceeded the targets
set under the loan from 1981 onwards. In absolute terms, administrative
costs grew at an annual rate of 27% during 1979-1983, with salaries and other
personnel expenses accounting for 77% of total administrative costs.
CFP's ability to control salary increases is, however, restricted, as they
are determined by agreement with staff union, using as parameter the
Government's salarv policy which has provided substantial increases over the
past years. Administrative expenses also grew in relation to average total
assets, from 6.7% in 1983 to 7.3% in 1984 and 7.6% in 1985. This situation
19/  Source:  Balances del Sector Financiero, Asociacion Bancaria de
Colombia, Junio de 1985.
2(9/  During the negotiations for the fourth SSI project, the Bank asked CFP
to prepare a portfolio recovery plan whiich would include: (a) recovery
targets; (b) collection policies and procedures; (c) a supervision
system, including use of the regional supervision committees; (d) clear
and concrete assignments of nortfolio administration responsibilitles;
(e) the corresponding operating/organizational adjustments; and (f) a
review of the special credit program for SSIs having liquidity problems,
with regard to expected duration, funding requirements, access terms and
results obtained. CFP was also asked to review its lending practices to
allow a longer repayment and grace period for subprojects.
21/  In this regard, during 1985, it intensified its efforts to improve the
effectiveness of its portfolio recuperation activities. In July 1985,
CFP established a portfolio executive committee, comprising CFP's
General Manager, Deputy Managers of Operations and Finance, Director of
Portfolio, Auditor General and Legal Counsel. Its primary objective is
to formulate measures that would facilitate debt recovery and improve
the administration and control of CFP's portfolio. Starting in 1986,
CFP would also require its regional offices to prepare not only
individual lending programs, but also debt recovery targets, and to
recommend appropriate action for the disposition of foreclosed
guarantees received for delinquent accounts, subject to periodic
reviews.



- 20 -
resulted partly from the slower-than-expected growth in CFP's portfolio and
the high relative share of administrative costs of headquarters staff (43.8%
of total staff and 48.5% of total administrative costs during 1979-1983), as
compared to costs in regional offices where CFP's income and profits are
generated.22/. Also, the higher administrative costs can be considered as
the price O  operating an institution supporting only SSIs, and, at the same
time, using adequate standards of subproject appraisal, supervision and
technical assistance. This does not, however justify the above concentration
of staff in the headquarters, and CFP should continue to achieve a better
balance between operational and support staff.23/
Technical Assistance
5.13         CFP's strategy of helping to diagnose TA needs and facilitating
the provision of services to clients and prospective clients by public
agencies and private consultants, in coordination with specialized technical
assistance institutions, like SENA and FICITEC, was adopted tinder the loan.
It required CFP to establish detailed annual programs for technical
assistance and monitor the implementation of the program closely. SENA has
improved its technical assistance capability and agreed to cooperate more
closely with CFP, offering its integrated technical assistance program to CFP
clients.  Agreements were also made with other instituitions, including
FICITEC and INCOLDA, and several universities to carry its technical
assistance plans.  During the period tinder review, CFP continued to implement
its technical assistance programs with a small technical assistance
department in the headquarters and the 17 advisors attached to its regional
offices.26/
5.14         Under the new technical assistance approach, CFP, frorr 1979 to
1983, carried out 9,747 supervision visits (Annex 15), througn whic1 most of
the technical assistance needs were identified.  The areas with ttie inost
pressing need for technical assistance were production and quality control.
marketing, financial and management capabilities; there was also a nee6 for
TA assistance in the application of new techniologies and aevelopment of new
markets, mainly for exports.  Duritng the same period, CFP has promoted 91
seminars, which were sponsored by SENA, FIcITFC, PROEXPO and other
22/ During the negotiations for the fourth SSI project, agreement between
the Bank and CFP on the Action Plan and target levels for CFP's
administrative costs/average total assets ratio, which form part of
CFP's overall 1984-1987 Action Plan, was reached. This Action Plan
include a program aimed at strengthening the rol- of CFP's regional
offices, with the ultimate objective of transforming them into ptofit
centers and lowering CFP's unit costs.
23/  In connection with the proposed split of the Bogota Regio n -  )ffice   Irtc
two branches, six headquarters staff have recently been reassigned to
handle part of the area covered by the Bogota Regional office.  Til s

institutions. A total of 1,586 entrepreneurs participated in these seminars
which dealt with accounting, financial, marketing and management aspects, as
well as technological matters. CFP also provided financial support to 59
enterprises requiring consultancy services, which amounted to about
US$16.8 million. In accordance with its agreement with CFP, SENA has
provided direct and integrated assistance to 561 artisans and 180 SSIs durilng
1979 to 1983. Although CFP has maintained adequate records of its technical
assistance programs with regard to activity volume and number of
participants, it did riot carry out a comprehensive review thereof to assess
their appropriateness, the clients' receptivity and practical adoption of the
TA received.
5.15        Notwithstanding the positive results of its new technical
assistance approach, CFP's technical assistance activities were hampered by
its limited institutional ability to coordinate, at the national level, the
technical assistance activities of specialized institutions providing TA
services to SSIs. The limited results of CFP's new technical assistance
approach also partly stemmed from the rather little focus placed on the
technical assistance needs of client enterprises during regular supervision
visits. Given this experience under the third loan, CFP is carrying out
technical assistance program at the regional and national levels in
accordance with the Plan of Action for 1984-1987 agreed upon with the
Bank.25/
5.16        CFP's overall 1984-1987 Action Program includes three TA programs
at the regional level (Bucaramanga, Medellin and Cali) and a TA program at
the national level, aimed at coordinating technical assistance to SSIs.
Under these programs, several courses, seminars, conferences, etc. were held
during 1984 and 1985 in coordination with TA institutions, including SENA,
ACOPI and FICITEC. In terms of activity volume and number of participants,
the programs provided a promising start for the 1984-1987 comprehensive
program. The above coordination has also been initiated in several other
regions where CFP is operating. It is expected that these TA programs would
be extended to the rest of the regions during 1986.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      With the third SSI loan, the Bank built upon the institutional
development efforts of Lhe prior loans and channeled resources at a
relatively rapid rate to the Colombian SSI subsector. Disbursements, which
started after a considerable delay in declaring the loan effective, were
25/ The technical assistance programs developed by CFP in 1984 and 1985
served as a model for designing the National Technical Assistance
Program for SMI. The Government also created in 1985 the Technical
Assistance Executive Committee for SMI, consisting of SENA, Ministry of
Economic Development, National Planning Depa.Fment, PROEXPO, CFP,
National Guarantee Fund, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, COLCIENCIAS,
ACOPI, etc. The Committee's cocrdinator is SENA. Operating committees,
with representatives from the same institutions, were also established
in various major Colombian cities to identify the technical assistance
needs of SMIs.

completed about four years from Board approval, as compared to the LAC
regional disbursement profile for SSI of 5.5 years.
6.02      The project was well geared to the Government's major industrial
sectoral goals to generate employment and stimulate geographical
decentralization.  With the third SSI loan, CFP provided effective support to
SSI, particularly at the regional level, reaching the intended target group
of smaller enterprises, and achieving a satisfactory geographic and
subsectoral dispersion. The economic impact of subprojects financed was
overall satisfactory.
6.03         For the most part, CFP's performance in achieving the objectives
of Loan 1834-CO was satisfactory. However, project implementation identified
some aspects that required strengthening as well as lessons to be learned for
future operations. Notwithstanding the institutional development efforts
under the previous projects and the loan, CFP's efficiency and effectiveness
are still hampered by some problem areas in which there is ample room for
improvement or in which CFP did not evolve significantly during the
implementation of Loan 1834-Co. In addition to the overall difficult
economic situation and the financial weakness of the SSI subsector, CFP's
inadequate appraisal and supervision procedures, as well as its portfolio
management;, have contribtuted to the deterioration of its portfolio.
6.04      The overall operational financial performance of CFP during project
Implementation caIn he considered satisfactory taking into account CFP's focus
on the smaller SSIs and its development activities in support of the
subsector for whicih it does not get renumerated. CFP met the expectations
regarding the growth of its lending operations, and maintained its
debt/equitv ratio within the level provided in the Project Agreement.
However, with the increase in its debt equity ratio and its average cost of
borrowing, CFP's income growth rate declined since 1979. Profits also did
not compensate for erosion of CFP's equity by inflation during 1979-1983.
CFP was also unable to meet the targets set for administrative costs.
Further strengthening of the role of the regional offices, transforming them
into profit centers and lowering CFP's unit costs remains an essential goal
for CFP.  However, the higher administrative costs can be considered as the
price of operating an institution supporting only SSIs, and, at the same
time, using adequiate standards of subproject appraisal, supervision and
technical assistance. This does not, however, justify the continued
concentration of staff in the headquarters, and CFP should continue to
achieve a better balance between operational and support staff.
6.(0t     The interest rate review mechanism introduced under the loan was a
welcome development. The revision and adjustment procedures provided the
Bans', withi adequate safeguards to ensure that, without unreasonably disrupting
CEP's lending activities, the Bank funds were onlent at positive interest
rates. This mechanism achieved a general objective of placing greater
responsibility for project management upon the Borrower.
e . (?6  'CFP has been able to mohilize adequate resources to support the
credit demand of SMIs.  However, it has continued to be excessively dependent
upon a few sources of term funds.  The Bank has also continued to be the
major source of long-term external funds. Building up a diversified and
sound resource base to adequately finance its operations continue to be an
important ohiective of CFP. The introduction of an onlending interest rate
system, tinder the fourth SSI loan, involving fixed and floating rate



-23-
components, was a first step toward the mobilization of domestic resources
(possibly via passbook savings) by CFP. Also, in the context of a possible
fifth SSI loan, the Bank is exploring the possible role of other financial
intermediaries, and the possibility of having a two-tier mechanism for SSI
financing.
6.07      While CFP's new technical assistance approach was viewed as a
positive step toward future development of the SSI subsector, the results
were rather modest, partly due to CFP's limited institutional ability to
coordinate, at the national level, the technical assistance activities of
specialized institutions providing TA services to SSIs. Given this
experience under the loan, CFP is now carrying out technical assistance
programs at the national and regional levels in accordance with its 1984-1987
Action Program agreed upon with the Bank under the fourth SSI Loan.
6.08      An important element affecting the institutional and organizational
development of CFP has been the lack of continuity of leadership of CFP's top
management, which involved frequent changes during project implementation.
Also, while it was the intention of the Bank to focus its efforts upon
external issues and to have CFP continue the internal development of the
institution, with the Bank's advisory assistance, CFP could have benefited
from more regular visits by the Bank, especially during 1981, the first year
after loan effectiveness.26/
6.09      The project's contribution in inducing the Government to establish
a policy framework for the SSI subsector development, has been limited.
However, the overall policy framework has not discriminated against SSIs, and
i.n the context of the difficult economic and financial situation of the
country during project implementation, the SSI subsector has continued to
play a significant role in the industrial development process. Partially, as
a result of Bank dialogue over the past years, coordinated efforts are now
being made by the Government to design specific policies for SMI. Agreement
was reached, during negotiations for the fourth SSI project, for the
Government to maintain and provide continuous support to the Advisory Council
for Small and Medium Industry (CA), which was established in 1981 as a
mechanism to coordinate, recommend and revise policies affecting the SSI
subsector development. The Fondo Nacional de Garantia started operations in
1982-1983, providing loan guarantees for small manufacturing and mining
firms.   The Government created in 1985 the Technical Assistance Executive
Committee, with SENA as Coordinatot, to identify the technical assistance
needs of SMIs. The Government has also initiated a nationwide
micro-enterprise program. The Bank should pursue, in its dialogue with the
Government, the identification of policies relevant for SSI development and a
review of their impact on SSIs.
26/ The first Bank supervision visit was made In 1982, about seven months
after the loan had been declared effective, followed by two other
missions in 1983, when the loan was about 75%-85% disbursed by the Bank,
and made in conjunction with the preparation of the fourth SSI loan.

Mr. David Thomas
Acting Division Chief
Operations Evaluation Department
IBRD, Washington
We have carefully studied the Completion Report on the Third
Small-Scale Industry Project (1834-CO) and concur with its evaluation of the
economic impact of the subprojects financed, accomplishment of the loan's
objectives and development of CFP's operating and financial results.
We are also aware of the need to continue improving small and medium
industry services and certain institutional and organic aspects, as proposed
in our plan of action for 1984-87 during appraisal of the Fourth Loan
(2464-CO).
In general the report is comprehensive, objective and highly
satisfactory, and forms a useful tool for CFP.
We will appreciate a copy of the final version.
Regards,
Luis Armando Galvis Valles
General Manager
