The objectives of the Project, as stated in the\n            Development Credit Agreement, were (i) strengthening and\n            expansion of Gambia's national health program; (ii) the\n            decentralization of health sector management; (iii) the\n            improvement of health sector planning; and (iv) the\n            introduction of a more effective cost recovery system. The\n            Bank's overall performance was satisfactory. Project\n            identification was consistent with The Gambia's health\n            policy and the economic recovery program. Project\n            supervision was satisfactory. The key lessons learnt are:\n            (a) the need to provide adequate lead-time for\n            implementation of targeted interventions; (b) the need for\n            up-front  agreement and ownership and implementation of key\n            policy objectives to improve quality at entry; (c) the need\n            for caution in establishing Inter-ministerial coordination\n            committees; (d) the importance of physical integration of\n            project coordination unit into the parent ministry; (e); the\n            need for simpler project design and development; and (f) the\n            need for improvements in project management through training\n            and establishment of effective accounting and financial\n            management systems prior to project effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1996-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
