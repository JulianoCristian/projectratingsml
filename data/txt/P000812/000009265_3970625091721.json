   aims to strengthen and expand the national health program,\n            including family planning and nutrition activities.\n            Specifically, it will decentralize health sector management,\n            improve planning, enhance cost recovery, expand primary\n            health care and family planning services, improve\n            institutional effectiveness and efficiency, and strengthen\n            support systems. In order to achieve these objectives, the\n            project consists of two parts. First, it involves a program\n            of reforms to strengthen health sector management, financing\n            and support systems through (i) decentralization, (ii)\n            reorganization, (iii) mobilization of financial resources\n            and (iv) strengthening of the logistic system. Secondly, the\n            prospective project involves a program of investments to\n            strengthen national health care in the country. To do this,\n            the project intends to (i) extend primary health care (PHC)\n            to the Western Region and the Banjul peri-urban area, and\n            expand the communicable disease program nationwide, (ii)\n            construct and rehabilitate health facilities, (iii) improve\n            training for nursing personnel, (iv) enhance maternal and\n            child health care, family planning and nutrition programs,\n            and (v) provide monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1987-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
