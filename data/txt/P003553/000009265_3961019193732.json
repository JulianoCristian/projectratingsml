The Beilungang Thermal Power Extension\n            Project was designed to support industrial growth in East\n            China by increasing electricity supply to the East China\n            Grid, which was suffering from acute power shortages. Bank\n            performance from project preparation through completion was\n            satisfactory. The Bank maintained good relations with the\n            borrower, the beneficiary and the consultants throughout\n            project execution. Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau\n            (ZPEPB) successfully completed the major project components\n            in spite of many difficulties. Key lessons learned from the\n            project were: (a) Although the design parameters of the\n            major equipment were selected on the basis of fully-proven\n            designs, the project experienced many defects in design and\n            workmanship of the major equipment. This experience\n            suggested the need for more stringent quality assurance\n            systems in both ZPEPB and the contractors. (b) Regarding\n            island-based procurement management, the number of contract\n            packages should be minimized to the extent possible to\n            reduce interfacing problems. (c) The effectiveness of\n            consulting services, particularly for construction\n            management, benefits from inputs by international experts.\n            (d) The devaluation of the US dollar against European and\n            Japanese currencies resulted in the beneficiary's loss\n            of $13 million. Measures to avoid or minimize risks related\n            to foreign currency movements should be sought."}, "docdt": "1996-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
