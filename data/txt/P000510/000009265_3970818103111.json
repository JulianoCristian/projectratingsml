Some lessons learned included: the objective\n            of technical assistance (TA) should be clearly defined from\n            the start. Sufficient resources should be allocated for the\n            preparation phase. Within a context of weak capacity and\n            political volatility, such objectives should be modest and\n            project design flexible. Assistance for economic and\n            financial management needs to reflect the Government's\n            strategy in terms of public financial management. Bank\n            flexibility is important in a country emerging from a period\n            of instability. The design of such an operation needs\n            flexibility to respond adequately to a dynamic environment.\n            However, flexibility also means close supervision.\n            Continuity is essential in order to ensure follow-up on\n            actions and recommendations. There should be incentives to\n            limit staff turnover. Also, tasks should not be over\n            centralized and become the responsibility of a single\n            person, as close supervision is crucial to ensuring timely\n            delivery of services and results on the ground. To ensure\n            that training is beneficial, a staff member must be legally\n            committed to staying at his/her post for a minimum time\n            period thereafter. Training needs to be part of an overall\n            program, especially as regards public management. A\n            comprehensive medium-term training program, designed by a\n            specialist in public administration, has to be carefully\n            prepared in the initial stages of the operation."}, "docdt": "1997-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
