Specifically, the\n            project has four components: (i) a technical assistance fund\n            for short-term studies and consultancies and for urgently\n            needed equipment; (ii) construction of two modest office\n            buildings; (iii) training, both short and long-term, in\n            critical areas related to economic and financial management;\n            and (iv) a cost-effective sample population survey. This\n            last component will yield basic demographic data essential\n            for economic planning as well as the sample base for surveys\n            measuring the impact of the adjustment program on households\n            and for health and education surveys."}, "docdt": "1987-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
