Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement
Description
The Grant of US$8.5 million will address several of the prioritized emergency works and activities in 
the port of Monrovia and at Roberts International Airport, and will provide targeted support to 
Government in achieving basic organizational capacity for efficient management of the respective 
sectors. The project also aims during the relatively short implementation period, to support the 
Government in formulating a strategic framework for the sectors. Although execution of the works 
normally would be expected to be completed in just over 2 years, the difficult post-conflict 
environment necessitates an assumption of implementation delays. Advantage of an added 
implementation time is possibility of deeper and richer policy dialogue. The implementation period is 
therefore 4 years.  
Sector Issues
The transport sector in Liberia prior to the civil war included road and railway networks, civil 
aviation, and several ports. Today, the railway network does not exist, civil aviation is limited to 
Monrovia with only UN flights operating upcountry, and the Port of Monrovia is the only operational 
port in the country.  
During the years of conflict, the sector was able to undertake intermittent maintenance activities but 
no periodic maintenance. Partial rehabilitation and new construction were sporadic and limited in 
scope. As a result of the chronic underinvestment and lack of maintenance the rehabilitation 
requirements of the sector today are enormous. 
The Government recognizes the urgency of the situation and has pleaded for donor assistance to the 
sector. Starting in 2005, the Bank financed the technical assessment of the Port of Monrovia, the 
Roberts International Airport in Monrovia as well as assessment of two of the main road corridors in 
the country (Infrastructure TA, TFLIB-funded). The studies identified emergency works and 
Page  2
developed bidding documents that have been shared with donors. Given the capital intensity of the 
sector, few donors have yet pledged funds for large-scale transportation projects.  
The roads sub-sector is mentioned briefly in this document as it is subject of another project 
proposing funding of emergency works that is currently under preparation (US$30.0 million IDA pre-
arrears clearance grant). The railway sub-sector is expected to be picked up by private investors when 
and if the mining sector takes up again. Marine transport and civil aviation are central to sustain and 
expand economic activities in Liberia and as such are a top governmental priority. In addition, marine 
transport and civil aviation infringe on issues of safety, security, and stability in a country still 
characterized as a fragile post-conflict environment. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement
Liberia had been a middle-income country before the war. During the years of conflict the country 
experienced a significant decline in living standards and is c
urrently one of Africa’s poorest nations. 
The peace agreement and the subsequent stability, resulting in the successful election of a new 
Government, offer Liberia a unique opportunity to rebuild its shattered economy and to establish a 
stable and democratic society. After years of war which saw aid from the international community 
almost disappear, Liberia today is supported by major international partners in an effort to promote 
stability in West Africa - a region of frequent conflicts and chronic instability. 
The case for Bank involvement in Liberia at this time is compelling. Following nearly 3 years of 
peace and with a democratically elected Government in place, the ground is prepared for 
reconstruction and recovery. In order to build a functioning economy and restore the livelihood of the 
country’s population, Liberia’s new Government needs to be able to rely on an adequate response 
from international donors both in terms of expertise and finance. In addition, peace provides a 
window of opportunity for the Bank to rebuild its knowledge base and understanding of national 
partner institutions, both of which are essential to increase readiness for a Bank lending program 
when that becomes possible. 
2. Proposed objective(s)
Provide Government with emergency support to restore priority infrastructure in the port of Monrovia 
and at Roberts International Airport and assist the Government in developing medium term strategic 
framework for efficient and productive port and aviation sectors. 
Successful implementation of project will be evidenced by: 
a. 
Identified civil works implemented with quality commensurate to design. 
b. 
Institutional capacity strengthened 
c. 
Government has developed a strategic framework for port and aviation sector

environment necessitates an assumption of implementation delays. Advantage of an added 
implementation time is possibility of deeper and richer policy dialogue. The implementation period is 
therefore 4 years.  
A. Civil Works 
(US$ 7.70 million). 
 
A1. Monrovia Port: Dredging
(
US$ 2.20 million). 
 
From a navigational safety point of view, it is necessary to maintain an entrance channel width of 150 
m
with an 11 meter draft. Based on bathymetric survey results, this requirement is not met by far as 
the channel width is less than 100 m at that draft. The dredging quantities associated with this 
navigational requirement are in the order of 500,000 m3, including dredging of part of the port basin. 
As any obstruction of the entrance channel due to stranding of a vessel might directly impact the 
supply line of Liberia, dredging operations were given the highest priority. 
A2. Monrovia Port: Upgrading Oil Jetty
(
US$ 2.75 million). 
 
The refined products jetty, which is the only functioning one in the country, has deteriorated to a 
degree that it forms a severe risk to the country’s fuel supply. Furthermore no fire fighting installation 
on the refined products jetty is available, increasing risks even further. Within the Port of Monrovia 
there are no alternatives.  
The oil jetty will be structurally upgraded, pipes replaced (until landfall) and adequate safety 
measures introduced. The Liberia Petroleum and Refinery Corporation has plans to replace oil pipes 
from jetty landfall to tanks. 
Collapse of the jetty would place the country’s fuel supply in great danger and a disrupted fuel supply 
would among other things, stop food supply and distribution, UNMIL activities, power generation 
and water supply.  
A3. Monrovia Port: Providing Fire Fighting Capacity at National Port Authority (NPA) Yard
(
US$ 
2.15 million). 
 
The chances of fire in the port are relatively high. The effects of a large scale fire in the port would be 
disastrous to the country’s food supply and export (rubber). At the moment there is no fire engine in 
the port, the fire hydrant system is not functioning, there is no water supply and there is no trained 
NPA fire brigade. 
It is therefore of great importance that minimally the fire water supply system to the NPA yard is 
made functional again and the NPA fire brigade adequately equipped and trained. 
The works will provide for the design, supply, delivery, handling, installation, commissioning, testing 
and setting to works of needed equipment for acceptable firefighting capabilities at NPA yard. 
A4. Roberts International Airport (RIA): Navigational, aeronautical, meteorological and security 
equipment
(
US$ 0.60 million). 
 
This activity addresses the first priority intervention at RIA with provision for supply and installation 
of various navigational, aeronautical, meteorological and security equipment, including earthling and 
lighting protection system, runway and taxiway edge lighting, provision for calibrating, and 
aeronautical and meteorological equipment.

B. Technical Assistance and Capacity Building 
(US$ 0.15 million). 
 
Provision of selective and ad-hoc technical assistance to Government, including support to develop a 
strategic framework for the sub-sectors, as well as targeted training in NPA and RIA to complement 
normalization of operations. The project will assist NPA in bringing about a container 
terminal/handling concession and will support NPA for tendering a marine or towage service contract 
if required. 
C. Project management 
(US$ 0.65 million). 
 
The Project will benefit from the implementation arrangements agreed on for a separate project, the 
Emergency Infrastructure Project (EIP), which are being set up within the Ministry of Public Works 
(MPW). Under EIP, MPW will implement the Project through the creation of a Special 
Implementation Unit (SIU) staffed with a combination of competent MPW staff and selected 
technical assistance. For this project, the SIU will provide coordination, financial management, 
procurement, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and support to safeguard management.  
Additionally, a port engineer and an environmental supervising engineer will be hired, as well as 
other specialist support as may become needed.

The project will provide substantial positive environmental impacts. At the airport, the provision of 
navigation, safety and security equipment will reduce the risk of accidents to airport and airline 
employees as well as nearby residents. Within the port, the works to improve access to the harbor, 
refurbish the oil jetty, install modern fire-fighting systems, and reorganize and re-equip the container 
handling yard will all contribute to reduced risk of accidents (including ship groundings) and spills, 
quick response to potential environmental catastrophes such as oil fires. An overall improvement in 
housekeeping and waste management is likely to follow the specific renovations and repairs.  
No significant, long-term adverse impacts are anticipated from the investments to be supported at the 
port. The preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (pEIA) has identified potential adverse 
impacts and categorized them as minor, moderate, and major, based on magnitude, probability of 
occurrence, and sensitivity of receptor or affected area. A general mitigation plan (EMP) is included

in the assessment, and the impacts are re-rated assuming EMP implementation. The only major 
impact identified is conversion of land for dredge spoil disposal, and since the analysis of sediments 
in the harbor confirms that they are not hazardous and are thus suitable for disposal at sea, this major 
impact will be eliminated. However, the choice of a sea disposal site and technique must take into 
account the characteristics of the marine environment 
–
current, depth, presence of sensitive features 
such as coral reefs and sea grass beds, existence of shellfish beds, recreational uses and fisheries. In 
other words, a more detailed environmental assessment focusing on of an appropriate site needs to be 
prepared, subjected to stakeholder consultation, and disclosed.
