Negative\n            measures include: air pollution, noise pollution, water\n            pollution, solid waste generation, and impacts on flora and\n            fauna. Mitigation measures include:  (a) use of good quality\n            fuel and lubricants; (b) prevention of dust through\n            sprinkling during periods of dry season; (c) noise\n            prevention measures, such as mufflers, installed on vehicles\n            and equipment; (d) tanks for fuel storages should be leak\n            proof and installed in a bunded area, fuel storage tanks\n            shall be checked daily, and in case of leakage will be\n            replaced until repaired; (e) excavated soils should be\n            reused as much as possible as filling material, and\n            contaminated soil should be considered as waste material and\n            disposed of accordingly. Excess soil should be disposed off\n            at sites approved by the municipality; and (f) the\n            contractor should minimize the destruction of flora and\n            limit the working area to prevent unnecessary ecological damages."}, "docdt": "2008-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
