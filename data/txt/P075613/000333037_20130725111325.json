to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the overseas training and study\n            tours were delayed and not fully implemented because the\n            government had tightened the restriction on the overseas\n            travelling of government officials during project\n            implementation. More domestic training and study tours were\n            implemented instead. For future projects, the plan for\n            overseas training should be made taking into account the\n            government's policy and regulations. Currently in\n            China, the maintenance of rural roads maintenance is usually\n            insufficient, in terms of budget and capacity. The\n            governments are trying to increase the budget and improve\n            the performance. In future projects, the Bank may design\n            appropriate programs for improving the capacity of local\n            roads maintenance, including enhancing human resource\n            development; purchasing road inspection and maintenance\n            equipment, developing management information system, and\n            adopting advanced concepts and techniques. Road development\n            can only make available of the infrastructure available for\n            connectivity. Transport services can better use the\n            infrastructure as to provide low cost services to local\n            people, especially to low-income people. Future similar\n            roads project should incorporate a public transport service\n            component into the project formulation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
