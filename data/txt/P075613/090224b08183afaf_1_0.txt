                         Maoba in Shaanxi Province by: (i) enhancing road infrastructure capacity and network integration along the corridor Ankang-Maoba; (ii) increasing accessibility to
                         markets and social services for the lower-income families in rural areas of Ankang; and (iii) strengthening Shaanxi Provincial Communications Department's capacity in
                         managing the increasing number of kilometers of roads under its responsibility in the Shaanxi province and, in particular, within the Ankang region.

                         The overall implementation of the Project has remained satisfactory. The AME has been completed and under normal operation since May 31, 2011. All the LRIP roads have been
                         completed by this mission as the last three roads were substantially completed in August 2012. The overseas training and study tours are being implemented and expected to be
                         completed by the extended loan closing date December 31, 2012. The project development objective will be achieved based on the current implementation status.
