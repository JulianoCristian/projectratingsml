There are 3 components to the Project. Component A\n            is the Ankang-Maoba Expressway (AME). This component\n            includes the construction of an 87 km expressway connecting\n            Ankang and Maoba and includes the construction of the\n            relevant ancillary buildings and the acquisition of the\n            relevant electrical and mechanical (E&M) facilities. It\n            will also require the acquisition of land and the\n            resettlement of people. The design of the AME has paid\n            adequate consideration to road safety features and has\n            minimized the social and environmental impacts, based on the\n            analysis undertaken at the feasibility stage and further\n            adjustments required upon completion of the preliminary\n            engineering designs. A joint local-foreign consulting firm\n            will supervise the construction of the AME, in a manner\n            similar to the one implemented under the AME component o f\n            the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project. Component B\n            is the Local Roads Improvement Program (LRIP). The LRIP aims\n            at improving of interconnection between provincial, county\n            and village roads in the rural areas surrounding the\n            corridor Ankang - Maoba Expressway. The interventions will\n            consist of rehabilitation of existing roadways, with\n            adjustments to its width when necessary or upgrading\n            existing non-motorized tracks to motorized substandard\n            roadways when warranted by the number of beneficiaries and\n            due consideration to environmental impacts. Component C is\n            the Institutional Strengthening Program (ISP). The\n            institutional strengthening program includes: (a) evaluation\n            and monitoring studies to measure impacts of LRIP on the\n            socio-economic and transport conditions in Ankang City; (b)\n            acquire road-condition data collection equipment to\n            strengthen the information base of Shaanxi Provincial\n            Communications Department (SPCD); (c) technical assistance\n            in using the road-condition data collection equipment and\n            incorporating the information into the pavement management\n            system currently installed at SPCD; and (d) training for\n            staff from the SPCD and the Ankang Communications Bureau."}, "docdt": "2007-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
