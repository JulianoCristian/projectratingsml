                         Ankang to Maoba in Shaanxi Province by: (i) enhancing road infrastructure capacity and network integration along the corridor Ankang-Maoba; (ii) increasing
                         accessibility to markets and social services for the lower-income families in rural areas of Ankang; and (iii) strengthening Shaanxi Provincial Communications
                         Department's capacity in managing the increasing number of kilometers of roads under its responsibility in the Shaanxi province and, in particular, within the
                         Ankang region.
