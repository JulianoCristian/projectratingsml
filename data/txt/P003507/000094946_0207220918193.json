the institutional\n            development impact substantial. Lessons reinforce the\n            importance of following strict procurement guidelines, where\n            joint ventures with insufficient technical, and financial\n            capabilities should not be pre-qualified to bid. This factor\n            was exemplified in the involvement of the offshore\n            contractor, i.e., given its low capacity led to delays in\n            mobilizing equipment. Conversely, international consultants\n            fostered valuable inputs, such as design, construction\n            methods, costs, and quality control. Furthermore,\n            communication problems should be considered in designing\n            procurement packages, since problems surfaced between\n            Chinese, and foreign contractors/laborers, in terms of\n            language misunderstandings, and cultural conflicts. This is\n            conducive to a need for training methods that include the\n            secondment of trainees for substantial periods during\n            implementation, with modern management techniques, set at\n            the early stages of the project. Although resettlement\n            planning needs to be improved, China's institutional\n            framework facilitates resettlement issues, due to: good\n            policies, and incentives for resettlement as a development\n            opportunity; significant planning managed by local\n            authorities, through a participatory process, and, a\n            resettlement funding, levied from project-generated income."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
