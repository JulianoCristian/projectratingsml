Other Covenants
Section 3.01. China declares its commitment 
to the objectives of the Project as set forth in 
Schedule 2 to the IBRD Loan Agreement, and, to this 
end, without any limitation or restriction upon any 
of its other obligations under this Agreement or 
the IBRD Loan Agreement, shall cause EHDC to 
perform in accordance with the provisions of the 
Project Agreement all the obligations of EHDC 
therein set forth, shall take or cause to be taken 
all actions, including the provision of funds, 
facilities, services and other resources, necessary 
or appropriate to enable EHDC to perform such 
obligations, and shall not take or permit to be 
taken any action which would prevent or interfere 
with such performance.
Section 3.02.  The purpose of the Loan is to 
partly finance Eligible Expenditures under the 
Project.  For that purpose China shall: (a) upon 
receipt of the proceeds of the Loan, deposit the 
same into two special deposit accounts (in Dollars 
Page  6
and Deutschmarks) to be operated by China 
exclusively for the purposes of the Project; and 
(b) make available the proceeds of the Loan to EHDC 
for the purposes of the Project under onlending 
arrangements satisfactory to IBRD.  The Dollar and 
Deutschmark Special Deposit Accounts shall be 
opened with a bank and on terms and conditions 
satisfactory to IBRD, including appropriate 
protection against set-off, seizure or attachment.
Section 3.03. (a)  China shall disburse the 
proceeds of the Loan deposited in the Special 
Deposit Accounts only to the Project Beneficiary to 
meet Eligible Expenditures, as they are actually 
incurred (and which have not been financed out of 
the funds provided by IBRD under the IBRD Loan 
Agreement) in the manner agreed with IBRD.
(b)  For each payment made by China out of 
the Special Deposit Accounts, China shall, at such 
times as IBRD shall reasonably request, furnish to 
IBRD such documents and other evidence showing that 
such payment out of the proceeds of the Loan was 
made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
(c)  If IBRD shall have determined at any 
time that any payment out of the Special Deposit 
Account was not made on account of Eligible 
Expenditures or was not justified by the evidence 
furnished to IBRD, China shall, promptly upon 
notice from IBRD, deposit into such account out of 
which the payment was made (or, if China cannot or 
fails to do so, prepay to the Agent for the account 
of the Lenders in accordance with the terms of the 
Loan Agreement) an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible 
or justified.  Any such deposits made hereunder 
shall be utilized for the purpose indicated in 
Section 3.02 above.
(d)  If IBRD shall have determined at any 
time that any amount outstanding in the Special 
Deposit Accounts will not be required to cover 
further payments for Eligible Expenditures, the 
Borrower shall, upon notice from IBRD, prepay to 
the Agent for the account of the Lenders such 
outstanding amount in accordance with the terms of 
the Loan Agreement.
Section 3.04.  China shall ensure that: (a) 
the goods and consultants' services required for 
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Loan shall be purchased at a reasonable 
price, account being taken also of other relevant 
factors such as time of delivery and efficiency and 
reliability of the goods and availability of 
maintenance facilities and spare parts therefor, 
and, in the case of services, of their quality and 
competence of the parties rendering them; and (b) 
such goods and services shall be used exclusively 
in the carrying out of the Project.
Section 3.05.  China shall: (a) have the 
Special Deposit Accounts for each fiscal year of 
China audited, in accordance with appropriate 
auditing principles consistently applied, by 
independent auditors acceptable to IBRD; (b) 
Page  7
furnish to IBRD as soon as available, but in any 
case not later than six months after the end of 
each such year: (i) certified copies of the said 
accounts for such year as so audited, and (ii) the 
report of such audit by said auditors of such scope 
and in such detail as IBRD shall have reasonably 
requested; and (c) furnish to IBRD such other 
information concerning the said account, as well as 
the audit thereof, as IBRD shall from time to time 
reasonably request.
Section 3.06. IBRD and China hereby agree 
that the obligations set forth in Sections 9.04, 
9.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.08 and 9.09 of the General 
Conditions (relating to insurance, use of goods and 
services, plans and schedules, records and reports, 
maintenance and land acquisition, respectively) in 
respect of the Project shall be carried out by EHDC 
pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Project Agreement.
ARTICLE IV

or in part the right of China to make withdrawals
