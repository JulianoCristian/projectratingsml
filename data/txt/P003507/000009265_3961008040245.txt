MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND GUARANTEE
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN ERTAN II HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to China for the equivalent of $400 million, and a proposed guarantee
operation to support the equivalent of $150 million in commercial loans to help finance the
Ertan II Hydroelectric Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan
would be onlent to the Ertan Hydropower Development Company, Ltd. (EHDC) through
Sichuan Province on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, with EHDC bearing
the foreign exchange risk. The proceeds of the commercial loans under the guarantees
would be onlent to EHDC under the same terms and conditions as the commercial loans.
2.          Background. Expansion of the power supply and improvements in the
power industry's efficiency are essential to sustaining China's rapid economic growth,
mitigating adverse environmental impacts of energy development, and improving living
standards. China is steadily improving the efficiency of energy use through reliance upon
economic energy pricing and a well-developed institutional network for energy
conservation.  Consumer prices for the major forms of energy now largely reflect
economic costs. Electricity conservation is promoted through a comprehensive network
of specialized agencies at all levels, and electricity conservation investments are made
through a variety of programs coordinated with provincial power companies and industrial
consumers. Even with yet more dramatic success in conservation, however, generation
capacity must increase by at least 17,000 MW a year in order to avoid exacerbation of the
serious power shortages that already exist. The Government has adopted the strategy of
constructing large and cost-effective power plants to meet demand and accelerate the
replacement of obsolete and heavily polluting plants with more energy-efficient and
environmentally sustainable units.
3.          To continue the efficiency improvements and increase capital mobilization
necessary for further development of the power industry, China is now actively pursuing
an ambitious program of power sector reforms. Particular progress has been made in
sector decentralization, improvements in cost recovery through major tariff reforms, and
diversification of financing sources, including development of a variety of independent
power generation schemes. The pace and depth of the sector reforms have picked up
during 1993-94, and the Government's integrated agenda for action now includes:
(a) commercialization and corporatization of power companies, together with achievement
of greater enterprise autonomy, (b) further measures to rationalize power tariffs,
(c) realignment of the regulatory and legal framework, including the promulgation of a
National Electricity Law, and (d) active encouragement for diversification in financing for
power development, including private sector participation. Although consensus exists at
the national level on the basic directions of the program, the difficult task of implementing



- 2 -
the reform program at provincial and local levels throughout the country is just beginning.
While actions have been initiated on all of the above fronts, measures to commercialize the
power entities are now a focal point in the overall effort.  These measures include
separating the producing entities from the Government, granting them autonomy in
business decision-making, and subjecting them to market forces in an arms-length
regulatory framework.
4.          In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in
China places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last
two years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector work
on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing further resources to meet
the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector work).  The study
(Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector report (China Power
Sector Reform: Towards Competition and Improved Performance, 1994) provide vehicles
for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese institutions. The energy conservation support
program includes technical assistance through the Global Environment Facility (GEF),
lending support in selected industrial projects, environment and energy, and development
of a series of new GEF investment operations. The power sector lending program now
focuses on assistance for the detailed aspects of implementation of the power sector
reforms, primarily in the less-advanced inland provinces, as well as reducing the power
shortages that continue to hamper development and slow the market orientation of the
sector.
5.          Sichuan Province, where the proposed project is located, is one of the less
developed provinces in China. Implementation of power sector reforms also lags behind
that in more advanced provinces where the Bank has been active in supporting reforms
through lending operations.  The process of restructuring the power industry of the
province from management by a government department to management by suitably
autonomous power companies is just beginning. Recent years have brought substantial
progress in power price reform, but in this area as well, Sichuan also lags behind other
provinces.
6.          Project Objectives. The main objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) alleviate an acute shortage of electricity in a least-cost manner by completing the
construction of the ongoing Ertan hydroelectric project; (b) assist in implementing power
subsector reforms in Sichuan Province, through development of the beneficiary as an
autonomous, commercially oriented entity; (c) promote competition at the generation level
through establishment of market-oriented commercial arrangements between power
generation and marketing entities; (d) encourage alternative financing strategies for power
development; (e) establish management and accounting systems to enable the Beneficiary
to operate efficiently in a commercial environment; (f) transfer modern technologies and
environmental and resettlement management practices for hydroelectric power plants; and
(g) upgrade management and operation capabilities through well-focused staff training
programs.



7.          Project Description. The proposed project would comprise completion of
the construction of the Ertan hydroelectric development and power sector reform, technical
assistance, and training components to ensure the smooth transition of EHDC from a
construction-focused company to the most important independent power producer of the
province. The Ertan project, appraised in 1991 and supported by Bank Loan 3387-CHA,
includes the construction of a 240 m high dam and an underground powerhouse complex
with an installed capacity of 3,300 MW, resettlement of about 35,000 people, an
environmental management program, consulting services, studies, and training. There are
virtually no changes in the technical scope covered by the first project and the proposed
project. The power sector reforn component of the proposed project consists of a time-
bound Reform Implementation Plan that includes: (a) revision of EHDC's charter to
incorporate it as a limited-liability company, in accordance with China's new Company
Law; (b) organizational restructuring and establishment of accounting and management
systems; and (c) finalizing contractual arrangements for sale of power and energy
generated by the Ertan power plant to protect EHDC's commercial interests and ensure
economic and efficient dispatch. The technical assistance and training components are
designed to assist EHDC to: carry out its Reform Implementation Plan and prepare it for
future operations; design and manage the construction of the Ertan development; and
implement the Environmental Management Program (EMP).
8.          Project Costs and Financing. The Executive Directors approved the first
loan for the Ertan Hydroelectric Project in July 1991. The loan amount of $380 million,
requested by the Governrnent, was relatively low in comparison to the estimated foreign
costs of $1,155 million at that time. The first loan was earmarked for financing of the first
five years of construction, and in consideration of the size of this project with a nine-year
construction period, it was understood that the Bank would consider a request for a second
loan for the remaining period of the project. Nevertheless, the Government has agreed to
provide financing for the entire project, irrespective of the Bank's provision of a second
loan. The total financing requirements for the proposed project, excluding interest during
construction (IDC), are estimated at $2,200.2 million equivalent. A second Bank loan of
$400 million and commercial financing of $150 million supported by Bank guarantees are
proposed to cover the remaining foreign exchange costs, excluding IDC. Retroactive
financing, totaling $30 million, would be provided for expenditures incurred before loan
signing for expenditures on ongoing contracts which were commenced under the first loan
to avoid disruption of the construction work. Detailed cash flow forecasts, provided by
the Beneficiary, indicate that the first loan (Loan 3387-CHA) is expected to be fully
disbursed by June 30, 1995 and that anticipated contractual payments between July 1, 1995
and the expected date of signing of the proposed loan (around the end of September 1995)
amount to about $30 million. Financing of local costs would come both in the form of
loans and equity contribution. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.
9.          The Proposed Guarantees. Following the endorsement of the Guarantee
Review Committee of the proposed guarantee operation for the Ertan II Hydroelectric
Project in May 1995, the Bank and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) determined the detailed
financing framework for the guarantee operation. The borrower of the Bank-guaranteed
financing would be the People's Republic of China represented by the MOF and the
proceeds would be onlent to the beneficiary, EHDC. The financing would consist of a



- 4 -
$100 million Eurodollar syndicated loan (the Dollar Loan) and a $50 million equivalent
Euro Deutsche Mark syndicated loan (the DM Loan), both from commercial banks. These
would match revenue flows in renminbi to meet civil work contract payments in DM over
time. Both the Dollar Loan and the DM Loan would be on a floating interest rate basis.
The maturity of both loans would be 15 years, with a 5-year grace period and semiannual
equal installments of the principal thereafter.  The summary terms are as shown in
Annex 1.
10.         It is proposed that the Bank guarantees would be in the form of partial credit
guarantees to cover the principal amount outstanding on and after 12 years, on an
accelerable basis on and after that point. The nominal amount of the guarantee at the
maximum would be approximately $50 million, or 33 percent of the total financing
mobilized by the guarantees. The Bank's exposure under the guarantee represented by the
present value of the guarantees would be approximately $20 million initially, or 14 percent
of the total loan amount, calculated at a discount rate for the respective currencies. Two
options would be included in the proposed guaranteed loans to allow a further reduction
in the Bank's exposure under the guarantees: the borrower would have prepayment options
and the lender would have guarantee release options, canceling both the loan and the
guarantee. Since the borrower would be the government of the People's Republic of China
itself, the Bank would charge a net guarantee fee of 0.25 percent per year of the Bank's
exposure. This is the same arrangement as the previous Bank-guaranteed financing for
China for the Zhejiang Power Development Project approved by the Board in February
1995.
11.         MOF conducted competitive bidding for the financing in June 1995 and
awarded a conditional mandate to an underwriting group of 14 commercial banks consisting
of: the Asahi Bank, Bank of America NT&SA, Daiwa Overseas Finance, the Fuji Bank,
the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Korea Development Bank, the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan. the Mitsubishi Trust & Banking, the Sakura Bank, Sanwa International Finance,
the Sumitomo Bank, Sumitomo Trust & Banking, the Tokai Bank, and the Zenshinren
Bank. The mandate is for both the Dollar Loan and DM Loan as one package and on a
fully committed and underwritten basis, subject to the approval of the Board of Executive
Directors of the World Bank and the conclusion of documentation satisfactory to MOF, the
Bank and the lenders. The mandated financial institutions have agreed in principle that the
legal terms and conditions of the loan and the guarantee will need to comply with the
policy and legal requirements for the Bank's guarantee.  Consents under the Bank's
Articles will be obtained from member countries for the currencies and markets involved
in the financing.
12.         The mandated pricing for both loans is an interest rate of six-month
LIBOR+0.3 percent per year and an up-front management fee of 0.5 percent (i.e., an all-
in cost of LIBOR+0.35 percent on a simple yield basis). This is very favorable pricing
for loans with a final maturity of 15 years, well below the average pricing of commercial
bank borrowing (about LIBOR+0.5-0.6 percent all-in) by Chinese sovereign entities for
a much shorter maturity of 5 to 7 years. The Ertan financing represents the Bank's third
guarantee operation for China.  The mandated pricing is an improvement over the
attractive pricing achieved for the previous Bank-guaranteed commercial bank borrowing
by China for the Yangzhou Thermal Power Project closed in May 1994 (LIBOR+0.475



percent all-in); and for the Zhejiang Power Development Project closed in March 1995
(LIBOR+0.4 percent all-in). The very low cost was achieved despite a reduction of the
Bank's guarantee coverage from China's previous transactions.
13.          Project Implementation. EHDC is responsible for implementation of the
project and has created a specialized construction unit to manage project implementation.
Assistance in engineering, procurement and construction management is being provided by
foreign engineering consultants. Review functions are undertaken by three expert panels.
one each for technical aspects, resolution of disputes in the civil contracts, and
environment and resettlement matters. Construction of the Ertan hydroelectric plant is
progressing satisfactorily, on schedule and within budget. Procurement of the works and
goods has been virtually completed in the first phase of the project. The two main civil
contracts were awarded to well-qualified foreign/local joint ventures. The main contract
for generating equipment was awarded to an experienced foreign supplier who is
subcontracting a substantial proportion of the work to local manufacturers. Schedule B
shows procurement arrangements and the disbursement schedule. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 14072-CHA dated July 7, 1995, is being distributed separately.
14.          Project Sustainability. The institutional and financial sustainability of the
project will be secured by EHDC's Reform Implementation Plan, which provides for its
incorporation as an autonomous limited-liability company (completed), organizational
restructuring, setting up of accounting and management systems, and a power sales
agreement for the sale of power from the Ertan plant. The principles of the power sales
agreement, which ensure EHDC's financial viability, and economic dispatch of power
produced have been agreed.  The projected funds flow  statement is provided in
Schedule E.
15.          Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. Project Completion Reports
(Report 12549) has been completed for the Lubuge Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2382-
CHA) and the Yantan Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2707-CHA).   The Shuikou
Hydroelectric Project (Loans 2775-CHA and 3515-CHA) is also nearing completion.
Lessons learned from these projects informed the preparation of the first Ertan project, and
are largely responsible for its successful execution to date. For example, weaknesses in
the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process for civil works, particularly in regard
to prequalification of foreign/local joint ventures, were corrected; as a result, strong joint
ventures  have  been  employed  for  Ertan.    Similarly,  the  ICB  process  for
mechanical/electrical equipment has been adjusted to ensure that, in all cases, a technically
and financially qualified manufacturer takes full responsibility for supply.  Local
procurement in previous projects has generally achieved its objectives of not adversely
affecting the project in terms of cost, quality and completion time. Exceptions have been
taken into account in the current project, in that high voltage (500 kV) transformers are
now internationally procured (as quality of the Chinese supply is still variable). The
Chinese also learned from the earlier projects the value of experienced foreign consultants
and expert review panels and, for the Ertan project, authorities have reinforced the
experienced local organizations with the best expertise available internationally.



- 6 -
16.         In some projects, executing entities were slow  to start institutional
development studies. Therefore, in the proposed project, procurement of consultants for
the organization and management study has already commenced, and the supervision plan
includes appropriate specialists to ensure that these studies achieve their objectives.
17.          Other lessons emerge from earlier reservoir resettlement projects in China:
the need to allow for inflation in resettlement budgeting, the need for flexibility in
resettlement planning to accommodate the preferences of affected persons, and the need
for independent monitoring. All of these aspects have been taken into account in the
proposed project.
18.          Performance in environmental aspects of previous Bank-financed Chinese
hydroelectric projects has been satisfactory, particularly measured against the standards
applying at the time of their approval. During recent years, environmental awareness has
improved in China and authorities have given more emphasis to the environmental
assessment during preparation of the first Ertan project, and to upgrading of monitoring
and mitigation plans during preparation of the current project.
19.          Bankwide experience has shown that the main reasons for ineffective
environmental management and monitoring in all types of environmentally significant
projects are: (a) the lack of a well-designed and specific EMP that is included in Bank
documentation and disseminated among and understood by relevant staff of the
implementing agency; (b) failure to specify persons within the implementation unit to be
responsible for plan implementation; (c) inadequate provision of counterpart funds; and,
(d) failure to feed the results of environmental monitoring back into the management
program.  Potential problems (a) and (b) have been directly addressed in project
preparation. Problem (c) has been a shortcoming in China in the past, but experience in
recent years, particularly on large dam developments such as Ertan and Xiaolangdi, has
been very encouraging. Reason (d) will be addressed through periodic reviews by an
Environmental Resettlement Panel (ERP) and by regular inclusion of environmental
specialists in Bank supervision missions.
20.         In power sector restructuring and reform  implementation, international
experience shows that even in countries with strong legal systems and open economies, the
time needed to build consensus on the reform directions, establish a new regulatory
framework, and implement structural changes can be very long. In the United Kingdom,
the pioneer country in implementing power sector reforms, it took: (a) about 10 years for
a government strongly committed to divesting and "demonopolizing" the utility sectors to
build consensus and put out the "White Paper" that laid out the reform options; (b) two
more years to draft the law and the licenses; and (c) another two years (for about 1,000
full-time specialists) to design the mechanisms to introduce competition. Currently, only
large customers can choose their supplier and full choice for customers has been delayed
until 1998. In the United States, where the power industry is mostly private, significant
development of the independent power business began to take place more than 10 years
after the enactment of the basic legal framework-which was intended to encourage
cogeneration and alternative generation technology, not the business of independent
merchant generation using medium- to large-scale conventional technologies. The first
important structural change, under discussion in California, is planned to go into effect



- 7 -
after 1996. In Central and Eastern European countries, hopes for achieving quick progress
in economic regulation in all sectors have not materialized because of perceived
weaknesses in their legal systems and the lack of interest of governments in attracting
large-scale private investments because of overcapacities and slow growth of demand.
Considering China's 40-year history of a command and control economy, the progress
achieved during the last decade and especially during the early 1990s clearly indicates the
government's commitment to reform and to increasing the credibility of its macroeconomic
policies, but the process will take time and require tremendous efforts as the country is
learning by doing as well as from the experiences of other countries. As experience in
Central and Eastern Europe shows, the pursuit of transparency and accountability of energy
and other utilities is the best way to achieve progress in economic regulation. Along the
same lines, the Bank's two-pronged power assistance program in China focuses on
(a) policy dialogue at the central government level to clarify the concepts of, and stress the
need for, economic regulation and an adequate legal framework through technical
assistance activities; and (b) requirement and implementation of adequate and reliable
accounting and financial systems, proper methods for financial control of state-owned
enterprises, encouragement of diversification of ownership, and adequate and binding
contractual arrangements to increase transparency and accountability through lending
projects.
21.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China presented to the Board on June 1, 1995.
For the power sector, the CAS identified six focal points for Bank assistance:
(a) commercialization and corporatization of operating companies and enterprises;
(b) realignment of regulatory and legal frameworks; (c) introduction of competition and
transparency; (d) ensurance of adequate tariff policies; (e) development of new sources and
methods of financing; and (f) transfer of new technology and modern operational and
environmental techniques. The proposed project supports the Bank strategy in most of the
above areas.   Commercialization and corporatization  are achieved  through  the
incorporation of EHDC as a limited-liability company, and through its Reform
Implementation Plan. Competition, transparency and tariff reform are promoted through
the establishment of EHDC as an independent power producer with a fully commercial
power sales agreement with Sichuan Electric Power Company (SEPC), which ensures an
economic tariff level and structure. Financing diversification is supported through the use
of the Bank-guaranteed commercial cofinancing. The power sector and tariff reform
measures of the proposed project complement those agreed to be implemented as part of
the recently approved Sichuan Power Transmission Project (Loan 3848-CHA). The latter
project targeted reform of the overall power sector in Sichuan, and particularly SEPC. It
provided for: (a) studies to define the optimum structure of the power sector in Sichuan
Province; (b) implementation of a package of province-wide tariff reforms, that would
more than double the power sale price by the year 2000 and improve tariff structure to
adequately reflect costs of supply; and (c) separation of government functions from, and
incorporation of, SEPC. Taken together, the two projects provide for comprehensive
power sector reform at the provincial level.
22.          Agreed Actions. Assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it will:
(a) ensure that SEPC enters into a power sales contract with EHDC by June 30, 1997; (b)
ensure that resettlement under the project is carried out in accordance with an agreed



- 8 -
resettlement program; and (c) onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan through
Sichuan to EHDC on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
23.          To ensure adequate and quantifiable monitoring of the project's progress,
assurances were obtained from EHDC that it will: (a) furnish the Bank with audited project
accounts, statements of expenditures, and financial statements within six months of the end
of each fiscal year; (b) take all measures required on its part to enter into the power sales
contract with SEPC; (c) continue to employ its Special Board of Consultants and
Environmental and Resettlement Panel; (d) implement organizational improvements, and
the development of improved accounting and financial management systems; (e) carry out
a management development and training program; (f) carry out an environmental
management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (g) carry out resettlement of
affected persons in accordance with a resettlement plan acceptable to the Bank; (h) prepare
annual reports integrating the results of monitoring activities carried out in the previous
year; (i) take all necessary measures to ensure that it meets its financial performance
targets (rate of return on average net revalued fixed assets in operation of 12 percent in
1999 and 15 percent thereafter, debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 times in 1999, and 1.5
times thereafter, and debt/equity ratio of no more than 85/15 in 1995-97, 80/20 in 1998-
2000, and 70/30 thereafter); and (j) furnish to the Bank, by April 30 of each year, a rolling
eight-year financial plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and
uses of funds, and balance sheets.
24.          Environmental Aspects.  The project is classified as Category A for
purposes of environmental review. An Environmental Assessment Report (EAR) and
summary for the Ertan Development. prepared by the Beneficiary with the assistance of
international consultants, were both updated in February 1995.  With respect to
biodiversity, the main impact arises due to inundation of land and water resources by the
reservoir. The reservoir will be 140 km long, with a remarkably low average width of
about 550 m. The biodiversity impacts will be registered on terrestrial ecosystems, due
to inundation, and on aquatic systems, due to the conversion of a riverine environment to
a lacustrine environment. Most of the terrestrial vegetation to be inundated is of neither
conservation nor economic value. The total area of forest to be inundated is about 3,000
ha, of which 2,000 ha is regularly harvested fuelwood forest and the remaining 1,000 ha
consists of scattered remnants of broadleaf evergreen forest of the type that once used to
dominate the area. To compensate for losses, the EMP provides that EHDC will assume
management responsibility for a 100 m (vertical elevation) buffer zone above the maximum
operational water surface elevation along the entire periphery of the reservoir and
implement active management plans for the preservation and enhancement of remnant
tracts of native broadleaf forest. Regarding fish and other aquatic organisms, potential
impacts arise due to the conversion of 140 km of riverine habitat into a lake-like habitat
and the physical barrier to migratory fish posed by the dam. The latter is of limited
significance since none of the identified species is migratory. Species requiring high-
velocity flow conditions and feeding primarily on bottom-dwelling organisms will not
survive in the reservoir area although they will be replaced either naturally, or through
stocking programs, by other, better adapted species. Public health is another important
consideration. Malaria was eradicated in the area in 1991 and special precautions are
being financed under the project to ensure that this situation is maintained.
Schistosomiasis was also eradicated by the late 1980s, but the EMP includes several



specific subcomponents directed at eliminating any residual risks. In addition, the World
Health Organization's Chief of Schistosomiasis. who accompanied the Bank mission to the
area, is a member of the Environment and Resettlement Panel.
25.          Resettlement.   The Ertan development requires the resettlement of
approximately 35,000 people living in 31 villages (24,000 rural people) and one town
(11,000 urban people) in five counties of Sichuan Province. The 101 km2. 140 km long
reservoir transverses a steep, sparsely populated mountain valley. No Yi national ethnic
minority people will be displaced by the project, since they occupy higher-altitude slopes
of the valley. Those affected by the project are from the Chinese majority people who
occupy the lower-altitude alluvial soils along the banks of the Yalong River and its
tributaries. The Resettlement Plan agreed with the Bank for the first phase of the Ertan
project based on 1984 census data has been updated through a 1992 census conducted by
resettlement officials when the physical survey and demarcation of the reservoir boundary
was completed. Approximately 5,500 rural people were resettled in the first phase to
higher elevations in their own villages or to newly reclaimed agricultural lands in new
irrigation zones.  Lessons learned during that operation such as the need for timely
compensation, extensive community participation, and adequate recordkeeping, have been
incorporated into the revised Resettlement Plan.  A notable feature of the ongoing
resettlement process is the extensive involvement of the affected population and of
community leaders in both planning and implementation.  Also, the real value of
compensation has been maintained through adjustments to offset the effects of inflation.
The revised Resettlement Plan meets all requirements of the Bank's resettlement policy
guidelines.
26.          Project Benefits.  This large power project will greatly increase the
critically needed power generation and transmission capability of Sichuan Province and the
Southwest China power grid as a whole. According to comprehensive analyses, the project
is clearly part of the least-cost development program of the Sichuan Province power system
for meeting future power supply needs. The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is
estimated at about 16 percent. Other intangible benefits are also important, such as
institutional development, improved power grid operation, and the favorable influence on
society at large by relieving hardships caused by the acute power supply shortages.
27.          The IERR of the project was estimated, in the base case, using the economic
costs of the project and associated transmission lines to the main load centers, and the
average price paid by the final consumers for electricity purchased from nonutility
producers in 1994 as a minimum proxy for the economic value of electricity. If only the
incremental costs are taken into account, the IERR would increase to 23 percent.
28.          The IERR would be reduced by 1 percent in the case of a cost overrun of
15 percent, and by 2 percent if the commissioning of the power plant were delayed by one
year. The IERR would be equal to the 12 percent discount rate if:
(a)   the full cost of the project (including sunk costs) is taken into account, and
(i) the project were to experience total cost overruns of 70 percent; (ii) the
commissioning of the first unit were delayed three years; and (iii) the plant



- 10 -
output were to be reduced by 30 percent or sold at 26 fen/kWh, 30 percent
lower than the base case economic price;
(b)   only incremental investment costs are considered and (i) the project were to
experience incremental cost overruns of 200 percent; (ii) the commissioning
of the first unit were delayed six years; and (iii) the plant output were
reduced by 50 percent or sold at 18 fen/kWh, 50 percent lower than the
base economic price.
29.          Risks. The main risks generally associated with hydroelectric projects are
related to potential cost and schedule overruns due to geological and hydrological
uncertainties, and contractor and construction supervision inadequacies. For the current
project, foundations and all riverbed work are completed, cofferdams are designed to
survive overtopping, dam concreting has commenced, underground works are at an
advanced stage and the first generating unit is on schedule for commissioning in July 1998.
The risk of major cost or time overruns due to implementation problems is thus very low.
30.          Design quality has been assured by the reinforcement of the very
experienced design institute with foreign consultants, and through the periodic reviews by
a consultant panel composed of world-renowned Chinese and foreign experts. Construction
quality is assured by the award of civil works contracts to very well qualified foreign/local
joint ventures. Risks associated with the quality of the generating equipment have been
minimized by the employment of well-qualified foreign manufacturers for all key
equipment, and strict pre- or post-qualification criteria in all other cases. Guarantees are
also backed up with performance bonds.
31.          There is a risk of delay due to nonavailability of local funds (mainly from
provincial sources). This is a generic problem in China in the current macroeconomic
environment. Therefore, this issue was examined in detail by Bank staff at appraisal, and
has also been given increased emphasis by national authorities in their project approval
process.  EHDC was able to demonstrate that, to date, funds availability has not
constrained project execution, and because of the high priority of the project, such
constraint is unlikely in the future.
32.          The most critical risk regarding environmental management would be failure
to implement the public health management components. However, all of the management
and control measures, in general, are standard practice on large infrastructure development
projects in China, and the record on recent projects has been very good. The risk that the
resettlement plan will not achieve its objectives appears to be small, given the advanced
stage of the process and the demonstrated responsiveness of the responsible authorities to
views of the affected people. An independent monitoring program also mitigates that risk.
33.          The market risk relating to power sales is minimal, given current power
shortages, the continuation of strong demand growth, and the projected low price of the
power in comparison to alternative sources. Nevertheless, risks have been further reduced
by obtaining the assurances of the Government, the owner of the SEPC, on the principles
of the power sales agreement.  These have been elaborated in a memorandum  of
understanding, between SEPC and EHDC. Elimination of market risk, and the explicit



- 11 -
inclusion of financial performance targets in the principles of the power sales agreement,
also ensure that financial risks are low.
34.         Bank experience in other major hydroelectric projects is that, in the Chinese
context, operation and maintenance risks are relatively low. Operation and maintenance
procedures are institutionalized, very experienced staff are selected for key positions, and
training of other staff is commenced long before commissioning. For the proposed project,
these procedures have been reinforced through Bank support to training programs, and
covenants relating to inspection and maintenance procedures. Economic risks are judged
to be minimal.
35.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it, with retroactive financing in an aggregate amount not exceeding $30 million
equivalent. I also recommend that the Executive Directors approve the provision of the
partial credit guarantees for the proposed $150 million equivalent syndicated commercial
loans to the People's Republic of China. The terms and conditions of the guarantees will
be determined by either the President, the Vice President for East Asia and the Pacific, or
the Vice President, Cofinancing and Advisory Services and the Executive Directors will
be informed accordingly. If there is any substantial change in the terms and conditions of
the guarantees as described in this Memorandum, the approval of the Executive Directors
will be sought.
