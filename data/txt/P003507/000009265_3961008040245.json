        of acute power shortages in Sichuan in a least-cost manner\n            through the completion of the Ertan Hydroelectric Scheme; 2)\n            further institutional development of Ertan Hydropower\n            Development Company (EHDC) as an autonomous, financialy\n            sound and commercially-oriented entity; 3) promotion of\n            competition through the development of market-oriented\n            commercial arrangements for the sale of power generated\n            under the project; 4) diversification of financing\n            strategies for power development; and 5) transfer of modern\n            technology for hydroelectric power plants. The project will\n            cover continuing work on all of the components of the\n            previous Ertan Hydroelectric Power Project and an expanded\n            resettlement program for about another 5,000 persons. The\n            project will also include technical assistance for policy\n            support and project implementation support."}, "docdt": "1995-07-11T00:00:00Z"}
