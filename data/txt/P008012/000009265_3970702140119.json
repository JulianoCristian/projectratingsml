Second Power Engineering Project is\n            designed to support the process of regionalization by which\n            nine regional utilities have been established to be in\n            charge of all local electricity services.  This process will\n            improve the efficiency of the electricity services by making\n            them more responsive to local needs.  The project consists\n            of:  (i) studies to improve the organization, performance\n            and operations of the regional utilities; (ii) studies to\n            identify the causes of high system losses and poor\n            reliability and to propose measures for system\n            rehabilitation; (iii) distribution planning studies; and\n            (iv) a study to develop performance indicators and\n            performance targets and to identify the measures needed to\n            achieve such targets.  The project will also provide; (v)\n            consultant services to review the current tariff structure\n            and make recommendations for the implementation of the\n            necessary adjustments; (vi) studies to bring regional\n            generation projects to feasibility level; and (vii)\n            purchase, and where applicable, installation of\n            microcomputers and accessories, equipment for\n            communications, high priority system components and parts,\n            and maintenance and laboratory equipment."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
