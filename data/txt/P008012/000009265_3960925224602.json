Shortly after Loan\n            approval, there was a change in Administration. The new\n            Government decided to review all commitments of the previous\n            Government, thereby deferring Loan signing. By 1986, the\n            deteriorating creditworthiness of Peru became an issue,\n            making the Bank reluctant to sign the Loan. However, as the\n            project was not a priority of the new Government that took\n            office on July 28, 1985, the Borrower and the Bank agreed to\n            the withdrawal of the Loan in November 1986. The main lesson\n            learned from the preparation and appraisal of this project\n            is the importance of more careful assessment of the risks\n            associated with preparing a project at the end of an\n            Administration, due to the inability to ensure continued\n            political support (the Bank should have been particularly\n            cautious because of the broad policy changes expected from\n            the likely winner). The Bank might have waited for the\n            regionalization reforms to be consolidated by the next\n            administration, before embarking on an ambitious engineering\n            and technical assistance loan in the sector."}, "docdt": "1992-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
