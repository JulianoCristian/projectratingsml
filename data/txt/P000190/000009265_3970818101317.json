proposed Credit would finance the\n            second phase of a long term afforestation program and assist\n            the Government in establishing long term production and\n            marketing policies for the sub-sector.  The main project\n            objectives are:  (i) to help meet the rapidly growing demand\n            for wood; (ii) to reduce Burundi's need for imports of\n            timber, timber substitutes and fuel; (iii) to contribute to\n            protecting the natural environment; and (iv) to promote\n            greater integration of cropping, forestry and livestock\n            activities at the farm level.  Ninety rural nurseries\n            (including about 30 new ones) would produce plants for sale\n            to the population.  Agroforestry would be promoted to\n            address the rural population's needs for wood, fodder,\n            shade and soil improvement. Pilot actions would be\n            undertaken in a few plantation areas to integrate\n            afforestation with livestock and agricultural improvement\n            activities.  About 3500 ha of eucalyptus and 1500 ha of pine\n            plantations would be established in Western Burundi.  In\n            addition 2000 ha of woodlots would be established in\n            communes all over the country."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
