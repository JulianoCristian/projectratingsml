Resources Project for Croatia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: creating an\n            enabling regulatory framework for Renewable Energy (RE)\n            investments is challenging, complex, and time-consuming even\n            when the government is fully committed to the task. Support\n            to RE development therefore needs to be sequenced carefully\n            with well-defined milestones to be reached before moving\n            into pre-investment and investment support stages. An\n            enabling regulatory framework with clear financial\n            incentives such as the introduction of guaranteed\n            preferential prices (feed-in-tariffs) for RE is a key\n            prerequisite for creating investor interest in RE projects\n            and without it other activities to stimulate an RE market\n            will have limited impact. This means that a pipeline of\n            projects will only be credible once such a framework is in\n            place. Once an enabling regulatory framework is in place,\n            investors are prepared to borrow funds on a contingent loan\n            basis for pre-investment activities such as feasibility\n            studies (including site-specific resource assessments,\n            environmental impact studies, due diligence and legal\n            documentation) and a contingent loan (to be forgiven if\n            project does not reach financial closure) can be a key risk\n            mitigation device for small, local developers. A centralized\n            registry of potential renewable energy projects, such as the\n            one built and maintained by Ministry of Economy, Labour and\n            Entrepreneurship (MoELE), is a valuable tool in managing\n            information useful to investors in a transparent way. It has\n            created a large number of applications that form the basis\n            for a solid pipeline of projects that can enable the country\n            to reach its RE targets."}, "docdt": "2010-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
