7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The objective of the proposed project is to help develop an economically and environmentally sustainable 
market for renewable energy resources in Croatia. Development of this market will support Croatia in its 
EU accession efforts.  In addition, the project will help make Croatia?s economy less reliant on imported 
electricity and fossil fuels, reduce overall emissions, lead to a higher degree of local equipment 
manufacturing, and create an attractive climate for private investment in renewable energy, and generate 
local industry and employment. The project will in principle deal with both the production of electricity 
and heat from RER. However, most of the emphasis will be on electricity production (from wind farms and 
biomass fired cogeneration plants).
