Under the level two\n            restructuring, no changes are proposed to the project's\n            development objectives, outcomes, design, or scope. The\n            restructuring proposes only an extension of the grant's\n            closing date to enable signing of already prepared contracts\n            under component one (contingent loan facility) and related\n            disbursements under component two (contingent loan\n            facility). Currently, 45.66 percent of the grant has been\n            disbursed, and with a two-month extension of the project\n            closing date the final disbursement is expected to reach 65\n            percent. The remaining undisbursed funds will be canceled.\n            One of the main reasons why the project will not reach full\n            disbursement is related to delays during the project's\n            initial stages due to the late adoption of secondary\n            legislation that established feed-in tariffs for renewable\n            energy, licensing, and permit procedures--a prerequisite for\n            the launch of the project's second component and an\n            important precondition for the development of a renewable\n            energy market. The legislation was finally adopted in July 2007."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
