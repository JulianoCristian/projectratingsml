                                  Proposed Changes

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

Under the proposed Level Two restructuring, no changes are proposed to the project's
development objectives, outcomes, design or scope. The restructuring proposes only an
extension of the Grant's Closing Date to enable signing of already prepared contracts
under Component 1 (Contingent Loan Facility) and related disbursements under
Component 2 (Contingent Loan Facility).

b. What are the other complementary changes, as applicable:

Institutional arrangements                                ___Yes    __X_No
If, yes, please explain:


Financing mechanism/Conduit                               ___Yes    __X_No
If, yes, please explain:


Outputs                                                   ___Yes    __X_No
If, yes, please explain:


Project Costs and financing plan (include summary tables) ___Yes   __X_No

If, yes, please explain:


Procurement                                               __X_Yes     ___No
If, yes, please explain:

The procurement plan will be extended to support completion of TA activities under
Components 1 and 2 of the Project

Closing date                                              __X_Yes     ___No

                                           5
If, yes, please explain:

A two-month extension of the Closing Date is proposed. The Ministry of Finance
requested this extension in a letter dated March 29, 2010 to enable signing of already
prepared contracts under the Contingent Loan Facility and related disbursements. This
will be the first Closing Date extension.

Currently, 45.66% of the Grant has been disbursed, and with a two-month extension of
the project Closing Date the final disbursement is expected to reach 65%. The remaining
undisbursed funds will be canceled. One of the main reasons why the project will not
reach full disbursement is related to delays during the project's initial stages due to the
late adoption of secondary legislation that established feed-in tariffs for renewable
energy, licensing and permit procedures--a prerequisite for the launch of the project's
second component and an important precondition for the development of a renewable
energy market. The legislation was finally adopted in July 2007.


Implementation schedule                                     __X_Yes     ___No
If, yes, please explain:

The implementation schedule will be adjusted to take advantage of the extra two months
to finalize ongoing TA activities.

Economic and financial analysis                    ___Yes    __X_No
If, yes, please explain:

Technical                                           ___Yes    __X_No
If, yes, please explain:
