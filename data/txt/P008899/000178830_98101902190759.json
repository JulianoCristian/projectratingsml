Urban Development Project\n            consists of consultant services for: (a) the preparation of\n            an integrated urban development program for Istanbul; (b)\n            development of institutions and improvement of regulations\n            and policies to enable the institutions to coordinate and\n            implement the program; (c) the preparation of high priority\n            investment projects; and (d) the preparation of an urban\n            transport/land use model to provide a basis for future\n            investment decision making. The projects to be prepared\n            under (c) will include (i) a project to provide basic\n            infrastructure for existing squatter settlements and future\n            low cost residential areas, (ii) an urban cluster to form\n            the nucleus for planned urban expansion along the proposed\n            Istanbul-Izmit Highway, (iii) a wholesale market relocation\n            project to relieve congestion in the center of the city and\n            to improve the efficiency of operations in the market, (iv)\n            a wastewater disposal project, and (v) a traffic engineering\n            and control project to improve at low cost the use of the\n            existing urban transport system. In addition, the project\n            provides for fellowships and seminars to train Turkish staff\n            in the above fields and the necessary equipment to carry out\n            the studies. The Istanbul Water Supply Project will provide\n            assistance in the preparation of an integrated program\n            designed to meet the urban development needs of the Istanbul\n            Metropolitan Area. It will include the preparation of\n            priority projects: (a) a project to provide basic urban\n            infrastructure for existing squatter settlements and future\n            low-cost residential areas, (b) an urban cluster to form the\n            nucleus for planned urban expansion along the proposed\n            Istanbul-Izmit Highway, (c) a wholesale market relocation\n            project to relieve congestion in the central city and to\n            improve market efficiency, (d) a wastewater disposal\n            project, (e) a traffic engineering and control project to\n            improve at low cost the use of the existing urban transport\n            system, and (f) an urban transport/land use model to be used\n            by Turkish authorities in future years as an investment\n            decision making tool. The preparation of the project has\n            been coordinated with a project to alleviate the existing\n            water supply need of Istanbul."}, "docdt": "1972-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
