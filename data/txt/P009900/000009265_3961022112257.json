The physical\n            objectives of the project were to increase TEC's peak\n            generating capacity, reduce its dependence on the\n            Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for power to\n            serve its consumers, reduce the average cost of generation\n            in increasing the capacity utilization of TEC's\n            existing thermal power plant at Trombay, mitigate the\n            Sulphur dioxide emissions (SO2) from the coal and oil\n            burning Trombay Unit 5, and improve system reliability and\n            quality of supply in the Bombay area. The institutional and\n            sectoral objectives were to: (i) support increased private\n            sector participation in the supply of power; and (ii)\n            encourage improved tariff structure and load management\n            procedures for TEC's direct consumers. The performance\n            of the Bank from project preparation through project\n            completion was satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (a)\n            stringent design quality control in this case appears to\n            have been lacking; (b) the experience in this project\n            confirms the appropriateness of the Bank's current\n            procedure for which investment projects with significant\n            environmental issues i.e., to secure all the necessary\n            environmental and other clearances from all concerned\n            central and state government agencies, well ahead of the\n            approval of any loan by the Bank; (c) for major equipment\n            suppliers, linking payment to the furnishing of essential\n            design information required for detailed engineering helped\n            alleviate design coordination problems; and (d) (f) not only\n            the implementing agency, but also other government\n            departments involved in the approval or licensing processes,\n            must be equally alive to the project implementation schedule\n            and work in unison to meet the schedule."}, "docdt": "1996-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
