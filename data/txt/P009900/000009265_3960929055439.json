of the Private Power\n            Utilities (TEC) Project are to provide additional peak\n            generation capacity to meet more of the increasing demand in\n            the Bombay area and reduce Tata Electric Company's\n            (TEC's) dependence on the state's grid; increase\n            the utilization of existing thermal generating units at\n            Trombay and add a gas-based combined cycle plant.  The\n            project comprises: (a) a pumped storage unit at the existing\n            Bhira hydroelectric station to generate 150 megawatt (MW) of\n            additional peak power by consuming off-peak thermal power;\n            (b) a 220 kilovolt (Kv) transmission line to carry this\n            power to the license area; (c) a gas-based combined cycle\n            unit of 180 MW at the Trombay thermal power plant; (d) a\n            second flue gas desulphurization (FGD) unit to control the\n            sulphur dioxide emissions from the coal and oil buring Unit\n            No. 5 at Trombay; and (e) a review of design and technical\n            specifications and supervision of construction of the Bhira\n            pumped storage scheme and acquisition of know-how for the\n            extension of the FGD facility at Trombay."}, "docdt": "1990-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
