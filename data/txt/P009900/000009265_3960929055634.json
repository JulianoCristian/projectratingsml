The\n            project comprises: (a) a pumped storage unit at the existing\n            Bhira hydroelectric station to generate 150 megawatt (MW) of\n            additional peak power by consuming off-peak thermal power;\n            (b) a 220 kilovolt (Kv) transmission line to carry this\n            power to the license area; (c) a gas-based combined cycle\n            unit of 180 MW at the Trombay thermal power plant; (d) a\n            second flue gas desulphurization (FGD) unit to control the\n            sulphur dioxide emissions from the coal and oil buring Unit\n            No. 5 at Trombay; and (e) a review of design and technical\n            specifications and supervision of construction of the Bhira\n            pumped storage scheme and acquisition of know-how for the\n            extension of the FGD facility at Trombay."}, "docdt": "1990-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
