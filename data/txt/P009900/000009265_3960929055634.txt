*            V                 . *        IN INDTA
V _________ __________ _- ________-- __--------- -- -
1.           -   The following memorondum inLd recoimendation on a proposed IBRD
loan of US$98 million equivalent and proposed IFC investment of US$30 million
and Y 4,600 million to Tata Electric Companies (TEC), is s\ubmitted for approval.
The proposed IBRD loan would be at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, and'
be repayable over 20 years, including a five-year grace period.  Interest rates
of the proposed IFC loans would be 10 7182 p.a. for the US Dollar loan and 8 114
S p.a. for the Japanese Oon' loan. The IPC ldans would be repayable on a 15 years
ba.lbon sciedule includiiig a four-year grace period.  The loans woutd help
finance the Private Power Utilities Project (I) -- TEC.
2.   ;      Background.  India is one of the few developing countries  with a
vibrant. if small, private sector presence in pidlic power,supply. There are
five private pown utilities providing public electric supplyt TEC, Bombay
Suburban Electrici'y Supply Ltd. (BSES), Ahmedabad Electricity Company (AEC),
Surat Electricity Company and the Calcutta Electricity Supply Co (CESC). All
but BSES generate at least some of the power they distribute. BSES distributes
power purchased in bWlk from TEC.
3.          All the private\power utilities are regulated by -the Electricity
(Supply) Act of 1948. Under the Act, utilities may set their tariffs to recover
their full operating costs, depreciation, interest and a return on equit- (122).
Their indiVidual  franchises are defined in licences obtained froi-- their
respective state government, which covbr their geographic area of operation and
a term which is normally of 20 years. In the case of TEC. its licence was iast
renewed to 2004 as a result of the Bank's requirements at previous loan approvals
(para. 4J.' GOI has been considering in the last 2-3 years a set of amendments
in 'the Att to imptove the incentives for private sector investment in power
generation.  Key reforms included in the White Paper GOI is considering are: an
increase in the return on equity froaml22 to 15; state government approval of
special reserves for repayment of loan principal sand to raise internal cash
generation for future investments; an increase in the depreciation allowance;
and an extension of the standard license period from 20 to 30 years.  These
incentives are in the right direction. The progress through the Government of
these reforms has been interrupted -- in our assessment \only temporarily -- by
the change' of admini tration and by 'the preoccupat-'4*  of -the- other concerned
authorities with rev'ision of the Eighth Plan. 'lHowever, delays in the
implementation of these policy initiatives would not adversely affect TEC's
ability to operate nor the economic and financial returns to the 'proposeJ. \.
project.'

4.          IBR  involvement with India's private power utilities has comprised
four loans to TEO for the staged. development of the Trombay Thermal Power Station
near Bombay. At} of these loans --approv*d in 1954 (Lqan l06-IN), l957 (Loan
164-X)), 1978 (Loan 1549-IN) and 1984 (Loan 2452-IN) - have been successfully
aimplemente&G IFC's involvement in the kector includes two loans of US$10 million
and SwF16 million to ABC and SwF6O million' to TEC approved in FY89. The latter
loan is to strengthen TEC's transmission system. A further loan of VS$20 million
equivalent to CESC is being considered for FY90.
5.          TEC is a well managed corporation with strong financial performance
and an excellent record of efficient operation and technical innovation. TBI's
staffing is coumensurate with the size and scope of its operations and is
adequate to carry out the proposed project. TEC provides extensive inth'ouse and
external training to  other utilities in India, primarily for power plant
operation. TEC supplils power'to BSES, BEST and large industrial consumers in
the Bombay area.   The quality of its power supply (as regards continuity,
frequency anO voltage) is superior to supplies provided by public utilities.
6.          Rationale for Bank Group'Involvement. \GOI has adopted an ambititus
Investment program for the power sector ulder the 1990-95 Plan.  Expansion of
private sector participation -is a key element of this program.  It wou'd provide
an opportunity to help mobilize additional resources from outside the public
sector as well as improve finaticial and economic ef'iciency in the power sector.
The Bink dioup's involvement with India's private power utilities has stimulated
GOI thinking on the role of the private sector in public power supply and has
helped obtain government commitments and regulatory improvements "that have
strqngthened utilities' financial performanc". IBRD And ,IPC participation in
the proposed project will also help mobilize additional financing for a private
uti3lity with excellent records of performance and efficiency.  Et will also
provide an opportunity.- to review 4ith the Government the adequacy of the
incentives it is currently considering \to encourage increased private investment.
This to especially relevant in Maharashtra, the largest industrial state, where
the, private sector is already active but where' there is scope and a need to
attract additional resources. Moreover, the Government of Haharashtra (GOM) has
beeri, a leader in promoting private investment in sectors such as power,
traditionally reserved for public funding.
7.          TEC, vhich has in the past borrowed from the Indian public financial
institutions and from IBRD, wishes to diversify its financing sources. IFC's
first loan of SwF60 million to TEC was p part of this strategy.  IFC's proposed
US$30 mS4lioh and Yen 4,600 million loins for this project, together withWits
earlier loan of SwF60,million would result in a total exposure of US$100 million
equivalent, which IPC judges to be a prudent overall exposure in TEC.  To
complete the financing, the additional requirement of US$98 million is being met
by IIRD. . i
8.   V      Project Ob ectives. -The phys-ical objectives of the proposed project
are, to provide additional peak\ generation capacity to meet more,of the increasing
demand in the Bombay' area and reduce TEC's dependence on the state's grid;

increase the util zation of existing therma. generating imJts at Trombay1aaid
add a gas-based comblned cycle plant.  These. investments will\ reduce TEC's
average cost of generation, mitigate the sulphur dioxide emissions trom the coal
aud oil burning Trombay Unit No. 5 and improve sykem reliability 'sand quality
of service to consumers. The project's institutional and sectoral objectives
are to help increase private sector participation in public power supply and
introduce time-of-day energa pricing and load management tariffs for TEC'a bulk
supply and direct consumers
9.   Y      Protect Description, Costs and Financing.  The proposed project is
part k the least-cost development program for the Western Region power system
and-eomprises:. a) a pumped storage unit at the existing Bhira hydroelectric
station, to generate 1I0 KW of addition&4 peak power by consuming off-peak
thermal power; b)'a 220 kV transmission line to carry th'ise power to the license
area; c) a gas-based combined cycle unit of 180 MV at the Trombay tb ermal power
plant; d) a second flue gas desulphurization (POD) unit to control the sulphur
dioxide emissions from the coal and oil burning Unit No.-5 at Trombay; and (e)
a review of design-and techni4al specifications and super4ision of construction
of the Bhira- ppped storage scheme and acquisition of know-how for the extension
of the PGD faZ\lity at Trombay.
10.         The Oroposed project vill be completed in about four years and will
tost about US$230.7 million. Interest during conitruction-will add an additional
US$43.0 mlllion. The foreign financing-'requirements for the pioject is about
US$144.2 miilion (532 qf the total), Schedule 'Al presents the cost estimates
and financ in plan for the project. Schedule 'B' presents the arrangements for
procurement and disbursement. ,Retroactive financing of up to US$2.0 million will
be provided «or eligible expenditures 'after May 31, 1990. Schedules 'C" and OD"
provide a tiimtable of key projecttprocessing events and the status of Bank gro4p
operations in India.  Map No. 22293 is attached.  Staff Appraisal Report Ko.

11.         Environmental Aji*cts. All the components of the project will'comply
with 001 and GOM standards as well as with all applicable environmental policies
and guidelines of the World Bank. The existing Bhira dam and power plant have
, '  not had substantial adverse effectk on the environent. ' The proposed pumped
\ storage unit, would use' the\, exsting upstream and downstream reservoirs, and'so
' would not 'adversely affect the surrounding environment. the new 220 kY
transmission line vould use the right-of-way of the existing 110 kV li4s. The
efficient use of natural- gas in a combined cycle scheme and the extension of the
POD Plant for Trombay Unit 5 would help contain emissions from the Trombay
*        Thermal Powez\ Plant  (total capacity 1,330 M           \TEC has obtained the
environmental clearance for the Bhira pumped storage scheme; and that for the

the proposed IBRD loan.      greed that It would not take any actions,- inEludlng
delimiting TIC's area of supply, that would adversely affect TEC's operitiqnal
performance and financial position.. GOMfurther agreed that it would continue
to allow TEC.the current practice of,colleting certain special reserves as are
permissible, under the Rlactricity (Su pply) Act.  TC agreed to the security
,arrangements for the proposed loan, and agreed also' to Unit their long-term
borrowings so that the companies' long-term debt to equity ratio does not exceed
13.        B efits  The project will increase TEC'is peak generating capacity
and its utilisation of the:existing Trpmhay thermal power station. The project
will also reduce TIEC's transmission losses- and improve system reLIability.
Tariff adjustments and load management initiatives will bring the level and
structure of TEC'\s tariffs more closely in 'ine with its oupply costs.  More-
genera;ly, Bank Grqup support for increased privl4te sector participation in the
de*elope1ept of India's power sector, will release Oublic resources-for investment
in other sectors that are-not able to attract private funds.
14.        Risks   ()- The physical twoject components, .*Uich are based on
6onventional technology, do nsot presen 'unusual technical fisks.  The Mulshi
'Dam, upstream of the Bhira Hydro Power Project will conftinize to be monitored
and inspected periodicslly by the IrriationY!partment of GMK ltm accordance

power- ptil7tise in India, TEC set their tariffs  ! recovet their full costs,
- anclinding depreciation-'at 3.6? p-a., interest and a predetermined return on the
capital base. Additional special`teserves are allowe4 by GM* to full\cover the
debt service and raise internal funds for future- investments. Contiuiuation of
'\these reserves is essential for TEC to attain c fortable debt servicing.  (c)
TEC's system and operations are clooely interlinked with the State grid operated
by the MSEB. Maintaining the present rorking balance is critical for TEC's lopg-
term viability.     -                                          -
