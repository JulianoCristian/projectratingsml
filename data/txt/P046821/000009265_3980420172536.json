The project\n            will be implemented over a four-year period. It will finance\n            technical assistance, consulting firms and the acquisition\n            of computer equipment, through five components. Activities\n            in the fraud and error component aim to reduce unwarranted\n            disbursements by desk-checking existing paper files,\n            carrying out on-site visits, and updating the beneficiary\n            database. The second component aims to reorganize agencies\n            to provide one-stop, full-service points of sale, while the\n            remaining components focus on institutional strengthening\n            which introduces a new organizational structure, management\n            techniques, and incentives linked to performance; on project\n            administration with key personnel and accounting and\n            monitoring systems Bank-financed; and lastly, on the\n            absorption into the national system of 22 provincial pension\n            funds, after their files are verified and screened for\n            errors and fraud."}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
