TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A:
BACKGROUND AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The New Integrated Pension System'
i.     Argentina reformed its national pension system in mid- 19942, when it substituted the
old pay-as-you-go system by a new mixed public/private two-pillar structure. The old system
suffered from a very high dependency ratio that was, in tum, caused by widespread evasion,
low retirement ages, and lax disability rules. Other problems were the promise of very high
indexed pensions relative to wages and the prevalence of special regimes that allowed for early
retirement and encouraged evasion. This system required an unsustainable contribution rate of
50 percent. Unable to impose such a high rate, the Government rieduced it to 21 percent and
reduced the replacement rate to half its target level, paying pensions with notes. Despite these
measures, the system ran deficits during the 1980s.
2.     The erosion of the real value of pensions prompted a barrage of lawsuits by
pensioners. In 1991, the Government recognized the past debt to pensioners and offered cash
payments with a limit of 1,580 pesos or payments with new bonds (dollars or pesos) with a
maturity of ten years. The total recognized debt amounted to 7. 5 billion pesos or 3.5 percent
of GDP.
3.     In 1994, the Government introduced a new integrated pension system. This system,
compulsory for all workers including the self-employed, has the f'ollowing structure:
(a)   The First Pillar is all public, financed by employers' contributions, earmarked
taxes and budgetary allocations. The employers' contributions are legally stipulated at
16 percent of wages, but discounts given to some sectors, and regions Ihave reduced the
average contribution to an estimated 14.7 percent.

2
(b)    This pillar is responsible for three types of benefits:
(i)     a basic universal pension (PBU) equal to 27.5 percent of the average
covered wage, subject to a minimum eligibility period of 30 years and a normal
retirement age of 65 for men and 60 for women;
(ii)    a transitory compensatory pension (PC) for past contributions to the old
system, paying a pension equal to 1.5 percent of the average indexed salary of
the last 10 years of employment for every year of contribution to the old
system; and
(iii)    a pension paid to existing pensioners, also transitory.
(c)    The Second Pillar is financed by an 11 percent contribution rate by employees,
who have the option to invest it in a private pension fumd or in the national system:
(i)    the private option is a defined contribution system based on individual
capitalization accounts managed by pension funds administrators
(Admninistradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones- AFJPs). The old-age
pension from this system will be in the form of 2L life annuity or scheduled
withdrawals based on the accumulated balance of each account, and will be
covered by group disability and life insurance. As of end 1995, about 5 million
workers had chosen to join one of the AFJPs, representing 55 percent of all
eligible workers and over 60 percent of affiliated workers.
(ii)    the public option is a defined-benefit' scheme. It provides a public
pension (PAP) of 0.85 percent of the average indexed monthly salary of the last
10 years of employment for every year of service to the new system, and will
also cover disability and survivorship benefits, s:imilar to those offered by the
private component.
4.       This pension system is based on one of the highest labor taxes in the world;
approximately 38% of gross salaries, compared to around 20% for the US, New Zealand and
Chile. It will require further reform to make it sustainable. For example, Government is
considering adjusting the sizes of the pillars relative to one another, and lowering the flat
pension to convert it into a safety net.
5.       Collections are carried out by the General Tax Directorate (DGI), which is undergoing
restructuring under its new General Director. Evasion is high; only 58.8 percent of potential
contributors actually pay, which the government estimates causes a deficit of some US$450
million per month.
3       Defined benefit: Specifies the amount of benefit due if participants mcet the eligibility criteria, such as age, years of work. minimum of
years under program coverage. 'The most common provide a pension based on a percentage of pre-retirement earnings. The benetits are
guaranteed, usually by govermient. and paid by a combination of current contributions ('pay.as..you-go"), accrued reserves or both. These
benefits permit transfen of income between groups (income or age). Defined contributions: Benefits depend on the contributions made, which are
inverted.

6.     Payments are administered by the National Social Security Administration (ANSeS),
which issues approximately 3.5 million payment orders per month. This will represent, for
1996, about US$15.3 billion. Inadequate granting and payment processes create a potential for
considerable distortions due to fraud and simple errors. Initial estimates by the government put
the amount of overpayment at a minimum of US$300 million per year; less conservative
estimates put the figure nearer to US$1 billion per year (the pension files are so inaccurate that
it is difficult to come up with a more precise estimate without an extensive corrective effort).
An improved administration of the public pension system is clearly indicated.
Pension Administration
7.     ANSeS is responsible for the administration of the public; component of the new
integrated pension system, covering old age, disability, widow an,d orphan funds, as well as
other social security schemes such as Farmily Allowances, the Naltional Employment Fund
(includes financing of retraining), and the administration of third party benefits such as military
and police pensions. In addition, it manages the resources of the Health Service Administration
(ANSSAL) and the National Social Security Institute for Retirees and Pensioners (INSSJP). In
all, ANSeS administers approximately 45% of the National Budget.
O.     ANSeS' operational budget is US$644 million per year. Of this, 48% represents
payments to the General Tax Directorate (DGI) and to some 80 lbanks (who handle payments).
ANSeS provides services to its clients through approximately 8,800 employees in 146 agencies
nationwide.
Status of the Pension Files
9.     In July 1995, letters were sent to 2.9 million pensioners asking for confirmation in
person of their right to receive a pension. The results were as follows:
* About 270,000 were represented by third parties. Of these, 30% were found to
have errors and irregularities.
*  About 188,000 did not come, nor did they send representatives. About 15% are
estimated to be fraudulent.
* About 316,000 people who presented themselves to the agencies had documentary
errors.
* About 391,000 people who presented themselves to the agencies had no
documentation at all.
10.     Government estimates that savings of a minimum of US$279 million per year would
result from correcting these errors. The review and correction of the errors detected requires
extensive desk-checking against scanty information, applying olcl and sometimes obsolete legal
frameworks, with site visits in many cases. This effort would be financed under the proposed
project.



4
11.     Benefit calculations are carried out under very lax circumstances. A conservative
estimate puts at US$278 million the savings resulting verification of past grantings.
12.     An additional US$6 million per year in savings would result from tighter controls
applied to new grantings.
13.     A pilot comparison with one provincial fund (Municipality of Buenos Aires), showed
that 9,000 (14%) of the provincial pensioners received pensions from both pension funds. A
sample of 800 cases showed that 67% had incompatible pensions. A rough estimate puts the
savings for all provinces due to double pensions at approximately US$20 million per year.
14.     There are many other estimates of potential savings. However, given the number of
files to be reviewed, the lack of documentation, the incomplete merging of the previous 18
pension programs, and the lack of historical data for comparison, it is not possible to make an
accurate estimate before more substantial reviews of the files are carried out, reviews which
would be financed under the proposed project.
15.     Tentatively and conservatively, the Government has agreed to consider savings of
US$300 million per year as the absolute minimum to be obtained from the strengthening of
ANSeS.
Institutional Status of the Organization
16.     Before the creation of the National Pension System, pensions were administered by
about 20 independent organizations (e.g., Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Police and the
Army), not including provincial administrations. Each organization had different procedures for
collections, grantings and payments. as well as different benefit rules. In 1991, the National
Pension Administration (ANSeS) was created as a semi-autonomous institution, merging 18 of
these organizations. However, the different programs were inadequately merged. For all
practical purposes, ANSeS administers 18 different programs, each with its own rules,
personnel and pay scales.
17.     In 1995, ANSeS decided to carry out an in-depth diagnostic of the institution. A
consulting firm was selected, and the review of the organization, procedures and staff took
place during November/December 1995.
18.     The diagnostic found:
*  A lack of definition of the mnission of the organization
*  No long-term planning
*  No prioritization of objectives
* Poor service to cLients
* Little clarity concerning the grantings and payments processes
*  Uncoordinated and insecure automated systems



S
* Inefficient internal organization
*  No clarity in the responsibilities of management and staff
*  No clarity in resource ailocation methods
*  An incentive scheme which did not permit rewards or sanctions
*  No internal communications
19.     The diagnostic team found that there was no shared vision of the institution and no
sense of belonging. There was no attempt to promote on merit, and criteria for promotion
were at best unclear and at worst passive (seniority, obedience, adherence to the letter of
instructions). Management had no clear objectives, a vague definition of its responsibilities (the
same is true for staff), very little information for control and no performance indicators,
resulting in a clear absence of accountability.
20.     The functional orientation of the organizational structure was detrimental to
coordinated effort. For example, an upgrade of agencies requirinlg infrastructure
improvements, new systems and training of personnel, would be carried out independently by
three different departments, with at best a loss of synergy, and at worst conflicting activities.
21.     ANSeS has cultural values based on stability and compliance with form. In the
absence of a policy for administration and human resources, with no performance measurement
and with an incentive system based on obscure criteria, salary distortions and low motivation
have resulted in low morale and endemic corruption. There are fiew highly qualified, and little
use is made of office equipment.
22.     The administrative and accounting systems are inadequate. Although about USS300
million is spent on the administration of ANSeS, no one is sure how this money is spent. There
is no system of cost centers and no way of evaluating the efficierncy of any area, nor are there
incentives to use resources efficiently. This results in cases like the following:
*  The child care center has one employee for every 3 children.
*  Janitorial services cost an average of US$5,200 each month for every 1000 m2.
Market rates are closer to $2,000.
* ANSeS rents many of its locales - yet at the same time it owns numerous empty
buildings. In Buenos Aires, 20.3% of ANSeS' available office space (123,000 mn2) is
on "loan" (free) to other state entities; 9 5%  is unused, and 14.2%/0 is misused for
archiving. A review of space use could save ANSeS about US$5 rnillion a year.
US$23 million is spent per year in improving the infrastructure. There is no
measure of effectiveness of this effort, except for the dilapidated state of existing
buildings, which do not show the effects of this large amount.
* The number of staff is unknown; although estimated at 8,800. Of these, 279 were
found in the accounting database (i.e., being paid) but not in the Human Resources



6
database (i.e., no record of what they do). Another 134 staff were found who
belonged to no recognizable unit.
23.     ANSeS' critical Systems and Processes were found to be confusing and inadequate.
ANSeS staff still apply the original 18 different legal frameworics, there are no clear processes
and no uniformity on decision criteria (e.g., for awards or disputes), and there are multiple
systems operating on several databases without control mechanisms.
24.     The award process has no controls. There are at least four ways to create an illegal
benefit: for example, upon the death of a person, it is possible to modify the database to
include a partner (spouse, sibling, child, etc.). There are also no post-award verifications, even
of the amounts awarded. A total of 340,000 updates are made to the database each month,
representing an average of US$360 million per year. There is no automated verification, and
data input has been calculated to have an error rate of 40 percent. The databases do not
contain sufficient information on past payments, and so pensions are estimated only roughly.
25.     The payment process is equally unchecked. The banks charge US$90 million per year
for payments, but there is no control over the length of time or of accuracy. Every month an
estimated 70,000 payments are not cashed, but no follow-up is carried out. All payment orders
are printed, even though the vast majority are repetitive and electronic payment orders could
easily be used. Perhaps the most striking example of the lack of attention to the payment
process is given by one detail: unlike normal practice, the payment system always rounds up
centavos to the nearest peso, costing ANSeS a totally unnecessary US$6 million each year.
26.     Twenty agencies were surveyed. The confusing procedures and lack of information
are reflected in the length of time taken for grantings and payments. For example,
Payment of Ordinary Pension:     average 14 days, maximum 302
Pension due to death of kin:     average 6 days, maximum 90
Invalidity pension:              average 20 days, maximum 302.
27.     These numbers reflect several visits by clients to the agencies. Each visit takes on
average 5.5 hours, and is very uncomfortable as there are only seats for 25 percent of the
(mostly elderly) clients. Moreover, agencies are very crowded, with an average of one client
for every square meter.
28.     To put these numbers into perspective, in Australia (admittedly a well-run social
security administration), 80% of all invalidity pensions are paid vvithin 2 days, 95% of all
clients are seen by an agent within 20 minutes (even if without an appointment) or 10 minutes
(if with an appointment).
29.     There were many more findings of this nature by the diagnostics team.

ANSeS Reform Strategy
30.     The current senior ANSeS management has begun its mandate intent upon
establishing its credibility and that of ANSeS through a number of targeted early activities
aimed at achieving quick. tangible and, more important, visible successes. In addition to
establishing its credibility, they have also sought to create a positive momentum for change
which would allow it, among other things, to attract badly needed senior management and
technical talent.
31.     To this effect, ANSeS has begun the process of establishing a clear vision for the
organization and establishing effective lines of authority and accountability, with the assistance
of a consulting firm. Steps were taken to identify key staff who can be counted on to change
the culture of the organization and to define the new processes and procedures necessary to
reengineer the entire operation. Efforts are underway to restructure ANSeS, review the
accounting and management information system (carried out following Bank procedures, with
a view to retroactive financing), and strengthen internal auditing, as well as to detect and
correct defective procedures and processes and to establish security and program safeguards.
32.     The reform is being implemented in two phases. The first or "Emergency" phase was
aimed at achieving the necessary level of control over the institution by end-1996. The second
is the more in-depth "Transformation" phase, which the proposed project supports.
33.     Early activities included:
3 Carrying out the in-depth diagnostic of ANSeS referred to above, to identify major
problems and areas of mismanagement and corruption.
* Defining the mission of ANSeS, by identifying ANSeS' present and future clients,
defining the products and services which ANSeS will provide, and determining the
level of service to be provided.
* Assuming the direction of the entity, including the need to: (i) define responsibilities
for managers and external advisors; (ii) emphasize internal auditing; (iii) strengthen
the legal area; and (iv) develop basic managemeni: and control tools.
* Identifying and recruiting new managers, both within and outside the organization.
 Defining and implementing an internal communications campaign, which included
the definition and implementation of a new ANSeS logo and colors.
* Taking over the computer center. This area in particular was identified as the major
center of corruption within ANSeS. Given the ease with which sabotage in this area
would cause ANSeS to immediately stop processing pensions, and the uproar that
this would cause, there was need for a carefully designed and executed, and secret
operation. The design of the operation and the infiltration of the computer center



8
took several months and required the help of an international consulting firm. At
the same time, federal police investigated a number of contracts and suspected
contacts. Eventually, ANSeS staff, accompanied by a large number of police
agents, successfully accomplished the "hostile takeover" of the computer center,
making copies of all archives and systems. Several ex-computer center managers
have been accused of fraud and are being tried.
34.     These activities, carried out during project preparation, will be financed retroactively
from government counterpart funds shortly after project effectiveness. The government has
agreed to deposit an amount sufficient to cover the retroactive financing as well as the first
year's counterpart expenditures within three months after project effectiveness.
Provincial Pension Funds
35.     On August 12, 1993, the National Government agreed to accept the transfer of the
Provincial Pension Funds (PPFs) and absorb them into the National Pension System,
admninistered by the National Social Security Administration (ANSeS).
36.     Preliminary studies show that the PPFs have higher average contributions and
benefits than the national system, as well as lower requirements to obtain these benefits. After
the expected transfer over the next three years of 22 Provinces and one Municipality (Buenos
Aires), the increase in the number of affiliates at the national level would be approximately
600,000 individuals (8 percent), and the increase in payments approximately US$4.2 billion
(27 percent). In addition, administrative errors, fraud and corruption have been determined to
be substantially higher than in the national system. For example, pensions for invalidity
comprise in some cases about 20 percent of all pensions. A normal rate would be closer to 4
percent. A first review of benefit amounts shows a considerable proportion of unexplained
increases (e.g., one case in which the amount went from US$160 to US$2000).
37.     The transfer of these systems must therefore be cairried out carefully and
progressively, simplifying processes and cleaning up files. To this effect, a special Transfer Unit
has been created within ANSeS, with a mandate to carry out: and manage all activities related
to the absorption of the PPFs.
Project Objectives
38.     The objectives of this project are to assist ANSeS in improving its institutional
efficiency and effectiveness along modern management principles in order to: (a) reduce
instances of improper pension payment; (b) improve the quality of its client services; and (c)
absorb the administration of the provincial pension fiinds.
Project Description
39.     Many attempts at institutional strengthening have suffered from a failure to recognize
the severe organizational disfunctions at the base of the institution's weakness. By focusing on



9
a limited number of key areas, or by failing to address managernent and incentive issues, early
successes have failed to ensure sustainability. Recognizing this., the proposed project addresses
the immediate issues of deficit reduction, low quality of client services and the absorption of
the provincial pension funds through three straightforward components. The fourth component
addresses institutional issues, centered around the premise that all the main processes of the
organization must be redesigned completely and concurrently around a shared vision, clearly
enunciated business processes, coherent management structures and appropriately motivated
human resources. In addition, the proposed strengthening is predicated on the notion that
sustainability can only be achieved if the entire culture, structures and premises of the
organization are refocused to its new goals through the systermatic use of change management
and facilitation tools and techniques.
40.     However, the re-inventing of an institution and refocussing of its culture require
long-term, sustained efforts, beyond the scope of this project. Such a change may take
upwards of ten years and sustained political will, and would require detailed long-term
implementation plans which the institution (and most likely no institution in this situation and
context) cannot prepare at present.
41.     Rather than attempting to put together a workplan with extremely flexible terms, this
project limits its scope to a first phase in which efforts are concentrated on putting the house in
order and laying the groundwork for future change.
42.     Clearly the proposed project cannot assure sustainability, but it will substantially
facilitate it. A revised ANSeS, with clear goals and incentives, an interim organizational
structure, cleaner databases and more efficient procedures, with errors eliminated and fraud
under control, trained personnel, and an administration conversant with modern techniques of
management and in change management will permit the full reengineering of its processes
which ANSeS requires, in a second phase of reform.
43.     The project will finance technical assistance, consulting firms and the acquisition of
computer equipment, through four components:
*  Fraud and Error Control
Activities in this component aim to reduce inappropriate disbursements due
to fraud and error by cleaning up existing files, setting up a Fraud Control
Unit, and agreeing on joint evasion programs with the General Tax
Directorate.
Improvement of Client Service Quality
Agencies will be reorganized to provide one-stop, full service "points of
sale", and will be provided with new processes and systems, trained
personnel, and an upgraded infrastructure.
* Provincial Pension Fund Transfer



10
The Provincial Pension Funds of up to 22 provinces will be absorbed into
the national system after a verification of its files and elimination of errors
and fraud.
Institutional Strengthening
Activities in support of an efficient organization will consist of the
introduction of a new organizational structure, management techniques,
incentive system, as well as central monitoring and control and back-office
operations such as maintaining the central database.
44.     Project coordination and administration will to a large extent be the responsibility of
ANSeS management (see attached Resolution by the Ministry of Labor), assisted by two
consultants financed by the project and an external procurement agent.
Component I: Fraud and Error Control
45.     To reduce future errors, ANSeS is engaged in the improvement of its Granting and
Payment processes and systems, to introduce better monitoring and accounting mechanisms. In
the second phase of its reform, these processes and systems will be redesigned to conform to
the new decentralized concepts introduced, as well as making them more transparent, more
effective, and less costly to operate and maintain.
46.     In addition to this on-going review of existing systems, ANSeS needs to carry out
two important activities:
(a)    a review of its beneficiary files (see results of diagnostic, above); and
(b)    creation of a Fraud Control Unit, which with Internal Audit will help
prevent future fraud.
47.     ANSeS needs to review and clean up its beneficiary files, which at present are the
cause of the largest identifiable erroneous disbursements. To this effect, a pilot exercise will
concentrate on one province (about 20,000 cases) and define the methodology for review,
develop the performance criteria for the work and for its control, calculate the cost/benefit cut-
off points, validate the methodologies and carry out the review. Based on the results of this
pilot, upwards of 400,000 files will be reviewed. Some of these files will require personal
verification. The file audits will therefore be followed up by on-site verification. Some 300,000
cases have already been identified as requiring site verification. Draft terms for the file review
have been prepared and can be found in the Project Files.
48.     The review of the files will be done in portions of approximately 100,000 files, not
counting the pilot of 20,000. It is not possible at this time to estimate precisely the cost of
review of each portion, as it depends on the degree of accuracy required, which will vary
according to findings in each portion, the learning curve of the consultants and staff employed
(not necessarily the same group throughout, in particular when dealing with on-site verification
in the provinces and with the review of invalidity claims, which require medical analysis). A



cost-effectiveness analysis would therefore be carried out at the end of each phase, to permnit
fine-tuning of the review methodology.
49.     To prevent the continuation of the prevalent fraudulent practices, a Fraud Control
Unit will be set up, along the lines of the Inspectorate General in the US. Initial activities
include the definition of the unit, its mission, objectives, performance indicators and skill mix
required, among others, and the preparation of prevention, detection and monitoring
mechanisms, including detection algorithms and the use of cross-referencing with other
institutions' databases (e.g., DGI, Civil Register, death certificates, etc.).
Component II: Improvement of Client Service Quality
50.     To improve services, ANSeS is implementing one-stop point-of-sale with its
agencies, offering all the services needed by the customer. To do this ANSeS has to devolve
responsibility for pension grantings, interpretations of the legal framework, and modifications
of customer data to the agencies. This in tum requires a revision of the granting and payment
processes to simplify them and automate them in a decentralized mode, using interconnected
information systems running on a "client-server" architecture, and at the same time introduce
monitoring and control mechanisms at headquarters. This approach follows the "normative and
supervisory centralization, operative decentralization" approach of the Second Reform of the
State and of many modern institutions.
51.     To implement the Full Service Agency (Unidades de Asistencia Integral, UTDAI), a
service strategy will be developed, personnel and managemeni: of the agenciies will be trained,
and the offices refurbished and provided with new computer equipment. These agencies will be
of one of three forms, depending on clientele. The "typical" UDAI will have approximately 60
people; the "minimal" LTDAI will have 5 people (including the manager), and the "mobile"
UJDAI, which will concentrate on people unable to come to the agencies, will consist of a
vehicle, one driver and two staff. Other ways of providing services are being considered, such
as using the telephone and the postal services.
52.     Full services require full and correct information, which in turn will require:
*  Structural reorganization of ANSeS' operations (i.e., revision of granting
and payment processes);
*  Unified guidelines for grantings, awards and modifications of pensions;
*  New definitions of functions and performance indicators at staff and
management level;
*  Introduction of incentive systems rewarding good performance;
*  Training of managers and staff (at headquarters and in agencies);
*  Central monitoring and auditing; and
*  An error-free database, and secure and efficient automated systems
providing access to all the customer's information.



12
53.     The operations of the UDAI will be supported from headquarters by several
Directorates, which will need to be strengthened (see Component IV, Institutional
Strengthening, below): Administration (procurement); Finance (Accounting. Budgeting and
Treasury); Information Systems (all automated systems and telecommunications);
Communications (information dissemination); Human Resources (selection. traning and
planning); Legal (simplification of frameworks and interpretation of difficult cases); and
Internal Audit.
54.     Work has already started on this component; ten UDAIs are in the process of being
constituted, and about 170,000 pending cases have been processed. There is at present no
granting backlog.
55.     Not included in this project is a complementary and necessary infrastructure
development exercise being carried out by ANSeS. Its main objective is to redesign the
location and physical structure of the agencies to make themr of easier access and use by the
client (and staff). In some cases new buildings will have to be rented or built; for example,
when a new clientele is brought into ANSeS (i.e., the Provincial Pension Funds). Other
objectives of this exercise are to establish a new headquarters building (in process), centralize
the archives, and re-evaluate infrastructure requirements and assets. More information on this
activity can be found in the Project Files, including plans for the new UDAIs.
Component mU: Provincial Pension Fund Transfer
56.     Ten provinces have already agreed formally to the transfer (Salta, Tucuman,
Mendoza, San Juan, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca, Rio Negro, Jujuy and La Rioja, plus the
Municipality of Buenos Aires, considered a province). It is expected that almost all the
provinces will eventually agree.
57.     The transfer of these systems must therefore be carried out carefully and
progressively, simplifying processes and cleaning up files. To this effect, a special Transfer Unit
has been created within ANSeS, with a mandate to carry out and manage all activities related
to the absorption of the PPFs.
58.     The absorption of the provincial pension funds will entail a transition process during
which these funds will be processed independently. Before full absorption into the national
system, all provincial pension files will have to be reviewed.
59.     During this process, technical assistance will be provided to assist ANSeS staff to
process payments under different provincial pension rules, as pensions granted before 1995 will
continue to operate under the original provincial rules. After ANSeS' critical pension processes
have been extensively overhauled, the pension files will be merged with the national system's.
Component IV: Institutional Strengthening
60.     The organization, structure and management processes of ANSeS have been
diagnosed as insufficient and ineffective. Furthermore, they are totally incompatible with the



13
emerging vision, which requires introducing private sector management practices, processes
and systems, resulting in an ANSeS which has:
*  A formal and informal organization aligned with ANSeS' objectives.
*  An error-free database, secure and efficient automated systems.
  Unified guidelines for grantings, awards and modifications of pensions.
* A high level of control and accountability, and delegation of authority and
responsibility.
*  An incentive system designed to reward performance.
* Trained and motivated staff.
* One-stop agencies offering all the services needed by the customer.
61.     Efforts will focus on introducing a culture based on service and accountability, and
on building ANSeS' capacity for analysis, planning, budgeting, process accounting, and
monitoring. The change program will also focus on the management of human resources and
on ways to improve the productivity of ANSeS' workforce. Incentive and motivation systems
will be overhauled, combining performance measurements with financial incentives, and backed
by a comprehensive skills inventory and training program.
62.     Initial activities in this area, to be financed through counterpart funds released to
ANSeS by the Ministry of Economy towards the beginning of' 1997, consist of the initial
diagnostic and proposals for the revision of critical processes and file verification, as well as
the design of the Full Service Agencies. Most importantly, the vision of ANSeS was defined,
and the value analysis of all activities has already begun.
63.     Changes in senior management have been a common source of disruption in technical
assistance projects. To help prevent this, a Steering Committee has been constituted. This
Committee, chaired by the Secretary of Social Security and composed of specialists in
management and social security, will review and approve the semi-annual progress reports and
workplans presented by the National Director, providing continuity in the case of a change in
senior management and thereby further reducing the chance of possible disruption in project
implementation.
64.     Management of change, especially a comprehensive organizational and cultural
change as envisaged for ANSeS, requires special skills in management not usually found in
institutions in either the public or the private sector. As mentioned before, an effort is being
made to attract managers to lead the ANSeS reform process. These managers will receive
training in modern management techniques as well as that subset of management known as
change management.
65.     A network of change facilitation teams, workgroups and committees is being
established to promote participation and insure that the full range of activities required to
manage change is undertaken in a systematic and timely fashion.



14
66.     Senior management also seeks to increase its internal credibility and achieve
employee commitment through a sustained communication effort and through the introduction
of significant changes such as performance pay and accountability regimes. The
communications process has already begun, with a new internal communications policy, an
institutional magazine, and documentation and presentations to staff on the reforn objectives
and strategy.
67.     An important part of the institutional strengthening will be the introduction of inter-
institutional contracts between ANSeS units, both for goal-setting and performance evaluation
and for the hiring of services from internal and external providers. Training is a prime example
of the hiring of services. While some very specialized training may be offered within the
organization, it is expected that most of the training will be competitively bid in the private
sector. Another example is informatics, in which both hardware and software is likely to be
provided by third parties.
68.     The Finance and Administrative sub-directorate has deteriorated perhaps more than
other areas of ANSeS; little financial management information is available for decision-making.
Efforts will be made to strengthen this area through a review of procedures, development of
management information systems, and training. In particular, the following activities would be
carried out:
* Design and implementation of a Management Information System
* Revision of the budget system
- Renegotiation of all service contracts
-- Revision of the accounting system
- Revision of the procurement system
* Recreation of the Human Resources Database.
69.     The work to be done in inforrnatics is very large, basically a realignment of the
Informatics Directorate towards a service orientation. The quality of its in-house informatics
resources and its outsourcing capabilities would be improved. A user requirement identification
and a client/user integrated planning capacity would be created, as well as the planning and
implementation of a world class multi-tier network which will require the re-development of
all major systems and the introduction of modern telecommunications.
70.     Activities in this area will take place in three phases:
*  Short-term activities aimed at ensuring that current operations are maintained at
their present level and that short-term actions such as backlogs and cleanups are
resolved.
*  Intermediate activities intended to maximize the usefulness of current informatics
resources while the long-term strategy is being developed, and
*  A long-term strategy, which will be based on detailed client and business process
requirements, using appropriate technological solutions. This strategy will develop
operational, administrative and management information systems aimed at



15
processing and delivering the information required, on time, within specifications, in
the appropriate formats and in the most user-friendly environment. In addition, a
migration plan will be implemented to take all data in its intermediate form to the
final Consolidated Database version.
71.     Most of this very large effort is already being carried out by ANSeS. The proposed
project would help the develop new informatics policies, reengineer the Informatics
Directorate, and provide training and procurement assistance.
72.     The satisfactory development of human resources in ANSeS has been hindered by the
lack of flexibility in current legislation, and by the application of outmoded management
principles emphasizing form over function. The absence of rewards or sanctions for
performance and the lack of targeted training are only two of the conditions which have led
ANSeS to its present situation of lack of managerial and staff accountability, demoralization
and low skill levels.
73.     It is therefore necessary to:
3  Define a new Incentive Policy for management and staff, based on
performance
*  Obtain a more flexible labor agreement;
*  Define a new policy for the selection and promotion of personnel;
*  Define a new policy for the identification of training needs, provision of
training and measurement of results;
* Define internal search criteria and prepare a search plan;
* Carry out a skills inventory;
*  Prepare and implement a Training Plan; and
*  Develop a Human Resource Information System.
74.     In addition, senior management is planning the introduction of carefully targeted
training aimed at enhancing staff capacity in critical processes
Project Administration
75.     The project will be coordinated by ANSeS' management. To assist them in the
administration of activities financed by the Bank, an administrative unit has been established, in
charge of procurement and accounting, and of ensuring that EBank procedures are followed. An
experienced administrator (five years of direct experience with the Bank, IDB, UJNDP and the
UN Office for Project Services - UN/OPS) has been identified and hired part-time by ANSeS.
After effectiveness the administrator, as well as an experienced accountant (not yet identified.
but the same profile is required), will be financed by the Bankc. ANSeS line staff will comprise
the remainder of the unit.
76.     A project accounting and monitoring system is already in place (transferred from
another Bank project), the Bank would finance its upgrade to set it in line with the latest Bank



16
requirements for monitonrng, accounting and auditing. An outline progress report has been
agreed (in draft Terms of Reference for project auditing in the 1project files).
77.     Thus, by financing a small number of experienced staff (two) and putting in place a
monitoring and accounting system, project administration costs would be minimized. By using
line staff for the remainder of the unit, institutionalization of project administration skills is
facilitated.
Other Expenses: External Administration
78.     ANSeS is considering entering into an external administration agreement with a UN
organization. This type of agreement is frequent in Argentina because:
*  Under the existing law, only staff of Secretary of State rank can contract in the
name of the State; all others must do so personally. This exposes the great majority
of National Directors and Project Coordinators to being sued, which, given the
amount of litigation in Argentina, is common. As a consequence, most National
Directors and Project Coordinators are loath to assume this responsibility.
-  It also permits the government to eliminate paying value-added taxes as counterpart
for consultants and goods. On this argument alone, such an agreement, which costs
3-5 percent of the total project, is worth considering, as the value-added tax stands
today at 21 percent.
79.     The Bank would finance this agreement.
80.     Project audits would be financed by ANSeS. Draft Terms of Reference for project
auditing can be found in the project files.

SECTION B:
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Agencies Involved
1.    The National Social Secunrtv Administration (ANSeS) will be the executing agency for
this project, and will be responsible for providing counterpart ftnds. The Executive Director of
ANSeS will be project's National Director. The Ministry of Economy will provide US$20 million
for counterpart financing. The first installment, of US$ 10 million, will cover preparatory activities
already carried out and counterpart expenditures for the first year of implementation. Further
installments of US$4 million, US$4 million and US$2 rnillion will be made before the end of the
first, second and third years of implementation, respectively.
Project Execution
2.    The proposed project would be completed in four years The completion date is December
31, 2000, and the Closing Date is June 30, 2001. The National Director will be responsible for
project execution as planned, within time and budget, and with ensuring compliance with all Loan
Agreements. Bank requirements for accounting, administration and procurement procedures will
be the responsibility of the Project Administration Unit (see below).
Procurement
3.    Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised January and August
1996). The bulk of the procurement of goods consists of computer equipment and software for an
estimated USS3.4 million equivalent which will be acquired in packages of not less than USS 350,000
equivalent each by International Competitive Bidding (1CB). No National Competitive Bidding is
contemplated. Miscellaneous computer equipment and software and office and photocopying
equipment required for project implementation and administration, will be acquired by National
Shopping by price comparisons of at least three quotations, in packages valued at less than
USS50,000, up to an aggregate of US$500,000 over the life of the project.
4.    Consulting services will be contracted in accordance with the Guidelinesfor the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August
1981). Out of the total loan amount. USS16.2 million is allocated for consulting services. To the
extent possible, the Borrower would employ consulting firms in preference to individual
consultants for the provision of consulting services to the Project. Individual consultants would be
financed out of the loan only with the prior written approval of the Bank on a case-by-case basis.
5.    Standard contracts, based on the Bank-issued Standard Form of Contracts, and procurement
documentation, based on Bank Standard Bidding Documents, modified as necessary for the purposes
of the project, were agreed with the Government (and the procurement agency where appropriate)
during Negotiations. Agreement was also obtained on formats for the technical specifications in the
case of goods; terms of reference (including objectives, activities, results, performance indicators, and
estimated breakdown of costs) and the use of the Bank's standard Letter of Invitation, for consulting
services.

Bank Prior Review
6.    Prior review by the Bank will be exercised for:
* All goods procured through ICB and consultant contracts under US$100,000
equivalent (in the case of consulting firms) and uncder US$50,000 (in the case of
individual consultants); however, in all cases the Bank would exercise review of terms
of reference for individual consultants or firms.
7.    All contracts would be subject to post-review sampling during supervision missions.
Current arrangements assure that the substantive aspects of 90 percent of contracts will be
reviewed ex-ante by the Bank.
Disbursements and Special Account
8.    The Borrower's financial administration regulations have been reviewed in the context of
previous projects and have been found acceptable for use with a Special Account.
9.    Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against 100 percent' of all activities
identified for Bank financing, exclusive of taxes. The Government is considering entering into an
agreement with a UN agency for the administration of the project and procurement of goods, following
procedures acceptable to the Bank, for an aggregate amount of US$16 million. The remainder, US$4
million, would be disbursed using a Special Account in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of
US$250,000 equivalent, for an estimated four months of average disbursements.
10.   The Special Account would be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank.
The National Social Security Administration would be entitled to make periodic withdrawals from
the Special Account for eligible expenditures upon request from the National Project Director at
the exchange rate applicable on the day such account is debited. The Bank would replenish the
Special Account for the amount of withdrawals for eligible expenditures at the request of the
Borrower.
11.   Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statemenits of Expenditure (SOE) for goods
contracts procured as allowed under national shopping procedures, as well as consultants'
contracts not subject to prior review. The documentation for these expenditures would be
consolidated and maintained by the Project Administration Unit (PAU), and made available for
the required audit as well as to Bank staff during supervision missions. All other expenditures
would also be fully documented, and copies of contracts woulcl be sent to the Bank. Applications
for direct payment and special commitments may be submitted to the Bank provided they are for
amounts equivalent to at least 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation of the Special Account.
Agreement on the use of the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure were obtained at
negotiations.
Accounting and Audits
12.   The Project Administration Unit will upgrade their exislting project accounting and
performance monitoring system. The formats of the reports produced were agreed during
Only if procured through a tax-exempt procurement agency; otherwise disbursements will be made against 82 percent of the
cost of these activities, to take into account the current Argentine VAT of2l percent



20
Negotiations. The accounting system will facilitate the monitoring of the project's financial
information to ensure that all project expenditures and commitments are consistent with the -
project's agreed allocations, including their expenditure categories. The accounting system will
provide information to the government on the project's financial progress.
13.   Annual Audits of the project accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be
perforrned in accordance with appropriate auditing principles applied by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (draft terms of reference for auditors can be found in the project files).
The auditors will: (a) audit the Special Account, SOEs and summary sheets; (b) audit
procurement procedures to report on their compliance with no-objections and Bank procedures
and guidelines; (c) apply auditing standards and procedures satisfactory to the Bank which
conform to generally accepted auditing practices; (d) carry out their auditing work in a timely
manner - an audit report will be presented to the Bank no later than April 30, four months after
the end of the fiscal year; and (e) render an audit opinion or provide reasons why such an opinion
cannot be rendered.
Project Administration
14.   The Project Administration Unit (PAU) will be headed by a project administrator, and
composed of a senior and a junior accountant, a senior and a junior procurement specialist, two
admninistrative assistants and a junior assistant. The project administrator and senior accountant
will be financed by the project, and should have over three years' substantive experience with
Bank procedures and external administration agency procedures. The remaining staff will be
selected from counterpart personnel, and given formal and on-the-job training.
15.   The PAU will report to the Project General Coordinator. Its responsibilities will be to:
* monitor the execution and evaluation of project activities,
* monitor the availability of funds from all financing sources,
* manage and keep records of all procurement operations, ensuring compliance with
Bank guidelines,
* monitor compliance with legal covenants,
* maintain records for all activities,
* manage contracting of technical assistance and consulting services under the project
* prepare the semi-annual progress reports and ensure their submission to the Bank on
time,
* ensure the timely preparation of the annual audit reports (including SOEs and
accounts), and
* prepare relevant portions of the Implementation Completion Report at the close of the
project.
Project Monitoring
16.   The National Director through the project administrator will be responsible for monitoring
project implementation activities as described in the Project Implementation Plan. Annual Action
Plans will be prepared, describing in detail the activities, personnel responsible for their execution,
how the performance of the various activities will be measured and by whom, and other
information necessary for the execution of the project.



21
The National Director will formally present a Semi-Annual Progress Report to a Steering
Committee, chaired by the Secretary of Social Security in the Ministry of Labor. This report will
provide financial and procurement information on project execution as well as performance
indicators to date (input, output, outcome and impact) as described in the last Annual Action
Plan. The Steering Committee will review and approve the Progress Report, including proposed
new Annual Action Plans. These plans will be agreed with the Bank during project supervision in
September of each year. Agreement on the outline of the semi-annual progress report was
obtained during Negotiations.

1999 supervision mission, to measure project progress and impact and agree on activities for the
remainder of the project. This review would also serve as an opportunity to assess the need and
feasibility for a potential follow-up technical assistance loan. This condition was agreed at
Negotiations. The Mid-term review will provide a formal opportunity for the Bank to assess
covenant compliance by the Borrower and ANSeS with regard to the Project, an opportunity
which the Bank nevertheless will have at all other times as well pursuant to the General
Conditions incorporated in the Loan Agreement for this Project.
18.   An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be submitted to the Bank after project
completion and no later than six months after the Loan Closing Date. Included in the ICR will be
an assessment of the execution of the project, costs and benefits derived, the performance of the
Borrower, the World Bank and other agencies involved in their respective obligations and
accomplishments, and lessons learned.

A new structure according to newly agreed objectives has been defined and is being implemented. All
procedures are being reviewed to facilitate operationality and accountability.
Systemic problems:                               The recently-begun Second Reform of the State is addressing basic legal impediments to the introduction of
Inadequate incentives and struclures.            better incentives and structures. This project will finance their revision within ANSeS.
Lack of Ownership:
Supplier-driven objectives                       To a certain extent this is true, as there is a (very natural) tendency for Borrowers to concentrate in the here
and now and leave longer term planning and issues of sustainability for later. The Bank's role in helping the
client to focus on the latter is very important in this context.

beneficiaries in project design stages.
ANeedfor a Champion                              This is crucial in this type of IDTA. A champion is in place now, but given the numerous government changes
in the past months, and the intense pressure to which champions are subjected, their continuity is always
doubtfuil. To dcal with this risk, tlhrece lines of action are considered:
(a) The position of General Manager was created, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
The General Manager is a hand-picked second champion.
(b) The CEO will report periodically to a Steering Committee chaired by the Subsecretary of Social
Security, which approves the semi-annual plans submitted to the Bank and will provide continuity in
case of a change in champions.
(c) In the event of a total change, and given the importance of the champion to implementation, the
Bank will reserve the right to cancel the loan if it considers that the replacements are not willing or
able to continue implementation as planned.
Dependency syndrome                              At present there is a recognized dependency on consulting firms. Institutionalization will be a goal of all
future activities, measured by outcome indicators.

Lack of EID strategy:
Poor diiagnosis of the institutional environment  An extensive diagnosis was carried out by a qualified consulting firm in 1995.

Shortcomings of the project mnodel                Future activities are highly dependent on the results of initial activities. For cxample, only after tlie review of
the first 20,000 or so files will enough information be available to carry out a cost/benefit analysis on the
scope of this exercise. To err on the side of caution, only 500,000 files are scheduled for review in this stage.
However, it is strongly felt that at least 1,000,000 files will eventually have to be reviewed. During the mid-
term review, the need for a follow-on project will be studied

building.
Ioo maniy unpriorilized objectives and components    The scope of the project is limited to one agency; priorities are set and revised by a project committee
composed of the agency's senior management.
Absence of appropriate performance indicators.     A Key Objectives and Performance Indicators Table has been prepared and can be found in the Techinical
Annex (page 31).
Too much or too little design flexibility         The implementation is designed to take into account the necd for flexibility as implementation proceeds. The
annual Plan of Action agreed with the Bank, as well as the mid-term review (see above) are designed to
preclude excessivC flexibility. 



Weak borrower management:
S,or-tAg.- aJskillc' d 7:1 project manaugers      The agency's managcrs will implcmciit thcir comilpoInciies. Fo support tlicin, a projcct administrator wit l
many years' experience with Bank projects has been hired. In addition, managers will receive training on
planning and change management.
Rent-seeking permitted                            A Fraud Control Unit will be formed to fight corruption.
Unsuitable expatriate experts; underuse or overuse    To minimize damage, expatriate consultants will be hired for short periods of time and their terms of
of local consultants                             reference will request results instead of defining functions. To preclude overuse of local consultants, only two
local individual consultants are planned (project administrator and project accountant). Given the healthy
state of Argentina's consulting industry and the prevalent strong desire to utilize local consultants, underuse
is not an issue.
Inadequate monitoring, evaluation and             Terms of reference have already been issued to request offers for a financial management system; a financial
accountability.                                   information system will be implemented through this project; internal contracts and a service orientation will
introduce evaluation and accountability.
Inadequate change/closure of nonperforming        Performance indicators will assist in identifying slow performing components; a decision on their
components; slow response to new opportunities.   continuation will be formally made during supervision missions, but can be made at any other time if
necessary. As to the second, the fact that there is no separately -financed Project Coordination or
Implementation Unit (since senior managers are responsible for project execution) ensures that issues will not
be ignored by the agency.



Supplier Shortcomings:
Insufficiently experienced staff              As mentioned above, managers will be trained and also supported by an experienced project administrator.
All other activities will be carried out by consulting firms with a mandate to institutionalize their activities.
Inadequate supervision and management oversight   A management information system will assist the Project Implementation Team, lcd by ANSeS' General
Manager. Monthly reports on project implementation by activity will be reviewed by the Team.
Inadequate monitoring and evaluation, and     Agreement with the Bank on annual Work Plans and Targets is a loan condition. Responsibilities for
accountability                                monitoring and evaluation are part of the Project Implementation Team's terms of reference.
