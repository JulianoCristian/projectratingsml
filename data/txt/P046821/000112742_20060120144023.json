The following lessons were learned: A key factor\n            to ensure sustainability is the continuity of reform-minded\n            administrators. The departure of 'champions'\n            endangers the sustainability of modernization processes.\n            Finding adequate mechanisms to ensure sustainability has to\n            be a priority at the onset of the modernization process.\n            Distinguish between modernization and anti-corruption\n            efforts when tackling an agency's overhaul.  Accurately\n            diagnose corruption before embarking on a full-fledged\n            anticorruption campaign.  Different strategies exist with\n            respect to agency modernization. Use of consultants brings a\n            danger of generating a dependency or resistance on the part\n            of the bureaucracy.  Identify measurable landmarks to\n            demonstrate the progress made and ensure its sustainability.\n            Purposely encouraging bottom-up participation can foster\n            innovation, enhance ownership and strengthen sustainability.\n            Building a direct relation with the public can help top\n            agency managers   Rotating managers among the various\n            divisions can help management develop a more holistic\n            understanding of the overall agency  Public agencies can\n            play an important role in revitalizing their constituencies.\n            Losing focus becomes a challenge in institutional\n            development projects with a longer life span.  Maintaining\n            the impetus of modernization efforts remains a challenge,\n            particularly when reaching performance thresholds.\n            Distinguish between potential and actual savings when\n            designing monitoring and impact indicators"}, "docdt": "2005-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
