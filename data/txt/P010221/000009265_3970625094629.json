project is to improve the quality of primary education in\n            Pakistan.  The proposed project would cover about 14,000\n            schools in Sind, Baluchistan and North West Frontier\n            Provinces.  Quality improvement would be achieved by more\n            effective in-service training and supervision of teachers,\n            improved learning materials, the expanded use of assistant\n            teachers, improved physical facilities, and greater\n            community support.  The success of the proposed project will\n            depend mainly on whether teachers can be influenced\n            sufficiently to improve the quality of teaching. The project\n            would adopt a new approach to teacher training through the\n            development of integrated learning modules for teacher\n            training and classroom use."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
