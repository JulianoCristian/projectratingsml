Education Project for Pakistan was marginally satisfactory.\n            The project achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of both the Bank\n            and Borrower was less than satisfactory. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, the tranche approach\n            used in this project was unworkable because it was\n            inconsistent with the Government's own project planning\n            and approval system. Also, a number of the prerequisites for\n            effective tranche programming simply were not present.\n            Second, the project introduced innovations and techniques\n            that were outside the norms and values of the organizations\n            administering the project. Finally, insufficient attention\n            was paid to management and organizational issues."}, "docdt": "1995-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
