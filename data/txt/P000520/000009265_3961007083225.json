Project\n            comprises the following four components: (a) stimulation of\n            employment generation by providing (i) credit assistance and\n            management support for small- and micro-enterprises, (ii)\n            technical assistance tailored to their needs, and (iii)\n            assistance to laid-off public employees; (b) improvement of\n            primary health care and social services by (i) restructuring\n            and expanding the network of these services in\n            N'Djamena, including the construction and operation of\n            three integrated health-social centers, three dispensaries\n            and three maternity centers, and (ii) strengthening the\n            regional health services in the Prefecture of Tandjile in\n            the cotton zone; (c) improvement of N'Djamena's\n            sanitation infrastructure by (i) rehabilitating the drainage\n            system in two flood-prone areas where a high percentage of\n            low-income families live, and (ii) improving public hygiene\n            through increased community participation and use of\n            labor-intensive public works techniques; and (d)\n            strengthening of social policy planning by (i) undertaking\n            small sample household surveys in the cotton zone and three\n            cities, an integrated nationwide household survey, and\n            socioeconomic studies, and (ii) assisting the Government in\n            defining future social policies and actions targeted at\n            vulnerable population groups."},
