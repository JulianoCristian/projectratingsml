uncertain. The Bank\n            performance had mixed results, since identification,\n            preparation, and appraisal were satisfactory, but\n            supervision was deficient due to a number of weaknesses.\n            Inadequate supervision, coupled with unexpected business\n            related costs, were conducive to poor administrative\n            practices, mostly due to unfamiliarity with Government\n            procedures. Likewise, for the borrower's performance,\n            being preparation satisfactory, while implementation\n            deficient. Reform policies were unclear, and, the perception\n            is, that credit resources were rather intended as a\n            short-term financing mechanism to cover the\n            government's budget constraints. Key lessons include:\n            1) The principal failing of this project was the lack of\n            government ownership, and commitment to reforms, for, while\n            momentum for reform existed at preparation, political\n            instability hindered success. 2) In the absence of\n            institutional capacity, project design should include\n            training for local staff. 3) The Bank should be prepared to\n            allocate resources according to each operation's\n            particular needs, thus, responsiveness to changing\n            situations, would produce positive results, through the\n            continuity, and strength of a team approach. 4) In the\n            absence of expected outcomes, restructuring should be\n            considered, and, the Mid-term Review reinforced to evaluate\n            performance in pursuit of those outcomes."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
