The credit will\n            finance three catagories of expenditure: (i) laboratory\n            equipment, vehicles, drugs, molluscicides, consulting\n            services and training for the governorates being added to\n            the national program; (ii) replacement of obsolete and\n            depreciated laboratory equipment and vehicles; retraining of\n            staff; and purchase of drugs and pesticides for governorates\n            included earlier in the national program; and (iii)\n            consultancy services, computers, vehicles and research funds\n            to strengthen the central agency charged with planning and\n            executing the program."}, "docdt": "1992-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
