MIMORANDUM AND RECO)MMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUT DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSEI) CREDIT TO TE ARAB RIEUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A NATIONAL SCHISTOSOMIASIS CONTROL PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed developmen. credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt) for SDR19.60 million
(US$26.84 miLion equivalent) to help finance a national schistosomiasis control project. The
credit would be extended at standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years.
2.          Economic Situatlol. The country's economic performance during FY91 and the
first half of FY92 has been better than anticipated. The Government estimates that real GDP
increased by around 2 percent in FY91, compared with a projected decline of 1.5 percent.
Current projections call for a very low, but still positive growth in FY92. This is partly due to
the strong rebound in tourism, workers' remittances, Suez Canal dues, agnculture and
construction. The exchange rate of the Egyptian pound vis-a-vis key currencies has remained
stable despite the wide differential between inflation rates of Egypt and the industrial countries.
The balance of payments performance has been particularly strong. The current account balance
(including official grants which currently average about US$1.1 billion a year) swung from a
deficit of about US$2.6 billion in FY90 to a surplus of US$2.4 billion in FY91, mainly because
of official gants. A surplus of about US$1.2 billion is now projected for FY92. This has been
achieved mainly as a result of the Paris Club debt relief (about US$1.5 billion a year in terms
of savings in interest and amortization payments), while imports have increased only modestly.
3.          Sector Back. The life expectancy of Egyptians is estimated to be about
62 years for females and 59 years for males-about five years less than the average for lower
middle income countries. The infant mortality rate is about 65 deaths per thousand live births.
Egypt's modest achievements in overcoming health problems are surprising since it has one of
the most extensive health care programs to be found in the developing world. Everyone lives
within five kdlometers of a government health facility and the ratio of physicians to population
is more than twice the average for middle income countries. The low productivity of the health
care system has been the focus of concern by both the Government and donors for many years.
4.          Since the mid-1980s, the Government has assigned priority to programs of
preventive medicine and rural health care, and has sought to reduce reliance on physicians and
hospitals. In 1991, 47 percent of the national investment budget for health was assigned to
preventive health care activities such as immunization, maternal health care, family planning,
school health, and health education.
5.          Overal Perdormance of the Health Sector. While the health of Egyptians has
improved significantly over the past thirty years, the gains have not been commensurate with the
commitment of national resources to the sector, and are not impressive when contrasted with the



accomplishments of other lower-middle income countries. The disappointing performance of
the health care system is due primarily to problems of staff morale and productivity; shortages
of specific items of equipment; scarcities of essential drugs; and, most importantly, defects in
the design of programs.
6.          Rationale for Bank/IA Involvement. Development of Egypt's human resources
is key to its economic development, as well as to the welfare of its people. Schistosomiasis is
Egypt's most serious parasitic disease. In areas where control is not being attempted, up to 80
percent of the population is infected. In 1991 about 75 percent of the 54 million people living
in Egypt resided in rural areas where the threat of infection exists. The disease is transmitted
by fresh water snails. It is usually contracted during childhood but produces pronounced
symptoms only after ten to twenty years. The importance of the disease igas increased
significantly as a result of investments in irrigation facilities and completion of the Aswan High
Dam in 1962 which ensured year around supplies of irrigation water to farms thereby sharply
increasing the prevalence and intensity of the infection.
7.          The disease is the most important cause of disability and death in rural Egypt
among males between the ages of 30 and 45 years. The Government of Egypt has mounted
several major campaigns to control the disease, beginning in 1922. The technologies for
interrupting transmission and treating infected persons have improved substantially since then,
with especially important breakthroughs occurring during the late 1970s. Several donors,
including the Government of Germany, the United States, the African Development Bank (ADB)
and the World Bank, have supported the Gove.rnment's efforts to control the disease.
Nonetheless, between five and six million Egyptians remain infected; five to eight percent of
them are likely to develop serious complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices
and bladder cancer.
8.          Project Objectives. The proposed project will help the MOH to develop an
efficient and sustainable national program for the control of schistosomiasis. First, the project
will provide funds to implement a program to screen and treat the roughly 17 million people
living in five governorates of the Nile Delta who have not been the focus of past national control
efforts. Second, it will finance the rehabilitation of existing facilities in the other 20 rural
governorates. And third, the project will assist the EDCD with consulting services and central
facilities to enable it to strengthen its capacity to design, plan and implement schistosomiasis
control activities. It is intended to serve as a model for the development of strategies and
management systems for other health programs as well.
9.          Project Description. The project will finance (a) the upgrading of simple
diagnostic laboratory facilities in rural health centers and dispensaries, (b) the training of
laboratory technicians and surveillance workers in monitoring the prevalence of the disease and
identifying transmission sites; (c) the retraining of laboratory technicians in modern techniques
of parasitology; (d) procurement and distribution of laboratory supplies and drugs during the
attack phase of the program when the disease is being brought under control; (e) the purchase
of vehicles in order to strengthen the monitoring of field activities and the distribution of drugs
- 2 -



and laboratory supplies; (f) the development of central facilities for the evaluation and design
of control activities; and (g) the purchase of consulting services in order to strengthen Anancial
management and staff supervision.
10.        Project Costs and Financing. To achieve the above objectives, the project would
provide about US$24 million for the development of facilities and staff and the purchase of drugs
and molluscicides in order to serve the five governorates of the Delta Region; about US$16
million will be needed to refurbish laboratory facilities, retrain field workers and replace
vehicles in order to make the programs in Upper and Middle Egypt sustainable; about US$1
million will be required for consulting services, central laboratory facilities, computers, vehicles,
laboratory supplies, drugs and pesticides to enable the Endemic Diseases Control Department
(EDCD) to strengthen the management of the national program. IDA, together with co-
financiers, will finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of the project. If co-financing
arrangements are not finalized by December 31, 1993, the duration of the project will be
reduced from six to four years. The Government of Egypt will finance local investment costs
of US$6 million and meet local recurrent costs. IDA has earmarked US$26.84 million
equivalent for the project. Project costs and financing are presented in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods ofprocurement are shown in Schedule B. The timetable of key prcessing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Egypt are provided in Schedules C and D
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10513-EGT dated June 2, 1992, is being
distributed separately.
.11.        Project mplementation. The project will be implemented by the EDCD which
has an international reputation for leadership and professional excellence in schistosomiasis
control. The EDCD has successfully implemented six control programs assisted by the World
Bank, ADB, USAID and the Government of Germany. The Department currently has a staff
of 65 persons including seven medical doctors and twelve agricultural engineers (responsible for
surveillance and control of snails) and is familiar with IDA procurement and financial reporting
requirements. The Directorate of Project Administration at EDCD would be maintained to
implement the proposed project, with staffing and terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
12.        Proect Sustainability. This project will assist the EDCD in developing a sustain-
able program for the control of schistosomiasis. The project will implement the attack phase
of the program in the five governorates in which control has not yet been achieved and will
strengthen the management and strategic planning capacities of the EDCD to enable it to better
design and carry out the maintenance phase of the national program. The project will simplify
the disease control strategy through appropriate targeting of screening and treatment activities,
and through rigorous evaluation of the costs and effects of elements of the control strategy. At
the completion of the project, the EDCD will have in place systems, procedures and trained staff
to operate the program on a maintenance basis. The cost of program operations will then be
about $3.5 million a year or 11 US cents per person protected, which is sustainable.
13.        Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Bank has supported control
activities in Upper and Middle Egypt through components of irrigation and drainage projects.
- 3 -



An independent international panel evaluated these efforts in 1985, and found they have been
carred out satisfactorily, and that the outcomes of the program have fully met expectations. The
panel endorsed plans to extend the control program to the Delta region.
14.         A    s. The following actions were agreed by the Government at
negotiations: (a) the EDCD would carry out operational research studies and modify the control
strategy in accordance with the findings of the studies; (b) the EDCD would report annually on
the findings of its operational research and strategic planning. At the end of the third year, a
review of the project would be held to assess the progress of the agreed studies and evaluate the
overall performance of the control program; (c) the EDCD would introduce new forms for
reporting on the incidence of schistosomiasis that would allow a single record to be maintained
for each child for the duration of his or her schooling, and would implement data editing and
data management procedures to control the quality of statistical information; (d) the EDCD each
year would prepare a strategic operational plan and a budget that reflects the Government's
tentative allocation of funds to the program, and the problems and results being experienced by
it; (e) the Government would designate the Director of Project Administration, EDCD, with
staffing and terms of reference acceptable to IDA, to coordinate the work of implementing
governorates, monitor progress, keep project accounts and liaise with IDA; (f) the EDCD would
maintain separate accounts for the project; (g) the Government, within six months of the end of
each fiscal year, would provide IDA with an audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may
reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against a
certified statement of expenditures; and (h) the Government would conduct all snail control
activities, regardless of the source of financing, in compliance with criteria agreed with the
Association. Co-financing by two European governments will be confirmed.
15.         Environmental Aspects.  The proposed project, rated as a category "BW
operation, would not have any adverse effects on the environment. Instead, it will lead to a
reduction in the use of molluscicides to control the snails that transmit schistosomiasis, a practice
that has led to the death of commercially valuable fish in canals and drains.
16.        Program Objective Categories. This project will significantly reduce the human
burden and economic consequences of schistosomiasis for more than 17 million people, most of
whom are low-income residents of Egypt's villages. The project will also rationalize the use of
chemical pesticides used to control snails in water courses and ponds and thereby reduce the
damage being done to the fish population.
17.        Prjc Benefits. The project is composed of three components. The first would
reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection with schistosomiasis among the 17 million people
living in the five governorates of Dakahlia, Sharlda, Qualubia, Beheira and Rural Alexandria,
in the Eastern and Western Delta regions of the country. This component is expected, by the
conclusion of the project, to have reduced the number of persons in.ected with schistosomes by
about two-thirds. If one assumes that society would be willing to pay US$600 in order increase
the length of the average victim's life by a year, that the average age at death due to
schistosomiasis is 40 years, and that the project will yield returns for 25 years, the internal rate
-4-



of r3tun for this component would be 40 percent. The second component would help to devise
and implement a cost-efficient maintenance strategy for the national control program. A
preliminary assessment of the impact of these measures suggests a cost reduction of at least 15
percent. The third would assist the government in developing a more efficient and sustainable
strategy for the long-term control of schistosomiasis throughout the country. These choices
would be based on a set of studies to be undertaken by the EDCD. If the findings of the studies
confirm the consensus of professional judgement, a reduction in operating costs of about LE6.00
million (US$2.00 million) a year could be achieved.
18.        Eisks. Obtaining the full benefit from improvements in management will
necessitate that the MOH modify its intervention strategy and redeploy human resources. The
success of these initiatives will demand political resolve. However, the project would be viable
even without these changes.
19.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
