{"cdata!": "The ratings for the National\n            Schistosomiasis Control Project for Egypt were as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            project and program experience reveal that a single-purpose\n            public health intervention, such as the schistosomiasis\n            program, is amenable to success because its purpose is\n            clear, its goals and objectives explicit and easily\n            quantifiable, and its interventions well defined.\n            Nevertheless, such a program, even when it incorporates\n            state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies, is unlikely to\n            be fully cost-effective if its strategies are not (i)\n            well-adapted to the country context; and (ii) periodically\n            assessed and revised to take into account program progress,\n            new knowledge and technologies and evolutions in the country\n            context.  The design of rigorous, technically sound\n            evaluation studies, specifically tailored to inform the\n            adjustment of intervention strategies for improved\n            performance and outcome, is a necessary, but insufficient\n            condition for improved strategic management and cost\n            effectiveness. Such studies are unlikely to be carried out\n            and effectively used in the absence of other essential\n            conditions, such as: the conviction of managers and\n            decision-makers of the value added of such studies; the\n            willingness to finance them; the capacity to undertake (or\n            commission) them; and well-defined processes and incentives\n            to exploit study results for decision-making."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
