  IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellenceand independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities of theWorld Bankfor two purposes:
first,to ensurethe integrityofthe Bank'sself-evaluationprocessandto verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
expected results, and second, to help develop improveddirections,policies, and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannually assesses about25 percent of
the Banks lendingoperationsthrough field work. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likelyto generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review,and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review; the borrowers'comments are attachedto
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessmentreporthas beensent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multipleevaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibilityto adapt to
lendinginstrument,projectdesign, or sectoralapproach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basicmethodto
arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand rating scale usedfor each evaluationcriterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank,org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation'smajor relevant objectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has threedimensions:relevance, efficacy, and efficiency.Relevanceincludes
relevance of objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extentto which the project's
objectivesare consistent with the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporategoals (expressedin Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
AssistanceStrategies,Sector Strategy Papers,OperationalPolicies).Relevance of design is the extentto which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the statedobjectives.Eficacyis the extent to which the project'sobjectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved, taking into account their relativeimportance.Efficiency is the
extent to which the projectachieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capital
and benefitsat least cost comparedto alternatives. The efficiencydimensiongenerallyis not applied to adjustment
operations.Possiblerafingsfor Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes (or
expectedoutcomes) will not be maintained(or realized).Possibleratingsfor Risk to DevelopmentOufcome: High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensuredquality at entry of the
operationand supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operationof supportedactivities after loanlcreditclosing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor BankPerformance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower(includingthe government and implementing
agencyor agencies) ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and
agreements, towardthe achievementof development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementing agency(ies) performance.Possibleratingsfor BorrowerPerformance: Highly

PREFACE

        This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Egypt
National Schistosomiasis project, financed through IDA Credit No. 2403 inthe amount of
US$26.8 million (19.6 million SDR), withplanned cofinancing and government
counterpart contributioninthe respective amounts o fUS$10.4 million andUS$6.0
million. The credit was approved on June 25, 1992, became effective on June 15, 1993,
and was 83 percent disbursed (with3.4 million SDR cancelled) when it closed on
September 30,2002, three years andthree months after the originally planned closing
date.

        The findings o fthis assessment are based on an Independent EvaluationGroup
(IEG) missionto the Arab Republic of Egypt carriedout inNovember 2007. The mission
met inCairo with authorities and staff o fthe Ministryo f Health and Population and
seIected development partners. The mission also undertook field visits inthe
Governorates o f Alexandria, Menoufia, Menya, and Qena where it met with health
authorities, services providers and stakeholders and assessedinputs and activities
supported by the Bank. Key sources o f evidence consulted include: (a) World Bank
project files; (b) project-related reportingandevaluation; and (c) epidemiological data,
studies, surveys andresearch on health, much o f it generated inEgypt.

        This PPARcontributes to a forthcoming evaluationby IEGofthe World Bank's
support to health, nutrition andpopulation (HNP) sector outcomes over the past decade
(1997 -2007). Itis one o f apackage o f three assessmentsofthe Bank's HNP sector
support to the Arab Republic of Egypt, the other two comprising: (a) a PPARon the
EgyptPopulationProject (Credit 2830-EGT); and(b) a case study onthe development
effectiveness of the Bank's lendingandnon-lending support to HNP sectors. While the
National Schistosomiasis Control project was designed prior to the decade under review,
its implementationperiod largely coincides with this period, during a time when the
Bank's HNP support to Egyptwas transitioning from single-purpose programs to health

 SUMMARY

         Schistosomiasishas beena major public health problem inEgyptfor thousands ofyears.
Itis causedbymicroscopic flatworms that live insnail-infested fresh water. When peoplewade,
 swimor bathe incontaminatedwater, the flatworms penetratethe skin, travel inthe bloodand
 cause anemia, diarrhea, internal bleeding, and organ damage, which can leadto cancer anddeath.
Water becomes contaminated byworm eggswhen infected people urinate or defecate init.
Egyptians are highly susceptibleto the disease given that the great majority o fthe population i s
concentrated inthe Nile DeltaandNileValley and around canals therein. Since 1922, after the
discovery o fthe role o f snails inthe transmission o fthe disease, Egypthas undertaken activities
to control schistosomiasiswith strong government commitment. Over the years the technologies
for fightingthe disease(drugs for treatment, andmolluscicides for snail control) became
 increasingly effective with fewer and less severe side effects. At the time of project design, the
National SchistosomiasisControl Programme(NSCP) was found not to be fully exploitingthe
newtechnologies for optimum program effectiveness.

         The objectives ofthe National SchistosomiasisControl Project (the project) were to "...
(a) expandthe coverage and improve the operation of the NSCP; and (b) strengthen the capacity
o fthe Endemic DiseasesControlDepartment (EDCD) to design, evaluate andadjust the national
strategy for the control o f schistosomiasis." Key performance indicators included: the extension
o fthe programto five governorates(and 17 million people) ofthe Eastern and Western areas of
the NileDelta, thereby increasing coveragefrom about 75 percentto 100percentofthe
population; the reduction o fthe prevalence of infectionfrom more than 35 percent o f the
population to less than 10percent; the adoption ofmodern diagnostic technologies for improved
control o f schistosomiasis in2Igovernorates inMiddle and Upper Egyptandthe Suez Canal
region, where the program had already been operating, that would result inmore sensitive and
less costly screening and more cost-effective control o ftransmission; the reduction o f control
strategy costs by about 15 percent; and the achievement o fthe financial sustainability o fNSCP.

         Assistance was channeledthrough two components. The NSCP component was designed
to extendprogram activities to the yet uncoveredgovernorates inthe Nile Deltaand to
consolidate and modernize existing control activities, by providing laboratory equipment and
supplies, drugs, molluscicides, vehicles, technical assistanceandtraining. The EDCD component
includedtechnical assistance, training, and office equipment to strengthen management
evaluation capacity o fthe EDCD, and the financing o f evaluation studies to support the
application and fine-tuningo ftechnologies and strategies inthe Egyptianoperational context.

        Program expansion and modernization. With the support o fthe project and the parallel
financing of the African Development Bank (AfDB), the NSCP achieved national coverage with
its successful expansion to five governoratesof the Delta andto newly reclaimed lands,
developedthrough irrigation projects to attractmigrants from other parts ofEgypt. New
screeningtechnologies for detecting the two strains o f schistosomiasis inEgypt(urinary and
intestinal) that are rapid, simple, less expensiveand more sensitive than technologies previously
usedwere adoptedbythe NSCP and implemented nationwide. However, surveillance strategies
were not refined and are not uniformly implementedthroughout the country. The project
supportedthe implementation o fthe mass treatment (chemotherapy) strategy, under which all
villagers and school children inhighprevalenceareas were treated with the drug, Praziquantel, a
change from the previous strategyo ftreating only those found to be infected. This new strategy
not only reduces the intensity o fthe infection andmorbidity. It also reduces further the
contamination o f canals and other water sources by infected humans. With project support the

                                                   x


 NSCP also adopted and implemented a new snail control strategy, under which canals and drains
 are surveyed less frequently and molluscicide i s applied ina more focused area. Furthermore,
 snail control i s now used as a supportive strategy to mass chemotherapy.

          Program costs have been reduced considerably. The price o f Praziquantel(for treatment)
 decreasedby 75 percent between 1995 and 2001 and the doses administered declined from 9.9
 millionin 1997to 0.7 million in2006. Between 1995 and 2001 the price o f Niclosamide (for
 snail control) decreasedby 76 percent and the annual consumption decreased from 85 tons to 10.2
 tons. The Government o fEgypt now finances the entire cost o fprogram implementation, but
 financing does not cover operations research, which has not been institutionalized.

          Program capacity building. The project, together with other relevant support provided
 by USAID, failedto develop withinEDCDMoH a capacity and discipline for carrying out
 evaluation and other operationally relevant studies and for systematically usingthe results to
 adjust program strategy. While research and development studies supported by USAID did
 inform to some extent refinements inthe control strategy, the complementary evaluation studies
 planned under the project were not carried out. As a consequence the evidence base is lackingto
 fine-tune various elements o f the strategy for improved efficiency and effectiveness (e.g.,
 frequency o f screening and treatment; cut-off values for snail control; timeframe for follow-up
 treatment, and innovations for multi-sectoral behavior change interventions, among others).
Technical capacity for policy and strategy formulation and for program design, planning and
evaluation remains insufficient and overly centralized. Government's reluctance to use technical
assistance and consulting services programmed under the project resulted inthe neglect o f key
areas for strengthening, including: capacity o f middle-management; systems for budgeting and
accounting; pedagogical supervision and technical backstoppingo f fi-ont-line health workers; and
quality control and validation o f program data. There i s evidence that capacity o f health workers
inprimaryhealthcarefacilities falls short ofprogramexigencies, interms ofskillsand
availability o f staff.

          Outcomesand attribution. The prevalence o fS. mansoni (the cause o f intestinal
schistosomiasis) among the general population inthe Delta declined from a level o f 14.8 percent
in 1993 (the year ofproject effectiveness) to 2.7 percent in2002 (theyear ofproject closing) and
continuedto decline inthe ensuing years, reaching a level o f 1.5 percent in2006. Likewise, the
prevalence o fS. haematobium (the cause o f urinary schistosomiasis) among the general
population inMiddle and Upper Egypt declined from a level o f 6.6 percent in 1993 to 1.9 percent
in2002, andcontinuedto decline thereafter, reaching a levelof 1.2 percentin2006. Project
support to the expansion, modernization and strengtheningo fNSCP activities is assessed to have
directly contributed to declines inprevalence because investments enabled NSCP to implement
nationwide treatment and prevention interventions, applying the latest technologies, that are
knownto be effective in controlling schistosomiasis. The Bank's support made up one third o f
all external aid for the NSCP disbursed duringthe project period. Public health research suggests
that investments inwater supply, sanitation and drainage made before, duringand after the time
o f project implementation are likely to have contributedto declines inprevalence, butthe impact
o f these investments on schistosomiasis inEgypthas not been evaluated.

         The outcome o f the project i s rated moderately satisfactory overall. The outcome o f the
first objective is satisfactory, based on its substantial relevance, efficacy and eficiency. The
outcome o fthe second objective is unsatisfactory, based on its negligible efficacy and modest
relevance and efficiency. Risk to development outcome is rated as substantial. The Bank's
performance was moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was moderately
unsatisfactory.

Lessons

    Project and program experiencereveal that a single-purposepublic health intervention, such
    as the schistosomiasisprogram, is amenableto success because its purpose is clear, its goals
    and objectives explicit and easily quantifiable, and its interventions well defined.

    Nevertheless, such a program, even when it incorporates state-of-the-art knowledge and
    technologies, is unlikelyto be fully cost-effective ifits strategies are not (i)
                                                                                  well-adapted to
    the country context and(ii)  periodically assessed andrevisedto take into account program
    progress, new knowledge andtechnologies and evolutions inthe country context.

    The design o frigorous, technically sound evaluation studies, specifically tailored to inform
    the adjustment of intervention strategiesfor improved performance andoutcome, is a
    necessary, but insufficient condition for improvedstrategicmanagementand cost-
    effectiveness. Such studies are unlikelyto be carried out and effectively used inthe absence
    o f other essential conditions, such as: the conviction ofmanagers and decision-makers o fthe
    value added o f such studies; the willingness to finance them; the capacity to undertake (or
    commission) them; andwell-defined processesand incentives to exploit study results for
    decision-making.


Challenges

         Sixyears have passedsinceproject closing. While the lessonsremain relevant, new
developments pose additional challengesto their application. The full support and continued
implementation o f schistosomiasisactivities will needto be ensured inthe new context and
incentive structure embeddedinEgypt's Health Sector Reform Program. The development by
MoHPEDCD with WHO assistance ofa proposal in2007, which changesthe national
schistosomiasis strategy fiom control to eradication, requires new investments, intensified efforts
and further adjustments to program strategy and organization. While incremental financing is
neededto support this more aggressive strategy, (i)   partnersthat havetraditionally investedinthe
NSCP (USAID, AfDB andthe World Bank) have reorientedtheir support aroundHealth Sector
Reform, and (ii) as o f 1999Egyptachieved lower middle-income status and graduatedfiom IDA
to IBRDlending. The costing and financing o fthis new strategy, as well as its appropriate
integration into health reformefforts, will be critical to its success.

 1. BACKGROUNDAND CONTEXT

SCHISTOSOMIASIS INEGYPT

 1.1      Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, i s endemic in74 developingcountries,
infecting more than200 millionpeople inrural andperi-urban areas worldwide.                  Ithas
been a major public healthproblem inEgypt for thousands o f years,2 andi s Egypt's
leadingparasitic infection.

 1.2      Characteristics. The major forms o f humanschistosomiasis are causedby
species o f water-born flatworm, or blood flukes, called schistosomes, two of which are
found inEgypt. Schistosoma mansoni (5'. mansoni), prevalent inLower Egypt (the Delta
area), causes intestinal schistosomiasis; andS. haematobium, prevalent inMiddle and
Upper Egypt, causes urinary schistosomiasis. Water becomes contaminated by worm
eggswhen infectedpeople urinate or defecate init. Humansbecome infectedthrough
contact with infestedsurface water at which time schistosomes enter the body. This
diseaseparticularly affects people engaged inagriculture and fishing, as well as the poor,
who rely on infected water sources for bathing and domestic chores. Rural to urban
migration inEgypt i s introducing the disease into peri-urban areas andpopulation
movements are spreading it to other areas. The opening up o f newly reclaimedlands
through ambitious irrigation initiatives to render desert lands arable i s attracting migrants
from other parts o f Egypt, some o fwhom are infected. The health and economic effects
o f schistosomiasis are considerable. Severe urinary schistosomiasis causes serious
kidney damage; and severe intestinalschistosomiasis can leadto serious liver disease,
spleen enlargement, vomiting o f blood and, ultimately, death. Severe schistosomiasis
also leads to increased rates o f cancer, particularly o fthe bladder. Morbidity caused by
heavy schistosome infectionimpairs the physical andmental health o f children
(negatively impactingtheir performance inschool), and undermines adults' ability to earn
income and contribute to economic development (Hotez et al., 2007).

1.3      Diagnosisand Treatment. Urinary schistosomiasis is diagnosed bymethods to
detect blood inthe urine (a filtration technique, visual inspection o furine specimens, or
the use o f chemical reagent strips to detect microscopic blood). The eggs of intestinal
schistosomiasis can be detected infecal specimens through a technique usingcellophane
soaked inglycerine, or between glass slides. Available since 1988, Praziquanteli s the
only available drugtreatment, which is effective against all forms o f schistosomiasis,
with few, transient side effects andvery low cost (anaverage treatment costs about
US$0.20 -0.30). Eventhoughre-infectionmay occur after treatment, the risk o f
developing severely diseased organs i s dramatically diminished withtreatment and even
reversed inyoung children.

  1.4      Cost-Effective     intervention^.^ A review o f evidence by world experts identifies
 a cost-effective package o f interventions for schistosomiasis control, comprised of: (a)
 periodic screening and (mass or selective) treatment o f high-riskgroups (e.g., school
 children andpopulations livinginhigh-infection areas); (b) improved sanitationto reduce
 water contamination(but to be effective sanitation infrastructure and services should
 cover a highpercentage o f the population); (c) health education promotingthe use o f
 latrines andhygienic behavior, a cheaper and faster way to reduce water contamination;
 and(d) inspecific epidemiologicalconditions, the environmentalor chemical control of
 snails for reducingtransmission.

 GOVERNMENT'S         RESPONSE

 1.5      General Health Sector Goals and Strategies. Egypt's second Five-Year Plan,
 coveringthe period 1987-1992, sought to improve access to health services for all
 segments o f the population, through: (i)        provision o f preventive care services or the early
 detection andtreatment o f infectious diseases (schistosomiasis beinga priority disease);
 (ii)provision o f basic healthcare services; (iii)        provisiono f curative services; and (iv)
 localproductiono fmedicines.

 1.6      Schistosomiasis Control i s recognized as a highpriority bypolitical leaders, the
 general public andhealthworkers4 Annex C-1provides a timeline, which documents
 landmarksinEgypt's longhistory inits fight against the disease, briefly summarized in
 this section.

 1.7      In1922, soon after the discovery ofthe role of snails inthe transmission ofthe
 disease, Egypt launched a national attack on schistosomiasis, consisting primarilyo f snail
 control, with some treatment ofheavily infected individuals with drugs that produced
 very serious side-effects. Health education efforts launchedinthe 1930sto reduce
 humancontact with surface water failed becauseo fmanyEgyptians' relianceon local
 water points for their survival. Inthe 1960snew, more effective technologies appeared
 on the market:(a) Niclosamide, an environmentally safe molluscicide; and (b) two new
 drugsthat achieved a higher cure rateandproducedfew side-effects thanolder
compounds, but still hadto be administered over a period o f week. Withthe introduction
o f Praziquantel inthe late 197Os, Egyptbeganto combine the treatment o f infected
persons with snail control. The thrust of control activities shifted gradually inthe years
leadingto project design from a strategy o fhaltingtransmission through snail control and
reductionineggs deposited inthe water by humanvictims to one o ftreatment o f
confirmed cases.




  Hotez et al., 2007.
  The highprofile o fthe diseaseinEgyptandstrong national commitment to its control were spontaneously
raisedbymany informants (spanning government officials, local officials, M o H staff and development
partners). The FirstLady is notedby several to behighly committedto its eradication. Itis also cited as a
priority disease under the national health strategy for prevention andearly treatment. Much o fthe literature
reviewedfor this PPARnotes that Egypthas beena world leader inthe fight o f schistosomiasis, since its
discovery inEgypt, andthere i s strong national pride associatedwith the performance and innovationof
this program and Egypt's contribution to internationalexperience and efforts.

 1.8       In1976theNationalSchistosomiasis ControlProgramme (NSCP) was
established within the Ministryo fHealth (MoH), assuming responsibility for overseeing
all schistosomiasis projects inEgypt. In1992 at the time of project appraisal, NSCP's

SUPPORT OF OTHERPARTNERS

 1.9       At the time ofproject designthe African DevelopmentBank(AfDB)had
supported schistosomiasis control activities inEgyptthrough a series o fthree credits,
approved in 1980, 1982 and 1990, respectively, andtotaling some US$27 million. In
 1988 USAID provided Egyptwith a US$39.7 million grant for a Schistosomiasis
Research Project (SRP), which supported the conduct of research anddevelopment
(R&D) studies andresearchcapacity building(see also Box 2-2). Annex Dprovides
more detail on donor support to health ingeneral andto schistosomiasis inparticular.

 1.10      Inadditionto direct support to MoHfor implementingits Schistosomiasis Control
Program, Egyptwas investing substantial sums (using both domestic and external
resources) inwater supply and sanitation, drainage and irrigation, one o fthe four proven
andcomplementarystrategies for the control o f schistosomiasis (para. 1.4). Total support

schistosomiasis, as opposedto the treatment o fthe general population.
6 Selective mollusciciding impliedthe spreading o f a chemicalto kill snails inwater bodies where the
prevalence o f schistosomiasis was greater than20 percent.
7 Limitedinterventions were carried out inthis area, buthadnot significantly reducedprevalence. They
included: care for victims o f schistosomiasisby primary health care facilities, annual screening of school
children ingrades one and six, and examination andtreatment o f symptomatic outpatients. Snail control
was limitedto the checking o f major canals and drains and the application of copper sulfate where infected
snails were found; and modemmolluscicides were generally not available. A thirdAfDB credit was
approved in 1989 to support control activities in the Nile Delta, but it didnot start disbursinguntil 1992.

 that the impact of these investments on schistosomiasis prevalence has been evaluated.

 WORLD BANKSUPPORT

 1.11 HNP Sector. IDA financedtwo populationprojects (approved in 1973 and
 1978), whose objectives were to expand and improve family planningservices, including
the strengtheningofhealthinfrastructureandMoH's capacity. These projectswere
judged at completionnot to have achieved their objectives, the second one cancelled after
 7 years o f implementation. Lessons emanating from these two projects pointedto key
conditions for project success, which had beenabsentduring these projects' designand
implementation: clearly stated objectives; the involvement o f the Borrower and key
stakeholders indesign; the firm commitment of the Borrower and its implementers;
sufficient implementationcapacity; clearly definedprocedures andprocesses. The
National Schistosomiasis Control Project was the Bank's third support to Egypt's MoH,
butthe first to investina standalone diseaseprogram. The projectwas identifiedin
 1987, a year after the second population project was cancelled because o f serious
implementationdifficulties and low Government commitment. The project concept was
rooted inthe results o f an international evaluation o fEgypt's schistosomiasis program
undertaken in 1985, which called for programexpansion to cover the Delta region. The
Bank,havingfinanced schistosomiasis controlthrough irrigationprojects (para 1.12),
was ready to continue anddeepen its assistancethrough a healthproject.

 1.12     Water, Drainage, Irrigation Sector.8 The Bankhas had a long history o f
support to schistosomiasis control through its financing o fmany water supply, drainage
andirrigationprojects. Prior to project effectiveness nine Bank-financedwater projects
had been approved, implementedand closed, o f which seven focused on drainage and
irrigationandtwo on water supply. Total Bank support to these projects amountedto
US$211millioninIDA funding and an additional US$150million inIBRDfinancing.
W h i l e all supported activities that would eliminate breeding habitats for schistosomiasis,
only four included specific components and/or activities for snail control: (a) Upper
EgyptDrainage Project (1973-1981); (b) UpperEgyptDrainageProject (1976- 1985);
(c) Nile DeltaDrainage Project (1977 - 1985); and (d) New LandDevelopment Project
(1980-1990). An additional five water, drainage and/or irrigationprojects (supported by
US$135.6 millioninIDA funding andUS$180 millioninIBRDfunding) were under
implementationat the time o fthe design ofthe National Schistosomiasis Control Project.
Implementationcompletionreports (ICRs) onthe three projectswhich closed between
1998 and the present indicate two with satisfactory outcomes and one with a moderately
satisfactory o~tcome.~None o f these projects hadspecific schistosomiasis components,

2.1        The National SchistosomiasisControl Projectwas financed through an IDAcredit
of US$26.8 million equivalent," approvedon June 25, 1992and declared effective a year
later on June 15, 1993, with plannedcofinancing and Government counterpart
contribution inthe respective amounts ofUS$10.4 millionandUS$6.0 million. Boththe
Netherlandsand Denmark hadexpressed an interest incofinancing this project. At the
time ofnegotiations, whencofinancing hadstill not beenconfirmed, the Bankandthe
GoE agreedto move aheadwith the project onthe basis of IDA financing, while
continuing to pursueparallel financing.

2.2        The objectives ofthe Project wereto ``. (a) expandthe coverage andimprove
                                                                     ..

2.4       Managementand ImplementationArrangements. Project management and
implementationresponsibilities were assignedto the EDCD, MoH. Having implemented
already six externally financed projects,14the Directorate of Project Administration o fthe
EDCDwas consideredbythe Bankto be experiencedinmanaging procurement and
financial reporting, satisfying the guidelines ofboththe AfDB andthe World Bank. The
Director of Project Administration was thus giventhe responsibility to coordinatethe
work of implementing governorates, monitor progress, overseeproject accounts and
liaise with IDA.

2.5       The EDCDwas to implementproject activities as apart ofits normal activities.
Its routine responsibilities included: the setting of policy, preparation o fplans, staff
training, procurement and distribution of drugs andmolluscicides and evaluation o f field
activities. At the time ofproject approval, it hada staff o f 65, including sevenmedical
doctors, 12agricultural engineers (responsiblefor surveillance and control of snails), and
some 40 support staff. The healthdepartments of Egypt's 26 governorates and 170
districts were to implementthe programthrough the primaryhealth care system. Eacho f
the 26 governorates had an executive director of endemic disease control, who reported to
anunder secretary or adirector generalofhealth assignedto each governorate, andwas
responsible for the day-to-day administration ofthe schistosomiasis control program,
particularly the oversight of efforts to control the snail population. TheNSCP andthe
EDCDwere found bythe Bankto be competent, motivated andeffective, andthus


14These projects were frnanced by the Government o f Germany, the African Development Bank and IDA
(the latter throughwater drainage project components).

capable of implementingthe project. Insupport ofproject implementation the EDCD
agreedat negotiations that it would prepareeachyear a strategic operational plan and a
budget, suggestingthe allocation ofresourcesandassessing the programproblems and
results. To this end, two annualplanningseminars were envisaged. Thefirst would
bringtogether project managersandtheir deputiesfrom the governoratesofthe Delta
region (concerned mainly w/ S. mansoni, attack phase), MoHstaff, facilitators and
external consultants. The second would beheldfor Upper andMiddleEgypt (concerned
mainly withS. haematobiurn, maintenancephase).


Box 2-3: USAID-Financed Schistosomiasis ResearchProject (SRP)         -AComplement      to Bank-
Financed Evaluation Studies

In 1988the SchistosomiasisResearchProject(SRP) was launchedwith aUSAIDgrant ofUS39.7 million
and a US$5.3 million contribution of Government (incash and inkind). This project, which was
implemented over 12years, supported six "research and development" components: (1) vaccine
development:to develop at least two candidate vaccines ready for testing; (2) immuno-diagnosis: to
develop new and sensitive immunodiagnostic tests to identifyinfected individuals andto evaluate
ultrasound as a means o f measuring morbidity; (3) chemotherapy: to develop apediatric formulation of
Praziquantel, to improve treatment regimes and to establish a mechanism to monitor for drugresistance; (4)
epidemiology: to develop an effective database for measuring morbidity and standardsfor measuring the
success o f chemotherapy andthe control programme, andto consider GIs as a managementtool; (5) social
and economicresearch: to develop methodologies to modify human behavior and improve health
education; and (6) operationsresearchto improve delivery systemsand understandingoftransmission with
a view to improvingsnail control. The program closed in2002.

2.6     The procurement of drugs, pesticides, laboratory equipment and supplies was to
becarried out by the Central Purchasingagency ofthe MoH, as itwas consideredby the
Bank's appraisalteam to bebothsufficiently experiencedandcapable. At the time of
project preparation this agency was already purchasing goods and services worth about
US$150 annually; and its procedurescomplied withthe requirementsof development
partners, including IDAandAfDB.

3. IMPLEMENTATIONAND COSTS

3.1     The credit was approvedonJune 25, 1992andbecameeffective one year later on
June 15, 1993 becauseof a delay inits ratification by Parliament. Itwas implemented
over aperiod of nine years andthree months, closing on September30,2002, more than
three years after the initially scheduledclosing date. Co-financing was not secured, but
the project implementation periodwas not shortened, as had been envisagedwiththis
scenario (para. 3.10). Over andabove implementationdelays (paras. 3.6-3.8), significant
parallel financing (especially from USAIDandAfDB) andlower thanestimated costs of
Praziquantel andNiclosamide were the mainreasons why IDA financing was ultimately
able to support the programfor a periodlonger than four years. InDecember 1998 a two-
year extension (to June 30,2001) was grantedto compensatefor the delay inratification
andvery slow procurement. In2001 a secondextensionofthe closing date (to June 30,
2002) was grantedto allow additional time to improve the quality and effectiveness o f
health care servicesto control andtreat the populationinhigh-prevalence villages inthe
context ofhealth sector reform andto consolidate andimplementnew strategies. An
exceptional third extension(to September 30,2002) was grantedinApril 2002 to allow

                                                        8


for the delivery and installation o f computer hardwareand software, estimated at US$3.5
million. These extensions allowed for an unusually long implementationperiod, but were
not usedstrategically to address and correct poor performance under the second objective
and component (paras. 5.10 - 5.15).

PLANNEDVERSUSACTUALCOSTSAND FINANCING

3.2        The total actual project cost was US$24.9 millionor 58 percent o fthe appraisal
estimate (Table 3.1). The actual costs o f programexpansion to the Nile Delta and o f the
modernizationandrehabilitationo f existing control activities fell far short o f original
estimates (at 62 and 48 percent, respectively) for reasonsprovided inparagraphs 3.1 and
3.3. The actual costs o f program management capacity buildingare equalto initial
estimates (Table 3. 1)' but the patterno f actual expenditures was different thanthose
initially envisaged (para. 3.5). O fthe original IDA credit amount o f 19.6 SDRs, 83
percent (16.2 SDRs) was disbursedandthe remainingamount was ~ancelled.'~The
actual use o fthe credit by expenditure category closely reflected initial allocations for
goods (equipment, drugs andpesticides),16 but fell far short of allocations for consultants'
services andtraining.I7 Counterpart funding providedby government amounted to
US$3.1 million, about halfo f the plannedamount of US$6.0 million, but satisfied
government's commitment interms of its (14 percent) share o f total project cost (Annex
D.Table D-2). Cofinancinganticipated duringprojectappraisal didnot materialize, but
significant parallel financing was providedby others, especially USAID and the AfDB.

3.3       Significantly less was spent under the project on drugs andpesticides thanwas
initially anticipated. This was due to significant cost savings achieved for these two
commodities (para. 5.9), as well as the parallelfinancing o f these commodities under the
AfDB project (itemized inAnnex E). Total drugs andpesticide costs underthe project
were initially estimated at US$28.9 million. Actual drugs andpesticide costs amounted
to US$10.9 million. This reduced amount includedthe purchase, towards the end o f the
project, o f drugs andpesticides (along with other laboratory consumables) to cover the
needs for an additionaltwo years o fprogram implementationafter the project's closure.
IDA funding ofEgypt's Schistosomiasis programduringthe project implementation
period (1993-2002) i s estimated to be about 39 percent o ftotal external financing




15Annex D, Table D-1. Because o fthe fluctuations inthe US$ duringthe life o fthe project, actual
disbursementsare estimated at US$21.82 million, againstthe original equivalent value ofUS$26.84 when
theproject was approved (World Bank Project database).
l6This i s despitethe fact that the prices o f bothPraziquantel andNiclosamide fell dramatically. The
 rojectprocured quantities to support more years o f implementation thaninitially anticipated.
p7World Bank supervision reports document a strong reluctance on the part of Government to use
consultants' services. Interviews reveal that this reluctance is due to a lack of appreciation o fthe true value
addedofthese services anda resistance to the use o f a credit for ``soft" products, especially with the
availability of substantial amounts of grant financing for this type o f expenditure.

PLANNEDVERSUSACTUALINPUTSANDACTIVITIES                         BY COMPONENT2*

3.4       PartA. of theproject was implemented largely asplanned, with significant
savings achieved (paras. 3.1 and 3.3). Itprovidedcritical commodities to the program
andits implementers (governorate level authorities andprimaryhealthcare facilities), in
support o f program expansion andmodernization, most notably: 110 million tablets and
2.3 million suspension bottles o f Praziquantel, 60 tons o fNiclosamide, $2.6 million
worth o f medical andlaboratory equipment, vehicles, informationtechnology equipment,
andoffice equipment. These same commodities were also procuredfor the program
duringthe life o fthe projectwithAfDB financing (see Annex Efor itemization). The
project also providedtraining22for (a) all physicians and laboratorytechnicians onnew
screening techniques; (b) all healthservice providers (both those in-service andnew
recruits) on mass chemotherapy; (c) snail control staff on sampling, identification, canal
mapping, and focal application of molluscicides; and (d) trainers to deliver training
modules and ensure continuedin-service and refresher training.

3.5       On the other hand, Part B of theproject was onlypartially implemented,even
though the actual cost of this component approximated initial estimates. This is
because: (a) it supported the costs o fproject (andprogram) management for four more
years than initially planned(10 versus 6); and (b) it procured computer hardware and


  Excluding financing of water, drainage and irrigationprojects.
  The AfDB project was focused onthree governorates intheNileDelta: KafiElSheikh, Gharbiya and
Menoufia.
20AfDB's share appears low becausethe yearprior to project effectiveness it financed some US$7million
worth o f commodities and other programsupport, much of it to compensate for delays inthe Bank's
procurement processesthat was slowing the supply ofprogram commodities.

 software for MoH's Disease Surveillance Unit. Very little o f what was planned under
 Part B.1EDCDManagement Capacity Building was actually executed. Only very
 limitedtraining was providedto EDCD staffinmodernmethods ofpolicy analysis.23
 Consultancy services were not providedto strengthen the accounting andbudgeting
 system or to develop and carry out studies o f operational efficiency andprogram
 effectiveness. Middlemanagement was not supported, as envisaged, with: management
 training, a consultancy to develop decision support systems based on program data, the
 provisiono f computer hardware and software, communication networks, E-mail and
 office equipment, or technical assistance for capacity building. The project didprocure
 GIS software, computers, printers andsoftware for improvedsurveillance. Research and
Studies toApply New TechnologiesenvisagedunderPart B.2 o fthe project were
 designed to complement those plannedunderthe USAID-financed SRP. But none were
 carried out with project support and only a few were pickedup for support under the SRP
 (para 5.11). The refinement o f strategies, envisaged with project support, occurred
 anyway, but without the benefit o f a stronger evidence base that these studies and
 operational researchwould have generated.

 3.6     Procurementwas carried out by MoHP's Central Procurement Department
(CPD) andencountered significant delays. CPD's performance was initially
unsatisfactory, but gradually improved untilit became satisfactory by the project's end.
Delays inthe preparation o ftechnical specifications o fprocurement packages and inthe
submission of bidopeningreports and bidevaluation reports were chronic concerns. The
international testing ofthe project's two maincommodities (Praziquanteland
Niclosamide) also contributedto the slow pace o fprocurement. Procurement rules in
Egyptwere not fully insync with Bankprocurement guidelines andtook time to
reconcile. Between 1996 and 1999 five large procurement packages were cancelled by
the Borrower after the bidevaluation process was completed, but was questioned by the
Bank. Procurement is also reported to have beenslower thanplannedinpartbecauseo f
procurement for the same commodities being carried out under the AfDB project, which
had beenongoing for a few years before effectiveness o f the Bank-financed project.
AfDB procurement was infact helpfulinthat it compensated for the slow start-up ofthe
Bank-financedproject, thus accelerating the availability o f program commodities long
before they would have become available under the Bank's credit.

3.7      FinancialManagement. EDCDs manualproject procurement and disbursement
tracking didnot facilitate optimal monitoring practices. Nevertheless, all fiduciary
requirements under the legal agreement were ultimately satisfied. In 1999 a qualified
audit raisedthe issues o f unreliableproject accounting and filing systems. Efforts to
resolve the issues identified inthis report were ultimately successful, as evidenced by a
clean audit report for the year endingJune 30,2001 and a final SoE review conducted in
2002, which documented no serious accountability issue (no ineligible, questioned or
unsupportedtransactions). One audit report (for 1997)prepared by the Central Audit
Organization (responsible for preparing all audits for Egypt's ministries) was
unacceptable andthe Bankrequiredthat the audit (and subsequent audits) be contracted

insome cases.

3.8     Disbursements. The Special Account was openedinFebruary 1995, one year
and eight months after project effectiveness because o f delays inobtaining necessary
governmental approvals. This underminedthe implementationo f some project activities,
while others were carried out, nonetheless, thanksto the fundingprovidedby MoHP and
other (external) sources. Above-mentioned delays inprocurement andthe utilization of
ADB funding for programcommodities also contributed to the slow pace of
disbursement inthe early years o f the project. Duringthe first three years o f project
implementation less thanUS$O.1millionwas disbursed. The pace o f implementation
picked up considerably in 1997 when large procurements were completed. The
cancellationo f 3.4 million SDR i s a result o f cost savings attributable to dramatic
decrease inthe prices o f Praziquantel andNiclosamide (para. 5.9).

3.9     Mid-TermReview(MTR). The MTRtook place inMarcWApril 1997at atime
when the programwasjust getting offthe ground. Staffing andtraining hadjust been
completed; and equipment, supplies andvehicles hadbeenpurchased and were being
distributed to the various program implementers. Duringthis review the Bank raised the
issues o f weak operational andbudgetary planning, data management andreporting; and
itrecommendedthe trainingandrecruitment ofprofessional stafffor datamanagement
andanalysis, as well as for projectfinancial management andreporting.

3.10    R i s k s and RiskMitigation. Risks were identified during project design and
were partially mitigated, as follows. The risk o f an eventual resistance o fthe parasite to
Praziquantel didnot come to pass. The environmentalrisks of molluscicidingwere
effectively mitigated by reducing snail control activities infavor o f mass chemotherapy
(treatment of high-prevalence populations) and implementingsnail control activities ina
more geographically focused manner. The risk that the political urgency o f controlling
the disease might decrease as morbidity andmortality rates would fall did not come to
pass. The Minister ofHealth andFirst Lady are both committed to the eradicationof
schistosomiasis and strongly support the initiation in2007 o f WHO and EDCD
collaboration to this end. The risk that cofinancing would not materialize did come to
pass, but it didnot threaten, as had been anticipated, the ability o fthe Bank-financed
project to cover more than four years of program support, necessary for ensuringreform
implementationand institutionalization. AfDB parallelfinancing and cost savings
allowed for a longer (ten-year) implementationperiod. Another mitigation strategy to
addressthis risk was to establish a stronger linkwith the USAID-financed SRP. This
strategy was not fully implemented, which ultimately had its negative consequences
(para. 6.10). The design overlooked other critical risks, which came to pass: the risk that
studies plannedunder the project would not be carried out andthe consequence that
strategy reform would not be fully evidence based; andthe riskthat the skills and
implementationcapacity o f the program and network o fprimaryhealth care facilities
would not be sufficient to meet programneeds, even after training.

 4. MONITORINGAND EVALUATION(M&E)

DESIGN

4.1      Despite the project's emphasison evidence-based decision-making, the overall
designofprojectM&Ewas weak. Because schistosomiasis control programs ingeneral
have clear objectives andwell-established interventions, the design o f M&Efor thefirst
objective was sound. Thefirst objective was articulated aroundthe program's
performance (expansion o f coverage andimprovement inits operation) as a means for
achieving the program's goal (the reduction o f prevalence). Project monitoring indicators
cited inthe designdocument included: inputmeasures(number o f rural healthunits,
number ofruralhealthunits not providing schistosomiasis control services, byduration
o f interruptioninservice, andby reason for interruption); process indicators (numbers o f
persons screened andnumbers found positivereported separately for various ~ategories~~)
andoutcome measures (intensity o finfectionfor arepresentative sam le o fpatients at
eachhealthfacility, by parasite; andnumber o f cases o fhematemesis' admittedto
hospitals). However, neither baselines on the above-cited indicators nor clear
arrangementsfor data collection, analysis andreportingon these indicators were
established. The design document did set a target to reduce prevalence from 35 to 10
percent of the population, butthis was not includedamong the list o fproject indicators
(although itwas, indeed, measured).

4.2     Nevertheless, the design didprovide for the monitoring o fprevalence rates and
emphasizedthe quality control o f the statistical reports preparedby the primaryhealth
care facilities andvetted at the district and governorate levels. Quality was to be
achieved through (a) computerizedprocedures for the detection andverification o f
inconsistencies inmonthly reports; and(b) checks on the execution and quality o f
screening andtreatment campaigns andthe re-examination o f random samples of urine
and stool specimens by the primaryhealthcare physicianor the chief laboratory
technician at the district or governorate level. Analyses and decision-making based on
data generated from the front-line services were envisaged to be carried out at the lowest
possible level.

4.3     Thesecondobjective (which encompassedthe undertakingo fresearch studies for
strategic decision- andpolicy-making) was not well articulated and its results chain was
not well defined. Eventhe statement o f the capacity buildingobjective differs across the
Bank's three key pro'ect documents: the legal agreement (officially bindingdocument),
the designdocument16 andthe Bank's internal supervision reporting system. The design
document includedno indicators for tracking progress inthe achievement o fthis
objective, for example: the undertaking o f operations research, the recording and analysis
o f screeningresults, the extent to which decision-making is evidence-based, the quality

 andreliability of data, andthe adequacyofthe design andimplementationof
 systems/processes to ensure the control o f data quality. Capacity for programdata
 collection and analysis was not assessed, nor was specific training developed to this end.
 The keyperformance indicators showninBox 2-2 were not identifiedas such inthe
 design document, but, rather, were pulledfrom various places inthe designdocument by
 IEGto establish a more explicit evaluation framework for assessingperformance.

IMPLEMENTATION

4.4      Implementationo fproject M&Ewas weak. The evaluation and operational
 studies plannedunder the project were not implemented (paras. 3.5 and 5.10-5.1 1). With
project support the EDCD did strengthen its schistosomiasis surveillance systemthrough
which the screening of three population groups is undertaken: school children, a random
sample o f 10percent o fresidents invillages, and patients visiting healthfacilities.
However, a number o f issues compromise the quality andreliability ofthese data (Bank
internalreporting and PEMA evaluation). The capacity o fprimary health care facility-
based healthworkers, who undertook the screening, recordingandreporting o f
prevalence rates amongthese three groups, was lacking (both interms of their skills and
interms oftheir availability). The frequency withwhichthesethree groups havebeen
screenedwas not inadherencewithprogram ~trategies.~~                 The supervision ofthis work,
envisaged to be undertaken by chief laboratorytechnicians at the district or governorate
level or by primary health care physicians, was not undertaken regularly or with
sufficient rigor, thus causing the neglect o ftwo essential tasks envisaged under the
project: the pedagogical support andtechnical backstopping ofthese staff, and data
verification and quality control. Furthermore, despite the Bank's frequent reminders, the
MoHP never validated the prevalence data from screening surveys by an independent
evaluation.28 Technical training was lacking ina number o f areas, including: the design
andimplementationof epidemiologicalsurveys, data analysis methods, reporting, and
data validation and quality control.

UTILIZATION

4.5     Utilization o f available data has been substantial, notwithstandingsome issues o f
data quality (para. 4.4). Data on prevalence and snail infestation, generated at the
primaryhealthcare facility level andaggregated at district andgovernorate levels, have
enabled the NSCP and local-level programmanagers to identify areas o f highprevalence,
providing a trigger for the programto intervene with mass treatment and snail control,
where warranted. Given that the project supported nationwide coverage o fthe NSCP,
these data also served to track and finetune the project's (as well as the program's)
performance. Supervisionmissions, aide-memoires and technical discussions between
the Bank andthe project, as well as Borrower's periodic reports on project progress all
were grounded inprevalence data.




27Twice a year for school children, monthly samples to cover villages in catchment areas, andall patients
ofruralhealth facilities.
28Fundsunderthe project hadbeenallocated, butwere not usedfor this purpose. The Bankdidnothave
adequatefunding under its supervision budgetto carry out such an evaluation itself.

control; vehicles for outreach, surveillance and supervision; and computers at the
governorate level) to carry out Program activities. Project support helped establish and
render the NSCP fully hnctionalinthe Deltaregion.

5.3      Theprogram was also expanded withproject support to newly reclaimed lands
which have been developedthrough irrigationprojects and are attracting migrants
from otherparts of Egypt. The AI Salam project inSuez and Sinai bringsNile water to
the Sinaidesert irrigating some 620,000 f e d d a n ~ ~ ~is expected to bringinthree
                                                          and
millionmigrants, primarilyfiom the Delta region. The Toshka project near Aswan Lake
inUpperEgyptsupports the irrigationo fsome 540,000 feddans andis expectedto attract
some 6 million immigrants. Project investments intraining, equipment, supplies,
vehicles and commodities supported activities aimed at preventing schistosomiasis from
being established inthese newly reclaimedlands. Activities include: the systematic
screening o f incoming settlers, who may already be infected, the surveying o f new canals
for snails andthe supervision o f health staff.

5.4     Theproject supportedthe adoption of modern technologiesfor improved
effectiveness in the control of schistosomiasis, and their application both in areas
where theNSCP had already been operating (the 21 governorates in Middle and Upper
Egypt and theSuez Canal region), and in areas wherethe Program was newly
established (the Delta and newly reclaimed lands). Training andkey commodities
(replacement microscopes, upgraded laboratory equipment, diagnostic materials and
supplies, Praziquantel, Niclosamide, computers andvehicles) were provided to the 21
governorates inMiddle and UpperEgypt andthe Suez Canal region, as well as to the new
areas o fprogram operation to support and facilitate the adoption and implementationof
moderntechnologies as follows.

5.5     New screening technologiesfor detecting urinary schistosomiasisand intestinal
schistosomiasis that are rapid, simple, less expensiveand more sensitivethan
technologiespreviously used in Egypt were adoptedand implemented by theNSCP
withproject support. Prior to the project, screening for urinary schistosomiasis (5'.
haematobium) andintestinal schistosomiasis (due to S. mansoni) involvedthe use o f


*'A feddan is a unit ofarea used inEgypt, Sudan and Syria equal to 1.038 acres or 4200 square metres.

                                                      15


cumbersome methods based on the sedimentation o f schistosome eggs inconical flasks or
test tubes. With programsupport: (a) urine dip sticks are now used to screen for urinary
schistosomiasis, and positive samples are checked by urine sedimentation technique; and
(b) the Kato technique is nowusedto screen for intestinalschistosomiasis. Inadditionto
being simple, rapidand less expensive, these techniques are more sensitive thus allowing
the measurement o fthe intensity o f infection.

5.6      Surveillance strategieshave not changed essentially and are not uniformly
implemented throughout the county. Project support to the strengthening of program
surveillance has been inadequate relative to the needs. At the project's outset the
NSCP's strategy for screening/surveillance was three pronged: (a) the examination o f
outpatients who present themselves at primaryhealth care facilities for any reason; (b)
the monthly screening o f a statistically valid rotating 10percent sample o f the entire
population ingovernorates/districts to monitor prevalence incommunities; and (c) semi-
annual examination o f all primary school children in all schools each year.                   Computers
andsoftware have beenprovidedto centralandgovernorate levels, butnotto rural health
units, whose staff are obliged to record and report sample testing data manually. The
absence o f guidelinesand inadequate training have not ensured that the skills and
capacities o f governorate, district andhealth center staff are adequate for the screening
andsurveillance ofa statistically valid rotating I O percent sample ofpopulations intheir
respective catchment areas. Despite project support to surveillance (mostly equipment),
evidence compiledthrough field visits and evaluation reports suggests that surveillance i s
still not carried out inline withNSCP strategy. Patient interviews reveal that they are not
routinely screenedfor schistosomiasis. Performance incentives stress quantity o ftests
administered, rather thanthe quality and accuracy o ftheir results, and are reportedby
some field basedrespondents to be causing inflatedreporting of the number o f samples
taken. Population screening is carried out only about once or twice annually andthe
statistical accuracy of data i s still inquestion. Furthermore, the frequency with which
school children are screenedvaries across the c0unt1-y.~~ Supervisions to check on the
quality o f sample testing o f villages, school screenings andpatient examinations are
infiequent. Humanandfinancial resources are inadequaterelativeto the requirements of
current screening/surveillance strategies.

5.7      Theproject supportedthe implementation of a new treatment strategy of mass
treatment with Praziquantel of all villagers and school children in high prevalence
areas, a changefrom theprevious strategy of treating only thosefound to be infected.
This new strategy not only reduces the intensity of the infection and morbidity. I t also
reducesfurther transmission resultingfrom the infection of canals and other water
sources by infected humans. Between 1997 and2006, withproject support,3' a total of
22.4 millionschool children attending schools withhighprevalence in 11governorates




30 Operational researchincluded inthe project was envisagedto assess the frequencies with which optima1
screening could be carried out for these different groups (exploring the possibility o f decreasing the
screeningof school children fiom twice to once annually), but was never carried out (para. 5.11).
3 1While the project closed inSeptember2002, it procuredsufficient commodities to cover the needs of the
NSCP for the two to three years after the closing andthus canbe acknowledged for supporting mass
chemotherapy activities through 2005.

 were treated (or retreated) with Pra~iquantel.~~Over time, as prevalence declined, both
the number o f governorates and the number of school children receiving mass
 chemotherapy annually declined sharply (Figure 5.1). Additionally, duringthis same
 timeperiodwith project support, atotal of 12.7million villagers residinginhigh
prevalence communities were treated (or retreated). As is the case for the school
 children, boththe number o f villages andthe number o f villagers declined over time, as
prevalence rates were reduced (Figure 5.2).                    Duringthis periodthe definition ofhigh
prevalence (or "hot spot") areas was more strictly defined (Box 5-1).33 As prevalence
dramatically declined (para. 5.19, some facilities have recently started following a
 strategy of micro focal treatment, whereby only infectedpeople are treated andthen
tested after three months.

 5.8     Withproject support theNSCP adoptedand implemented a new snail control
 strategy, applied in a morefocused manner, and used as a supportivestrategy to mass
 chemotherapy. Under this newstrategy, snail teams attachedto local healthfacilities
 survey all canals and drainstwice per year and spray two to three times annually (as
 opposedto the quarterly activities ofthe previous strategy). Niclosamide is applied in
 canals andwater courses inamuchmore focused geographic areathanunder the
 previous strategy: small perimeter of 1kmaround highprevalencevillages (based on
 humaninfectionrates), andinany canalwhere infected snails arefound.

 5.9     During theproject implementationperiod overallprogram costs have been
 reducedconsiderably. While IEGwas unable to obtain dataontotal program costs
 before andafter the project intervention, there is still strong evidence of important cost
 reductions. With regard to treatment (a) the price of Praziquantel decreasedby 75
 percentbetween 1995 and2001, from LE0.98 to LE0.24 per tablet, and (b) the number
 of doses administeredannually decreaseddramatically among school children (from 7
 million in 1997to 0.01 millionin2006) andvillagers (from 2.9 millionin 1997to 0.7
 million in2006) treatedthroughmass chemotherapy. Annual mass chemotherapyof
 school children and villagers, combined, was reducedby 93 percent (from 9.9 millionto
 0.71million), indicating a dramatically smaller consumption ofPraziquantel. This is
 attributable to program success inreducingprevalence (para. 5.16) andto a stricter
 definition of "hot spots" (Box 5-1). Withregard to snail controZ (a) the price of
 Niclosamide decreasedby 76 percent between 1995 and2001 (fiom US$50,000/ton to
 US$12,000/ton); and (b) the annualconsumption ofNiclosamide decreasedby 88
 percent during this same time period (from 85 tons to 10.2 tons). The decline in
 consumptionis attributable bothto the change insnail control strategy andto program
 success, resultingina decrease o fthe lengtho fwater courses treated from 44,000 kmto
 2,900 km. The Government of Egypt nowfinances independentlythe entire cost of
 program implementation, butfinancing does not cover operationsresearch, which has
 not been institutionalized(paras. 5.11-5.12),or neededrenewal of equipment and
 training.

 OBJECTIVE #2: STRENGTHENTHE CAPACITYOFEDCD TO DESIGN, EVALUATEAND
 ADJUST THE NATIONALSCHISTOSOMIASISCONTROL STRATEGY

 5.10    The objective to strengthen the capacity ofEDCD to design, evaluateandadjust
 the national schistosomiasiscontrol strategy was negligibly achieved.

 5.11    Theproject, together with other relevantsupportprovidedby USAID,failed to
 develop within EDCDMoHP a capacity and disciplinefor carrying out evaluation and
 other operationally relevantstudies and systematically using the resultsto adjust
program strategy. Evaluationandoperations research studiesplannedunderthe Bank-

                                                       18


 financed project (itemized inAnnex D) were designedto field test, inthe various
 operational contexts o fEgypt's differentregions, the application o fnew technologies and
 strategies for screening, treatment and snail control inorder to generate the evidence-base
 for further adjustment of the national schistosomiasis strategy. Evaluations o f screening
 methods34were ultimately financed by USAID.35Butnone ofthe other evaluation
 studies plannedunder the project were undertaken. The NSCP didindeed adopt new
 technologies and refine its strategies for screening, surveillance, treatment, and snail
 control (paras. 5.4-5.8), but only the adoption of screening technologies was based on
 field tests and feasibility studies. The other adjustments were implementedonthe advice
 o fthe tropical parasitologist, who was part o fthe Bank's design and supervisionteams.
 H i s advice did contribute to some efficiency gains. But both this expert (as documented
 inhistechnical reports andAide-memoires) andother healthsector experts interviewed
 by IEGassertthat programeffectiveness andefficiency were, nevertheless, undermined
 becausemost o fthese studies were not carried out. For example, the evaluation o fthe
 current practice o f screening andtreating a rotating sample o f community members, as a
 basis for assessingprogramperformance and for establishing operational priorities,
 would have identified and resolved issues inthe quality and accuracy o f surveillance data
 that persist today. Assessments o fthe frequency of screening andtreatment, the timing
 o f follow-up treatment of intense infections andtradeoffs between more sensitive and
 more frequent screening would have enabled the adjustment of screening andtreatment
 strategiesto achieve even greater effectiveness and efficiency. Snail control strategies
 could also have been more finely adjusted had studies to establish cut-off values for snail
 control andto assess the feasibility, effectiveness andcost o f focal mollusciciding been
undertaken.

 5.12     Furthermore, innovative activities meant tofield test, evaluate andfine-tune
NSCPstrategiesand interventions in the multi-sectoral areas of health education and
environmental and sanitation were largely not implemented. The design and
evaluation o f innovative activities for improving sanitation anddomestic water supplies
incommunities withhightransmission rates were notundertaken. These activities were
meantto test the feasibility andeffectiveness ofinvestments ininfrastructureandhealth
education to incite changes inbehavior that would preventthe infections caused by
humansusingwater indrains andcanals. None ofthe envisaged construction ofpublic
laundries and showers was undertaken. Very little constructiono f community facilities
for disposal o f waste water and excreta was undertaken, andthere i s no evidence that this
interventionwas evaluated. The effectiveness ofthese promising interventions is thus
not known andthere continues to be no body o f evidence inEgypt on which to review




34 Studies financed by USAIDevaluated pilots which were field testing screening technologies that are
more sensitive and cheaper to use: dipsticks for testing urine; paper or nitrocellulose filters for confuming
diagnosis obtained with a dipstick andfor assessingthe intensity o f an infection; and the Kat0 technique for
diagnosiso f intestinal schistosomiasis. Study results ledto an adoption o fthese techniques inEgypt.
35 The USALD/Government ofEgypt's Schistosomiasis ResearchProject(SRP) didsupport anumber of
other studies on various topics of operational relevance: vaccine research; the development o f a suspension
formulation o fPraziquantel suitable for young children; the monitoring o fresistance to Praziquantel; a
large epidemiological study to establish the extent o fprevalence; production o f a slow-release Niclosamide;
the developmentofhealth education material; andthe evaluation o fultrasound as a diagnostic tool (El-
Khoby article).

                                                  19


andreviseNSCPs strategies for behavior change interventions. No data are available to
show trends inrisky behaviors because inadequate attention was paid by the project and
bythe programto tracking, understandingandinfluencingbehavior change. No
financing has become available to support evaluative and operations research since the
closure o f the project and USAID-financedSRP.

5.13     Technicalcapacityfor policy andstrategyformulation andfor program design,
planning, data collection and evaluation remains insufficient and overly centralized.
The capacity o f the central level o f EDCD i s still lacking interms o f skills, staffing,
training andmodern office equipment (computers, internet, internalnetwork facilities),
especially for middle management. Training inmodernmethods o f policy and strategy
analysis and management financed under the project was limited to a few study tours and
conferences, as was the training o f staff inepidemiology. IEGcould find no itemization
o fthis training or evidence that ithad been evaluated. A management-oriented
accounting system, an important tool for establishing and evaluatingthe costs o f various
interventions, was not developed nor were accounting andbudgeting functions
strengthened, as planned. Among reasons for this failure, raised ininterviews and
documented inproject files, are: Government's propensity not to draw ontechnical
assistanceprogrammed under the project andthe failure to use project support (training,
technical assistance, office equipment, internet, E-Mail and other management tools)
programmed for middle management.

5.14     The decentralizationof programplanning, management,data collection and
evaluation was onlypartially achieved. Ineach o fthe 26 governorates an executive
director o f endemic disease control i s responsible for overseeing program implementation
anda chief laboratorytechnician is responsible for overseeing the work o f all laboratory
technicians operating intheir respective governorates. District staffing provides for a
physicianwith special qualification or experience inpublic healthresponsible for
managing and supervisingthe program at the district level. All rural healthunits are
supposed to have at least 1physician andone laboratory technicianto implement
schistosomiasis surveillance, screening and treatment. While MoHP did undertake
recruitment to strengthen staffing o f these positions36and the project supported training
o f these staff inthe application o fnew strategies, there is evidence that capacity is still
lacking. Projecttraining provided at decentralized levels was not evaluated.

5.15     Biannual planningseminars (one for Lower Egypt governorates dealing primarily
withS. mansoni,andone for UpperEgyptgovernorates dealingprimarilywith S.
haematobium) have taken place inaccordance with a clause inthe Development Credit
Agreement, but this has been insufficient for achievingthe objective o f decentralizingthe
program. Planning and decision-making remain overly centralized, which i s increasingly
inappropriate as the program i s evolving towards a more locally-based, focal approach.




36World Bank supervision reporting indicatedthat 70 percent ofpositions were filled as a result of
significant recruitment in1998.

 PROGRAMOUTCOMESAND ATTRIBUTION

 5.16     Between 1993 and 2006 theprevalence of S. mansoni (the cause of intestinal
 schistosomiasisin Lower Egypt) declinedfrom a level of 14.8percentin 1993 (theyear
 of project effectiveness) to 2.7 in 2002 (theyear of project closing) and continued to
 decline in the ensuingyears, reaching a level of 1.5percent in 2006. Likewise, the
prevalence of S. haematobium (the cause of urinary schistosomiasis in Middle and
 Upper Egypt) declinedfrom a level of 6.6percent in 1993 to 1.9percentin 2002, and
 continued to decline thereafter, reaching a level of 1.2percent in 2006 (Figure 5.3).
 Declines inprevalence have been documented for all governorates duringthis period.
 Annex Gshows more trends for various parts ofEgypt, all showing that (a) since project
 effectiveness the decline inprevalence has accelerated; and (b) since project closing
 declines inprevalence have continued. Nevertheless, there remain several areas o f high
 prevalence scattered insome localities. InLower Egyptin2006 localities with
 prevalence rates for S. mansoni greater than 3 percent includedtwo districts37and 33
 villagesa3*InUpper Egypt there is not a single district that has a prevalence rate for S.
 haematobium that i s greater than2 percent, but some 35 villages still have prevalence
 rates o f more than 3 per~ent.~'Over and above declines inprevalence, EDCDMoHP as
 well as front line healthproviders report a decline inthe intensityo f infections andin
 morbidity. Clinical cases o f schistosomiasis are reported by EDCDand field-based staff
to have virtually disappeared.

5.17    Project support to the modernization, strengthening and expansionof NSCP
activities is assessed to have directly contributed to declines inprevalence because
these investmentsenabledNSCP to apply the latest technologiesand implement, on a
nationwide basis, screening, treatment and snail control interventions that are known
to be effective. Inassessingattribution, it is important to recall that betweenproject

activities inthree governorates inthe Delta region(1990-1999); and (b) USAID's
US$39.7 million grant to support schistosomiasis R&D(1988-1998). Estimated annual
disbursements from these two sources and IDA disbursements (Annex D, Table D-3)
reveal that duringthe period 1992-2002 IDA financing made up one third o f all external
financing for schistosomiasis, withAfDB andUSAID shares at 15 percent and 52
percent, respectively. Duringthe decadeprior to project effectiveness, prevalence rates
for bothS. mansoni and5`. haematobium were declining rapidly, a likely outcome o f
significant investments inwater supply, sanitation and drainage as well as activities o f
NSCPbefore they were expanded andmodernized. Itis also likely that investments in
water supply, sanitation and drainage made during the time o f project implementation
have also contributed to declines documented duringthe project implementation period!'
However, their impact has not been evaluated.

6. RATINGS

6.1      The outcome oftheNational Schistosomiasis Control Project is moderately
satisfactory, overall. The outcome o fthe first objective i s satisfactory, based on its
substantial relevance, eficacy and efficiency. The outcome o f the second objective i s
unsatisfactory, basedon its negligible efficacy andmodest relevance andefficiency
(Table 6-1). Inassessingoverall outcome, greater weight was givento the first objective,
given its importance inalleviating Egypt's overall disease burdenand its substantialshare
o f total project support.

6.2      Overall relevance i s a function o f the relevance o f project objectives (assessed in
thisparagraph) andproject design (assessedinparagraph6.3). The relevance ofboth
project objectives is substantial. Egypt's longterm goal i s to improve accessto health
care for its citizens through the implementation o f health sector reform (Annex H). The
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Egyptfor the period2006 -2009 supports this
goal inits aim to improve coverage and quality o f healthcare for the poor by (a)
increasing coverage of the basic healthbenefits package to 45 percent inthe target
governorates o f Menofia andAlexandria; (b) increasing utilization rates o f (new) family
health services; and (c) reducingregional andincome disparities inaccess to basic health



40Public healthresearch does indicate that improved water supply and sanitation does contribute to
declines inprevalence (Hotez et al., 2007).

 services. The project objective to expand the coverage andmodernize NSCP services,
deliveredthrough Egypt's health system, is responsiveto Egypt's andthe Bank's broader
health strategies that emphasize coverage, quality, efficiency and equity.
 Schistosomiasis i s a diseasethat affects the poor inparticular (Hotez et al., 2007) and
thusrespondsto equity goals. The projectobjective to strengthenEDCDcapacity
responds to the CAS objective o f establishing standards and guidelines for service quality
andto the HRSPstrategy of institutionaldevelopment.

6.3     The relevance o fthe design of thefirst component (supporting the first
objective) i s substantial. The technical design was strong, butthere were major
shortcomings. The design: (a) focused on an interventionthat was o fhighpriority for
government andwell defined interms o f specific services, commodities, activities; (b)
was supportive o f a nationalstrategy; (c) facilitated an evidence-based process for
experiential learningand strategy refinement. Other positive aspects included: its
technical rigor enablingthe exploitationo ftechnology breakthroughs and consequent
strategy refinements; and its assessment andmonitoring o f technology risks (drug
resistance and environmental safety of molluscicide). Nevertheless, there were
shortcomings. The design effectively addressedtwo o fthe four schistosomiasis
interventions (treatment and snail control) but was weak inits support to behavior change
interventions, touching upon the other two strategies (health educationand water and
sanitation). Project attentionto these latter strategies was relegatedto a fund for
innovative activities, without proper technical analysis andproject preparation, andwhich
ultimately were not carried out. The relevance o fthe design of the second component
(supporting the second objective) i s modest. The results chain o f the capacity building
objective was not well articulated, interventions were not well defined, roles and
responsibilities were not fully assessedand redefined inlight o f the program
decentralization objective, and no indicators were proposed to measure performance and
outcome o f capacity building. Quality at entry was weak due to the absence of: bidding
documents ready for the first year o f implementation(although technical specifications o f
goods were defined), and implementationschedules, including a detailed planfor training
and supervision o f staff andperformance evaluation.

6.4     As summarized inTable 6.1 anddiscussedinChapter 5, theproject'sfzrst
objective was achieved with substantial efficacy (paras. 5.2 -5.9), but achievement o f
thesecond objectivewas negligible (paras. 5.10 - 5.14). Inassessingoverall efficacy, a
heavier weight was appliedto the first objective because o f the share o fproject fimds
devoted to it (97 percent) and, especially, becauseit was instrumental and effective in
contributing to successful program outcomes.

6.5     Thefirst objectivewas achieved withsubstantial efficiency. The cost-
effectiveness o fnew strategies for treatment and snail control has increased, withtheir
more carefully defined interventions, lower prevalence thresholds, and use o fnew, better
performingtechnologies, along with dramatic declines inthe cost ofthese interventions
(para. 5.9). Nevertheless, there were some inefficiencies. According to Hotez et al.,
health education and communication (promoting safe behavior) constitute an essential
component o f any (schistosomiasis control) strategy and a cheaper and faster way to
reduce water contamination. While no cost-effectiveness estimates exist for health
education and communication, available evidence suggests that this interventioncan

                                                     23


decrease costs, increase knowledge, decreasereinfectionrates andbuildthe trust and
engagement o f communities. Health education was not vigorously pursued inproject
designand implementation, nor was it effectively coveredby other financiers.

6.6      The efficiency withwhichthe second objective was achieved is modest. The
failure to fully achieve the project's capacity buildingobjective also underminedits
efficiency. The failure to undertake evaluationandother operational studies resulted ina
lost opportunity for further refiningstrategy and a weaker link between evidence and
program management. The allocationofroles andresponsibilities between central level
anddecentralized entities hasnot beenfully defined, andthe programis still overly
centralized. Furthermore, there are indications that capacity for program implementation
falls short o f needs. An economic analysis undertaken at the time o fproject appraisal is
based on mortality projections, but didnot capture morbidity, which constitutes the major
burdeno f schistosomiasis. All o fthe elements neededto measure schistosomiasis
morbidity were not inplace so an economic analysis was not undertaken at the end o f the
program.41

6.7      R i s k s to Development Outcome is substantial. A technically sound strategy
requires continuous fine-tuning on the basis of: research and evaluation to incorporate
andfield-test newtechnologies andemergingprogramchallenges as the economic,
social, and epidemiological situations change. The absence o f evaluation andresearch
capacity inMoHP and financial support for research poses a risk to program
effectiveness (paras. 5.11and 5.12). While GoE is reportedto be financing virtually all
o fthe program's operating costs, field visits andinterviewsreveal that this does not
adequately cover all programs needs, notably: the renewal of governorate-level
laboratory equipment, studies and operations research, training and supervision. While
political support remains strong, the population's support andappreciation o fthe program
andits own criticalrole inpreventinginfection are likely to fbrther wane inthe absence
of more emphasis on behavior change interventions and social engagement. Technically
sound and full implementationo fthe program strategy throughout the healthsystem i s at
risk inthe absenceofeffortsto reconcile the imbalancebetweenthe program's supply o f
anddemand for capacity, including: the adequate number andskills level of
implementers; their backstopping through the design, delivery and evaluationof training
programs and more frequent andtechnically competent supervision and quality control;
and possibly the redefinitionof activities that could reduce time spent without
compromisingresults.

6.8      Governance issues, ifleft unchecked, are likely to put development outcomes at
risk. Incentivesemphasizing the quantityo ftests areputtingthe accuracy ofprogram
data andtrends at risk. A rangeo f country-level informantshave notedthat the HRSP
does not sufficiently emphasize public healthinterventions inpractice. Family Health
facilities operating under the HSRPperformance system are measuredby a range o f
performanceindicators, butnot one is specific to schistosomiasis. Some reformed
facilities are reportedto be charging fees to patients for testing andservices, eventhough


41The Global Burden of Disease Due to Schistosomiasis (Michaud, 2003) points out major discrepancies in
World Bank and WHO disease burden estimates, due inpart to the choice of disability severity weights,
andpoint to the need for more research on this topic.

                                             24


 they are to beprovided free o f charge. Major investments inreformedhealthfacilities'
 laboratories are reported to have bypassed governorate laboratory facilities for the
 schistosomiasis program, despite their need for equipment renewal.

 6.9     The Bank's overall performance was moderatelysatisfactory. During
preparation the Bank'sperformancewas moderately unsatisfactory. Technical quality
 at entry was sound. The Bankundertook a thorough analysis of environmental aspects o f
the diseasetransmission andthe safety and effectiveness o f mollusciciding.
Implementationarrangements were not sufficiently advanced at the time o f project
 approval, which caused important delays inimplementationduringthe first few years.
Riskassessmentwas sound overall, butoverlooked some critical risks (para. 3.10). The
design of the capacity buildingobjective and monitoring and evaluation were weak.

 6.10    TheBank's performance during supervision was moderately satisfactory. The
tropical parasitologist who was involved inproject designparticipatedinsupervision
throughout implementation. This ensured a consistent andtechnically sound dialogue.
Technical supervision was proactive, rigorous and constructive. Against the backdrop o f
rapidly declining prevalence across the country (an indication o f program success) the
BankchallengedMoHPto keepto the spirit ofthe project andundertake ongoing
research andanalysis and refinement o f strategy. Dialogueremainedintensive
throughout implementation. Aide-memoires, technical papers and dialogue advised
Government to: evaluate new strategies, develop stronger inter-sectoral approaches,
ensure close surveillance o f newly reclaimedareas, develop a strategy for behavior
change, exploit program data more fully, commissionan independent validation o fthe
quality and accuracy ofprogramdata, intensify capacity buildingefforts, and integrate
more fully the program activities into the healthservices. The Bankmight have been
more strategic inencouraging improved Government performance inthese areas through:
better use o f the potential leverage ofproject extensions; andmore proactive coordination
withUSAIDwith aview to possibly drawingon grant moniesunder the SRP for the
financing o f critical evaluation studies.

6.11    Resourcesfor project supervision were lacking for the first few years o f
implementation, when intensive supervisionwas needed. Informantsnoted that the Bank
was very slow inlaunchingproject implementation. While the project became effective
in1993, implementationonly started in1996. Supervision inthe ensuringyears was well
resourced. The appointment o f a locally-basedtask team leader in 1998 andthe
placement o f fiduciary experts at the Bank's office inCairo further enhanced the Bank's
presenceinEgypt andfacilitated a closer supervision and dialogue. The Bank's value-
added i s evidentbothinits financial andtechnical supports. Hadthe Bank not invested in
this project, prevalence might still have continuedto decline (perhaps more slowly), but
program efficiency would have beenweaker.

6.12    Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory overall. The
performance o f Government was moderately unsatisfactory. Highnational ownership
andcommitment were instrumental inthe successful expansion andmodernizationofthe
program. However, delays within the Government's control causedvery slow project
start-up, including a one-year lapse between approval and effectiveness, a one and one
halfyear delay inthe opening o f the SpecialAccount after effectiveness, andslow action

                                                       25


inreconcilingthe Bank's andEgypt's procurement rules. GoEwas also unwillingto use
project technical assistanceand consultingservices. As a result, evaluation studies,
capacity buildingo f middlemanagement, improvements to data quality control and
validation, andthe strengthening o f budgetingand accounting systems were not
implemented. An inter-disciplinary andinter-sectoral "think tank" proposed at the
beginningofthe projectwas not constituted. The inter-sectoral HighCommittee of
Schistosomiasis Control, headed by the Health Minister, with multi-sectoral
~nembership,~~      didmeet regularly, buthasnot beeneffective incoordinatingagencies
responsible for water quality and environmentalmanagement.43

6.13      The performance o fthe EDCD, which was theproject implementing agency, was
moderately satisfactory.        Duringpreparation the EDCDwas productively involvedinthe
technical design o f the project. Duringimplementation, however, the EDCD Director i s
reported to have runproject activities largely by himself, despite the fact that the EDCD
was adequately staffed with professional and administrative staff. The procurement of
drugs, pesticides, laboratoryequipment and supplies was carried out bythe Central
Purchasing agency o f MoHP, which performedvery poorly at the project's outset, but
improved somewhat over the life o fthe project. Overall project management, interms o f
disbursement, procurement andfinancial management slowly improved over time, but
issues relatedto M&Eremained unsatisfactory throughout project implementation.

6.14      Project monitoring and evaluationwas modest (Chapter 4).

7. LESSONSAND CHALLENGES

7.1       Ithasbeenalmost sixyears sincethis projecthasclosed. As showninChapter 5
(Figure 5-3) andAnnex G,declines inprevalence rates acrossEgyptacceleratedduring
project implementation, andprevalence has continued its downward trend inthe years
following the project's closing date. With the exceptiono f one project financed inthe
approximate amount o fUS$0.4 millionby Italy withtechnical support from the
University o fValencia and                   andimplementedduringthe period2004-2007, the
GoE reports that it has financed all ofthe costs o f the NSCP operations since project
closing. However, government financing o fNSCP has not supported operations research,
andneededrenewal of equipment andtraining. Further,the National Schistosomiasis
strategy has not essentially changed since the closing o fthe IDA credit.

43 O fthe 4 interventions available for control, three (chemotherapy, snail control and health education) are
theresponsibility o fthe MoHP, whereasthe fourth (water quality and environmental management) is the

 LESSONS

 7.2      Project andprogram experience reveal that a single-purposepublic health
 intervention, such as the schistosomiasisprogram, is amenable to success because its
purpose is clear, its goals and objectivesexplicit and easily quantifiable, and its
 interventions (the what) well defined. The design o fthe first component (supporting the
 first objective) was sound inlargepart because of the clear goals, well-established
 interventions andwell-defined results chain of Egypt's schistosomiasis program (para.
 6.3). The implementation ofthis component, which supported the strengthening and
 expansion o fwell-established interventions, did indeed contribute to the decrease in
 prevalence documented during the project period (paras. 5.16 and 5.17).

 7.3     Nevertheless, such aprogram, even when it incorporates state-of-the-art
 knowledge and technologies, is unlikely to befully cost-effective or evidence-based if
 its strategies (the how) are not (i) well-adapted to the county conted5and (ii)
periodically assessedand revised to take into accountprogramprogress, new
 knowledge and technologiesand evolutions in the country context. Program
 effectiveness and efficiency were undermined because most evaluative studies planned
 underthe projectwere not carriedout. As aconsequence, there are gaps inknowledgeo f
the costs and effectiveness o fvarious program interventions and activities inthe
particular context o f Egyptand, stemming from this, aninability to identify and exploit
 opportunities for further reducing costs and enhancing effectiveness. Among many
 examples are: (a) the optimal frequency o f screening andtreatment has not been
established; (b) the tradeoffs between more sensitive and more frequent screening have
not been assessed; (c) the screening andtreatment o f a rotating sample of community
members as a basis for assessingprogram performance and establishing operational
priorities still has not been evaluated; (d) the possibility o f following uptreatment o f
patients after one year instead o f three months has not beenexplored; (e) cut-off values
for snail control have not been evaluated; (0the feasibility, effectiveness and cost o f
focal mollusciciding are not known; and (g) the potential o f community laundries and
showers for further reducingprevalence has not been explored (paras. 5.1 1, 5.12 and 6.6).

7.4      Project experience has also revealed that the design of rigorous and technically
sound evaluation studies, speci@cally tailored to inform the adjustment of intervention
strategiesfor improvedperformance and outcome, is a necessay, but insufficient
conditionfor improvedstrategic management and cost-effectiveness. Such studies are
unlikely to be carried out and effectively used in the absence of other essential
conditions. Factors which influencedthe neglect o f evaluative studies under the project
include: the lack o f conviction o f managers and decision-makers o fthe value added o f
such studies; the unwillingness to finance them (be it with a credit or other sources);
weak capacity to undertake (or commission) them; andthe absence o fWell-defined
processes and incentives to exploit study results for decision-making (para. 4.4).




45Elementsofcountry contexts that have abearingon strategiesinclude: epidemiology; health sector and
health systems institutional and organizational framework, efficiency, capacity, incentives, budget,
financing; sociology; poverty; inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms; population distribution, among
others.

CHALLENGES

7.5      The applicationo fthese lessonstakes on even more importance as they support
the challenges posed by a number o f issues and events currently facing Egypt's health
sector.

7.6      Health sector reform program (HSRP). Launched inthe mid-1990s, the HSRP
seeks to separate service delivery from financing, rationalize services through the
delivery o f anintegrated package o f services by family healthfacilities, and ensure
sustainable financing through riskpooling andthe financing o f services on the basis o f
performance indicators (Anne H). Experience to date inpilot governorates (Alexandria
andMenoufia) pointto challenges inensuring that the schistosomiasis controlprogram
will not suffer any setbacks as it is integrated into the basic services package. While
significant investment inlaboratory equipment and capacity has beenmade infamily
healthunits, which has benefitedthe schistosomiasis program front-line efforts, the
governorate-level schistosomiasis program staff and premises have not benefited from
such investment even though their facilities, skills, equipment andvehicles are inneed o f
renewal and critical to support o f front-line services. There are no schistosomiasis-
specific performance indicators under HSRP, on which basis financial incentives are
paid. This could discourage attention to schistosomiasis activities. The development o f a
disease surveillance capacity under HSRP will needto take into full account the demands
andlessonsto date o fthe schistosomiasis surveillance efforts andensure their
prominence and strengthening inan integrated system. A number o f informants and an
independent evaluation o fthe project (PEMA, 2004) have noted that some reformed
facilities are chargingpatients for schistosomiasis examinations andtreatment, which are
supposed to be free o f charge. This discourages patients from accessing these services,
andexacerbatesthe risk offwther transmission o fthe disease.

7.7      New Strategyfor Eradication. EDCD prepared inlate 2007 with WHO support a
proposalto evolve its strategy fiom the control o f schistosomiasis inEgyptto its
eradication(defined as the reduction o f the prevalence o fS. mansoni andS. haematobium
to less than 0.1%). Planned activities include: (a) capacity buildingo f health
professionals and school teachers; (b) implementation andmonitoring o f field activities;
and(c) social mobilization activities. The lessons from this evaluationmay provide
guidance and directionto this effort. Clarity o fprogram objectives andthe results chain,
more attention to institutional and organizational issues, stronger links between
evaluationresults and decision-making, and capacity buildingall should support and
strengthen the development effectiveness o f eradicationefforts.

7.8      Program Financing. While incremental financing is neededto support this more
aggressive strategy, (i)partners that have traditionally investedinthe NSCP (USAID,
AfDB, andthe World Bank)havereoriented their support around HealthSector Reform,
and(ii) o f 1999, Egyptachieved lower middle-income status andgraduated from IDA
         as
to IBRDlending. The costing and financing o fthis new strategy, as well as its
appropriate integrationinto health sector reform, will be critical to its success.

The World Bank report about evaluation of National Schistosomiasis Control Program
(NSCP)

   0   The report for evaluation (NSCP) include that it was hnded the prqyam by loan number
       2403 by 26.8 million US Dollars, Implementation started in 15/6/1993 till 30/9/2002 for
       extending the National Programs to include west and east D d t a governorates and
       supporting other activities for Schistosomiasis control ingovernorates all over Egypt which
       included previously in the National Programs and the rate of expenses during this period
       was 83%

   0   T h i s evaluation was done in November 2007 by World Band Committee after field visits
       for some governorates e.g. ( Alexandria - Menoufia - Menia and Qena ) for monitoring
       the activities which supportedbythe program.

   e   Indicators and results of the evaluation confirm that there is decrease in sequence of
       Schistosomiasis prevalence intestinal & urinary ( 14.8% ,6.6%) in 1993 the startingyear o f
       the piograms to (2.7%, 1.9% ) in2002 at the endo f programs and itbecome (1.5%, 1.2%)
       at the end o f2006.

      The report indicate that the programs made an efforts to achieve this goals through
      extending to cover all governorates to include west & east Delta governorates by-renovate
      and strengthen the control activities by providing Praziquantel for mass chemotherapy to (
      population and school children ) and also byprovidingmulloscicides for snail control, Lab.
      Equipments and training for health staff.

  0   Inreportthe sharingofWorldBankrepresents thethirdfrom whichachievedinthe fieldof
      Schistosomiasiscontrol as external hndduring the program and the rest was achieved from
      governmental investments byimproving environmental sanitation inmost villages.


  0   Six years have passed since program 'closing, while the lessons remain relevant, new
      developments- pose additional challenges to their application. The hll support and
      continued implementation o f Schistosomiasis activities will need to be ensured inthe mew
      context and incentive structure embedded in Egypt's Health Sector Reform Program. The
      development by MoHP/EDCDwith WHO assistance o f a proposal in,2007,which changes
      the national Schistosomiasis strategy from control to eradication, requires new investments,
      intensified efforts and hrther adjustments to program strategy and organization. While
      incremental financing is needed to support this more aggressive strategy. The partners that
      have traditionaliy invested inthe NSCP (USAID,AFDB andthe World Bank).
