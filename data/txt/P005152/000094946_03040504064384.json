The lessons learned indicate that\n            the Schistosomiasis project has been characterized by its\n            compliance to implement the recommended international sound\n            and widely recognized control strategies. In addition, Egypt\n            has adapted the control strategies to the country situation\n            taking into consideration the epidemiological and\n            demographic pattern, these were used to select and target\n            priority intervention areas. Awareness campaigns created an\n            adequate understanding of the consequences of the disease\n            among the public. The need to expand the coverage of the\n            National Schistosomiasis Control Program to Nile Delta has\n            long been recognized in Egypt. This project lacked a\n            detailed and clear implementation plan which led to a\n            misunderstanding of the specific activities that were to be\n            implemented and financed. The client would have been better\n            guided and assisted if a well-planned project was launched,\n            more supervision provided, and monitoring of higher budgets.\n            Capacity building activities would have ensured an earlier\n            start of the project and would have avoided delays in\n            implementation. A list of indicators was developed at the\n            project preparation stage without a baseline or clear\n            arrangements for data collection, analysis and reporting\n            that led to unsatisfactor"}, "docdt": "2003-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
