Specifically, the five-year project will\n            support: (a) accelerated issuance of title deeds to eligible\n            land owners; (b) producing cadastral maps in rural and urban\n            areas in a uniform mapping system; (c) improving land\n            administration service delivery; and (d) developing the\n            Central Valuation Authority to provide an effective national\n            property valuation function. A main thrust of this third\n            phase is to ensure the sustainability of technical and\n            managerial capacity by productivity improvements and\n            implementation of human resource development strategies.
