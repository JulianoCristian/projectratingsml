secure documented\n            land tenure to eligible land owners, developing the long\n            term sustainability of the Department of Lands'\n            institutional capacity, improving land administration\n            service delivery, and developing an effective national\n            valuation function. Specifically, the five-year project will\n            support: (a) accelerated issuance of title deeds to eligible\n            land owners; (b) producing cadastral maps in rural and urban\n            areas in a uniform mapping system; (c) improving land\n            administration service delivery; and (d) developing the\n            Central Valuation Authority to provide an effective national\n            property valuation function. A main thrust of this third\n            phase is to ensure the sustainability of technical and\n            managerial capacity by productivity improvements and\n            implementation of human resource development strategies. The\n            Australian International Development Assistance Bureau will\n            cofinance technical assistance and training in key areas."}, "docdt": "1994-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
