The lessons learned indicate that following up\n            sector work, targets and implementation plans are better\n            conceived. However, when components involve coordination\n            between multiple agencies, new technologies or changing\n            roles of public institutions increase the difficulty of well\n            thought-out plans. Demarcation of forest boundaries suffered\n            considerable delays and its achievement was much lower than\n            the planned targets due to lack of working arrangements,\n            policy direction, and coordination between Department of\n            Lands, Land Development Department, and Royal Forestry\n            Department. Introduction of new technologies should be\n            phased and tested at a smaller-scale before expansion.\n            Property valuation development programs should clearly\n            identify the respective roles of the public and private\n            sector in valuation, and the most appropriate\n            institution/agency for support to valuation development. A\n            strong commitment of the borrower/implementing agencies is a\n            prerequisite for successful implementation. Bold\n            initiatives, such as this 20-year program to provide land\n            titles, create spill-over effects and valuable public-sector competency."}, "docdt": "2003-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
