   follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            Bank's entering strategy into sensitive political\n            topics in complex environments should be carefully\n            scrutinized. Being transparent and earning buy-in from\n            stakeholders on the reform process is essential: if the\n            final industrial structure is not defined ex ante, the\n            restructuring assessment should be inclusive of all\n            stakeholders to succeed. If one aims at important power\n            sector reforms, having a clear and explicit understanding of\n            the political economy challenges is essential to understand\n            who the winners and losers behind the reform are."}, "docdt": "2013-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
