                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Ministry of Energy and Water has improved the performance of this project, and is now on track to complete project activities by the Project Closing Date. Sustained improvement in
                         the performance of this project will require close monitoring of Consultants' work in developing a roadmap for Corporatization of EdL, and in supporting a final investment decision for
                         LNG supply. MoEW will also need to continue engagement with other stakeholders, particularly in the development of a roadmap for corporatization of EdL given the political
                         sensitivity around this issue.
