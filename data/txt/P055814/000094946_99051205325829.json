       enhance the ability of Tunisian private exporters to\n            integrate into the global economy. The project will foster\n            export competitiveness of Tunisian firms by mitigating some\n            of the disadvantages they encounter relative to their\n            foreign competitors. There are three project components. 1)\n            Export market access will include a grant fund to cover on a\n            temporary basis up to 50 percent of the cost of consultant\n            services required to enable enterprises to enter export\n            markets. The component will offer its services solely in\n            response to private sector demand on a\n            first-come-first-serve basis. 2) Preshipment export finance\n            guarantee will encourage financial institutions to provide\n            preshipment financing to small enterprises medium\n            enterprises and emerging exporters with viable export\n            contracts whose perceived nonperformance risk is greater\n            than their actual risk because they are unable to provide\n            adequate collateral or do not have a suitable credit history\n            to prove that they are creditworthy. 3) Trade facilitation\n            component will support investments and technical assistance\n            required to reduce the number of procedures and transaction\n            costs involved in trading activity, with special emphasis on\n            customs procedures and electronic exchange of trade-related documents."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
