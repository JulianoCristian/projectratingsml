The primary lesson indicates that\n            expanding EMAF (Export Market Access Fund)-like\n            public-private partnerships for effective export development\n            is more effective than purely public, and centralized\n            support. EMAF clients now pay half of the technical\n            assistance costs of export business development services,\n            and, surveys reflect that 60 percent are ready to cover the\n            full costs of export consultants. This demand-driven\n            approach has also simultaneously helped stimulate a new\n            local market of business development services, focused on\n            the export market. Success of this partnership depends upon\n            a delicate balance of public policy and financial support,\n            and a light, flexible and efficient private sector-like\n            program execution. The balance achieved in EMAF is essential\n            for the success of subsequent operations, and other such\n            programs. Notwithstanding, it is emphasized that a strong\n            and credible management team, cultivating good relations\n            with financial institutions is critical for schemes such as\n            the Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee (PEFG), that serve\n            as catalyst to address export financing constraints. Proper\n            promotion and marketing of the scheme is as important. For\n            PEFG-like schemes to succeed, key non-performance risks\n            should be addressed: the survey conducted among firms and\n            banks, confirmed that the instrument is needed, useful, and\n            effective, but it will not work unless the bad-faith issue\n            is addressed. Further lessons reinforce the importance of a\n            strong Government commitment, of collaboration and\n            coordination among the various agencies, of an established\n            trade regulatory framework, and, of simplified factors for\n            trade facilitation."}, "docdt": "2005-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
