                  Second Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sir:
      We refer to the Loan Agreement entered into between Instituto
Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE) and International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated June 7, 1988.
      Whereas the Bank waived as a condition of effectiveness on
September 28, 1989 the requirement of Section 7.01 concerning the
Fideicomiso Contract (as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement)
and Section 7.02 (b) requiring a legal opinion thereon pursuant to
Section 12.02 of the General Conditions of the Bank applicable to
Loan and Guarantee Agreements dated January 1, 1985 on condition
that this Amendment Letter be entered into by all parties concerned.
      It is hereby agreed that the Loan Agreement be amended as
follows:
      In Schedule I paragraph 3:
            In sub-paragraph (a) the word "and' shall be deleted at
            the end of such sub-paragraph;
            In sub-paragraph (b) the word "and" shall be inserted at
            the end of such sub-paragraph: and
            A new sub-paragraph (c) shall be inserted, to read as
            follows:
            "In respect of payments made for expenditures under Part
            A of the Project, unless the Bank shall have received
            the duly signed Fideicomiso Contract referred to in
            Section 3.02 (b) of the Loan Agreement, satisfactory to
            the Bank, and a legal opinion from counsel acceptable to
            the Bank stating that the Fidecomiso Contract has been
            duly authorized or ratified by the Borrower, the Bank
            administering the Fideicamiso and EEG, and is legally
            binding upon the parties hereto, in accordance with its
            terms."
      The amendment set forth in this Agreement Letter shall come
into full force and effect on the date.upon which the Bank shall
acknowledge receipt of all duly countersigned copies of this
Agreement.
      Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing
the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
                         Sincerely yours,
