F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objectives are to: (i) improve the water and sewerage services
of Cartagena and the sanitary conditions of the city poorest population, by expanding
water and sewerage coverage, particularly in the city poor neighborhoods, (ii) facilitate
the environmental cleanup of water bodies surrounding the city (Cartagena Bay,
Caribbean beaches and Cienaga de la Virgen estuary) by providing adequate collection,
treatment and disposal of the entire flow of the city wastewater; and (iii) improve the
sustainability of water and sewerage services in Cartagena by leveraging Bank support to
shore up the private sector participation (PSP) model pioneered by ACUACAR, the city
mixed-capital water and sanitation utility, against the prospect of political interference.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The District of Cartagena was one of the first municipalities in Colombia to introduce private
sector participation in the water sector following the 1994 Public Services Law that expanded the role of
private operators and created a national tariff regulator, the Comisión Reguladora de Agua Potable y
Saneamiento (CRA) and a service quality regulator, the Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos
Domiciliarios (SSPD). After many years of chronic inefficiencies in the provision of water supply and
sanitation services (WSS), the District decided to liquidate the municipal utility and create a new public-
private mixed capital enterprise with Bank's support through a previous technical assistance loan (Loan
2961-CO for the "Colombia Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Project"). In December 1994, Aguas de
Barcelona (AGBAR, the privately owned Water Company of Barcelona), was selected as the partner of
the municipality, and the mixed enterprise Aguas de Cartagena (ACUACAR) was created with an initial
capital of US$4 million. ACUACAR took over the responsibility for the provision of WSS services in
June 1995. The District was responsible for capital investments to expand the existing WSS system,
while ACUACAR was responsible for capital expenditures to improve the existing system. At appraisal,
ACUACAR had been in operation for three and a half years and it had achieved significant improvements
in operational performance and service quality.1

2.       Despite significant progress in improving the efficiency and quality of WSS service provision,
Cartagena still faced many challenges, including: (i) insufficient water supply coverage especially in poor
neighborhoods located in the vicinity of the Cienaga de la Virgen; (ii) insufficient sewerage services
especially in the poorest areas around the Cienaga and in zones adjacent to the Cartagena Bay in where
open sewage canals on streets was common; (iii) inadequate domestic wastewater management system
with untreated wastewater discharging to the Cartagena Bay, the Cienaga, and the inner-city water
courses; and (iv) industrial wastewater discharges from the Mamonal zone to the Cartagena Bay with
minimal treatment. This situation generated public health,sanitation, and environmental problems, which
had negative impacts on the quality of life of the local population and posed serious restrictions to the
city's sustainable economic development, especially in the tourism sector.

3.     To address the outstanding WSS challenges, the District and ACUACAR developed a water and
wastewater master plan and implementation strategy that primarily relied on two projects:

(i)    The Cartagena Expansion of Sewerage System financed by the Inter-American Development
Bank (IADB) to improve sanitary conditions in the Cartagena Bay drainage basin. The project was
completed in March 2006, and it increased sewerage coverage in the basin, rehabilitated old networks and
upgraded hydraulic capacity of networks, and rehabilitated the existing outfall located in the Cartagena
Bay. The map section of this report depicts a schematic of the IADB-financed works.

(ii)    The Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage, and Environmental Management Project ("the Project")
with financing from the World Bank. The Project aimed to expand water supply coverage and production
capacity, expand sewerage networks and improve the sewerage system in the Cienaga de la Virgen basin,
and enhance wastewater management in Cartagena. The wastewater management plan consisted of a
conveyance system for the entire city's wastewater to a preliminary treatment plant which would

1
  From 1996 to 1999, water and sewerage coverage increased from 73 to 80 percent and 61 to 65 percent, respectively; 24 hr
continuity of services went from 60 to 70 percent of the customers; water meter installation increased from 77 to 99 percent of
the connections; and the number of clients increased from 178,000 to 363,000.


                                                              1
subsequently discharge the treated wastewater into the Caribbean Sea through a submarine outfall.
Schematics of the works under this Project are shown in the map section.

4.       The Bank, through Loan 2961-CO for the "Colombia Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
Project", provided technical assistance to support the privatization process in Cartagena and had financed
several water sector reform projects in Colombia. Despite the substantial improvements in the late
nineties, the reform process was considered vulnerable to political interference from future mayors, since
the implementation process was still in its early stage and the District owned 50 percent of ACUACAR's
shares. The Bank's participation in this Project at this critical juncture was considered to be essential to
help consolidate the sector reform and establish a much needed credibility of the mixed enterprise model
in Cartagena, where the public sector is responsible for financing major infrastructure investments.

5.      The Colombia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 1997 identified the poor and deteriorated
state of the country's infrastructure as a critical constraint to economic growth and the government's
strategy emphasized private sector participation to expand WSS services and improve wastewater
treatment infrastructure. The Project contributed to the CAS objectives of improving infrastructure
services and ensuring sustainable development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (from Project Appraisal
Document)

6.       The project development objectives are to (i) improve the water and sewerage services of
Cartagena and the sanitary conditions of the city's poorest population, by expanding water and sewerage
coverage, particularly in the city's poor neighborhoods; (ii) facilitate the environmental cleanup of water
bodies surrounding the city (Cartagena Bay, Caribbean beaches and Ciénaga de la Virgen) by providing
adequate collection, treatment and disposal of the entire flow of the city's wastewater; and (iii) improve
the sustainability of water and sewerage services in Cartagena by leveraging Bank support to shore up the
private sector participation (PSP) model pioneered by ACUACAR, the city's mixed-capital water and
sanitation utility, against the prospect of political interference.

7.       The key performance indicators for the project development objectives presented in the PAD are
(i) environmental indicators which measure sewerage coverage and volume of sewage treated; (ii)
"utility-based" indicators which measure the operational and financial efficiency of ACUACAR; and (iii)
financial indicators of the District of Cartagena. Details of the performance indicators are provided in the
results monitoring framework (Annex 1 of the PAD), which includes a total of 29 outcome indicators to
measure and monitor progress toward the PDOs.

8.       Although the outcome indicators were appropriate to measure and define the PDOs, there were
too many, and they were not well organized in the results framework, making the monitoring and
evaluation process complicated. In an effort to bring order to the evaluation, the ICR simplified the

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.       The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

10.      According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the primary targeted beneficiaries were
80,000 people located in Cartagena's poorest neighborhoods. These people were classified as among the 2
first two (and lowest income) consumer categories in Colombia's six point classification of consumers.
This group directly benefited from project investments in increasing sewerage and water supply coverage;
however, during project implementation the targeted beneficiaries increased to 272,700 due to the
inclusion of additional communities.

11.      A secondary target group was the entire permanent population of Cartagena (750, 000 inhabitants
at the time of appraisal) and the tourist population (700,000 annually), as they would benefit from the
improvements in the reliability of the water supply service and especially from the environmental
improvements that wastewater collection, treatment and safe disposal systems would bring to the
Caribbean beaches, the Cienaga, and the Cartagena Bay. In 2008, the permanent population in Cartagena
increased to 902,000 and the tourist population increased to about 900,000 annually.

12.     In a larger sense, by strengthening ACUACAR and the reform process, the Project also benefited
the water and sanitation sector in Colombia, since ACUACAR has served as a model for the
transformation of water utilities nationwide.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

remove rags, floatable material, and large solids, and (ii) two vortex-type grit chambers.

18.      Component E - Construction of Submarine Outfall: This component consisted of construction of
the submarine outfall for the safe discharge of the pre-treated effluent to the Caribbean Sea near Punta
Canoa. Total outfall length would be 2,850 m and the discharge point (diffuser area) would be submerged
at a depth of 20 m.

19.      Component F - Industrial Wastewater Discharge Control: This component addressed the issues
related to industrial wastes discharged to the municipal sewerage network, and included the following
activities: (i) carrying out a survey to identify key sources of industrial pollution in the city of Cartagena;
(ii) establishing a system for regulating the discharge of industrial wastes, either to the sewerage system
or to receiving bodies; (iii) establishing a system for auditing the status of industrial wastes discharge; (iv)
defining strategies to control small and dispersed sources of industrial pollution discharging to the
sewerage networks (gasoline stations and mechanical repair shops); and (v) providing technical assistance
in selection and design of pretreatment processes.

20.     Component G - Environmental and Social Component: This component sought to implement
mitigation measures of the project's environmental and social impacts. The environmental management
program included: (i) environmental supervision during construction; (ii) restoration and conservation of
the Ciénaga de la Virgen nature reserve; (iii) carrying out a monitoring program before and after
construction of the marine outfall to study the fate of coliforms and other contaminants discharged
through the outfall; and (iv) environmental institutional strengthening program. The social management
program included: (i) a social consultation and communication program; (ii) organization and
strengthening of the communities of La Boquilla, Punta Canoa, Las Palmeras, El Pozon, and Manzanillo
del Mar; (iii) construction rehabilitation and equipping of community centers in La Boquilla, Punta
Canoa, and Las Palmeras; (iv) supporting in house basic sanitation in La Boquilla; and (v) strengthening
of the Community Relations Unit of ACUACAR.

21.     Component H - Project Management, Technical Assistance, Studies, Design and Supervision:
Provision of technical assistance in the design and supervision of the activities under Parts A, B, C, D,
and E of the Project, the auditing of procurement procedures, and the overall management of the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

22.     The project components were not formally revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

23.     There were no significant changes in the design, scope, scale and implementation arrangements
of the Project, but there were changes in the implementation schedule and funding allocations. The
implementation of Components C, D, and E, which constitute the wastewater management system
(WMS) and represent about 50 percent of project cost, faced significant delays caused by a lengthy
authorization of an environmental license for these works, an unsuccessful bidding process that required
rebidding, and an Inspection Panel investigation followed by the implementation of a Bank management
action plan to respond to the Inspection Panel report. The delays were therefore attributed to the
Borrower as much as to the Bank. These events are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2, and a
summary of the Inspection Panel is presented in Annex 10. As a result, the Bank provided two extensions
to complete the works and meet the PDO: a two-year extension in June 2005, when about 40 percent of
the loan amount had been disbursed, and another two-year extension in May 2007, when 70 percent of the
loan was disbursed. The Project closed in June 28, 2009, as scheduled in the second loan extension,
without being fully executed due to delays in completing two contracts - the land conveyance pipeline and
the submarine outfall. Since another extension was not considered critical as the loan was fully disbursed,
the Borrower and the Bank agreed to complete all the project works afterwards with counterpart funds.
The Bank team continued to provide supervision after the loan closed, as part of the ICR exercise.

24.      In addition, three amendments to the Loan Agreement where issued during implementation. The
first amendment (2003) was to finance water supply works to poor communities in the north zone of
Cartagena and sewerage works to complete the wastewater collection system in the southeastern zone of
Cartagena. These two works were originally supposed to be financed by the District, but they were
unable to finance them due to the economic crisis that hit Colombia in 2003. The second amendment
(2006) involved converting the financial clause of a variable spread loan to a fixed spread loan to provide
the Borrower with access to the Bank's financial products for the purpose of managing the volatility of
interest and currency exchange rates. The last amendment (2009) was to increase the Bank's financing
percentage of the Category of Works from 75 to 100 percent to allow full disbursement of the loan and to
reallocate funds between categories to adjust the allocation (estimated 10 years earlier) to the Project's
actual expenditures and needs.




2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)



                                                    5
25.      The Project built directly upon the success of the PSP model in Cartagena in which the Bank had
been instrumental in helping with sector transformation. The up-front resolution of the Cartagena water
sector institutional issues by the creation of ACUACAR ensured high quality provision of services and
sustainability of investments, and provided a sound basis for Bank participation in the Project.

26.      Background analysis during project preparation was crucial in terms of scope, relevance, and
quality for appropriate project design. ACUACAR's water supply and wastewater master plans provided
detailed background information and a solid implementation plan that helped project preparation.
Furthermore, international engineering consultants prepared a feasibility study and an environmental
assessment that considered a full range of wastewater management alternatives, of treatment options and,
subsequently, of outfall construction sites. An international panel of experts and Bank staff provided
guidance in carrying out these studies to ensure worldwide experience was considered in the selection
process. These activities were partially funded by a Japanese Trust Fund (TF029605). The comprehensive
background analyses allowed the Bank to correctly identify and include a number of key project design
aspects such as (i) an important poverty focus through the expansion of WSS coverage to impoverished
communities; (ii) an environmentally safe and cost-effective wastewater management system solution for
a coastal city given the financial constrains of the District and ACUACAR, and the needs to first expand
water and sewerage; (iii) technical assistance to control industrial wastewater discharges; and (iv) social
and environmental programs to accompany infrastructure components. The lessons that contributed to the
success of the Project include front-loading institutional change, safeguards against political interference
through loan conditions to maintain PSP, and appropriate design standards to prevent overestimation of
water demand and minimize over-design risk of water and wastewater facilities.

27.      The three PDOs reflected Cartagena's essential priorities for the water and wastewater sector as
identified by the District, the national government, and the CAS at the time. The PDOs were clear and
specific, and the design provided a cause and effect relationship between the PDOs and their outcomes.
The component design was found to be adequate to achieving the PDOs and provided important social
and environmental dimensions to infrastructure projects. Nevertheless, the Inspection Panel case
presented by poor communities in the north zone of Cartagena, reflected the need for a more
comprehensive social plan in this area, including a more explicit stakeholder analysis and a stronger
communication strategy to dissipate doubts and create a better understanding of the Project. In addition,
the original cost estimates formulated during project preparation for the WMS turned out to be low,
resulting in subsequent procurement complications when bids for some major works turned out to be
much higher than originally budgeted.

28.     At the time of appraisal, the commitment of the Borrower was high as evidenced by the
privatization reform process and the significant investments in expansion of WSS networks by
ACUACAR and the District. Moreover, the technical capacity of ACUACAR for project implementation
was strong as demonstrated by the WSS coverage expansion achievements and the development of a
comprehensive strategy that laid the foundation for the design of this Project. At the national level,
environmental sustainability, improved sewerage coverage for unserved urban areas and the need for
private capital for the WSS sector figured highly on the government's agenda. The District, ACUACAR,
and the national government continued to demonstrate ownership after almost 10 years of implementation
and the passing of six district administrations.

29.     Identification of risks and mitigation measures were generally adequate; however, the risks from
a lengthy authorization of an environmental license and opposition from stakeholders to the selected
wastewater management solution were not included in the PAD risk matrix, and when these events
occurred they caused significant delays in project implementation. Additionally, the risk of not
implementing sewerage works financed by other sources was seen as negligible, but this actually
materialized when the District suffering from an economic crisis and was not able to finance a WSS

                                                     6
project in the north zone, which was critical to the overall success of the Project. While a mitigation
effort was not indicated during appraisal, the works in the north zone were completed with Bank
financing.

30.      Despite these aforementioned shortcomings, which were difficult to foresee at the preparation
stage, it is noteworthy the close attention paid to the lessons learned under other projects, the due
diligence during background analysis, and the close collaboration and ownership created between the
District, ACUACAR, the national government, and the Bank team.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

31.     The Project has been successfully implemented in spite of serious project delays and other issues
indicated in Table 2. Credit for this achievement goes to the strong capacity, commitment and
determination of ACUACAR, strong government support, and to a very proactive and experienced Bank
task team. As mentioned before, a major factor contributing to the success was the up-front work to
strengthen the water sector in Cartagena with the creation of ACUACAR. In addition, the high quality of
professional expertise provided by ACUACAR, international consulting firms, Bank staff, and panel of
experts during project preparation and implementation contributed to the Project success's, and this also
allowed Bank management to address concerns arising from the Inspection Panel investigation and to
prepare a solid action plan that was approved by the Bank Board of Executive Directors and executed
successfully.

 Year                                                                Comments
 1998 -    Project preparation. Environmental license for the WMS was submitted to the environmental regional authority in
  1999     Cartagena (CARDIQUE) in April 1998.
           Loan agreement became effective on January 19. Environmental license process underway during the first part of
           2000, but progress delayed due to objections to the outfall construction from local communities in the north zone and
           rich land owners with strong political ties.(1) An environmental license authorization was expected in October 2000, but
           instead CARDIQUE issued a request for additional actions to be conducted by ACUACAR, who shifted priorities from
 2000      project implementation to respond to this request.
           In June, the environmental license was issued, but several citizen groups opposed to the outfall appealed CARDIQUE's
           decision. After the appeal was rejected the objecting groups appealed to the Ministry of Environment, and this took
           almost 10 months to resolve. The District requested that the Bank finance the water and sanitation works for four
 2001      communities in the north zone that were originally under the District's responsibility per the Loan Agreement.
           The Ministry of Environment rejected the appeals and issued a resolution ratifying the environmental license issued by
           CARDIQUE. Design for the WMS was completed and bidding documents for four main contracts (Paraiso PS, on
           shore force main, treatment plant, and submarine outfall) were underway. It was reported that the WMS design took
 2002      longer than expected due to the technical complexity of the systems.
           First loan amendment was approved to finance water and sanitation works in the north zone and complete the
           wastewater collection system in the southern zone of Cartagena. The District was originally responsible for both
 2003      works.
           The bidding process for the four main contracts initiated in January, but three of the bidding processes (pumping
           station, treatment plant, and outfall) were voided. The pumping station and the treatment plant were rebid, resulting in
           successful contracts. On April 24, the Inspection Panel received a request for inspection from members of a Colombian
           NGO, Corporación Cartagena Honesta representing the north zone residents, which raised concerns about the impact of
           the Project on their culture and way of life, as well as the pollution impact on their health. The Board of Directors
           approved the Inspection Panel investigation, which took over a year to complete. The second bidding process for the
 2004      outfall was postponed pending the completion of the IP.

  Year                                                             Comments
            The original project closing date was June 30, 2005. The Bank approved a two-year project extension to complete the
            WMS. The Inspection Panel submitted its final report in June, and management submitted its "Report and
            Recommendation" with a detailed action plan to the Board in July. In November, the Board accepted the proposed
            management action plan and instructed management to continue with project implementation while executing the
            proposed action plan. In addition, the project team agreed to carry out a 3D modeling study, recommended by an
            Inspection Panel expert, and to proceed with the project on the basis of the results. The 3D modeling was expected to
  2005      last one month.
            Studies under the management action plan were conducted. The 3D modeling lasted 8 months and confirmed the 2D
            model results that a submarine outfall 2.85 km long was an adequate wastewater disposal solution for Cartagena. The
  2006      outfall second bidding process initiated after implementation of the action plan and completion of the 3D modeling.
            The Bank approved a second two-year project extension due to delays caused by the Inspection Panel investigation,
            implementation of management action plan, and 3D modeling study, as well as delays caused by an unsuccessful
            second bidding process of the outfall that required lengthy proposal reviews and negotiations. To avoid further delays
            with a third bidding process, ACUACAR, with the Bank's no objection, voided the bidding process and negotiated a
  2007      direct contract with the lowest bidder.
            ACUACAR reported that an additional amount of US$15 million to complete the Project was needed, mainly because
            of the need to finance works that were originally under the District's responsibility and to a minor extent because of the
            devaluation of the US dollar. This amount was available in the Project Fiduciary Account, accumulated by Colombian
            counterpart funds. Since the outfall works were delayed due to initial contract negotiations, the District decided to
  2008      borrow counterpart funds from other sections and return the funds when needed.
            The Project closed in June 28, 2009 without completing the onshore pipeline and the submarine outfall. The Bank and
            the Borrower decided to fully disburse the Bank Loan proceeds through a loan amendment to pay for part of these two
            contracts before the closing date, and the District committed its own funds to bring the Project to a successful
            completion by the end of 2009. However, due to a severe rainy season and delays in obtaining a road right of way, the
            onshore pipeline was not completed, and the outfall begun with a slow contract execution, which was then affected by
  2009      sea conditions that impeded its completion by the end of 2009.
            The onshore pipeline was completed in mid April; however, contract execution of the outfall has been slower than
  2010      expected and its installation is expected to be completed in July and in full operation in September 2010.
(1) The communities include Punta Canoa, Arroyo de Piedra, Manzanillo del Mar living in the north zone of Cartagena near the proposed
outfall location.

32.      Strong oppositions to the project outfall from local communities in the north zone and special
interest groups played a significant role during project implementation, as they contributed to a lengthy
authorization of the environmental license (27 months after loan effectiveness) through several appeals
and later requested an Inspection Panel investigation (taking about 20 months to complete the process).
Despite the small number of people opposing the project, several were considered powerful and well
connected.

33.     Project preparation envisioned specific activities for the population in the north zone under the
Mitigation and Community Development Program (MCDP), including the provision of WSS services and
the construction of two community centers to support the District's Urban Rehabilitation Program.
During implementation, these activities fell behind schedule, delaying important benefits to the
community, and perhaps contributing to project oppositions. In addition to completing these activities,
ACUACAR also arranged for community members to visit existing outfalls in Chile and Uruguay and
conducted activities under the Management Inspection Panel Action Plan, including a program to
strengthen fishing activities (i.e. training and equipment acquisition), a plant nursery, and a public beach
front with tents and sport courts, all to be to be managed cooperatively by the community to create jobs
and improve the well-being of the population. Furthermore, ACUACAR employed people from the north
zone for the construction and operation of the project facilities. The completion of these actions provided
direct benefits to the population, and coupled with the Inspection Panel findings and the decision of the
Bank's Board to continue with the proposed WMS solution after additional technical studies confirmed

                                                            8
that the outfall would not affect public health and marine ecosystems in the area, helped to dissipate
doubts and create a better understanding among stakeholders that improved project acceptance.

34.     One of the main issues during the Inspection Panel investigation was the selected option of a
submarine outfall for disposing Cartagena's wastewater and the outfall's location. The inspection
requested that additional technical studies be undertaken to confirm the location and design of the outfall
delaying the implementation of the project significantly. Annex 10 provides an overview of the technical
issues associated with Inspection Panel request, as well as a summary of other issues brought by the
requesters.

35.      The Project also encountered significant procurement challenges with the bidding process for the
WMS which was divided into four main contracts: (i) Paraiso Pump Station; (ii) preliminary treatment
plant; (iii) on-shore force main; and (iv) submarine outfall. During the first bidding process, only the on-
shore force main was successfully awarded; the other three bidding processes were voided as the lowest
cost proposals were significantly higher than their estimated costs. The pumping station and the treatment
plant were successfully awarded after a rebidding process in where ACUACAR divided the contracts into
two separate packages: civil works and equipment to attract competition from qualified national and
international contractors. In the case of the submarine outfall, ACUACAR adjusted the design and
specifications to replace the reinforced concrete cylindrical pipe (RCCP) pipe material to high density
polyethylene (HDPE) in an effort to lower the costs. The second bidding process for the outfall was
suspended pending the completion of IP. Approximately 20 months after the first bidding process took
place, the rebidding of the outfall was carried out, but the results were again unsuccessful as ACUACAR
was not able to reach an agreement with the lowest responsive and qualified bidder, who submitted the
third lowest price, but was significantly higher than the estimated cost. The bidding process was therefore
cancelled for the second time. In an effort to save time, ACUACAR was able to negotiate with the lowest
bidder to adjust the offer so as make it technically responsive and received a waiver from the Bank to
allow for direct contracting.

36.     The project ICR was postponed six months to mid-2010 with Operations Policy and Country
Services (OPCS) approval to allow for completion of the WMS. At the end of the ICR preparation, all
project activities and contracts were completed except the submarine outfall. From January to March
2010, outfall construction was slower than expected due to rough sea conditions. After March, the
weather conditions in Cartagena normally improved, and a Bank mission conducted in April 2010
confirmed that the work was proceeding at full speed. ACUACAR forecasts that the outfall will be
completed and installed in July 2010, and commissioned in September 2010.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.    M&E Design. It is important to note that the PAD was formulated in 1999, and there have
subsequently been changes in the Bank's M&E guidelines and the introduction of ISRs.

38.      The PAD included three overall key performance indicators for the three parts of the PDO: (i)
environmental indicators which measure sewerage coverage rate and volume of sewage treated rate; (ii)
utility-based indicators which measure the operational and financial efficiency of ACUACAR; and (iii)
financial indicators of the District of Cartagena. Annex 1A of the PAD provided a results framework
matrix with details on these performance indicators. The framework included a total of 29 outcome
indicators to measure and monitor progress toward the PDO, and five output indicators to measure
component objectives. Overall, the indicators were specific in terms of quantity, quality and time, except
in the case of two outcome indicators associated with the first PDO, namely: (i) evacuation of wastewater
in open channels on the street; and (ii) discharge of wastewater to the Cienaga through the storm drainage
system, as these both lacked specificity in terms of data measurement.

                                                     9
39.     One of the outcome indicators "reduction of pathogenic coliform contamination in water bodies"
corresponding to the second PDO lacked explicit baseline values in the PAD and a protocol for data
measurement. Although the baseline water quality information existed at the time of project preparation,
this was not formally incorporated into the PAD results framework.

40.      The direct relationship between the District financial indicators and the third PDO was not clear,
as the PAD indicated that these indicators would only measure the District capacity to repay the loan and
to provide counterpart funding and not to measure the development objective. At the output level, the
results framework did not include specific indicators for the industrial wastewater discharge control and
environmental and social components even though, on a smaller scale, they also contributed to the PDO.

41.     Despite these shortcomings, the ICR considers that the selected outcome indicators were
appropriate to measure and define the three PDOs; however, the Project could have benefited from fewer
indicators in a simplified framework connecting each PDO with its corresponding indicator.

42.     M&E Implementation. The Bank and ACUACAR, in close collaboration with CARDIQUE,
collected baseline data and tracked indicator performance during the implementation of the project.
ACUACAR submitted periodic reports to the Bank, which included project activities and calculation of
performance indicators. The Bank verified, monitored, and evaluated the Project conditions reported by
ACUACAR during supervision missions. Furthermore, ACUACAR and CARDIQUE are implementing
a water quality monitoring program along the beaches of Cartagena, the Bay, and the Cienaga to measure
the before and after effects of the Project and compliance with Colombian water quality standards. To
simplify reporting of the PDO indicators, the Project Team only reported three main indicators in the
Implementation Status Reports (ISR): (i) water coverage; (ii) sewerage coverage; and (iii) continuity of
water supply service. Although these indicators were appropriate, they focused mostly on the first PDO
(improve WSS services) and the ISR indicators do not directly address the second and third PDOs-
environmental clean-up and sustainability.

43.      M&E Utilization. M&E information was used to provide feedback to ACUACAR, the District,
and other agencies on issues pertaining to project implementation and sector performance. The Bank team
also used the M&E information to report progress and support decision-making. Furthermore, service
quality indicators played a key role in enhancing ACUACAR's internal transparency and responsiveness.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.      Environmental Safeguards. Although the Project had significant beneficial environmental and
health impacts as it provided sewage collection and treatment in the City of Cartagena, the Project was
classified as a Category A due to potential negative environmental impacts during construction and
operation if not properly mitigated. A comprehensive environmental assessment (EA) and environmental
management plan (EMP) were developed during preparation, reviewed by an international panel of
experts, and consulted with the public following Bank policies. The EMP was implemented satisfactory
with close supervision from Bank staff and CARDIQUE, and it included measures to mitigate
environmental impacts during construction and other activities to enhance environmental conditions in
Cartagena that complemented the benefits from the wastewater works. Noteworthy are the
implementation of a comprehensive program for monitoring the quality of sea water and the sea bed
before and after construction of the outfall and the Cienaga de la Virgen Restoration and Conservation
program resulting in the declaration of the Cienaga as a protected area.

45.     Social Safeguards. The social assessment conducted during project preparation indicated that
the Project would benefit the poorest communities in Cartagena and that no resettlement or other negative

                                                    10
impact would result. The Mitigation and Community Development Program (MCDP) was designed and
implemented to address concerns raised by low income communities in relation to displacement from
tourism and residential urbanization activities once the benefits of the Project were achieved as well as
nuisances from construction and perceived water quality impacts from the outfall operation. The
activities under the MCDP, which are also part of the environmental and social component, focused on
strengthening community organization and consolidating urban and rural neighborhoods. These activities
were conducted moderately satisfactorily due to delays in getting benefits to the north zone communities
and reduced support from the District after changes in the administration. During implementation, the
MCDP was strengthened with training activities and equipment to optimize fishing activities in the north
zone as per the outfall environmental license resolution. Moreover, a plant nursery, a beach front, and
community participation activities combined with an improved communication strategy were also
conducted as a result of the Inspection Panel recommendations.

47.      Although resettlement activities were not expected during project preparation, the involuntary
resettlement policy was triggered when 37 families informally settled on District property on the planned
route of the onshore pressure pipeline, near the Paraiso pumping station, between 2000 and 2003.
Consequently, CORVIVIENDA, in collaboration with ACUACAR and Bank social specialists, prepared
and implemented a Resettlement Plan that included the resettlement of 24 eligible families.3 The families
were resettled to the Villa Zuldany Neighborhood, located approximately 2 km from their previous
residency. The compensation package included land tenure and housing with basic services for each
family; transition period support; and development assistance, including workshops on hygiene and
sanitary conditions in the community and job training. The Resettlement Plan followed Bank policies and
received highly satisfactory marks in the ISR for the way this was handled. In a recent ex-post
evaluation, the resettled families expressed high levels of satisfaction with their new housing and standard
of living compared to what they had before.

48.      Financial Management and Procurement.            Financial management arrangements were
satisfactory through project implementation. Audit and project progress reports were received by their
due dates. Financial management and procurement activities were managed by experienced staff within
ACUACAR in a satisfactory manner. There was no instance of misprocurement, although as noted
earlier the project encountered many procurement challenges and setbacks during implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (Including transition arrangement to post-completion
operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements,
sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

49.      As the WSS utility in Cartagena, ACUACAR, currently provides operation and maintenance
works on the facilities constructed under the Project, and will continue to provide capital investment to
improve the existing water and wastewater systems. After almost 15 years in operation, ACUACAR has
demonstrated that it is a strong and capable utility, achieving significant improvements in operational
performance and service quality, and through the Project it consolidated sector reform and established the
credibility of the mixed enterprise model in Cartagena. ACUACAR also has an adequate incentive to
ensure appropriate operation and maintenance, as works implemented under the Project generated
additional income and strengthen its financial position. In Section 3.2, financial indicators are presented
to demonstrate the sustainability of water and sewerage services. In addition, Cartagena has capable
environmental institutions in CARDIQUE and the District Environmental Department (Establecimiento

Público Ambiental, EPA) that will continue conducting water quality monitoring and implementing
activities aimed at the restoration and conservation of the Cienaga de la Virgen.

50.      According to the environmental license for the WMS, ACUACAR is required to submit to
CARDIQUE by the end of 2010 treatment alternatives and a design to expand the existing WWTP in
order to comply with Colombian effluent discharge criteria by 2015. In addition, the environmental
license requires the implementation of a water quality monitoring study, which will compare water
quality data in the Cartagena's water bodies before, during construction, and after one year of operation of
the wastewater management system. According to the license, the monitoring study results will provide
scientific information to determine whether treatment expansion is necessary at the WWTP beyond
preliminary treatment.

51.     Since the wastewater outfall pipe has not yet been commissioned by the ICR due date, and the
actual water quality impact of the WMS has not been confirmed, it is recommended that the Bank
conducts a one-year post project assessment.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

52.     The overall outcome of the project is based on a combination of the following variables:
relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Each of these three variables is given a rating of high, substantial,
modest, or negligible.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities, and
Bank assistance strategy)

53.       The close policy dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the Bank, stretching back
some four decades, has resulted in a shared vision. The current Country Partnership Strategy, dated March
4, 2008, is derived from the 2006-2010 National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP comprises five
development pillars for each of which the Government has clear goals and progress indicators. The
objectives are aligned with the "Promotion of Equity" pillar and the goals of "Livable cities", "Equity and
Rural Development" and "Infrastructure for Development". The first objective relates strongly to equity
as it targets higher connection rates among the low-income population in Cartagena. The second objective
directly contributes to the targets under the "Environmental Sustainability" pillar through its priority on
preventing and controlling environmental degradation of the Cartagena Bay and Cienaga de la Virgen.
The third objective also contributes to the "High Sustainable Growth" pillar through its emphasis on
competitive contracting procedures and improved sustainability of private operators. Based on the close
alignment of the PDO with the current Colombia development priorities, the Country Partnership
Strategy, and specific urban development and environmental needs of Cartagena, the ICR rates the
relevance of the Project as "high".

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy) (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 2)

54.     The first part of the PDO was to improve the water and sewerage services of Cartagena and the
sanitary conditions of the city's poorest population, by expanding water and sewerage coverage,
particularly in the city's poor neighborhoods. The PDO was measured by the project's success in
achieving three outcome indicators related to better water and sewerage services shown in Table 3.

Table 3. Outcome Indicators to Measure Improved Water and Sewerage Services in Cartagena

Continuity of Service**, %                    95                         98                       99.9
Sewerage Coverage, %                          69                         90                   86 (92)***
* December 2009 values.
**Percentage of users which receive water supply service 24 hours per day
*** 86 percent of households connected to sewers; the sewer infrastructure is sufficient to connect 92 percent of the households.

55.      Cartagena's water coverage increased from 80 percent to 99.9 percent from 2000 to 2009,
corresponding to 78,300 new water connections. The Bank-financed Project directly contributed to
13,800 new water connections, particularly in the city's poor neighborhoods of El Pozon, Villa Estrella,
southeastern zone, Plan Barrios, and north zone benefiting a population of 96,000. Furthermore, the
expansion and improvement of the water production system as well as the construction of the main
distribution pipeline to the north zone area contributed significantly to the other 64,500 new water
connections.

56.      Cartagena's sewerage coverage increased from 69 percent to 86 percent from 2000 to 2009,
adding 66,900 new sewer connections. The Cartagena Bay Expansion of Sewerage System Project
financed by IADB increased the sewer coverage to 75 percent, and the Bank Project increased coverage
from 75 percent to 86 percent. The new sewerage networks under the Bank Project added 57,300 sewer
connections, corresponding to a population of 255,800 located in the neighborhoods of El Pozon, Villa
Estrella, southeastern zone, La Boquilla and surroundings, San Jose de Los Campanos, southwest Zone,
and Falda de la Popa. Although the current sewer household connection rate of 86 percent is slightly
short of the target value of 90 percent, the infrastructure is in place to connect 92 percent of the
households. ACUACAR has a program in place to connect low-income households and expects to reach
92 percent coverage by the end of 2010.

57.     Furthermore, ACUACAR was able to improve service quality measured by the percentage of
users that receive water supply service 24 hours per day (Continuity of Service), which reached 99.9
percent at project completion. The subprojects under Component A ­ Water Supply System Expansion,
such as expansion of the water production system, replacement of primary distribution mains, installation
of remote control systems, and implementation of the UFW reduction plan, directly contributed to the
elimination of rationing and intermittent supplies, improvement of pressure, and operation and
maintenance cost savings.

58.      In addition to increasing water and sewerage coverage, the Project also helped to improve the
sanitary conditions of low-income communities located in the Cienaga drainage basin and of the city in
general by improving the wastewater collection and conveyance system. As a result of the sewerage
improvements, ACUACAR was able to eliminate 18 discharge points located around the city and
significantly decrease evacuation of wastewater in open channels on the street. Currently the sewerage
system has two discharge points: (i) the Manzanillo outfall located close to the Cartagena Bay and (ii) the
Paraiso force main that discharges to the Cienaga de la Virgen. With the installation of the outfall, these
two discharge points will be eliminated.

59.     The associated rating of the efficacy for the first PDO is considered "high" based on the results
described above.

60.    The second part of the PDO was to facilitate the environmental cleanup of water bodies
surrounding the city (Cartagena Bay, Caribbean beaches and Ciénaga de la Virgen) by providing
adequate collection, treatment and disposal of the entire flow of the city's wastewater. The PDO was


                                                               13
intended to be measured by the Project's success in reducing the level of total coliforms along the beaches
of Cartagena, the Bay and Cienaga de la Virgen to meet Colombia recreational water use standards.4
However, since the WMS is not yet in operation, existing water quality data can not accurately measure
the full benefit of the Project. To evaluate the achievement of the PDO, this ICR assumes the proper
functioning of the wastewater infrastructure and the forecast improvements in water quality estimated in
the project feasibility study and in the outfall design models.

61.      The key following key elements of the WMS have been completed at the time of the ICR: i)
Paraiso pumping station, ii) the onshore pressure pipeline, and iii) the treatment plant were completed
satisfactorily, and the outfall is expected to be completed satisfactorily in June 2010. When the WMS is
completed, Cartagena will have the infrastructure in place to adequately manage all of its domestic
wastewater, corresponding to an average flow of 1.6 m3/sec.

62.     The Project's environmental benefits can be appreciated by comparing the water quality situation
before and after the wastewater management system, as depicted in the map section of this report. The
"Current State of Contamination by Sewage (Without Project)" map shows the water bodies contaminated
by raw sewage close to the shoreline and urban areas contaminated by sewage flowing in the streets, as
well as Cienaga de la Virgen and the Cartagena Bay. The "Effect on Contamination by Sewage (With
Project)" map shows the expected water quality situation after construction of the wastewater
management works. This information will be confirmed by the water quality monitoring study conducted
by ACUACAR, which will compare water quality data in the indicated water bodies before, during
construction, and after one year of operation of the wastewater management system. The Bank will
review and file the report in the Bank's filing system.

63.      Another part of the Project that significantly contributed to the environmental clean-up of
important water bodies in Cartagena was the implementation of the industrial wastewater discharge
control program and the Cienaga de la Virgen restoration and conservation project. The industrial
program supported the regulatory functions of CARDIQUE and resulted in (i) an inventory and data base
for industrial pollution in a GIS platform; (ii) a regulatory framework for industrial discharges and the
design of a control program; and (iii) a monitoring system for regulating discharges and auditing
industries. As a result of this program, CARDIQUE reported that 95 percent of the industries have
wastewater treatment plants to comply with the new regulations. Noteworthy are the completion of an
integrated land use and management plan for Cienaga de la Virgen that includes identification of the main
deterioration factors and specific projects to mitigate them, and environmental education activities
tailored to increase community support to preserve the Cienaga. As a result, the Cienaga was declared a
protected area and CARDIQUE, in collaboration with ACUACAR and the District, began specific
restoration projects.

64.      The associated rating of the efficacy for the second part of the PDO is considered "substantial"
as the anticipated improvements in environmental quality of water bodies are expected to occur shortly
after the ICR date.

65.     The third part of the PDO is to improve the sustainability of water and sewerage services in
Cartagena by leveraging Bank support to shore up the PSP model pioneered by ACUACAR. The PDO
was measured by the Project's success in meeting utility-based indicators which measure the operational
and financial efficiency of ACUACAR. The PAD reported 19 operational and seven financial indicators
as ACUACAR's utility-base indicators; however, for evaluating this PDO, this section of the ICR only

  Primary contact: total coliforms not exceeding 1000 MPN per 100 ml and secondary contact: total coliforms not exceeding
5,000 MPN per 100 ml.

discusses the most significant ones directly related to utility management best practices and financial
sustainability. Annex 11 shows the results of all the 26 indicators resulting in a high degree of
achievement when compared to the target values.

66.      In regards to the operational indicators, Figure 1 depicts an increase in water and sewerage
connections while maintaining the volume of water distributed in 1999 and an improved continuity of
service. In other words, with the same amount of water ACUACAR has been able to serve more people
and provide a better service, which indicates a significant improvement in water management.
ACUACAR was able to do this with support of the Bank-financed Project, especially with the water and
sewerage works, remote sensing, and UFW program. For instance, the UFW program resulted in a
reduction of water loss from 26 to 13 m3/connection/month - below the 17 target value. In addition, water
consumption decreased to about 20 percent from 2000 to 2008 due to a metering program and
conservation campaigns.

Water Distributed (1999-2009)




                                                   15
67.     In regards to the financial performance indicators, Table 4 shows that five of the seven indicators
met the expected target values indicating that ACUACAR is in a sound financial situation. Debt to asset
was expected to reach values close to 46 percent and the 2009 value was 66 percent. Although the actual
value was higher than the target, the level of total debt to operating income was lower than one in the
annual financial statements indicating a reasonable debt condition. The debt service coverage was also not
met, but a value of 3.4 is considered typical when a healthy financial situation exists.

68.     ACUACAR's numerous actions brought along efficiency gains in operation, in the commercial
system, and water usage. Water losses were reduced, consumption per connection decreased, customers
database improved, and revenues increased. In addition, ACUACAR has met all financial obligations
acquired when the District signed the IADB and the World Bank loans. Annex 3 presents a more detailed
financial evaluation of ACUACAR.

69.     In addition, Cartagena was able to maintain the private sector participation model pioneered by
ACUACAR over six political administrations, serving as an example for other cities in Colombia. The
project had an important influence over this political stability as the Cartagena District Government had a
legal obligation to preserve ACUACAR in order to access the Bank funds, as this was included in Bank
Loan Agreement.5

70.     The District financial indicators were not considered in the evaluation of this PDO, as the PAD
indicated that these indicators would only measure the District's capacity to repay the loan and to provide
counterpart funding and not to measure the development objective. However, Annex 3 provides an
evaluation of the District financial situation based on the indicators. Overall, the District complied with
the financial indicators expected at appraisal.

71.     The associated rating of the efficacy for the third part of the PDO is considered "high" based on
the results presented above.

72.     The ICR rates the composite achievement (efficacy) of the three parts of the PDO as
"substantial" given the fact that efficacy is rated as "high" for the first and third of the sub-objectives
while the second is rated as "substantial."

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

73.     An economic and financial analysis for the project was undertaken based on actual investment
and operating costs, as well as actual benefits. All costs and benefits were transformed to 1999 prices to
make it comparable with results obtained at appraisal. The 12 percent discount rate used during appraisal
was used for this evaluation. Details of the evaluation are presented in Annex 3. The analysis was
conducted for (A) water supply; (B) sewerage; and (C) the overall project. The first two components are
fully implemented and the customers are getting the associated benefits.

74.      The financial returns for the water component are estimated at 33 percent and 28 percent for the
sewerage component, which are both significantly higher than the PAD forecasts for 18 percent and 4
percent respectively. The financial analysis is based on using the increase in revenue by ACUACAR due
to service expansion, compared with the actual financial costs of the project investments.

75.     The benefits for water and sewerage components are estimated based on avoided costs by project
beneficiaries. For the water component, the benefits are related to the elimination of the water rationing
and the expansion of water service. For sewerage component, the benefits are associated with the

    Loan Agreement, December 10, 1999, Article V, Section 5.01 (d)


                                                              17
elimination of alternative on-site sanitation solutions. The rate of return for the water component is
estimated at 50 percent with net benefits of US $44 million. The rate of return for the sewerage
component is estimated at 14 percent with net benefits of US $4 million.

76.      Cartagena has experienced remarkable growth in tourism and property development over the last
decade. An efficient and reliable water utility, such as ACUACAR, is a necessary but not sufficient
condition to sustain this type of growth. Prior to the project, water rationing was common and streets were
often flooded with wastewater. The remarkable service improvements provided by ACUACAR have
helped contribute to economic growth in Cartagena. It is difficult to accurately quantify how much of the
economic growth is due to improvements in water and sewerage service, but this may be one the biggest
economic benefits of the project. In attempt to capture this benefit, the economic analysis quantified the
increase in tourism and real estate values in Cartagena over the last decade, and then conducted a
sensitivity analysis to examine returns on the project by changing the percentage of the tourism and real
estate growth that could be imputed to the project.

77.     The table below summarizes the results of the economic analysis. The overall economic return on
the project, considering the costs of the WMS but without considering benefits from economic growth, is
estimated at around 16.9% which is similar the PAD estimates. When only 1 percent of the growth in
tourism and real estate development is taken into account the rate of return jumps to 29 percent. Although
the project demonstrates an acceptable rate of return, it should be noted that the delays in project
implementation partially undermined the overall efficiency of the project.

78.     An important economic aspect of the project was the cost effective approach to providing the
WMS. The preliminary treatment with submarine outfall option was clearly the most cost-effective
solution. A more expensive option, such as secondary treatment, would have increased costs and therefore
reduced overall benefits.

79.     Based on the results of the economic evaluation, the outcome for efficiency is considered
"substantial" based on the reasonably good economic returns, but with a minor shortcoming due to
delays in project implementation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

80.      The ICR rates the overall outcome of the Project as "satisfactory" based on a "high" rating for
relevance, and "substantial" ratings for efficacy and efficiency. The minor shortcomings in the project
stem from the delays in implementing the WMS, which affected efficiency and also prevented the
confirmation of achievement of the 2nd PDO: environmental cleanup of water bodies. It is recommended
that the Bank conduct a one-year post project evaluation to confirm the achievement of the 2nd PDO.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

81.      The Project brought significant public health and economic benefits with increased water and
sewerage coverage especially in the city's poor and marginal areas corresponding to Strata 1 and 2
(highest level of poverty according to Colombia's stratification system). It also improved overall living
standards in the city, especially in poor neighborhoods in the southeast urban areas (around the Cienaga)
and the north zone rural areas, and reduced urban pollution citywide. Higher connection rates in poor
neighborhoods do not only imply greater convenience and access to safe water, but also enables the
connected households to access the subsidies as a proportion of the tariff bill, ranging from 70 percent
(tariff Strata 1) and 40 percent (tariff Strata 2). By connecting to the public network, low-income
households will not only reduce their expenditure per cubic meter consumed but they will also likely
reduce their absolute household expenditure for water. For example, low-income households in the sub-
project "El Pozon" purchase water from water-tankers at a cost of US$3 per cubic meter ($/m3) and are
currently paying about US$0.40/m3 for Strata 1 and US$0.45/m3 for Strata 2.

82.      ACUACAR's attention to social issues significantly increased during the course of the project
through the implementation of the MCDP, which supported social development in poor communities by
installing in-house connections and basic sanitary facilities; constructing and furnishing community
centers to promote community organization and development; and supporting fishing and tourism
activities in the north zone.

83.     Furthermore, the Project has enhanced the socio-economic development of the region by reducing
environmental pollution and public health risks providing great benefits to the tourism and real estate
industries in Cartagena.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

84.      Particular efforts were made under the Environmental Institutional Management Program to
strengthen the technical and operational capacities of CARDIQUE and the Establecimiento Publico
Ambiental (EPA) to ensure institutional capacity to implement the environmental management program.
Professionals from these two agencies received training workshops, study tours, and specialization
courses in topics such as wetland restoration, pollution control, water quality monitoring, and
environmental audits. In addition, the Project supported CARDIQUE with hardware and software to
establish a GIS platform to control industrial discharges and land use in the Cienaga.

85.     Indirectly, the Project also allowed ACUACAR to improve its operational and financial
efficiency by allowing the company to consolidate the sector reform and establish the credibility of the
mixed enterprise model adopted in Cartagena. For instance, a 2009 customer satisfaction survey reported
that 92 percent of the customers were either highly satisfied or satisfied with the service and only 2
percent indicated some degree of dissatisfaction. Also noteworthy is the strengthening of the PSP mixed
capital model against political interference, as the Project continued despite six changes in the District
administrations.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

86.   ACUACAR has transformed Cartagena's municipal utility into a modern, efficient, and
commercially sound operation that was able to expand coverage to Cartagena's lowest income

                                                   19
populations. In a larger sense, by strengthening ACUACAR and the reform process, the Project also
benefited the WSS sector in Colombia as a whole, as ACUACAR has served as a model for the
transformation of the water sector nationwide. First with the Bank-financed Water Sector Reform
Assistance Project that facilitated the incorporation of PSP into the management and operation of water
utilities in small and medium size municipalities in the Caribbean Coast, and later with a number of
policy actions to enable this framework and sustain reform at a national level.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

87.      Technical Sustainability. This refers to the risk that the investments will not be sustainable
because the technical choice was inappropriate or because the systems are not properly maintained. This
risk is rated "moderate" since the water and sewerage works and wastewater management system are
proven technologies and careful attention was given to the design and construction of the wastewater
management system, especially the submarine outfall. In addition, as a result of the Inspection Panel
investigation, additional studies and minor design changes were conducted to reduce risks in the outfall
operation. To ensure sustainability, during the selection of technologies, ACUACAR paid special
attention to adopt a low-cost efficient wastewater solution that took into consideration the environmental
and financial conditions of Cartagena. ACUACAR is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
the facilities, ensuring high performance and efficiency as demonstrated in Section 3 of this ICR.
ACUACAR has 11 more years under its contract and it is there long-term interest of the private operators
to honor its signed commitments.

88.      Financial Viability. This refers to the risk that ACUACAR will not be able to generate and
obtain the financial resources to operate and maintain the facilities constructed under this Project and
build new ones to continue providing high quality service. The risk is rated "low" and is mitigated by the
proven tariff regulation that subsidizes low-income households. The risk is also mitigated by Law 715
that stipulates revenue sharing to all municipalities of central government revenue. The financial
indicators in Section 3 also demonstrate that this risk is low.

89.      Government Commitment. This refers to the risk that the District will not support the
institutional PSP model and that political objection will arise. This risk is rated "moderate" due to
ACUACAR's success in providing high quality water and sewerage services to Cartagena and high
approval ratings from customer satisfaction surveys, making it difficult for future administrations to
withdraw their support to the institutional model.

Rating: The ICR rates the composite Risk to Development Outcome as "moderate".

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                   20
90.      The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the Project is
considered moderately satisfactory. The Project was consistent with the government's development
priorities and the Bank's CAS. In addition, the Bank covered in-depth engineering, institutional, tariff,
and demand-side issues when designing the Project. The Bank took into account the adequacy of project
design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, environmental, social,
institutional and fiduciary aspects. Lessons learned from earlier projects in Colombia were considered and
incorporated into the project design.

91.     In addition, the Bank's participation provided a poverty focus and ensured that ACUACAR's
efficiency gains benefited the poor. Bank-financed investments in water supply and especially in
sewerage infrastructure in the impoverished sub-basins that drain to the Ciénaga had a direct impact on
improving the quality of life of the poor.

92.      Although project design mitigated high level threats, such as political interference, a stronger
social emphasis with specific actions during preparation, such as more inclusive and extensive
consultations with the affected communities and stakeholder analysis, could have reduced project
opposition during implementation. In addition, the risks from a lengthy authorization of an
environmental license and opposition from stakeholders to the selected wastewater management solution
were not envisioned during appraisal, and when these events occurred they caused significant delays in
project implementation. Furthermore, the Project could have benefitted from a more explicit M&E results
framework design with less outcome indicators covering all three parts of the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

93.      The Bank's performance during project implementation was satisfactory. Sufficient budget and
staff resources were allocated and the project was adequately supervised. A single task manager oversaw
the entire operation from project preparation to closing. This ensured continuity of dialogue and
uninterrupted supervision. The task team also maintained continuous monitoring of the project and a
higher level policy dialogue with national authorities (Minhacienda, MAVDT, and DNP).

94.     Aides memoire were regularly prepared and the performance of the project both in terms of
achievement of development objectives and implementation were realistically rated in the ISRs. The
review of procurement of goods and works was in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Loan
Agreement and the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Likewise, the selection of consultants was reviewed
by the Bank in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank's
Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants.

95.     Noteworthy issues are also the Bank team's management of the Inspection Panel investigation
and the preparation of the action plan that was later approved by the Bank's Board and executed
successfully by the task team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

96.    Based on Bank performance during the lending phase as well as supervision, overall Bank
Performance is rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

                                                   21
Rating: Satisfactory

97.     During project preparation, the Borrower demonstrated strong commitment and ownership by
actively participating in the project design. Nevertheless, the Borrower commitment ebbed and flowed
during implementation due to successive changes in administration. Specific examples include not
financing the north zone water and sewerage project as indicated in the Loan Agreement and decreased
support on the urban rehabilitation and community development programs, two important social activities
to mitigate the objection of the outfall construction. The local government performance is considered
moderately satisfactory.

98.     Although sometimes the local government interest on the project fluctuated, the national
government, in particular the Department of National Planning and the Ministry of Finance remained
strongly committed to the Project. This was especially important to ensure that the District honored its
agreement during the last loan amendment to complete the works with counterpart funding. The national
government performance is considered satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

99.      ACUACAR demonstrated commitment to fulfilling the PDO and provided adequate internal staff
and resources to ensure success despite the numerous challenges experienced during implementation. It
complied with all Bank loan covenants, progress reports and discharged its fiduciary duties in a
satisfactory manner. In addition, ACUACAR provided technical input and support for the Bank team
during the Inspection Panel process and provided additional financial and human resources to implement
the Management Action Plan. As indicated in Section 2.2, the Project suffered significant delays due to
major factors that were outside the control the implementing agency; however, mainly due to ACUACAR
commitment, strong capacity, and determination the Project has been executed successfully.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

100.    Based on the discussion below, the overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

101.     Long Term Bank Involvement in the Water Sector Can Nurture Institutional Reforms: The
Bank strategy to continue supporting ACUACAR through the project was instrumental to consolidate the
sector reform initiated in Cartagena under a previous Bank operation, and to establish the needed
credibility of the mixed enterprise model. ACUACAR's notable improvements in the quality and access
of water and sewerage provision coupled with providing wastewater treatment and adequate disposal have
significantly increased the well being of the population. Therefore, consumer confidence was quickly
restored, the benefits of competent management were acknowledged, and local authorities became
convinced that the system was working to their own advantage without major conflict between private
and public interests. Furthermore, ACUACAR's positive experience has served as a model for the
transformation of the water sector at a national level. The Bank should take a long-term view of the
evolution of the water sector and provide not only infrastructure financing but also promote and protect
necessary institutional reforms.

102.     Wastewater Management Requires Quality Planning and Design: Providing wastewater
collection, treatment and disposal to a large urban city in a developing country is a complex and

                                                   22
challenging endeavor requiring careful design and technical expertise to provide an adequate wastewater
management system using a strategy of minimum cost that considers financial and economic limitations,
but is also protective of the environment. During project preparation, in depth engineering studies and
several technical consultations were carried out with international specialists through a panel of experts to
select and design the most appropriate system for the specific conditions in Cartagena. The careful
attention to technical considerations during project preparation was instrumental when defending the
Project during the environmental license process and the investigation panel investigation. It is therefore
important to make the necessary up-front investments in planning and design for large wastewater
projects and to include a panel of experts for complex wastewater management projects.

103.    Wastewater Management is a Complex Political and Social Process That Requires Time:
Even through the project was well-prepared technically, implementation took over a decade due to
complications in obtaining the environmental license, local opposition to the outfall solution, and the
Inspection Panel case (as well as procurement delays). In retrospect, these delays are not surprising, and
local opposition to almost any wastewater treatment and disposal option is almost inevitable--particularly
an ocean outfall in a coastal city dependent one tourism. The typical Bank standard of five year projects
may be too optimistic for large wastewater projects. The average life of Category A WSS project in the
LAC region is estimated at 8.4 years, and projects with significant wastewater treatment and disposal
components probably take longer.6 Large wastewater projects should not underestimate the risk of delays
and set realistic project durations.

104.     Social Assessment and Consultation are Keys to Successful Projects: Complex projects
should include inclusive and extensive consultations with stakeholders to explain objectives, design,
approach and benefits. A stakeholder and political analysis during project preparation should help to
identify project champions and those in opposition, understand personal interests, and anticipate probable
reactions, thus assisting in consultation and communication strategies and implementation of a social
plan. In addition, a comprehensive communication strategy, to create a better understanding of the
project and dissipate erroneous information, and promised activities that benefit the affected population
should be conducted at an early stage during project implementation.

105.    Private Sector Participation in the Water Sector Can be Pro-Poor: The mixed-enterprise
ACUACAR model has proved to have a dramatic impact on the lives of the poor in Cartagena. The
almost universal coverage in the Cartagena, means that not only the affluent sections of the city but also
the poor neighborhoods are receiving good service. The resources for expanding coverage in poor areas
were generated mainly from efficiency improvements and subsidies, with only minor increases in tariffs.

Component C - Construction of the main wastewater conveyance system: This component is 100 percent
completed and included the following works:

(i)         Upgrading of the Paraíso pumping station;
(ii)        construction of the force main from Paraíso pumping station to the treatment plant site - 19.3 km
            of pipe in polyester fiber-reinforced glass, with inner diameter of 1800 mm; and
(iii)       Construction of the effluent pipeline from the treatment plant to the submarine outfall at the
            Caribbean shoreline:

Component D - Construction of the Wastewater Treatment Installations: it is 100 percent completed, but
is not in operation. The Plant is scheduled to be in operation in September 2010 after the construction of
the submarine outfall.

        ·   When in operation, the preliminary treatment plant will remove floatable materials, grease, oil,
            sand, and grit. Treatment facilities include six rotary screens (1.5 mm clearance) followed by two
            vortex-type grit chambers. The rotary screens will remove rags, floatable material, and large
            solids. The expected volume of screenings generated by the rotary screens is about 8.5 m3/d. In
            addition, the vortex-type grit chambers will remove about 5.1 m3/d of sand and grit. The average
            flow into the treatment is 1.6 m3/s and will increase up to 4 m3/s.

Component E - Construction of Submarine Outfall: This component is 70 percent completed.
ACUACAR forecasts that the outfall will be completed and installed in July 2010, and commissioned in
September 2010.

        ·   This component consists of construction of the submarine outfall for the safe discharge of the
            pre-treated effluent to the Caribbean Sea near Punta Canoas. The main conveyance system will
            connect the treatment plant with the submarine outfall. The outfall would be constructed using a
            72" HDPE pipe. Total outfall length would be 2,850 m and the discharge point (diffuser area) will
            be submerged at a depth of 20 m. The diffuser will have a length of 540 m, with a riser spacing of
            20 m, i.e., a total of 27 risers. Each riser will be made of a 12" diameter pipe, 2 m long. The
            upper end of each riser pipe will be sealed by a welded plate, and it will have 2 openings close to
            the plate, each of 8" diameter, i.e., the total number of discharge ports will be 54. In the surf zone
            between the shoreline and the 3 m-depth contour, outfall pipes will probably be laid using a
            trestle built over the water. At greater depths, a barge-mounted crane would probably be used for
            construction.

Component F - Industrial Wastewater Discharge Control: This component addressed the issues related to
industrial wastes discharged to the municipal sewerage network. It is 100 percent completed, and it
included the following activities:

(i) Carrying out a survey to identify key sources of industrial pollution in the city of Cartagena.(ii)
Establishing a system for regulating the discharge of industrial wastes, either to the sewerage system or to
receiving bodies; (iii) Establishing a system for auditing the status of industrial wastes discharge; (iv)
Defining strategies to control small and dispersed sources of industrial pollution discharging to the
sewerage networks (gasoline stations and mechanical repair shops); and (v) Providing technical assistance
in selection and design of pretreatment processes.


                                                         26
To date, approximately 27 monitoring campaigns have been conducted and 87 points in sewage pumping
stations and inspection cameras have been sampled. Through this Project, 383 samples and 4,521
analysis, covering a total of 20 parameter (heavy metals, total hydrocarbons, BOD, COD, TKN, DO, total
phosphorus, fats, OSH, temperature, pH, conductivity) have been performed. All the information
gathered has been stored in a Geographic Information System.

Component G - Environmental and Social Component: This component implemented mitigation
measures of the environmental and social impacts of the project. It is 100% completed:
The environmental management program included:
(i)    environmental supervision during construction (on-going with the construction of the submarine
       outfall);
(ii)   (restoration and conservation of the Ciénaga de la Virgen nature reserve;
(iii)  carrying out a monitoring program before and after construction of the marine outfall to study the
       fate of coliforms and other contaminants discharged through the outfall (on-going); and
(iv)   environmental institutional strengthening program.

The social management program included:
(i)    organization and strengthening of the community;
(ii)   construction rehabilitation and equipping of community centers;
(iii)  support to in-house basic sanitation in La Boquilla; and
(iv)   strengthening of the Community Relations Unit of ACUACAR.

Component H - Project Management, Technical Assistance, Studies, design and Supervision: This
component supported and partially financed the following activities: (i) project management; (ii) design
and supervision of the water supply systems works; (iii) design and supervision of the sewerage systems
works; (iv) design of the main wastewater conveyance system, treatment installations and submarine

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

This annex presents three analyses: (i) economic and financial evaluation of the project; (ii) financial
evaluation of ACUACAR; and (iii) financial evaluation of the District of Cartagena. The main results of
this annex are summarized below:

    ·   Cost benefit Analysis. The water and sewerage components had benefits higher than expected at
        appraisal with 29 percent financial return and 31prcent economic return. The wastewater
        management component cost is not in operation yet; however when its costs are included without
        any associated benefit, the economic returns for the whole project are USD 19 million and rate of
        return of 16.9 percent . The project has additional benefits related with the economic growth that
        Cartagena has seen in the last years, caused by various infrastructure project implemented by the
        National Government and the District. If one percent of these benefits were imputed to the
        project, the profits increase to USD 63 million and the rate of return 29 percent .

    ·   Financial Analysis of ACUACAR. Overall ACUACAR financial performance surpassed targets
        and showed a healthy financial situation; and

    ·   Financial Analysis of the District. Overall the District complied with all financial indicators
        expected at appraisal.

A. Economic and Financial Analysis of the Project

1. Project components. For the purpose of this evaluation, the project is divided into three main
   components: (A) water supply system; (B) sewerage system; and (C) wastewater management
   system. The first two are fully implemented and the customers are getting the associated benefits;
   however, Component C, which includes main collectors, wastewater treatment plant, and submarine
   outfall (Components C, D, and E in the PAD) is partially implemented pending the installation of the
   submarine outfall and is not in operation yet.

2. The economic and financial analysis for each component was based on actual investment and
   operating costs, as well as actual benefits. All costs and benefits were transformed to 1999 prices to
   make it comparable with results obtained at appraisal. The 12 percent discount rate used during
   appraisal was used for this evaluation.

3. Cost benefit analysis results for the water and sewerage components show financial returns of USD
   11 million and 29 percent internal rate of return (IRR) and economic results with net benefits of US$
   48 million and 31percent IRR. The economic benefits obtained with the water and sewerage
   components compensate for the investment and operating costs of the wastewater components
   resulting in a total project net benefit of USD 19 million and a 16.9 percent IRR when no benefits
   from the economic growth of Cartagena are included in the equation.

4. The Project has contributed to the economic growth that Cartagena has achieved in last decade,
   especially in the tourism and real estate sectors, by improving water supply reliability and eliminating
   overflows on the street and discharges in the city water courses and shorelines. Although information
   was not available to quantify how much of the economic growth was caused by the Project, the
   economic analysis indicates that if only one percent of the estimated benefits derived from tourism
   and real estate sectors, is imputed to the Project the returns will increase to 29 percent and profits to
   USD 63 million.

7. The operating costs included for this evaluation corresponded to the actual ones ACUACAR is
   incurring for operation. Regarding the operating costs of the wastewater treatment plant and
   submarine outfall, the annual operating cost corresponded to the estimated value in the Environmental
   Assessment Study of USD 0.8 million (including the operation of pumping stations, wastewater
   treatment plant and some needed replacement)7.

8. For the economic evaluation, the flow of financial costs was transformed to economic costs using
   conversion factors to eliminate market distortions. The same conversion factors used for the appraisal
   were applied to this evaluation.

9. Benefits. The benefits for water and sewerage components were estimated based on the actual avoided
   costs that the population had with the implementation of the project. Additional project benefits were
   estimated as a portion of the economic growth that District of Cartagena experienced. These benefits
   were estimated as follows:

10. Financial Benefits for water component. As it was expected at appraisal, the project eliminated the
    rationing and intermittence of water supply, which by then affected about 21 percent of the
    population. The quality of services got better due to improvement of pressure, and a better water
    usage. The results show reduction of water losses; decrease of water demand due to incentive for
    better water usage; increase on coverage, reduction of required production per connection; and
    continuity of water supply 24/7.

11. The financial benefits were estimated through the increase of revenues and the reduction of operating
    costs. Increase in revenues was estimated based on the bills paid by customers. For some of the
    beneficiaries, the bills increased when rationing was eliminated and consumption was higher; for
    others, the bills decreased when water efficiency measures induced reduction on consumption; and
    those who previously did not have service started paying for their bills. Reduction of operating cost
    occurred due to reduction of water losses, reduction of water produced per connection, and efficiency
    gains on operating the system.

12. Financial benefits for the sewerage component. As in the water component the financial benefits for
    the sewerage component were estimated as the increase of revenues when service was expanded.
    Given that the beneficiaries belonged mostly to lower income levels, so were the tariffs applied for
    the evaluation.

13. Sewerage beneficiaries. Sewerage extension has been possible with the implementation of two
    projects: IADB and the World Bank project. With the IADB the coverage increased from 65 percent
    to 75 percent and with the World Bank project the coverage increased from 75 percent to 86 percent.
    The final capacity of the sewerage system is 92 percent. The evaluation considered 255,760
    beneficiaries, which correspond to about 48, 000 connections that are effectively connected to the
    sewer network and are already in the commercial database in 2008.

14. Financial Results. Results show that all the projects were financially profitable except in the northern
    zone, as the investment cost per connection was higher than the benefits obtained. The present value
    of net benefits for the water and sewerage components are USD 3.4 million and USD 7.6 million,
    respectively; for a total of USD 11 million. The internal rates of return are 33 percent in water and
    27.7 percent in sewerage, and 29 percent for both

15. Economic Benefits of the water component. At appraisal the economic benefits of the water
    component were measured through the incremental revenues obtained when consumption increased
    due to rationing reduction. For this evaluation, the benefits were estimated through the avoided costs
    obtained when intermittent water supply was reduced or eliminated. For this calculation, information
    about the way population dealt with rationing or absence of water connection was collected, as well
    as their associated cost of these solutions.

         a. The first solution found in the project area, before project was implemented, consisted of
            installing and operating a storage tank in the dwellings. The cost of the reservoir is about of
            US$ 0.42/m3 8, plus the cost of each cubic meter provided by ACUACAR, US$ 0.48/m3 for
            residential customers in average. The resulting rationing cost for this solution is US$
            0.90/m3. When the project was implemented the costs incurred by beneficiaries were only the
            tariffs to be paid to ACUACAR, and so the avoided cost consisted on the difference between
            both situations.
         b. The second solution found consisted on buying the water to water-trucks and storing it in
            several containers of 200 liters capacity each. The cost of this solution was estimated as

   The cost of installing and operating these reservoirs is estimated as follows: (i) investment US$160 with 5-year lifetime, and
(ii) operating costs equivalent to 5% of investment cost. This results in a cost of US$ 0.42/m3 for a consumption of 10 m3 per
month


                                                              31
              US$ 2.05/ m3 9. When the project was implemented the costs incurred by beneficiaries were
              only the tariffs to be paid to ACUACAR, and so the avoided cost consisted on the difference
              between both situations.

16. Economic Benefits of the Sewerage Component. At appraisal the economic benefit of this component
    was estimated as the willingness to pay for the service. For this evaluation the actual avoided costs
    when having sewerage connection were estimated.

17. Expansion of sewerage coverage. Households without sewerage service had on-site solutions, which
    varied from septic tanks, pit tank, latrines or nothing at all. For septic tanks the benefit was estimated
    at US$13.9/hh/month10. For pits, the benefit was estimated as US$11.3/hh/month11. For other
    solutions the benefit was estimated as US$ 3.8/hh/month. The benefit was partially offset with the
    cost that some of the households had to incur for adjusting the in-house connection and sanitary
    equipment to make possible the access to the service. The cost of in-house connection was estimated
    at US$250.

18. Economic Results of Water and Sewerage Components. The results show net benefits of US$ 44
    million for the water component and US$ 4 million for the sewerage component; the associated
    internal rates of return are 50 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The results of both components
    indicate a net benefit of US$ 48 million and an IRR of 31percent.

19. If the investment of the wastewater component is added without including any associated benefit, the
    returns are still positive with US$ 19 million net benefits and a 16.9 percent IRR.

  The cost of buying and cleaning the water containers is estimated as follows: (i) investment US$20 with a 2-year lifetime, and
(ii) cleaning costs of about US$ 10 per month. Plus the tariff charged by the water trucks.

  The estimation was based on the following costs: (i) an investment cost of a typical septic tank of US$355 with a lifetime of 15
years; (ii) maintenance and repair cost of US$120/year, incurred once every three years; and (iii) cleaning cost of US$ 75 per
year. The total cost per year is US$ 13.9/household per month.

20. The returns for the water component are higher than expected at appraisal, when 15 percent return
    was expected, while actual returns are 50 percent. For the sewerage component the returns are
    similar: 16 percent at appraisal, and 14 percent real values. The higher returns obtained in the water
    component compensate for the costs of wastewater management component, allowing a 17 percent
    return for the whole project, even without considering any benefit for this component. The returns
    are higher than expected at appraisal.

21. Additional Benefits obtained with the Project. Even though the wastewater management component is
    not in operation yet, and so the benefits that come along with the whole project are not fully obtained,
    the partial implementation of the project has already contributed with, the economic growth observed
    in the District of Cartagena in the last years. The benefits for the whole city are due mainly to the
    improvement of water reliability and elimination of sewage overflows previously seen along the city
    streets. Project's works along with many other actions and infrastructure projects that the District of
    Cartagena and the National Government have carried out, have contributed to the growth and
    development that Cartagena has had in the last seven years, which has boosted the construction
    activity, increased property values, and increased tourism dynamics.

22. During appraisal, the benefits of the wastewater management component were quantified as the
    willingness to pay for wastewater treatment. For this evaluation, it was not possible to measure the
    benefits of this component since it is not in operation yet. Moreover, it was not possible to isolate the
    actual impact on the economic growth of Cartagena imputed to the works implemented so far with the
    project. The following steps were taken to calculate additional benefits to be used for this evaluation:
    (i) a quick estimation of total increase on the property value in the whole District and of the economic
    impact of tourism growth in Cartagena; and (ii) a sensitivity analysis to find returns on the project by
    changing the percentage of the economic growth imputed to the project.



                                                     33
23. Benefits of the boom of construction and real estate market. The construction of new buildings and
    new houses has gone up significantly since 2000. According to ACUACAR the number of residential
    dwellings in Cartagena has increased 33 percent since 2000, at a rate four times higher than the
    population growth. Additionally, there have been important changes in the real estate market, not
    only in the historic part of the city, but also in the areas along the beach, as well as in the poor
    neighborhoods. The city's improvement increased the demand for new vacation homes, new
    buildings, and new investments.

24. According to a group of real estate agents, the property's value in Cartagena had a fourfold increase
    in the last five years. In 2003, the average price per square foot was USD 54.70 and went up to about
    USD 200 in 200812. The price differs among areas from USD 570 per square foot in the historic
    center to USD 96 in Crespo. There are some concerns, however, regarding a possible real state
    bubble and if so, the price will come down at some point. Several investors and real estate agents say
    that the prices can fell down as much as 50 percent. This evaluation was carried out on a
    conservative side and included this possible decrease in price; therefore, the estimation was made
    considering the increase from USD 54/sq ft to USD 100/sq ft, i.e., a 100 percent increase. This raise is
    similar to the increase of property tax billed by the District in Cartagena during the same years
    (117%). The resulting present value of the incremental benefit originated on properties value increase
    is about USD 2.6 billion13.

25. Increase in tourism. The tourism sector experienced important improvements as well. According to
    COTELCO, the Colombian tourism industry association, during the last four years, the number of
    tourists arriving by air increased about 30 percent , and tourists arriving on cruises increased fivefold.
    The tourism impact on the overall economy was measured through the revenue obtained by the hotel
    industry in Cartagena as well as all the indirect impacts that come from other sectors, such as
    restaurants, commerce, and others. To calculate the benefits from tourism, this evaluation relied on
    statistics from the Central Bank of Colombia (Banco de la Republica).14

26. The economic benefit generated by each tourist was calculated as follows: (i) information of the
    production of the hotel industry in Cartagena; (ii) indirect impact on other sectors, which was
    measure as the percentage of input required per dollar produced in the tourism sector15. Industries
    such as hotels, restaurants, travel agencies and alike, were included; and (iii) average expenses per
    family while on vacation, broken down by type of expenses.

   Estimated by the Central Bank of Colombia as the technical coefficient which measures the relationship between the values of
all production inputs, to the value of production. This is calculated for each type of industry. For this evaluation, the results of
the hotel industry, the restaurants, and the travel agencies and alike were used.


                                                                34
27. Using information from the Central Bank on the revenue produced by the hotel industry in
    Cartagena, about USD 65 is spent on lodge per tourist (which corresponds to about USD 260
    per family). Additionally to lodge, tourists spend on restaurants, sightseeing, and other
    activities for a total estimated of USD 850 per family. The Central Bank estimates that one dollar
    produced in the lodge industry, requires inputs for USD 0.49 from other sectors; the same from
    restaurants, which require USD 0.64 from other sectors per dollar produced; and travel agencies and
    alike require to buy USD 0.35 in inputs from other industries per dollar produced. Adding all of this,
    it was estimated that a family of four spends about USD 850 on direct expenses and generates an
    indirect impact of USD 370 on other sectors, for a total of approximately USD 1200 per family (USD
    300 per tourist).

28. The calculation above differed from those arriving on cruises, which do not spend in lodging and
    expenses in restaurants are lower.

29. The resulting present value of the impact of the increase in tourists, including the cruises, is about
    USD 308 million.

30. Total Benefits of Cartagena's growth in construction and tourism. In summary the present value of
    the incremental benefit obtained from improvements in the District of Cartagena is USD 4.4 billion,
    which consists of USD 3.9 billion increases on properties value and USD 464 million due to the
    increase in tourism.

31. When only one percent of the benefits are imputed to the results show that the project has benefits of
    USD 63 million and 29 percent economic returns.

    percent is assigned to the project the benefits would increase to US$107 million and internal rate of
    return of 39 percent.

B. Financial Evaluation of ACUACAR

34. The financial evaluation of ACUACAR was based on the audited financial statements from 1999 to
    2009 (Attachment 1 presents a summary of financial statements). The results show that financial
    situation at ACUACAR has been better than expected at appraisal.

35. Income statements show that revenues have increased at a higher pace than operating and financial
    expenses. Increase in revenue has been 23 percent in real terms, which is due not only to increase in
    tariffs but also to increase in clients. It is important to note that this increase occurred despite the 35
    percent decrease in average consumption per connection (from 26 m3/hh/month in 1999 to 17
    m3/hh/month in 2009) and that most of new customers belong to the two lowest socio-economic strata
    that have the lowest tariffs.

36. On the other hand the operating expenses increased only 4% in real terms during the whole period.
    This made possible an important increase in the profit indicators, such as, net margin, which
    increased from 6.8 percent in 1999 to 9% in 2009, and return on equity, which increased from 14
    percent to 22.6 percent. The operating margin16 remained around 20 percent in the period.

                                                                         36
37. The financial indicators from the balance sheets show a sound financial situation as well. The
    relationship between total debt and assets has remained around 62 percent, and debt has been lower
    than total revenues during the period. A summary of the financial statements is presented in
    Attachment 1.




38. All the risks foreseen at appraisal were targeted by ACUACAR with results better than expected. At
    time of appraisal there were liquidity problems due to commercial bank loans, poor commercial
    performance, and required operating efficiency. All these problems were faced by ACUACAR,
    increasing its current ratio to values higher than one, but in 2009 when it reached 0.98, due to some
    short term liabilities to be paid during 2010. The liquidity improved as a result of numerous actions,
    which brought along lower commercial debts, higher revenue collection rate, and improved operating
    efficiency. The account receivable decreased from 4.6 months of billing in 1999 to 2.2 months of
    billing in 2009; the operating cost increased 4 percent in real terms during the whole period, water
    clients increased 72 percent and sewerage clients 68 percent. It is worth to highlight the achievement
    on commercial efficiency gain given that most of the new clients are at the lowest income level and
    hence in a more difficult situation to pay.

39. Regarding the financial obligations that ACUACAR acquired when the District signed the loans with
    the IADB on March 1998, and with the World Bank on December 1999, ACUACAR has been
    complying. For the IADB loan, ACUACAR was obliged to transfer 4.8 percent of water and
    sewerage revenues to the District from 2001 to 2017, with which has complied to date. For the World
    Bank loan, ACUACAR was obliged to: (i) pay for designs, studies and supervision of the project
    (US$ 4.6 million); and (ii) pay to the District of Cartagena USD 15.4 million from 2005 to 2011 as
    contribution for the debt service. With both obligations ACUACAR has complied to date.

40. All the indicators show better results than expected at appraisal, but two: debt to assets and debt
    service coverage. Debt to asset was expected to reach values close to 45 percent and the 2009 value
    was 65 percent. Although the actual value was higher than the target, the level of total debt to
    operating income was lower than one. The debt service coverage was also not met, but a value of 3.4
    is considered typical when a healthy financial situation exists.

C. Financial Analysis of the District of Cartagena

41. The financial targets set at appraisal were broken down in two categories: (i) Revenues to be allocated
    for sewerage investments, which consisted of four sources: property taxes, 20 percent of National
    transfers, 100 percent of environmental fee, and 5 percent of royalties; and (ii) Financial indicators,
    which consisted of property tax collection rate, and three debt indicators, measuring the capacity of
    the District to comply with the debt services. The debt indicators had as reference the ceilings
    imposed to public entities by the National Government.

42. Regarding the first set of indicators, the earmarked revenues, the District complied with all of them,
    but the environmental fee. The total earmarked revenue was twice as much as it was expected at
    appraisal.

43. Regarding the second set of indicators, the District also complied with all of them except with one:
    earmarked revenues/debt service which it is lower than expected. The following is brief analysis of
    the District real values compared with the target values during appraisal.

         a. The property tax collection rate was higher than expected.
         b. Debt to current revenue was higher than 90 percent until 2005, but it decreased in 2008 and
            by 2009 it was 41percent. The maximum ceiling allowed by the National Government in this
            indicator is between 70 percent and 80 percent, which means that the District complied as
            well with the National Government requirement.
         c. Interest to Net operational surplus. Complied with the criteria until after 2004
         d. Net operational surplus to debt service met the target in 2004 and by 2009 it reached 18 times
            exceeding expectations.

Overall Customer Satisfaction Survey

Opinionmeter, a survey consulting firm, conducted ACUACAR 2009 Customer Satisfaction Survey from
September 15th 2009 to January 6th 2010 using a sample of 400 units to determine the level of customer
satisfaction and identify elements and strategies to assist ACUACAR to reach optimum quality levels. A
summary of this survey is presented in this annex to determine the level of user satisfaction as it relates to
the perceived level of satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and company image.

The overall satisfaction with ACUACAR's service based on direct consultations for 2008 and 2009 are
presented in Table 1. The 2009 results show that 91.7 percent of the customers were either highly
satisfied or satisfied with the service, and only 2.01 percent indicated some degree of dissatisfaction. As
show in Table 1, the 2009 results indicated an improvement when compared with 2008 values. Some of
the positive comments received during the survey include (i) good service provider, (ii) constant service,
and (iii) good water quality. Some of the negative comments are (i) high service cost, (ii) low pressure,
(iii) service interrupted, and (iv) no sewerage.

Opinionmeter also calculated the level of satisfaction applying a methodology developed by the Service
Quality Regulator (Superintendencia de Servicios Publicos Domiciliarios ­SSPD). In 2009, the customer
satisfaction resulted in 88.45 percent for water supply and 76.9 percent for sewerage with combined value
of 82.7 percent for water and sewerage using the SSPD methodology. Cartagena's levels are above the
latest national value calculated in 2006 of 65.6 percent for water supply and 69.2 for sewerage.

Customer Service and Company Image

Level of satisfaction for customer service indicators are shown in Figure 1 for 2008 and 2009. The level
of satisfaction ranges from 1 (highly unsatisfied) to 5 (highly satisfied). The results demonstrate a high
degree of satisfaction on customer service with all of the indicators between satisfied and highly satisfied.
In addition, an improvement is also observed in 2009 compared to 2008 values.

Opinionmeter also conducted questionnaires to determine the image perception that ACUACAR projects
to its customers. Table 2 shows the results of four image parameters (leadership, service quality,
responsibility, and environmental stewardship) indicating that ACUACAR's costumers has a very
positive image of the company.

sewerage services particularly in the poorest neighborhood; even though the submarine outfall has not
been finished yet, all the other components have been finished successfully and allowed to increase
coverage to the level of the proposed objectives; once the outfall is completed it will contribute to the
environmental cleanup of the Cienaga de la Virgen and Bahia de Cartagena, allowing in the near future a
sustainable use for aquatic, sports and commercial activities. Also, with the project and the experience of
the private operator, there was an improvement in the increase and quality of water and sewerage services
and strengthened the private sector participation to make the services more sustainable.

The implementation of the project took twice the time foreseen originally (5 years) due mainly to
complications in getting the environmental license, aggressive social opposition to the project in part
manipulated by particular interests, and also the time that the Inspection Panel took to investigate issues
that were from our perspective very clear and did not justify the time and money spent for the different
issues mentioned in the request for inspection alleging the violation of policies and procedures in the
design, appraisal and implementation of the project.

The project was carefully prepared and supervised by a panel of experts which allowed a strong tool to
defend the project against all the attacks and investigations both local and IP.

One point to remark is the continuous support from the World Bank in all the difficulties and processes
the project has been through. The World Bank staffs provided valuable inputs and advice in different
phases, which was central to the project. The Bank Supervision Missions worked closely and intensively
with ACUACAR and the District to solve main problems and to implement the project. The Supervision
Missions provided very useful technical inputs and understood the difficulties and gave support to allow
and facilitate practical solutions in different areas environmental, social, technical and financial. Without
their support and advice it would have not been possible to complete this project.

Annex 10. Summary of Inspection Panel Case

1.      On April 24, 2004, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection from a Colombian
nongovernmental organization (NGO), Corporación Cartagena Honesta, on behalf of residents of the
communities Punta Canoas, Arroyo de Piedra, and Manzanillo del Mar living in the north zone of
Cartagena, approximately 20 km north of the city. The requesters claimed that they had been harmed and
were likely to suffer further harm from the construction of 23.85 km pipeline and submarine outfall that
would carry untreated wastewater from the city and discharge it into the Caribbean Sea at a point about
2.5 km from the north zone communities. The requesters raised concerns about (i) the impact of the
outfall on their culture and way of life, as well as the impact of pollution on their health, marine
ecosystems, and economic well-being; (ii) the Bank failure to identify affected communities as
indigenous and to safeguard their livelihood; (iii) the wastewater management evaluation analysis and the
Bank's consultation of locally affected people conducted under the project environmental assessment; (iv)
the Bank's analysis of the economic investment; and (v) the Bank's supervision of the Project.

2.       On July 13, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the inspection panel's recommendation to
conduct an investigation into the claims made by the requesters. The purpose of the investigation was to
establish whether the Bank complied with its own policies and procedures in the design, appraisal, and
implementation of the Project, and whether non-compliance instances caused, or were likely to cause,
harm to the residents in the north zone communities. On June 24, 2005, the Panel submitted the
Investigation Report to the Board of Executive Directors.

3.       One of the main issues during the investigation was the selected option of a submarine outfall for
disposing Cartagena's wastewater and the outfall's location due to risk of diapirism (mud volcanism) and
potential risk to human health and marine ecosystems. Although the Panel indicated that a submarine
outfall is a proven technology for wastewater management in coastal cities, it noted that a computer 2D
modeling on which the outfall design was based may not account for special oceanographic conditions of
the project areas and recommended the use of more sophisticated 3-D models to assess the potential risks.
With respect to diapirism, the Panel found that the potential for the pipeline to be ruptured or disturbed by
a diapirism appeared to be low; however, to reduce the remaining uncertainty, it recommended
conducting a side scan sonar survey of the proposed outfall trajectory. The Panel also mentioned that the
analysis of wastewater management alternatives was not a systematic comparative study of all the
potential alternatives as required by the Bank policy on environmental assessments.

4.       With respect to the social issues, the Panel indicated that the Bank was not in violation of Bank
policy by not regarding Afro-Colombians as indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, the Panel indicated that
the requesters, Afro-Colombian people, could have been regarded as indigenous people, and because of
this, the Bank would have been well advised to require an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP)
providing mitigation measures for risks and potential harm. Furthermore, the Panel felt that the full
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) did not adequately address the issue of compensation for the affected
Afro-Colombia communities in the north zone for bearing most of the risk of negative impacts from the
wastewater component of the Project. The Panel noted that some compensation for the potential impacts
was included in the SIA; for example, water and sanitation services and a community center in the north
zone area. However, it also noted that the implementation of some of these activities seemed to be
lagging behind and information about these compensation measures were inadequately disseminated to
the village.

5.      The Panel analyzed the economic evaluation of alternatives and found that the Bank should have
recalculated the costs of the alternative and reviewed the economic analysis based on the new licensing

                                                     52
requirement of providing for primary treatment of wastewater in ten years. In addition, in the Panel's
judgment, the analysis in the Project's feasibility study should have provided a clear justification for the
land prices used in estimating the cost of the project alternatives.

6.   In regards to Bank supervision of ACUACAR, Panel concluded that the Bank closely supervised
ACUACAR's performance and that it was in compliance with Bank supervision policy.

7.       Management submitted its Report and Recommendations in respond to the Panel's Investigation
Report on July 29, 2005, which included an Action Plan. In its report, Management emphasized that the
submarine outfall is the most cost-effective solution to Cartagena's wastewater problems and that the
environmental, social, economic, technical, and financial studies showed that the outfall will achieve
public benefits and will not have significant adverse effects on the environment or the north zone
residents. In relation to the environmental assessment, Management felt that the analysis of alternatives
for the selection of the wastewater management system was appropriate, comprehensive, and sufficient to
select a preferred alternative. As to the issue of inadequate consultations raised by the requesters,
Management claimed that consultations were conducted in compliance with OD 4.01 and that a
participatory approach was used during project preparation. According to the Management Action Plan,
the Bank requested that its expert prepare a second 2-D validation model to incorporate the influence of
wind patterns, including an independent review of an international expert. Management also
recommended that ACUACAR undertake a side sonar scan survey to strengthen the assessment of risk of
diapirism. Other actions to which the Bank committed included updating the results of the economic
analysis to take into account the additional investments required by the environmental license that would
need to be operational in 2015, and adjusting land values used for the study alternatives. Management
also stated a plan to strengthen the social program in the north zone, which included, in addition to piped
water, in-house sanitation, and a community center, a fishing program, a plant nursery, and a public beach
front with tents and sports courts, all to be managed cooperatively by the community to improve the
economic development of the population. The Action Plan also provided for improvement of the
communication and outreach programs.

8.       On November 8, 2005, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors discussed the findings of
the Panel investigation and Management Report and Action Plan. The Board approved Management's
Action Plan, but with the caveat that Management and the Panel meet to discuss the modeling approach
for assessing the risks of the submarine outfall and to guarantee that the most appropriate project design is
considered. After this meeting, the project team and ACUACAR agreed to carry out a 3 D modeling
study, recommended by an Inspection Panel expert, and to proceed with the Project on the basis of the
results. The 3D modeling was expected to last one month, but instead lasted eight month, and its results
confirmed the 2D model and therefore the original project design and outfall location.

9.       A year later to the Board approval, Management submitted a progress report in the
implementation of the Action Plan. It is important to mention that none of these actions resulted in a
significant change to the original wastewater management system design. According to the progress
report, a side scan sonar survey was conducted and as a result the route of the outfall was slightly changed
to further reduce the risk of diapirism. The results of the updated economic analysis showed that even
with the additional investment, but considering the decreasing land values, the outfall remains the lowest-
cost alternative. The completion of social program provided direct benefits to the population and
improved communication and outreach activities, which helped to dissipate doubts and create a better
understanding among stakeholders improving project acceptance.

Annex 11. Operational and Financial Performance Indicators

1.      The PAD reported 19 operational and seven financial indicators as ACUACAR's utility-base
indicators. Table 1 shows the results of all the 26 indicators resulting in a high degree of achievement
when compared 2009 values with their targets. In cases where indicators did not meet target values, as
indicated in bold in Table 1, they mostly correspond to secondary parameters not directly related to
ACUACAR's performance, factors outside ACUACAR's control, or non-compliance is reasonable and
understandable considering the existing situation.

2.       ACUACAR was able to meet primary indicators, such as water coverage, volume of water loss,
metered connections, continuity of service, staff on payroll/1000 connections, among others indicating a
significant improvement in water management. Noteworthy is the increase in water and sewerage
connections while maintaining the volume of water distributed in 1999 and an improved continuity of
service. In other words, ACUACAR has been able to serve more people and provide a better service with
the same amount of water. This was largely possible due to a decrease in water consumption as a result
of a metering program and conservation campaigns. Water consumption decreased to about 20 percent
from 2000 to 2008. Consequently, indicators affected by water demand, such as volume of water
produced, volume of treated water distributed, volume of raw water sold, and volume of treated water
sold did not achieve forecasted values. Although water production related indicators were not met,
ACUACAR conducted water works under this Project to increase the water system reliability and to
reduce the system vulnerability.

3.       Unaccounted for water (UfW) is also another indicator affected by a decline in water
consumption as its calculation depends on the volume of treated water distributed. Since the volume of
treated water is less than expected, the UfW resulted in a higher value than the target of 34 percent.
However, volume of water loss, volume lost/connection/month/ and volume loss/km pipe/month achieved
targets indicating strong efforts from ACUACAR to reduce UfW.

4.      Although sewerage coverage and volume of sewage treated did not meet target values,
ACUACAR has actions in place to meet these indicators in a short term. In the case of sewerage,
although the current sewer household connection rate of 86 percent is slightly short of the target value of
90 percent, the infrastructure is in place to connect 92 percent of the households. ACUACAR has a
program in place to connect low-income households and expects to reach 92 percent. The volume of
sewage treated will meet its target value when the outfall is completed and the water management system
is in operation.

5.       In regards to the financial performance indicators, Table 1 shows that five of the seven indicators
met the expected target values indicating that ACUACAR is in a sound financial situation. Debt to asset
was expected to reach values close to 46 percent and the 2009 value was 66 percent. Although the actual
value was higher than the target, the level of total debt to operating income was lower than one. The debt
service coverage was also not met, but a value of 3.4 is considered typical when a healthy financial
situation exists.

6.      ACUACAR's numerous actions brought along efficiency gains in operation, in the commercial
system, and water usage. Water losses were reduced, consumption per connection decreased, customers
database improved, and revenues increased. In addition, ACUACAR has met all financial obligations
acquired when the District signed the IADB and the World Bank loans. Annex 3 presents a more detailed
financial evaluation of ACUACAR.
