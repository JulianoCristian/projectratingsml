This\n            report concludes the Panel's investigation into the\n            matters alleged in the Request for Inspection. The Panel\n            notes the urgent need for Cartagena to have in place a\n            sustainable system for disposing of its wastes. This is\n            especially essential when the population of the city is\n            growing rapidly. The Panel hopes that its Report will be of\n            value in assessing Bank's compliance with its policies\n            and procedures and in furthering the development of a\n            sustainable and equitable waste disposal system."}, "docdt": "2006-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
