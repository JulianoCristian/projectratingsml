Lessons learned include: the Bank strategy to\n            continue supporting ACUACAR (Aguas de Cartagena - the water\n            and sewerage company of Cartagena) through the project was\n            instrumental to consolidate the sector reform initiated in\n            Cartagena under a previous Bank operation, and to establish\n            the needed credibility of the mixed enterprise model.\n            ACUACAR's notable improvements in the quality and\n            access of water and sewerage provision coupled with\n            providing wastewater treatment and adequate disposal have\n            significantly increased the well being of the population.\n            Providing wastewater collection, treatment and disposal to a\n            large urban city in a developing country is a complex and\n            challenging endeavor requiring careful design and technical\n            expertise to provide an adequate wastewater management\n            system using a strategy of minimum cost that considers\n            financial and economic limitations, but is also protective\n            of the environment. Even through the project was well\n            prepared technically; implementation took over a decade due\n            to complications in obtaining the environmental license,\n            local opposition to the outfall solution. Complex projects\n            should include inclusive and extensive consultations with\n            stakeholders to explain objectives, design, approach and\n            benefits. A comprehensive communication strategy, to create\n            a better understanding of the project and dissipate\n            erroneous information, and promised activities that benefit\n            the affected population should be conducted at an early\n            stage during project implementation. The mixed enterprise\n            ACUACAR model has proved to have a dramatic impact on the\n            lives of the poor in Cartagena. The resources for expanding\n            coverage in poor areas were generated mainly from efficiency\n            improvements and subsidies, with only minor increases in tariffs."}, "docdt": "2010-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
