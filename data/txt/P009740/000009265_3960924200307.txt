KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
The Project covered the first phase of the Korba 2100 MW development
located on the right bank of the Hasdeo river in Bilaspur district of Madhya
Pradesh, just downstream of an existing Barrage at Darri. It consisted of
civil works, three 200 MW turbo generating units, three 670 tons per hour
boilers and an associated 400-kV transmission system. An IDA Credit of
US$200 million, representing 49X of the total financing required for the
Project was made to the Government of India on May 1978 with the National
Thermal Power Corpo-ation as the bensficiary. The Project was completed
satisfactorily in March 1984 and the Credit was closed in March 1986.
The Project Completion Report was prepared jointly by the National
Thermal Power Corporation and the South Asia Region on the basis of the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 1733b-IN, the Development Credit and Project Agreement,
both dated May 12, 1978, and other relevant documents in Bank Group's file.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OEr staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government and the Borrower. Comments received from them have been
reproduced as Attachment A to the report.

KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
Credit 793-IN of US$200 million was for the implementation of first
phase of the Korba 2,100 MW development located on right bank of Hasdeo river
in Bilaspur district of Madhya Pradesh, just downstream of an existing bar-
rage at Darri. It consisted of civil works, three 200 MW turbo generating
units, three 670 tons per hour boilers, as well as an associated 400-kV
transmission system. The Project was the Association's second lending opera-
tion with the National Thermal Power Corporation, the beneficiary and the
implementing agency. The Corporation was established less than three years
prior to the operation for the purpose of constructing and operating large
thermal power plants in the central sector and distributing the power gener-
ated to the State Electricity Boards.
As per the staff appraisal report, the Project was to be completed
by September 1983 and the credit closed by March 1985. However, because of
an initial delay in the placement of orders for major plant equipment, the
Project was not completed until March 1984 and the credit was not closed
until March 1986. The Project was completed at a cost of about Rs 4,234.2
million which is about 21Z higher than the original cost estimate of
Rs 3,489.5 million. The bulk of this increase is due to: (i)
higher-than-anticipated increases in the price of equipment and material;
(ii) customs duties for which allowance was not made in the appraisal report;
and (iii) a change in scope of the Project to cover the cost of trial and
pre-commissioning procedures (PCR, para. 3.05).
The Project was completed satisfactorily and is generating the much
needed electricity for the Western Power Region. In addition to completing
the Project satisfactorily, NTPC initiated improvements on its own accord
which are having, and should continue to have, beneficial spin offs. These
include a new control and instrumentation package, a contract management
system, a rapid coal loading system for unit trains, concepts of quality
assurances and of design, and supply and erection type packaging for
auxiliaries. NTPC needs to be commended for these initiatives and for com-
pleting the construction of the Project in almost the identical time as was
envisaged by the appraisal report despite innumerable site related
infrastructural constraints. For two consecutive years, NTPC has received
the Award for Meritorious Performance  (PCR, para. 8.01).



- v -
The Association's involvement through the Project and subsequent
Bank Group operations have provided NTPC the impetus and assistance needed to
assume a substantially larger role in the power subsector than was envisaged
at the time it was established. Bank Group support, however, will be needed
to enable NTPC to implement its expanded investment program and develop into
a financially mature utility.

KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    Power shortages of the 19709 and the adverse effect these were
having on the productive sectors of the economy prompted the Government of
India (GOI) to intensify its efforts to balance the demand and supply of
electricity. This was to be achieved within the context of GOI's overall
strategy for the energy sector which was formulated in response to the
increases in the international price of oil to reduce the country's depend-
ence on imported liquid hydrocarbons and sase the burden on its balance of
payments. Accordingly, emphasis was accorded in the power subsector to:
(i) accelerating the development of the hydropower potential and large
coal-fired power plants at both the pithead and in the proximity of load
centers; (ii) improving the efficiency of thermal power plants and reducing
losses in the transmission and distribution networks; (iii) expanding the
rural electrification program; and (iv) strengthening the organizational and
management capabilities of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) as well as
augmenting their generating capacity through the increased involvement of
the Central Government in the power subsector (para 1.04).   The Project was
formulated in the contest of this strategy and was an integral part of the
power development program of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, covering that period
of FY80-FY85 (para 2.01). However, because of the long gestation, it was
initiated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (PY74-FY79). 1/
Power Subsector 2/
1.02    According to the Constitution and the Electricity (Supply) Act,
1948, (the Act), the power subsector is within the concurrent jurisdiction
of the Central and state Governments and, until 1974, it involved the fol-
lowing four agencies: The State Electricity Boards (SEBs), the Regional
Electricity Boards (REBs), the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and the
Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). Under the Act, SEBs were assigned
1/ The Plan was suspended in PY78.
2/ Data relating to the supply and consumption of electricity between FY70
and PY75 and a description of the facilities in operation as of 1977 when
the Project was appraised are presented in Annex 1.



-2-
the responsibility for the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity within each state and for the regulation of private licenses.
Although SEBs were supposed to be autonomous in managing their day-to-day
operations, in practice they are under the purview of the state Governments
in such matters as capital investment, tariffs, borrowings, pay and person-
nel policies. REBs were formed during the period 1964-66 by grouping SEEs
into five regional systemi to promote coordination.  They are also under the
purview of the state Governnents and their coordinating responsibilities
include overhaul and maintenance programs, general schedules, interstate
power transfers and concomitant tariffs.
1.03    The other two agencies, CEA and REC, are under the purview of the
Central Government. CEA was established in 1950 in the Power Wing of the
Central Water and Power Commission, the Ministry of Irrigation and Power, to
formulate national policy and coordinate the activities of the various
agencies involved in supplying electricity. However, because of institu-
tional constraints, CEA was unable to carry out its mandate and was vir-
tually ineffective during the first 25 years. REC was established in 1969,
to coordinate the expanding rural electrification program and provide finan-
cial as well as technical expertise to SEBs fot their rural schemes.
1.04    The constraints on CEA's ability to carry out its mandate and the ad
hoc development of the power subsector together with the shortages of elec-
tricity ensuing therefrom induced GOI to amend the Act to enlarge the scope
and functions of CEA and address the financial operations of the SEBs.
Legislation was enacted in 1975 to give CEA an effective veto over new
investments by SEBs. The amendment also covered the establishment of gener-
ating companies by the Central and state Governments for the installation of
large power stations to allow for economies of scale in meeting the forecast
demand for electricity. An ordinance incorporating the amendments to the
general provisions of the Act was issued and two generating companies were
established in the central sector, the National Thermal Power Corporation
(NTPC) - the beneficiary of the Credit - and the National Hvdro Power Cor-
poration (NHPC).
1.05    NTPC was established under the Companies Act 1956, and the Elec-
tricity (Supply) Act 1948, as amended, to give the corporation statutory
recognition. Its initial authorized share capital amounted to Rs 1,250
million (US$140 million). NTPC was to be managed by a Board of Directors of
not less than four and not more than fifteen, some of whom would be part-
time. The Corporation was established to design, construct, e^ld operate
large thermal power stations in the central sector and distribute and sell
the power generated. NTPC also was to own and operate the associated 400-kV
transmission system over which power would be distributed and sold in bulk
to SEBs. NTPC's provisional development plan provided for the construction
of two thermal power stations each with an ultimate capacity of about 2,000
MW (para 2.01). It was envisaged that NTPC would also take over the opera-
tion of the Government owned 300 MW Badarpur power station near Delhi.



1.06    In 1977, when the Project was appraised, NTPC was in the process of
building its establishment by filling key positions. A competent
administrator with wide experience in the formation and development of large
industrial undertakings and in the construction of factories and the
manufacture of generating facilities had been appointed as the Chairman and
Managing Director. The Board of Directors had also been constituted and
staff at General Manager and senior professional levels and essential
administrative staff were being recruited. At appraisal, 220 appointments
had been made which included a first intake of 36 trainee engineers (para
6.03).
Bank Group Involvement
'.07    Prior to the Project, the Bank had made seven loans to India for
power projects amounting to US$179.5 million and IDA nine credits totalling
US$596 million. Of the total funds made available to the country, US$315
million was for the construction of generating plants, US$23 million for
purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydroelectric project,
US$380 million for high voltage transmission and US$57 million for rural
electrification. All the loans and credits for the generation projects
(excluding the Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit 685-IN)), the Beas
project (Credit 89-IN) and the first two transmission projects (Loan 416-IN
and Credit 242-IN) had been disbursed. The Singrauli project, which was the
AssJciation's first lending operation with NTPC, was in the early stages of
implementation and no funds had been disbursed. As of February 28, 1978,
about US$10.3 million of the credit for the Rural Electrification Project
(Cr. 572-IN) had been disbursed. Of the credits for the two ongoing trans-
mission projects, one (Cr. 377-IN) was committed fully and commitments in
respect of contracts awarded or under issues for the other (Cr. 604-IN)
amounted to US$44 million.
1.08    The ongoing power transmission projects and the rural electrifica-
tion projects were proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding initial delays
in implementation and in the preparation of specifications for the more
sophisticated load dispatch equipment. The Singrauli Thermal Power Project,
though in the early stages of implementation, was also proceeding satisfac-
torily. The Project was the Association's second lending operation with
NTPC.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin, Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiations and Approval
2.01    The Sixth Five Year Plan's development program for the power subsec-
tor was predicated on an average annual increase in the demand for elec-
tricity of about 10X between FY80 and FY85. The target for the commission-
ing of new capacity associated with the load forecast was set at 19,666 MW,
consisting of 13,846 KW of thermal, 5,130 MW of hydro and 690 NW of nuclear
capacity.l/ Most of the thermal capacity was to be coal-fired, with emphasis
on large power stations whose ultimate capacity could reach about 2*000 NW.
Feasibility studies for five such developments were completed in 1974. The
responsibility for constructing and operating two of these power stations,
one at Singrauli in Uttar Pradesh and the other at Korba in Madhya Pradesh,
was assigned to NTPC (para 1.05). GOI's formal request for Bank Group
assistance in financing the development at Korba, described in Annex 3, was
received in January, 1976. The development which was to be implemented in
two stages consisted of 3x200 NW and 3x500 MW generating units and
associated 400-kV transmission lines for the evacuation of power. The
Project consisted of the first phase (3x200 MW) of this development.
2.02    The Project was prepared by NTPC and appraised by the Association
in July/August, 1977 and negotiations were held in Washington in February,
1978. As NTPC had made significant progress in strengthening its in-house
technical capabilities, it was agreed during negotiations that the corpora-
tion would prepare the basic engineering and preliminary design for the
Project with the Thermal Design Organization functioning as principal review
consultant. It was also agreed that NTPC would: (i) prepare the detailed
design and specifications for the generating units, boiler and transform( 
packages; and (ii) appoint retainer consultants to assist in the more
sophisticated areas of design and review the specifications prepared by the
corporation.
Project Objectives
2.03    The primary objective of the Project was to provide NTPC the impetus
and assistance needed to assume its envisaged role, including the allevia-
tion of power shortages in the Western Region. In addition, it was to
assist GOI in achieving its objective of further advancing the regional and,
ultimately, the national integration of the power subsector.
I/ The original program for the expansion of generating capacity during the
Sixth Fifth Year Plan which differs slightly from the actual program is
presented in Annex 2.



Project Description
2.04    The projesct involved the first phase of the Korba development and
consisted of:
(a) civil works, including acquisition of land, construction of roads,
culverts, railways and other miscellaneous preliminary works, power
station and residential buildings, plant foundations dams, canals,
ducts and other works associated with the circulating water system;
(b) three 200 NU turbo generating units and three 670 tons/hr boilers
complete with all auziliaries and ancillary electrical and mechani-
cal equipment, including coal transportation and handling equipment
and the switchyard;
(c) the 400-kV transmission system comprising two 190 km single circuit
lines from Korba to Bhilai and a 300 km single circuit line from
Bhilai to Koradil/; and
(d) a training simulator.
2.05    The Korba 2100 MW development was-to be constructed on the right
bank of the Hasdeo river in Bilaspur district of Madhya Pradesh, just down-
stream of an existing barrage at Darri. The site was selected for its
proximity to the coal deposits in the Kusmunda blocks and the adjoining
irrigation canal which could be used for direct cooling during part of the
year. The Project was selected as a logical slice of the overall develop-
ment which, on economic and engineering considerations, could operate as an
independent and viable project in the event construction of the remaining
units, aggregating 1500 Mv, was delayed or deferred. The criteria used in
selecting the Korba development and in firming up the composition of the
units are presented in Annex 4.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Effectiveness
3.01    The credit was made effective on August 14, 1978 following the
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and NTPC.
Project Execution
3.02    The Project was executed satisfactorily, but because of an initial
delay of about six months in the placement of orders for the major plant
1/ Amended to reflect the Borrower's comments.

components all three generating units were commissioned later than
originally planned. The first unit was commissioned in March 1983 instead
of September 1982, the second unit in October 1983 instead of March 1983 and
the third in March 1984 instead of September 1983.1/ Much of the delay in
the placement of orders and, in turn, in the commissioniing of the generating
units, was due to protracted discussions with a manufacturer concerning the
price of turbo generators, boilers and associated equipment.   Notwithstand-
ing this delay, NTPC was able to complete the construction of the Project in
almost the identical time as was provided in the appraisal report. This was
achieved by resolving problems that are wont to arise in a project of this
size expeditiously. The Project also benefitted from the concepts of
quality assurance and of design, supply and erection type of packaging for
auxiliary systems which were introduced in the country by NTPC (para 8.06).
3.03    The Project, as implemented, complies fully with the enviroilental
quality standards prescribed by the Indian National Committee on Environmen-
tal Planning and no ecological problems are envisaged.
Reporting
3.04    NTPC met all the Bank's reporting requirements) submitting on a
regular basis, quarterly progress and annual reports.
Project Cost
3.05    The Project was completed at a cost of Rs 4,234.2 million, which
is about 21Z higher than the appraisal cost estimate of Rs 3,489.5 million.
A detailed comparison of the estimated and actual project costs is presented
in Annex 5. The actual cost was about 501 higher than the appraisal
estimate for electrical and mechanical equipment including coal handling,
201 higher for preliminary and civil works , 1291 higher for preliminary
works and land, and 70% higher for training simulator. Most of this
increase is attributable to: (i) higher than anticipated increases in the
price of equipment and materials; (ii) customs duties for which allowance
was not made in the original cost estimates; and (iii) change in the scope
l/ The Borrower would like to the Bank to note: That the discussions with
the manufacturer took place before award over a period of about 1 to
1 1/2 months and the time taken between award and bid opening was 3
months and between bid opening and award placement was about 6 months
which are well within the normal time required for this process.
Similarly, if a period of 4 years is allowed between placement of award
and the commissioning of the first unit, as was done in the SAR, then the
scheduled commissioning date should have been end February 1983 instead
of September 1983. This would imply that there was virtually no delay as
the firsi unit was commissioned in March 1983.

of the Project to cover expenses amounting to US$49 million for trial and
pre-commi ssioning.
Procurement
3.06    Bank guidelines were strictly adhered to by NTPC for all procurement
involving international competitive bidding.
Disbursements
3.07    The appraisal estimate of disbursements and actual disbursements
are presented in Annex 6. Actual disbursements were slower than the
appraisal estimate mainly because of the initial del! in the placement of
orders for major plant components (para 3.02). As of March 31, 1985, the
original date for closing the credit, about 91.4X ot the funds had been
disbursed. As the remaining 8.6% represented payments withheld on contracts
pending the successful completion of performance and guarantee tests on the
main plant equipment, the closing date was extended to March 1986. bespite
this extension, the Bank Group was obliged to cancel US$584,433.09 because
applications for payment were not received within six months of the closing
date.l/
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.08    In addition to a principal review consultant and a retainer consult-
ant, NTPC had appointed consultants for:
(a) design and engineering of main plant and mechanical auxiliaries;
(b) township and simulator buildirs;
(c) design/engineering of the 400-kV transmission liness and
(d) development of coal transportation system and railway siding.
1/  This includes US$503,450 for which a refund has been requested by the
Bank Group from a supplier.
The Borrower would like the Bank to note that it had logged a claim of
US$503,460, before the closing date under the direct disbursement's
procedures. This claim was payable on presentation of documents by
the supplier. The Bank had not agreed to finance this as the deliveries
would due only in October 1987. NTPC is presently making the payment
under Letter of Credit and the claim under the reimbursement procedure
can be logged after the delivery provided the Bank is agreeable to
disbursing this amount.



-8-
The performance of the consultants was satisfactory and their association
with the Project further enhanced NTPC's capability in detailed engineering
and strengthened its in-house Technical Service Division. This division has
already completed several detailed engineering tasks for subsequent NTPC
projects.
3.09    The performance of contractors, all of whom were prequalified, and
suppliers was also satisfactory. As is to be expected in a Project of this
size, problems did arise during erection and commissioning. These, however,
were addressed expeditiously by the contractors/manufacturers concerned.
IV.   OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01    As per NTPC's guidelines, a generating unit is declared commercially
operational only after it has been inspected thoroughly together with the
associated equipment and within four months from the date of synchroniza-
tion, has operated for a minimum period of 1,000 hours continuously, carry-
ing a full load for not less than 72 of these hours, and generating at an
energy equivalent rate of 2,500 kWh/kW/year during that period. In case a
unit is unable to achieve the above operating standards within the specified
time because of teething problems, the General Manager of the project is
required to obtain Management approval for extending the date of commercial
operation by submitting a detailed description of the nature of the problem
and the reasons for its occurrence.
4.02    Of the three units comprising the Project, two were able to achieve
the operating standards within four months from their respective dates of
synchronization: Unit II in 93 days and Unit III in 75 days. By contrast,
it took 153 days to bring Unit I into commercial operation. This was due to
problems with the primary air ducting and the Reheat line. During the first
year of commercial operation Units I and II achieved a plant load factor of
65.4% and 70.0% respectively, which compares favorably with the load factor
of 63% envisaged in the appraisal report. Unit III, however, was only able
to achieve a load factor of 37.35% during this same period primarily due to
teething problems. These, however, have been resolved and Unit III was able
to achieve 98.41% in 1985-86. Highlights of the operating performance of
Unit I, II and III are presented in Annex 8.
4.03    Although the performance of all three units compares favorably with
the expectations of the appraisal report, some of the main plant equipment
and auxiliaries require further improvement to achieve full stability for
base load operations. Specifically, NTPC intends to:
(a) remove the manual dampers that are in front of the induced draft fan
to reduce system resistance;



-9-
(b) replace discharge dampers by Guillotine dampers;
(c) replace the T-duct at the suction duct connecting induced draft far
with a Y-duct to streamline the flow;
(d)  provide a ring and highly twisted vane at the induced draft inlet;
and
(e) provide a vibration isolation damper at crusher foundation.
4.04    Fuel for the Project was to be supplied from the Kusmunda II (Gevra)
Block of the Western Coalfield, Ltd. As NTPC had no control over its
development, assurances had been obtained from the Coal Company that it
would take all necessary steps to make available adequate coal supplies for
the efficient operation of the 3x200 MW units. The company has complied
with it-, commitment, despite an initial delay in the implementation of the
coal handling facilities at the mine. The effect of this delay on gener-
ation was minimal as a temporary fast loading station was comrissioned to
meet initial requirement. The quality of coal supplied to the power plants
has been better than envisaged, but the price paid for it by NTPC was sub-
stantially higher than originally estimated. The corporation was allowed to
pass on these higher fuel costs to beneficiary SEBs through higher tariffs
(para 5.02).
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01    As per the Credit Agreement, NTPC was to sell power from the Project
to SEBs in the Western Region 1/ under bulk supply contracts satisfactory to
the Association, and GOI was to ensure that all necessary steps were taken
to obtain an undertaking from respective state Governments to purchase, in
the aggregate, not less than 851 2/ of output of power from the Project.
GOI and NTPC have complied with their commitments, despite an initial delay
in the ratification of the bulk supply contracts precipitated, in part, by
the absence of a blueprint for establishing multi-party contracts for the
exchange of power. NTPC's operating and financial performance, however, was
not adversely affected by this delay.
1/ Power from the Project was to be sold in bulk to the State Electricity
Board of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Electricity Department
of Goa.
2/ The remaining 15% was to be sold in accordance with priorities to be
determined by GOI.

5.02    NTPC's income statements, balance sheets and sources and applica-
tions of funds statements, covering the period FY82-FY86, are presented in
Annexes 9, 10, and 11, respectively. The appraisal report's financial
forecast for PY82 are provided primarily for presentational completeness
as none of the generating units at Singrauli or Korba were in commercial
operation in that year, because of initial delays in the placement of orders
for major plant components (para 3.02). For the remaining four years
(FY83-FY86), the financial statements compare the appraisal report's
forecasts with actual results.
5.03    NTPC's financial performance between PY83 and FY86 was satisfactory
despite the fact that fuel costs were higher (para 4.04) and electricity
sales were lower in each of these years than was forecast. The difference
between the forecast and actual electricity sales is attributable to the
delays in the placement of orders for major plant components and, in turn,
in bringing the units into commercial operation.l/ NTPC's key operating
results are shown below:
1/ The Borrower would like the Bank to note that the difference between the
forecast and actual electricity sales is attributable to both the time
difference between commissioning of the first unit as per the SAR and
the actual commissioning date and to the time required to bring the units
into operation which was not considered at the time of project appraisal.

Sales of energy were about 21X lower than the appraisal estimate in FY83,
about 27Z in PY84, about 29% in FY85 and about 31% in FY86.  These short-
falls, however, were more than offset by the introduction of higher than
anticipated tariffs.  As a result, the corporation, instead of incurring a
loss in FY83 and FY84 as was forecast in the appraisal report, made a profit
of about Rs 46 million and Rs 449 million, respectively. Similarly, in each
of the two subsequent years NTPC's profits were substantially higher than
envisaged; Rs 875 million compared to Rs 10 million in FY85 and Rs 1,830
million compared to Rs 294 million in FY86.
5.04    The appraisal report's financial forecast anticipated that NTPC
would eventually achieve and maintain from FY88 (the first year in which the
2100 MW Korba Power Station was expected to be in full commercial operation)
a rate of return of not less than 9-1/2% on the original cost of its average
net fixed assets in service. The tariffs associated with this forecast and
actual tariffs are presented below:

FY86               22.9           39.8             73.8
As shown, actual tariffs were considerably higher than forecast, about 45%
higher in FY83, 62% in FY84, 72X in FY85 and 741 in FY86. It was partly
because of the introduction of higher than forecast tariffs and partly due
to higher than expected plant load factor achieved at NTPC stations that
NTPC surpassed the rate of return targets set in the appraisal report. The
actual and forecast rates of return were: 6.6% compared to 1.6% in FY83;
11.3% compared to 3.6% in FY84; 12.5X1/ compared to 5.3X in FY85 and 16.81
compared to 5.7% in FY86. The 38% increase in the rate of return in FY86
resulted from an improvement in NTPC's overall plant load factor from 581 in
FY85 to about 741 in FY86 at the 200 MW units of the Ramagundam, Korba, and
Singrauli power stations. This was due to the stabilization of the Ramagun-
dam units, increased availability of the Singrauli units and a sustained
high level of performance of the Korba units. This performance exceeded the
covenanted requirement of 71 stipulated for NTPC during FY85-90.2/
5.05    NTPC's cash generation as a percentage of investment was 5X, 31, 121
and 11% in FY83, FY84, FY85 and FY86, respectively. The low contribution to
investment, which was anticipated at the time of appraisal, is temporary and
is gradually increasing. It is acceptable in view of the fact that NTPC's
sales volume in its early years of operation is small compared to the large
capital investment program under implementation.  Much of NTPC's fixed
assets are not yet in operation. Work in progress amounting to Rs 31,069
million at the end of FY86 was almost double the amount of fixed assets in
operation of Rs 16,047 millioui. NTPC's debt equity ratio of 36/64 and debt
service of 5.0 in FY86 were satisfactory and compare favorably with the
appraisal estimates of 46/54 and 1.3, respectively. The current ratio of
1.61/ reflects NTPC's relatively high accounts receivable.
1/ Amended to reflect the Borrower's comments.
2/ It was agreed under the Project that VTPC would earn a rate of return of
9-1/21 on net fixed assets in operation from FY89 onwards. This was
superseded by covenants under subsequent projects requiring 7X from
FY85-90 and 9-1/21 from FY91-95 and at satisfactory levels thereafter.



-13-
5.06    NTPC's collection of accounts receivable during its first two years
of operations was poor, but improvements have been made in recent years.
The accounts receivables, expressed in terms of average monthly sales, were
equivalent to seven months sales at tne end of FY84, and declined to six
months at the end of FY85, and five months at the end of FY86. NTPC has
undertaken various measures to further reduce receivables and, with GOI
support, now requires 8MB customers to establish letters of credit equiv-
alent to at least one month sales receipts. NTPC recognizes that close
monitoring of the level of accounts receivable is necessary and the matter
has also been addressed under subsequent Bank Group projects.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01    As noted (para 1.09), the Credit was the Association's second lend-
ing operation with NTPC which itself had been established less than three
years prior to that operation. The institutional objectives of the Credit,
therefore, were to provide the impetus and assistance needed to ensure that
the developments at Singrauli and Korba (para 2.01), assigned to NTPC, were
implemented successfully. This objective was achieved fully and, in fact,
NTPC has been able to assume a much larger role in the power subsector than
was envisaged originally. This is made evident by the expansion of its
existing facilities, organization and management and staffing. As of end
June, 1986, NTPC was operating 12 new 200 KW units (5 at Singrauli, 3 at
Korba, 3 at Ramagundam, and 1 at Farakka) and 3,279 km of 400 kV transmis-
sion lines. NTPC also operates the 720 NW Badarpur station near Delhi, and
is responsible for the construction of a 270 MW captive power station being
established at Korba for the Bharat Aluminum Company, on a management fee
basis.
6.02    In response to the rapid increase in its operational and construc-
tion activities, NTPC also adopted a regional organizational structure in
August 1982 on the basis of a study conducted with assistance from power
utilities/consultants in the UK and the USA. Bach Region is under the
charge of an executive director who is responsible for the construction and
operation of generation and transmission facilities. The Corporate head-
quarters is progressively concentrating on policy-making and on providing
functional guidance to the Regions and opetating divisions. Although NTPC
has centralized engineering and contract administration in order to utilize
the trained manpower more effectively, the concept of carrying out these
two functions on a project basis will continue. As of June 30, 1986, NTPC
had about 15,512 employees.
6.03    Training of Engineers and Operators for operation and maintenance
was to be an integral part of NTPC's human resource development program.
Accordingly, the c(orporation developed training programs and established an
in-house management trainee institute. So far, eleven batches of engineers



-14-
have been trained. For operator training, NTPC has set up one 200 MW full
scope training simulator under the Prcject. In addition, two training
groups, namely Central Training Institute (CTI) and Power Management
Institute (PMI), have been established to provide technical and management
education, respectively. A decision to convert these training groups into
full-fledged independent institutes is pending.
6.04    As NTPC stations are located at pitheads in remote areas, which are
difficult to access from corporate headquarters in New Delhi, NTPC has
decided to establish an integrated modern communication system using large
computers and satellites. This system is expected to be completed by
mid-1987.
6.05    To conduct in-house research in the areas of operation and main-
tenance, NTPC has established a research and development cell. In additiont
NTPC has requested GOI's approval for establishing a research and develop-
ment R&D center to conduct research in the areas of water chemistry, boiler
tube failure, insulation breakdown, erosion, corrosion, pollution, etc.
Government approval for the R&D Center is being processed.
6.06    There is understandably a growing concern about maintaining ecologi-
cal balance, in view of the rapid expansion in industrial activity in the
country. NTPC intends to establish an Environmental Impact Cell to conduct
comprehensive studies which would cover all ecological aspects associated
with the setting up of power projects. This cell would also monitor, on a
continuous basis, the pollutants from the power stations to ensure that
these are within the acceptable norms. NTPC, with the assistance of the
Bank Group, has initiated work on comprehensive environmental studies in the
areas around Rihand Lake and Singrauli Coalfields.
6.07    System improvement measures contemplated by NTPC include introduc-
tion of Computer Aided Design in engineering design, time of the day meter-
ing for sale of power to SEBs, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
system for better operational data recording and communication.
VII. ECONOMIC REVALUATION
7.01    In the appraisal report, the return on investment was calculated for
the entire 2100 KW development at Korba to demonstrate relationship between
tariffs and the economic cost of the development. It was defined as the
discount rate at which the present worth of the economic cost associated
with the development equals the present worth of the economic benefits over
the life cycle of the development. The measurable costs included:
(a) capital and labor costs involved in the development of generation
and transmission facilities;



-15-
(b) the annual operation and maintenance costs; and
(c) fuel costs
The benefits were measured in terms of the revenues to be derived from the
sale of electricity.
7.02    Based on measurable economic costs and benefits associated with the
2100 KW Korba development, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return
(IERR) was estimated at about 13x. Because actual tariffs were higher than
envisaged (para 5.02), this same approach results in an ex-post IERR of 14%
(Annex 12) which compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital of
about 12%, implying that NTPC's bulk supply tariffs for the Western Region
continue to adequately reflect tha economic cost of supply.
VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE ASSOCIATION
8.01    The performance of NTPC, the beneficiary of the Credit, was commen-
dable and met the expectations of the appraisal report fully. For two
consecutive years, NTPC has been given the Award for Meritorious Perfor-
mance. It implemented the Project satisfactorily and in almost the identi-
cal time as was originally envisaged. In addition, NTPC initiated improve-
ments on its own accord which are having and should continue to have benefi-
cial spin offs. The most notable of these, including some that were intro-
dtuced into the country for the first time, are described below.
8.02    NTPC implemented a control and instrumentation package, the first of
its kind in the country, to improve the performance of power plants in terms
of safety, availability and reliability. The package consisted of systems
for automatic turbine run up, coordinated master control, centralized steam
and water analysis, micro-processor based analog control and computerized
on-line data acquisition system (DAS). The analog control system with its
self-surveillance and diagnostic features was implemented to optimize plant
performance. Likewise, DAS will assist plant operators in preparing perfor-
mance calculations, pre and post trip logs and operator guidance messages.
8.03    Another first for the country was the preparation by NTPC of
detailed specifications for procurement of power plant equipment through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB). A Contract Management System has
been developed and implemented by NTPC for this purpose.
8.04    Yet another first was the introduction by NTPC of a rapid loading
system at coal mines for dedicated unit trains with bottom discharge wagons
and underground coal receiving hoppers. This system for expediting coal



-16-
transport has been adupted by NTPC for all of its pithead power projects.
Other utilities are currently contemplating the adoption of this system.
8.05    The other improvements introduced in the country for the first time
include the adoption of thie concepts of quality assurances and of design,
supply and erection type of packaging for auxiliary. Urder this packaging
concept, contractors and vendors were responsible for d&tailed engineering
of the system, manufact,ire/fabrication, testing and supply of equipment as
well as erection and commissioning of the system as a whole. This approach
has enabled NTPC to reduce the staff-time spent on coordinating activities
without sacrificing its high standards of quality control and system perfoi?-
mance which are ensured through contractual obligations and suppliers.
8.06    NTPC, for the first time in India, has installed a full scope Relica
Digital Computer based 200 MW Power Plant Training Simulator, at Korba, for
Operator Training. This Training Simulator, simulates the entire boiler
turbine generator and their auxiliary in digital computers to exactly cor-
respond with the real plant. Similar 500 MW training simulator is also
being installed.
8.07    In addition, NTPC has made substantial progress in developing and
implementing systems for financial management, project management, personnel
management, selection, recruitment and training; storss accounting and spare
parts management; maintenance managr ,ent and engineering.
8.08    The Association formally supervised the Project five times and
maintained good relations with the beneficiary allowing it the latitude
needed to innovate. This fostered an environment conducive to increased
Bank Group involvement with NTPC. To date, the Bank Group has assisted NTPC
in implementing 10 other projects and in revising the financial covenant
agreed to under the Project, as well as in inittating studies aimed at the
formulation of a long-term power transmission plan, and restructuring bulk
supply tariffs and conducting and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
study in Singrauli region.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01    The Project was entirely successful in that the 3x200 MW units were
completed satisfactorily and are generating the much reeded electricity for
the Western Region. In addition, the Project and subsequent Bank Croup
lending have provided the impetus and assistance needed by NTPC to assume a
larger role than envisaged. In fact, NTPC could become GOI's vehicle for
promoting the regional and, ultimately, the national integration of the
power subsector. NTPC needs to be commended not only for its active par-
ticipation in all stages of Project preparation, implementation and quality



-1 7-
control, but also for its initiatives in other areas such as the introduc-

Intrastate and interstate transmission was at 132 kV and 220 kV and,
generally, major load centres were interconnectea by 132 kV and 33kV
sub-transmission lines. Distribution voltage were 11 kV and 415/240 V. The
supply was generally reliable but losses both technical and non-technical were
relatively high, estimated at about 20% of the energy sent out.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Description of the Korba Development
1.      The Korba development is the second of a series of large thermal
power stations, planned by the Government of India, to feed into a 400 kV
interconnected transmission system and supply bulk power to the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs).
2.      Korba 2,100 MS power station is installed on the Western Bank of
lasdeo River adjacent to the extensive Kasunda block of mines of Western
Coalfields Ltd. in the Bilaspur district of Madhya Pradesh.
3.      The plant consists of 3x200 MW and 3x500 MW generating units with
boiler plant, ancillary electricial and mechanical eq4ipment and associated
400 kV transmission. The first stage of the development, comprising the
Project, consisted of 3x200 MW installations.
4.      The 200 KW turbines are three cylinder, tandem compound 3,000 rpm,
double flow exhaust type reheat units operation at 150 ka/cm[u]2[d] witojeh a
temperature of 535 C. The generators are of the hydrogen-cooled type, rated
at 235,000 KvA. The boilers are to be natural circulation, pulverized fuel
fired, balanced draft type using the direct firing system. Each boiler has
a continuous evaporation rating of 670 tonnes/hr with a superheater outlet
pressure of 156 ka/cm[u]2[d] and temperature of 540 C. Each 200 MW
generating unit is connected to its own 250 MVA transformer and to feed
power into the 400 kV system.
5.      The 500 MW turbines are locally manufactured.  These are three
cylinder tandem compound type with operatng parameters much the same as for
the 200 MW units. Boilers are of a similar type as the smaller unis except
that each boiler has a continuous evaporatio rating of 1,725 tonnes/hr with
a superheater outlet pressure of 179 ka/cm(uJ2[d] and temperature of 540 C.

KORBA THERMAL POWER PROZECT
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
1.        The obvious alternatives to the Korba 2,100 MW development are
hydro or nuclear. In the case of hydro the most readily available and
economic hydro sites that could supply the Western Region are to be
developed in parallel anyway -- they are supplements and not alternatives
and would, in any case, be too small, in aggregate, to be considered as a
comparable alternative. In the case of the nuclear alternative, the long
gestation period of nuclear power development (8-10 years for a first unit),
the technical problems in developing a 2,100 MW nuclear power station and
the attendent political problems eliminate this as a practicable
alternative.
2.        Confining attention to thermal options, the alternative considered
was the establishment of three 700 MW stations. These were costed out at
load centers, based upon cost estimates for proposed SEB projects in the
Western Region. Operating costs were dominated by the high transport costs
of coal, which were assumed on average to equal the costs of rail shipment
from either the Singrauli or Korba coal fields to Bombay.l/ This would be
reasonably representative if the three stations were at, say, Poona, Ahmen-
dabad, and Bombay.  Capital costs were somewhat lower than Korba, because of
Korba's transmission component. The cost streams, at market prices (net of
identifiable taxes) are summarizd in Table 1A (Korba) and Table 1B
(Alternative).
3.        At market prices, the equalizing discount rate is 29.5%.  At a 101
discount rate, the net present worth of the costs of Korba is Rs 2,681
million less than the net present worth of the alternative. The sensitivity
analysis of market and shadow prices, summarized in Tables 2 and 3 show that
Korba is more economic than the alternative in all the cases considered.
The Return on the Investment
4.        The return on investment relates the expected revenues of NTPC to
the costs of Korba development. In a year of full operation, it is further
assumed that the full 2,100 MW generating capacity will operate on average
5,500 hours each your. The wholesale tariff that will be charged on this
basis of financial performance criteria is expected to be 22.1 paise per
kWh. Annual revenues assuming 9% station consumption and 2% transmission
losses will thus be about Rs 2,275 million.
1/ We may note that a third possibility would be to use Chandrapura coal,
which would cost Rs 65 per ton to ship by rail to Bombay, as opposed to
Rs 83.5 per ton from the Singrauli or Korba fields. This possibility is
fairly represented in the sensitivity analysis in Tables 5 and 6.



-24-
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 6
5.        The cost streams for the project at market prices are shown in
Part A of Table 1. All the costs are net of identifiable taxes. The for-
eign exchange costs have been estimated from those identified for the 600 NW
Project, assuming the phasing of costs will remain the same for the sub-
sequently installed units, and that foreign exchange costs will be about
two and a half times greater for the last two 500 MW units (33X as opposed
to 13% of the Project cost). Labor costs have been estimated at 15Z of
equipment costs (based on manufacturer's statistics) and 35% of civil works.
Total capital costs in 1977/78 (year 1) prices are expected to be Rs 7,669
million, net of price and physical contingencies. Operation and maintenance
costs from year 78 onward have been estimated at 2.5% of total capital
costs. Fuel costs are based on coal at Rs 41 per ton (net of taxes).
6.        On these assumptions, the internal rate of return is 13.0%, and
discounting future costs and revenues at 10% per annum, the net present
value of the Project is Rs 1,810 million.
7.        The most important cost components to shadow price are foreign
exchange and labor and a shadow exchange rate of 1.15 times the official
exchange rate, based on Planning Commission estimates has been used. It was
further assumed that about 70% of the market wage rate would fairly repre-
sent the shadow wage rate. On these assumptions, the shadow priced rate of
return is 13.0%. Sensitivity analysis on this rate of return is shown in
Table 4.
