Project for the Philippines received a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome rating with moderate risk to\n            development. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            moderately satisfactory ratings. There were four\n            restructurings to this project. (1) The project closing date\n            was extended from its original June 30, 2008, to June 30,\n            2009, to allow sufficient time to make up for the delays\n            mostly caused by highly centralized management. (2) The\n            project closing date was extended from June 30, 2009, to May\n            31, 2010. (3) ASFP Additional Financing was approved. The\n            SRI component was not continued, but a Municipal Block Grant\n            sub-component was added. The PDO and KPIs were restructured.\n            (4) A twelve month extension to address delays caused by\n            security incidents and in view of delays in Additional\n            Financing effectiveness. Indicators were also updated to\n            accommodate core sector indicators as required by Bank\n            procedures and to consolidate and clarify some indicators.\n            The PDO was slightly altered and is as follows: The\n            objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce\n            poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a\n            peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-affected areas\n            in the ARMM Region and in particular to: (a) improve access\n            to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood\n            opportunities; (b) strengthen social cohesion and\n            partnerships between and within targeted communities; and\n            (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities\n            for implementation in the ARMM Region, with a focus on\n            improved participation, transparency and accountability in\n            the allocation and management of public resources by the\n            participating communities, local government units and ARMM\n            Regional Government. There were eight lessons learned from\n            this project and are as follows: (1) Regional governments\n            are able to implement community-driven development programs.\n            (2) CDD projects are an effective means to foster social\n            cohesion and partnerships in conflict-affected areas, but\n            are less effective in alleviating poverty. (3) CDD projects\n            in conflict-affected areas are effective if their design is\n            simple yet flexible. (4) Set realistic targets that can be\n            measured accurately. (5) Facilitators require incentives to\n            promote innovation. (6) CDD projects are highly appropriate\n            to improve literacy. (7) Spot checking and geo-tagging are\n            effective means for Bank supervision in otherwise\n            inaccessible areas. (8) Output-based Project Implementation\n            Agreements help ensure accountability and foster an\n            environment of responsibility."}, "docdt": "2015-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
