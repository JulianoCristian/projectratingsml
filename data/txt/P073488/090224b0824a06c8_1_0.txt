                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-
                         affected areas in the ARMM Region and in particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities; (b) strengthen social
                         cohesion and partnerships between and within targeted communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM
                         Region, with a focus on improved participation, transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities,
                         local government units and ARMM Regional Government.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After eleven years of implementation, the ARMM Social Fund Project will close on May 31, 2014. As of April 30, 928 of the targeted 1,156 sub-projects in the Additional Financing
                         phase have been completed, with 228 remaining. It is expected that around 50-60 of these remaining subprojects will not be completed before May 31 and approximately $1 million

                         of the World Bank loan will be cancelled. However, the government has a fully costed plan to complete these activities in June and July using government funds to ensure that
                         communities will benefit from the investments. By the end of May, approximately one million people will have benefited from the project since its inception in 2003, equating to more
                         than 25 percent of the total population of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The beneficiaries will enjoy increased access to services through 700 school
                         classroom buildings, 100 day care centers, 200 health centers, 300 water and sanitation projects, 500 transports projects (access roads, wharfs, ports, etc.) and 700 post-harvest and

                         other agricultural facilities. In addition to increased access to services, available evidence from impact evaluations and other assessments, suggests that moderately satisfactory
                         achievements have been made against the other key elements of the project development objective on: (i) social cohesion and partnerships between different groups in target
                         communities; and (ii) participation in local governance and community influence over development resources at the village level. Detailed and up-to date evidence on these higher
                         level outcomes will be produced through an ongoing impact assessment. These data will be presented in the World Bank's Implementation Completion and Results Report, which is
                         due in November 2014. One significant achievement of the project is that the ARMM Regional Government is now fully committed to the community-driven development approach.
                         A joint national-regional government technical working group is currently preparing a follow-on project to the ARMM Social Fund that should cover all 116 municipalities and two cities
                         in ARMM. In light of the imminent abolition of ARMM and transition to the new Bangsamoro political entity, preparation of the new project has also involved the Bangsamoro
                         Development Agency to ensure sustainability through the transition period.
