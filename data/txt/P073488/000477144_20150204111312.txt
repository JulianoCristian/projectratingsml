I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created by the government of
the Philippines in 1989 to grant a degree of political and fiscal autonomy to the country’s
Muslim population. It was a major part of government efforts to address the concerns of
Muslim Filipinos in a part of the country that had been affected for centuries by armed
struggle. Fuelled by a sense of historical injustice and neglect, that conflict intensified in the
mid-1970s between forces of the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and Muslim
separatist groups, of which the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were the largest. Since 1976, tens of thousands of people
have been killed, billions of dollars in damage and loss incurred and over 900,000 persons
internally displaced.1
A plebiscite was held in 1990, in which four provinces elected to become part of ARMM:
Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. Marawi City and Basilan Province were
added in 2001.
In 1996, the Government of the Philippines signed a peace agreement with the MNLF, but
not with the MILF. In 2000, armed conflict between GPH forces and the MILF escalated,
displacing thousands of people. In the same year, the GPH formulated a “peace and
development” strategy aimed at addressing some of the underlying economic causes of
continued armed conflict in Mindanao. A key component of the strategy was the targeted
development of conflict-affected communities in Mindanao under institutional arrangements
that would be “Mindanaon-driven”.
Against this background, the Government of the Philippines requested the Bank to support a
program to provide basic social services and infrastructure to promote economic
development in conflict-affected areas in ARMM.2 In response to this request, the Bank
helped prepare the ARMM Social Fund Project (hereinafter also referred to as ASFP or “the
project”), which was appraised in November 2002. The project would not only address the
GPH’s policy objectives, but was also highly relevant to the Bank’s 2003-2005 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Philippines, which aimed to support national efforts to
empower the poor to participate more fully in development, and help the Government to
implement its Medium-Term Development Plan for 2001-2004. The total cost of ASFP was
estimated at US$40.6 million, and would be financed from the proceeds of an IBRD Loan
(US$33.6m), and the Borrower’s own resources (US$7.0m). The expected loan effectiveness
date was January 15, 2003, and the expected loan closing date was June 30, 2008.
At the time of appraisal, it was anticipated that implementation of any development project in
ARMM would be difficult and dangerous. This was partly because armed conflict had
destroyed some of the social and economic infrastructure in the region. Furthermore, civil
unrest had plagued the region for decades and in 2002, significant parts of the region
remained de facto under the control of armed separatist groups. An important legacy of the

    Another Bank-funded project, Kalahi-CIDSS, provided similar support in the rest of the country outside
    ARMM. That project was not extended to ARMM in light of the region’s autonomous status and to
    adapt to its specific socio-political context.

long-standing conflict was weak governance and a lack of trust among communities and
between communities and the Government. The CDD approach was considered an important
strategy for addressing this problem by expanding the footprint of the state while directly
engaging with communities. On the positive side, a number of multilateral and bilateral
development partners had made significant financial commitments in support of the planned
peace process. These included the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) and the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), which both planned to provide parallel
financing in support of ASFP.3

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
Project Development Objective
According to the PAD, the development goals of the project are “to foster sustainable
development in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) through reducing
poverty and supporting mechanisms for the promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in
the conflict-affected areas therein.” This is considered a high-level goal related to the
Country Assistance Strategy, The PAD also mentions four specific project development
objectives, which for the purposes of the ICR are considered to represent the original PDO:
(i) provide and/or improve sustained access to social and economic infrastructure and
services by the poor and conflict-affected poor communities; (ii) provide capacity building
for women, youth and other community groups for improving food security, employment
opportunities and household incomes; (iii) strengthen social cohesion and partnerships
between and within communities in the ARMM region; and (iv) improve local governance
and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM Region. The original Loan
Agreement stated that “the objective of the project is to assist the Borrower in reducing
poverty by fostering sustainable development in the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao”. ISRs consistently referred to the specific PDOs in the PAD. The PDO reflects
the three main thrusts of the project – to open up access to basic services for improved socio-
economic welfare, to strengthen social cohesion and to support enhanced participation and
local governance in a region long known for corruption and weak governance.

Key Indicators
PDO indicators
The PAD mentions 19 output indicators, ten of which are also mentioned in Schedule 7 to the
Loan Agreement. The PAD does not include time-bound or quantifiable targets for any of
these indicators. The Loan Agreement mentions targets to be achieved by the end of 2007,
but most of these are not stated in terms that can be measured objectively. The Results
Framework was improved in the Additional Financing Project Paper, which provided end of
project target values that can be measured objectively. The Project Paper included eight
outcome indicators. Pursuant to a May 2013 restructuring of the Additional Financing, two of
these were dropped, one revised and four Core Sector Indicators added in line with World

 Eventually JICA did provide parallel financing to the ASFP. CIDA supported a long-term local
government capacity-building project in the region called the Local Government Support Program-ARMM
(LGSPA),which coordinated with the ASFP Institutional Strengthening and Governance component to
support barangay development planning.

Bank policy at the time. Annex 1 provides a Table with the outcome and intermediate
indicators at each stage of the project as represented in the PAD, the Project Paper and
following the May 2013 restructuring. The final indicators from the 2013 restructuring are as
follows:
    1. Percentage of households reporting reduced travel time and cost of access to
        communal basic service facilities
    2. Percentage of households reporting reduced cost of access to local agricultural
        production facilities
    3. Number of households with at least one adult family member who learned how to
        read or write as a result of the project’s Learning Livelihood and Food Self-
        Sufficiency Program.
    4. Average sub-project economic rate of return
    5. Proportion of people confident in their ability to influence decisions on identifying
        local development priorities
    6. Average LGU cost-sharing rate (incl. % of the sub-project total cost)
    7. Project beneficiaries (core sector indicator)
    8. Number of female project beneficiaries (core sector indicator)
    9. Conflict-affected people to whom benefits have been delivered within the first year of
        project effectiveness (core sector indicator)
    10. Increase in household consumption

Intermediate outcome indicators
The Restructuring Paper from 2013 also contains indicators that were used to measure
intermediate outcomes as follows:
    1. Number of communities with improved local infrastructure facilities implemented by
       the Project
    2. Number of LGUs with improved municipal infrastructure facilities implemented by
       the Project
    3. Number of indigenous people beneficiaries
    4. Number of established POs
    5. Number of community sub-projects implemented at technical standards and within
       budget
    6. Number of POs with women officer
    7. Number of POs with indigenous person officer
    8. Number of Municipal Teams installed and mobilized in target communities
    9. Beneficiaries that feel project investments reflected their needs (core sector indicator)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
Revised PDO. In 2010, the GPH and the Bank signed a Loan Agreement for Additional
Financing of ASFP. The agreement contained a project objective that was based on the PDO
in the PAD, albeit with slightly different wording as follows: “The objective of the Project is
to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a
peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-affected areas in the ARMM Region and in
particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood
opportunities; (b) strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and within targeted
communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities for

                                               3
implementation in the ARMM Region, with a focus on improved participation, transparency
and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the participating
communities, local government units and ARMM Regional Government.”


The PDO revision changed some of the wording and the second of the four specific
objectives mentioned in the original PDO (“provide capacity building for women, youth and
other community groups for improving food security, employment opportunities and
household incomes”) was merged into the first objective. The project activity linked to this
objective, the Learning, Livelihood and Food Sufficiency (LLFS) sub-component, was
maintained in the Additional Financing. Furthermore, the capacity-building objective for
women, youth and other groups was also retained in various intermediate indicators in the
Project Paper. Thus, although this was technically a revision to the PDO, it was not deemed
substantive, and did not result in a change in the implementation of the project.
Revised key indicators. During project implementation, major and substantive changes were
made to the indicators used to measure project performance. The original Loan Agreement
mentioned ten performance indicators, without differentiating outcome and intermediate
result indicators. The Loan Agreement and Project Paper for the Additional Financing (AF)
introduced eight outcome indicators and 15 intermediate results indicators, eight for
Component A (Community Development Assistance) and seven for Component C
(Institutional Strengthening and Governance).4 Although none of the eight outcome
indicators were mentioned in the original Loan Agreement, one indicator (the number of
active people’s organizations) was nonetheless measured by the project’s Management
Information System (MIS). Of the 15 intermediate results indicators, none were explicitly
mentioned in the original Loan Agreement, but two indicators were already measured by the
MIS before the Additional Financing was approved (the number of communities with
improved infrastructure facilities implemented by the project and the number of established
people’s organizations). According to the Project Paper for the Additional Financing, key
indicators were revised in order “to better reflect original intentions and ensure ability to
monitor achievement”.5 The Project Paper also contained end-of-year target values for each
of the indicators. Because the revised key indicators were formally introduced in August
2010, when the Loan Agreement for the AF was signed, the MIS started measuring most of
the revised result indicators in that year (except for the three overlapping indicators, which
had been measured from the first year of implementation in 2003).

In May 2013, the Bank approved a proposed change to the Results Framework. As required
by Bank procedures, four new core sector indicators were introduced: number of project
beneficiaries (total and female only), number of conflict-affected people to whom benefits
have been delivered within the first year of project effectiveness and number of beneficiaries
that feel project investments reflected their needs. An indicator to measure increase in
household consumption was also added to try to strengthen evidence on economic impacts.
Of the original 23 indicators, nine were dropped (mainly because of limited relevance or
overlap with other indicators), and two were revised (see Annex 3 for details).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
At the time of appraisal, ARMM comprised five provinces and one city. These were divided
into 94 municipalities and 2,378 barangays (villages). The primary beneficiaries of the
project comprised some 750,000 persons living in 500 barangays, which were selected based
on four criteria: (i) poverty, (ii) degree of conflict-affectedness, (iii) complementarity with
other government programs, and (iv) LGU commitment. The population in all target
barangays would benefit both directly and indirectly from improved community
infrastructure and services, community-oriented training, and grant assistance for the poorest
and most vulnerable groups––all planned and implemented through a community-driven
development process. Secondary beneficiaries would be (i) the Government of ARMM (the
executing agency), which would benefit from increased capacity; (ii) barangay level
facilitators and partner agencies providing implementation support; (iii) the provincial and
municipal governments in which the 500 target barangays were located, who would benefit
from training, field studies, and institutional strengthening aimed at improving their planning
capabilities; and (iv) the newly created (or activated) people’s organizations (POs), which
would benefit from technical assistance and advisory services on planning, implementing and
monitoring development projects in their own communities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Community Development Assistance. Project Cost: US$26.0 million (88%
Bank financing) 6
This component would finance the development and implementation of a community-driven
development program through the provision of: (i) block grants to community groups for the
construction, rehabilitation and improvement of small-scale social and economic
infrastructure, including rural water supply and sanitation systems, small scale irrigation
schemes, rainwater tanks, barangay health stations, communal schools, community learning
centers, post-harvest facilities, farm-to-market and barangay roads, timber ports and bridges,
and the rehabilitation of damaged houses; (ii) community-oriented training and training for
community development groups and service providers to improve access of the people to
community services; and (iii) capacity building, technical and financial assistance to
women’s groups and out-of-school youth.

Component 2: Strategic Regional Infrastructure. Project Cost: US$5.5 million (85% Bank
financing)
This component would finance the rehabilitation of larger infrastructure damaged during the
conflict in 2000. Thirteen subprojects were prioritized in line with ARMM’s regional
development plan, including facilities for health, education, human resource development,
social services and ports. It would also provide technical assistance to assist the Regional
Government to procure, manage and monitor the strategic regional infrastructure investments.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Governance. Project Cost: US$8.8m (66%
Bank financing)



6
    The total project cost was slightly higher than the sum of the cost of the three components, because it
    also included a front-end fee of US$0.34 million.

                                                       5
This component would finance the following four types of activities:
1. Information, education and communication activities to support institutional strengthening
   and governance for ARMM, Local Government Units (LGUs), and the Central and Area
   Fund Management Offices (CFMO and AFMOs, respectively), and develop public
   awareness on the project development objectives and processes.7
2. Strengthening of ARMM, LGU, CFMO and AFMO capacity for project implementation,
   including staff training and development of operational and administrative guidelines.
3. Enhancing the community-based education system in ARMM for mainstreaming in the
   formal national education system including the development of curricula and educational
   materials, piloting of selected community-based schools and training.
4. Project management and implementation support, including audits of Project accounts and
   strengthening of the operational, managerial and administrative capacity of the Social
   Fund, the ARMM Government, LGUs, community groups and nongovernmental
   organizations involved in Project implementation, including the provision of training,
   consultants’ services and equipment.
The project would be managed by a Fund Management Office (consisting of one CFMO and
two AFMOs) under the auspices of a Board of Directors, whose members would be
appointed by and report directly to the President of the Philippines. The Fund Management
Office would closely coordinate with ARMM government units, but be semi-autonomous
from the ARMM Government.

1.6 Revised Components
None of three components was revised during project implementation. However, the
Additional Financing only funded Components 1 and 3, because JICA had committed to
continue financing Strategic Regional Infrastructure (Component 2). In addition, a pilot sub-
component for municipal infrastructure was included in Component 1 in 2009. Eventually,
the pilot sub-component financed 17 subprojects with an average cost of about US$50,000
(or about three times the average cost of a community-based infrastructure subproject).
1.7 Other significant changes
Change to the closing date of the original loan. The Bank agreed to extend the loan closing
date from June 30, 2008 to June 30, 2010. The extension was granted because of delays in
project implementation during 2002-2006. According to the mid-term review, the delays
were the result of an over-optimistic implementation schedule. Centralized project
management (ASFP was initially managed from Manila) also contributed to delays in
disbursement.
Additional Financing. In August 2010, the government and the Bank signed a Loan
Agreement for Additional Financing of US$ 30 million. Of this amount, about US$26.1
million was allocated for community development assistance for over 500 barangays that had
not been covered under the original loan. The remaining US$3.9 million would finance
supporting investments in institutional strengthening and governance (as mentioned in
Section 1.6, additional investments in strategic regional infrastructure were to be financed by

JICA). The Loan Agreement for the AF contained a minor revision to the PDO and
introduced a revised set of key performance indicators with end-of-year targets for 2011,
2012 and 2013. The original closing date of the Additional Financing was May 31, 2013. The
Bank approved a 12-month extension of the loan to May 31, 2014 in response to delays in
project implementation that were caused by the unexpected change of the ARMM
Government in 2010, shortly after the 2009 Maguindanao massacre (see Section 2.2 for
details), and because of occasional major spikes in armed conflict between GPH and
separatist forces, as well as serious communal conflicts in various project locations.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Soundness of background analysis and lessons learned from previous projects. The
project was the first genuine community-driven development project in the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao. The PAD contained a thorough analysis of other ongoing
projects in Mindanao (notably the pre-cursor project, the Southern Zone of Peace and
Development Social Fund) and of successful CDD projects elsewhere in the region. The
background analysis resulted in a series of lessons learned, all of which were incorporated in
the project design. The most important of these lessons can be summarized as follows:
 there is a high demand from communities in ARMM for a demand-driven menu that
     addresses their socio-economic needs,
 a quick-response mechanism for post-conflict areas is necessary, but is unlikely to result
     in lasting peace and development, and
 the sustainability of subprojects depends on responsiveness to community demands,
     adequate community “social capital”, involvement of LGUs and other stakeholders, and
     workable O&M plans.
Assessment of project design. The project design was highly relevant and addressed to the
plans and priorities of the national and ARMM Governments. The CDD approach was
especially seen as a suitable means to rebuild social cohesion and partnerships. The
components and implementation arrangements were well designed, realistic, and not overly
complex, having been largely adapted from proven approaches developed under successful
CDD projects in Indonesia, a country in the region with similar circumstances. The project
design was also sufficiently flexible to respond to local needs, including a number of
important adaptations to the ARMM context. By contrast to the Kalahi-CIDSS project or
Indonesian CDD projects, the ASFP targeted directly at the village level, with no inter-village
forum. This was based on concerns about promoting competition for funds between groups
that might be engaged in violent conflict. Reflecting local socio-political realities, the project
established Municipal Multi-Sector Committees (MMSCs), comprising tribal elders, religious
leaders and, where present, representatives from the Moro National Liberation Front and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front. MMSCs validated site selection and endorsed subproject
selection. In practice they also prevented duplication of effort from different government or
donor programs and also provided a “social licence” to the project to operate in areas where
security is challenging. These design features helped the project to function in areas where
few others could be implemented.



                                                7
Government commitment, stakeholder involvement, and participatory processes. The
Government of the Philippines and the ARMM Government played a central role in the
preparation of the project, based on the national development plan (the Medium-Term
Development Plan for 2001-2004), ARMM development plans, and the central government’s
“Mindanaoan-driven” development strategy to foster peace and security in the region. The
high level of government ownership was one aspect highlighted by a 2003 QAG review that
rated quality at entry as “Satisfactory”. The QAG review also noted that “some aspects of the
preparation, design, and implementation arrangements are exemplary, and represent ‘best
practice’ in preparation and design”.
Risks and risk mitigation measures. The overall project risk was rated “substantial”, and
this rating was deemed appropriate. The highest risks identified in the PAD were on security
and governance. The project paper for the Additional Financing added “reputational risk” as a
third substantial risk, in view of the Bank’s involvement in a region that was administered by
some members of Ampatuan clan some of whom – including the ARMM Regional Governor
and Governor of Maguindanao province at that time – had been charged in relation to the
case (see Section 2.2 for details on the Maguindanao massacre).8 To mitigate security risks,
project interventions would be aimed at communities with “manageable" peace and order
conditions; a substantial capacity-building program and well-trained facilitators would be
provided by the project to mitigate governance risks; in addition, third parties would conduct
spot checks to verify compliance with eligibility criteria for block grants. In the Additional
Financing phase, a grievance redress system was established to capture community
complaints. Geo-tagging of subproject sites was also introduced as an additional
transparency measure. The spot checks and geo-tagging were of particular value in the three
island provinces of ARMM (Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi), which were inaccessible to Bank
staff for supervision because of security concerns. Reputational risks were mitigated by
seeking political support from GPH and the post-Ampatuan administration and by conducting
an assessment of security and governance in Maguindanao province following the massacre.
The direct transfer of block grant funds to communities – in line with CDD principles – was
another crucial mitigating measure employed by the project.

2.2 Implementation
Overview. Despite some challenges and implementation delays, given the context the project
made significant achievements. It delivered CDD in every municipality in ARMM, reaching
almost 1 million people. The technical quality of construction was consistently rated as
adequate; the quality of social preparation was inconsistent but certainly sufficient to meet
minimum standards; and the PMO worked diligently to meet challenging output targets.
Significant capacity was built within the Office of the Regional Governor and the two main
implementing regional line agencies, the Department of Social Welfare and Development and
the Department of the Interior and Local Government. ASFP was widely recognized as a
flagship project of the ARMM and received national recognition in the form of a “Good
Practices” Award from the National Economic and Development Authority in 2011. The
value of the human infrastructure established by the ASFP was also recognized by the
national government, which piggy-backed on the ASFP’s network of people’s organizations

 It is important to point out that many members of the Ampatuan clan are also professionals with no
association with the massacre.

(POs) to deliver millions of dollars of government projects through the ASFP POs under
separate national government projects from 2010-2013.9
Factors outside the control of the government or the implementing agency
    Adverse impact of Ampatuan administration on security and subproject selection. From
     2005 to 2009, ARMM was governed by Zaldy Ampatuan, with Maguindanao province at
     the time headed by his father, Andal Ampatuan, Sr.. On 23 November 2009, 58 people
     were murdered in a town under the control of the clan while they were travelling in a
     convoy to file a certificate of candidacy for a gubernatorial candidate challenging the
     Governor’s son, Andal Ampatuan Jr., in upcoming local elections. As a result of this
     event, which became known worldwide as the “Maguindanao massacre”, the province
     was temporarily placed under martial law. Shortly afterwards, Ampatuan Jr. and Sr., as
     well as some other members of their clan, were charged with murder and have been on
     trial since. Commencement of the AF was put on hold in Maguindanao to allow time for
     an assessment of security and governance in the province, delaying implementation in
     the region’s largest province by six months. A confluence of poor governance,
     monopoly of power and high security risks made it difficult for the implementing agency
     to prevent misuse of funds and political interference in subproject selection in
     Maguindanao. A 2011 Commission on Audit Special Audit Report on Maguindanao
     province identified a number of issues with the ASFP, though nearly all of these were
     JICA-funded subprojects.10 The aftermath of the Maguindanao massacre saw elections
     suspended in ARMM and an interim government directly appointed by the President.
     The transition period saw a virtual hiatus in implementation, another cause of delay.
    Violent conflict. Ongoing armed conflict (which was especially prevalent in 2003 and
     2008) kept security risks high and drove massive displacement, in turn complicating and
     delaying project implementation. In addition to violence between separatist groups and
     the government, spikes in communal conflict and violent crime also regularly affected
     the speed of implementation throughout the life of the project.
    Extreme weather events. Since 2011, Mindanao has been hit by major storms in each of
     the past three years, some of which affected Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur in
     particular with heavy flooding.
Factors subject to the control of the government or the implementation agency
Positive factors
    Strong political commitment and support. The project was able to secure support at the
     highest levels of government. The commitment of both the national and the ARMM
     administrations to the peace process facilitated project implementation. Both
     Governments were also committed to the CDD approach to foster cohesion and socio-
     economic development in conflict-affected areas. This is evident by the fact that the
     project retained ARMM government support through four regional administrations.
     LGUs also consistently delivered on counterpart funding commitments, not a common
     occurrence in ARMM.

   Communities” or PAMANA project.

   Effective anti-corruption strategy. Prevention was the main strategy employed. PMO
    fiduciary staff were hired as consultants to ensure independence from government. This
    included an effective internal auditor. Geo-tagging and independent third-party spot
    checks also supported oversight in hard to reach areas. Individuals and independent
    organizations in beneficiary communities used channels of communication established
    by the project (such as the grievance redress system or facilitators) to report suspected
    cases of corruption. Follow-up actions, including local government coordination and
    withholding of funds, proved effective in combating isolated cases of corruption.
   Institutionalization of ASFP. The locus of project management was shifted from Manila
    to ARMM when the central Fund Management Office was abolished in 2006 and the
    ARMM PMO empowered to manage all aspects of project implementation. This was
    crucial to unblocking the bottlenecks that had hampered project implementation in the
    first two years of the project. ARMM demonstrated significant capacity to deliver once
    given full management responsibility. The ARMM Government assigned its own staff
    for many of the PMO positions to avoid reliance on consultants, and to build in-house
    capacity. The project structure was also based around Project Implementation
    Agreements (PIAs) between the PMO and two regional line agencies, the Department of
    Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Interior and Local
    Government (DILG). DSWD handled social preparation and community organization,
    with DILG leading on capacity-building for local government units on development
    planning. The PIAs linked funding to the delivery of specified outputs. This provided a
    degree of discipline and accountability in implementation. It also minimized reliance on
    external consultants, with implementation being handled directly by ARMM regional
    line agencies.
Negative factors
   Manila-based project management (2002-2004). Based on concerns about capacity and
    corruption risk, the government initially managed the project from Manila. This was
    inconsistent with its own policy of supporting “Mindanaoan-driven” development. It
    also resulted in major delays in disbursement during the initial period of implementation.
   Inconsistent quality of facilitation. To promote LGU ownership and leadership and in
    the interests of efficiency, the project had a light structure at the municipal level. A
    project-hired Municipal Facilitator was to work with Municipal Technical Teams
    (MTTs) from the LGU to handle social preparation and oversight of implementation. In
    a number of LGUs the MTTs were not very active. This isolated some facilitators, who
    often spent insufficient time in the field to fully empower people’s organizations.
   Delays in compliance with loan covenants. The implementing agency complied late with
    covenants related to the appointment of an internal auditor, issuance of annual work
    plans and the recruitment of an independent third party to conduct spot checks.
Mid-term review. As planned, a mid-term review was conducted in January 2006. The key
findings of the review can be summarized as follows: (i) the original implementation
schedule was overly ambitious, which explained why disbursement was lower than planned;
(ii) there was a need for an institutional champion (at the time the review was conducted, the
election of a new ARMM administration was underway); and (iii) there was a need for
institutionalization of the project (by appointing ARMM staff as project officers and
including counterpart funds in ARMM Government and LGU budgets). Most of the
recommendations in the mid-review were implemented, leading to significant improvements

Because of delays in disbursement, the mid-term review already anticipated the need for an
extension, which was granted in 2008 (see Section 1.7).
Effectiveness of risk mitigation. Mitigation of project risks was generally good. The
specific risks related to pro-poor targeting and fiduciary controls were mitigated effectively
during implementation. However, risks related to security and lack of capacity by the ARMM
Government and LGUs were greater than anticipated, and not mitigated as successfully as
expected (necessitating an extension to the original loan). However, these shortcomings did
not fundamentally undermine achievement of the project outcomes.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E system included a number of innovations to address governance and corruption
concerns. An internal monitor was appointed to independently check progress and
compliance with fiduciary requirements, and third-party spot checks were introduced in
locations not accessible to the Bank, together with geo-tagging of subproject sites.
The project measured progress against key performance indicators (KPIs) using a
management information system (MIS). Before-after/treatment-control Impact Assessments
were conducted both at the end of the original loan and the Additional Financing. The
assessment of the AF was set up in a rigorous manner, but the government introduced two
new community development programs in ARMM in 2011, making the impacts of the project
difficult to isolate. The end-line survey was also undertaken when construction of
subprojects was ongoing or only just completed in more than half the treatment sites,
diminishing the ability to measure real benefits from subproject implementation.
M&E design. Perhaps surprisingly, the PAD did not contain a description of the M&E
system that was envisaged at appraisal, although Annex 1 did present a data collection
strategy. The project paper for the AF contained a much more detailed results framework that
clearly outlined data collection instruments and allocated responsibilities for data collection.
M&E implementation. The PMO submitted timely quarterly progress reports, with detailed
quantitative information on subproject progress from the project MIS. The PMO utilized a
very effective dashboard to track progress against inputs and activities, but lacked tools for
tracking the quality of implementation. The PMO was responsible for two surveys upon
project completion: an economic analysis (which was eventually undertaken by the Bank)
and a beneficiary survey (which was submitted more than three months late). Spot checks
were undertaken infrequently and much later than agreed with the Bank, but were particularly
valuable for the three provinces where the Bank was unable to conduct direct supervision at
all during the Additional Financing phase due to security concerns.
M&E utilization. There was little strategic use of information generated by the MIS. As
already observed by the mid-term review, M&E functions tended to focus on the number and
pace of activities undertaken, but data was rarely maximized to improve project
implementation. Most strategic changes and improvements emerged from joint discussions
with the PMO and government during Bank implementation support and technical missions.
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
Although some project activities triggered safeguards related to environmental assessment
(BP 4.01), indigenous peoples (BP 4.10) and involuntary resettlement (BP 4.12), none caused

                                               11
significant adverse impacts. The project did not finance land acquisition, but utilized
voluntary land donations. Given the small size of subprojects (usually no more than
US$20,000), it was a priori expected that any adverse social and environmental impacts
would be small or negligible. Indeed, the project generated substantial social and environ-
mental benefits, especially through investments in health and educational facilities, and water
supply systems.11 The recording of potential social and environmental impacts was adequate,
and compliance with safeguards was generally good. For this reason, the overall safeguards
rating was “satisfactory” throughout most of the project implementation period.
The project’s financial management was mostly satisfactory. The PMO recruited capable
financial managers, established an effective internal monitoring unit, and submitted financial
management reports and audit reports in accordance with the provisions in the loan covenants,
and mostly on time. Seven of the eleven audited project financial statements had unqualified
opinions from the Commission on Audit while four (2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012) had
qualified audit opinions, mainly because of: (i) outstanding balance of cash advances to
various officers and employees, and (ii) overstatement in receivables account and Inventory
account. Status reports on the resolution of the above issues were submitted to the Bank and
actions taken were found acceptable. However, the implementing agency was unable to
prevent misuse of funds (which reportedly occurred in 17 of over 2,700 subprojects); it was
also of some concern that the PMO disbursed final tranche payments to over 200 villages
shortly before the loan closing date (although it was anticipated that these funds could be
absorbed in full before loan closing). Actions were taken to refund to the Bank the loan funds
for subprojects not completed by the closing date and to use counterpart funds to complete
unfinished subprojects. Procurement was also mostly satisfactory, although some delays were
encountered, partly because some individuals designated to perform the duties of the
procurement officer were initially not familiar with agreed procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
a)      Transition arrangements. Not applicable.
b)      Follow-up projects. Through 2013 and 2014 under a grant from the Australian
        government, a joint team of the national government, ARMM and the Bangsamoro
        Development Agency (with technical support from the Asian Development Bank and the
        World Bank) has been working on the design of a follow up CDD project. At the time of
        writing, the ARMM Government has secured PHP 120 million to commence
        implementation in the first half of 2015. Funding to continue the program would need to
        be secured either from development partners or from the proposed Bangsamoro
        Transition Authority, which is expected to assume power in mid-2015.
c)      Future impact evaluation. Given the impact assessment was rolled out in many
        locations where implementation was ongoing, the Bank task team would like to repeat
        the end-line survey in twelve months’ time to allow sufficient time for benefits to accrue.
        This will require additional funding, however.




11
            The average cost of Strategic Regional Infrastructure and infrastructure financed by municipal
     block grants was about US$ 440,000 and US$50,000, respectively. However, the combined cost of these
     types of infrastructure accounted for less than 10% of the total project cost.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project complemented the Government’s efforts to improve socio-economic development
and empower local communities, and foster peace and security through inclusive growth and
poverty reduction. As described in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016, the
government remains firmly committed to adopting the CDD approach and, like the ARMM
Government, considers this approach an important means to help achieve peace and cohesion.
The CDD approach is also a key component of the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for FY2015-2018, which was issued two weeks before the loan closing date. The CPS
emphasizes engagements with government counterparts and other stakeholders who are
committed to addressing critical governance and institutional challenges. The CPS identifies
five thematic areas for the Bank’s engagement in the Philippines during FY2015-2018, three
of which are directly relevant to ASFP: (i) transparent and accountable government, (ii)
empowerment of the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) peace, institution building, and social and
economic opportunity. The latter pillar explicitly mentioned the development and
implementation of a “peace dividend” program for the Bangsamoro (see also Section 2.2).
Therefore, at completion the project was still highly relevant to the objectives of the Bank,
and the national and ARMM Governments. The government further demonstrated its
commitment to the CDD approach and the “social infrastructure” established by the ARMM
Social Fund when they used it as a channel for funds for new national programs on peace and
development.12
The design was very relevant to the ARMM context, with a modified CDD approach that (as
discussed above) targeted directly at the village level, involved local informal leaders in
project processes, included a literacy sub-component and also enhanced conflict analysis in
the social preparation stage. On the negative side, the original results framework and
indicators were complicated, in some cases overly ambitious and not always closely
connected to the PDO. However, this problem was addressed in the 2010 Additional
Financing and 2013 restructuring.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO was revised under the Additional Financing in May 2010, and KPIs were
restructured twice – first through the AF, and secondly in the May 2013 restructuring. Both
the original and the revised PDO focused on three overall objectives of strengthening access
to services and livelihood opportunities; social cohesion and trust; and local governance.

Outcome indicators. The project had three key objectives, as articulated in the Additional
Financing Project Paper (which consolidated the four objectives under the Original Loan).
The three PDOs were as follows: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure
and livelihood opportunities; (b) strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and
within targeted communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities
for implementation in the ARMM Region, with a focus on improved participation,
transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the
participating communities, local government units and ARMM Regional Government. The


12
     Specially the PAMANA program and the Transition Investment Support Program.

                                                  13
project was moderately successful in achieving these objectives, when measured by its key
performance indicators (see Annex 3 for details).13 The Loan Agreement for the AF listed
eight outcome indicators and 15 intermediate results indicators (IRIs). Several indicators
were revised or dropped during a restructuring in 2013; at this time four core indicators were
added (see Section 1.4). The achievement of outcome indicators can be summarized as
follows, drawing mostly on a 2009 independent assessment of the Original Loan and the
2014 Impact Assessment of the Additional Financing.

PDO 1: Improve Access to Social and Economic Infrastructure and Livelihood Opportunities

The key indicators were: (i) Percentage of households reporting reduced travel time and cost
of access to communal basic service Facilities; (ii) Percentage of households reporting
reduced cost of access to local agricultural production facilities; (iii) Number of households
with at least one adult family member who learned how to read or write as a result of the
Project’s Learning-Livelihood Program; (iv) Average sub-project economic rate of return;and
(v) increase in household consumption

The project achieved solid results on this objective. The project improved access to local
agricultural production facilities to a higher proportion of households than expected (20%
against a target of 18%) and resulted in higher-than-expected increases in access to piped
water supply. Communities in treatment areas reported improved access to communal basic
services including health, education, water, food and sanitation facilities (though none were
at a statistically significant level).

These results built on benefits being delivered to 988,500 people in 1,261 villages (against at
target of 900) through 2,703 (vs. target of 2,600) subprojects. While targets for the number
of villages and subprojects were exceeded, the desired total number of beneficiaries was not
achieved. This suggests that beneficiary numbers per community were significantly
overestimated.

The project met the target of thirteen larger strategic regional infrastructure subprojects.
Seventeen of the targeted 22 municipal infrastructure subprojects were completed at the loan
closing date. The other five were dropped due to either security problems, political
instability or governance concerns.

The Learning, Livelihood and Food Sufficiency sub-component was initially conceived as
focusing on livelihood/income generation. However, when faced with the high levels of
illiteracy, the program shifted to emphasize basic numeracy and literacy skills. The number
of households exceeded the target of 57,900 by 4,500 and pre- and post-test results showed
99% of beneficiaries improved their skill level.

The average subproject rate of return was estimated at 14.5%, slightly above the 14% target.


13
  As this is a restructured operation with Additional Financing and a PDO revision, an assessment of the
achievement of the PDOs for the original and AF phases would normally be made to determine the overall
efficacy. But given the change in PDO was not significant, the rating applies to both phases of the project.

                                                     14
The project set a target of 5% increase in household consumption for treatment over control
areas. Given improved access to services – particularly agriculture production facilities – and
Philippine and global experience from CDD projects, it was expected that the project would
have a positive or, worst case, no impact on consumption. However, the 2014 impact
assessment indicated a 4.5 % decrease in consumption in treatment over control areas (albeit
this change was not statistically significant). Expenditure is traditionally very difficult to
measure. Investments of hundreds of millions of dollars by the government in the ASFP
areas from 2011-2013 is likely to have complicated measurement of this result as well. The
endline survey was also undertaken while many subproject remained under construction, thus
suggesting results are understated. 14

Finally, while the literacy and numeracy activities under the Learning, Livelihood and Food
Sufficiency sub-component have proven to be very successful and well received, the
livelihood aspects were small in scope and in impact.

PDO 2: Strengthen Social Cohesion and Partnerships between and within targeted
communities

The project’s main intervention to support social cohesion and partnership was the
establishment of people’s organizations. Representing all sitios (or hamlets) in the village to
promote interaction between different ethnic and religious groups, the POs also had targets
for female and IP representation to ensure inclusivity and gender-sensitivity.

The key indicator for this objective was: “Proportion of people confident in their ability to
influence decisions in their village in identification of local development priorities.” The
2014 assessment showed a 3% increase in treatment areas over control, though this was not
statistically significant (see Annex 6). The confidence increased in treatment over control
areas by 14% where both subprojects were completed. Qualitative evidence from the field
and stakeholder workshop suggested that the ARMM Social Fund was the first opportunity
for many to influence decision-making on development. And while there was not significant
progress against this indicator, 86% of people against a target of 60% felt that project
investments reflected their needs, representing a vote of confidence in project processes.

In terms of trust and social cohesion, the 2014 assessment showed a slight reduction in trust
within and outside treatment communities compared to control, though not at a statistically
significant level. The 2009 assessment showed a 9% increase in Lanao del Sur and 3% in
Sulu in trust levels in treatment over control locations.

The program established multiple partnerships, including over 1200 people’s organizations
and Memorandums of Agreement with every Municipal Local Government Unit in ARMM.



14
   Overall the survey showed a 5% decrease in consumption in control over treatment areas, though this is
not statistically significant. However, in survey locations where two cycles of subprojects had been
completed, consumption increased by 14% in the bottom quintile. Across the board the indicators were
stronger where two cycles had been completed, suggesting the timing of the endline survey significantly
understated the impact the project actually had.

                                                    15
Efforts for social cohesion included outreach to indigenous peoples and women as groups
often marginalized from local power structures. The number of POs with indigenous person
officers was about 25% lower than the target (144 against a target of 200). The target was
poorly set, however, as there are not 200 villages in ARMM with indigenous persons. The
number of POs with women officers was 995 against a target of 775.

PDO 3: Improve Local Governance and Institutional Capacities for implication in ARMM

Activities to support this PDO included direct support and training for the ARMM Office of
the Regional Governor, DSWD-ARMM, DILG-ARMM and multiple municipal and
barangay LGUs. Among other things, the project helped Barangay LGUs to prepare
Barangay Development Plans, many for the first time.

The key indicator for this objective was: “Average LGU cost-sharing rate (including % of the
subproject total cost).” The project was able to surpass this indicator, a notable achievement
in the ARMM region. The 2014 assessment also showed a 7% increase in collective action;
7% increase in awareness of barangay assemblies and 5% increase in participation in
barangay assemblies. Furthermore, the project supported the formulation of village
development plans in hundreds of villages in ARMM, many for the first time. The
participation of planning, engineering, and social welfare LGU staff in the project allowed
them to gain expertise, strengthening LGU capacity. However, it should be noted that this
increased capacity did not lead to broader reforms in LGU processes, which is reflected in the
limited change communities expressed in their views on the capacity of LGUs.

* The first two outcomes under the original PDO were merged under the label “improved access to social
  and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities” following the AF.

3.3 Efficiency
Economic internal rate of return. Efficiency was gauged by the economic rate of return
(EIRR) and by unit rate norms of subprojects financed by ASFP. The Bank estimated the
EIRR of community-based infrastructure subprojects, which accounted for over 65% of the
total project cost, at 14.5%. The EIRR of the municipal infrastructure was estimated at 13.8%
(see Annex 4 for details). The rate for the Strategic Regional Infrastructure was between
14.7% and 22.1%. Weighing the different components, the overall EIRR is 14.47%.
Cost effectiveness. Unit costs of four types of community-based infrastructure (schools,
roads, water supply systems and health stations) financed by ASFP were lower than for
similar subprojects financed by the nationwide sister project, KALAHI-CIDSS. This is an
important finding, given that the overall project costs for KALAHI-CIDSS are lower than
similar projects contracted out by line agencies.15 Cost savings are mostly due to the
absence of contractor fees and associated value added tax, estimated at around 15-25% of
the total subproject cost,16 and voluntary community contributions.
However, the average cost per beneficiary household was higher under ASFP than KALAHI-
CIDSS for two school buildings and health stations, possibly because the ASFP area has a
lower population density and contains more isolated villages than the rest of the of
Philippines (i.e., the KALAHI-CIDSS area).

ARMM Governments. ASFP was seen by all three parties as an effective means to build
social cohesion in ARMM, and both the national and ARMM Governments will continue to
use CDD to help create transparent and accountable government, empower the poor and
vulnerable, and support peace, institution building, and social and economic opportunities.
The design was carefully adapted to the local context in a way that allowed it to function in
difficult areas and become seen as a breakthrough project in the ARMM region.
Achievement of PDO. As described in Section 3.2, the project achieved some but not all of
its targets. It was successful in attracting counterpart funds, improving literacy and improving
access to local agricultural facilities and piped water supply. Project investments generated
economic benefits, as evidenced by its EIRR, which exceeded the target. Access to health,
education, water and markets is also higher in treatment over control areas. However, the
project did not reach the targeted number of (male or female) beneficiaries and did not
achieve the targeted number of municipal infrastructure facilities. In addition, there is no
evidence that the project had a statistically significant impact on household expenditure.
Results were mixed on the confidence of intended beneficiaries to influence decisions about
local development priorities. On the positive side, it appears that several targets were missed
because of overoptimistic assumptions. Moreover, the project appears to have resulted in an
outcome that is difficult to capture by quantitative indicators: improved social cohesion and
partnerships in communities served by ASFP. This aspect was documented through extensive
qualitative research throughout the project and also raised during the stakeholder workshop.17
Efficiency. The cost of ASFP projects is much lower than similar programs financed by
contractors and other government line agencies. The project’s overall EIRR slightly exceeded
the target of 14%. The project experienced delays (as described in Section 1.7, the original
loan and AF were extended by a total of 36 months), so that benefits were delivered
substantially later than originally envisaged. Much of the delay was due to security
conditions and political instability. However, overly-centralized management in the initial
phase of the project also played a part, though this was later addressed.
On balance against the three main thrusts of access to services and livelihood opportunities;
social cohesion; and local governance, the project made impressive achievements in a
difficult environment. Access to services improved as the project exceeded subproject and
village targets. However, this did not seemingly translate into increases in household
consumption. The project promoted social cohesion and trust through POs. This generated
increased participation in collective action and local assemblies, but did not apparently filter
across into immediate improvements in local government performance. Longer-term
engagement beyond the ASFPs normal two-year intervention in each village would seem to
be necessary to generate those spillover effects.
Whilst acknowledging the continued relevance of the project, because of limitations to the
achievement of the PDO and the efficiency with which ASFP was implemented, the overall
outcome of the project was rated “moderately satisfactory”.

The project helped mobilize additional investments in CDD projects (several LGUs provided
more than the minimum required amount of 15%) and Strategic Regional Infrastructure
(JICA and AusAID co-financed an expansion of the ARMM Technical Education and Skills
Development Center). More importantly, the project helped the ARMM Government
establish itself as a reliable and competent Executing Agency of projects financed by
development partners, and CDD projects in particular. As the first donor project run through
the regional government, the ASFP was a trail-blazing activity for ARMM.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary survey. Two major impact assessments were undertaken, one at the conclusion
of the original loan and the second covering the Additional Financing phase. In both cases,
the PMO recruited a firm to assess the impacts of the project on inter alia, access to services,
social cohesion and partnerships and local governance. . The key findings of both
assessments are detailed in Annex 6 and can can be summarized as follows:
 the vast majority of project beneficiaries feel that project investments reflect their needs;
 the project significantly improved access to agricultural production facilities and piped
     water supply;
 the project improved access to communal basic services at a higher rate than in a
     “control group” of localities for education and health facilities, food and sanitation
     facilities and access to local markets;
 the project did not generate clear evidence of an increase household consumption; and
   results were mixed on improvements in the confidence of people in their ability of
    influence local development priorities and on trust.
It is important point to note that subproject implementation was still ongoing in 14 of the 48
treatment villages when the 2014 endline survey was fielded, and only just completed in
another twenty. Accordingly the results do not capture the full benefits of the project. It is
evident, for instance, that in locations where two sub-project cycles had been completed,
project outcomes tend to be more significant. For instance, in locations with two completed

Stakeholder workshop. On 8 May 2014, the PMO and the Bank invited key stakeholders to
a workshop in Cotabato City to comment on the initial findings of the project evaluation
presented in this ICR. The majority of the participants agreed that ASFP has brought major
benefits to ARMM and a similar project should be designed for implementation beyond 2014.
To improve the approach embedded in ASFP, it was deemed necessary to further
institutionalize CDD in ARMM, especially to strengthen the role of LGUs (see Annex 7 for a
summary of the stakeholder workshop). Another major point raised during the workshop was
the importance of the project in establishing ARMM as a credible implementing partner at a
time when it was dismissed by many as either being untrustworthy or lacking in capacity.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The “Risk to Development Outcome” is defined as the risk that the expected development
outcomes of the project—at the time of this assessment—will not be maintained or realized.
As mentioned in Section 1.2, the project was originally designed to: (i) provide and/or

                                              19
improve sustained access to social and economic infrastructure and services by the poor and
conflict-affected poor communities, (ii) provide capacity building for women, youth and
other community groups for improving food security, employment opportunities and
household incomes, (iii) strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and within
communities in the ARMM region, and (iv) improve local governance and institutional
capacities for implementation in the ARMM Region. For each of these intended outcomes,
the risk to development outcome was rated. Each rating reflected the likelihood that the
intended outcome would not be sustained, and the impact of an unfavorable change to the
outcome on the development outcome of the project as a whole.

                                            However, given challenges of local governance, long-term
                                            sustainability will still be challenging.
                                            There is limited evidence that ASFP has helped improve
                                            food security, employment opportunities or household
                                            incomes (see Annex 6) under the Learning, Livelihood and

                                            for the first time. Municipal LGUs gained significant
                                            capacity through the involvement of planning, engineering
                                            and social welfare personnel. Local counterpart
                                            contributions exceeded targets. However, there is little
                                            evidence to suggest that the participatory and transparent
                                            processes inherent in the ASFP have led to broader LGU

capacity building (which may no longer be available upon completion of the project), and
limited evidence that ASFP has contributed to reducing poverty. This risk was partially offset
by the fact that the project’s impacts on social cohesion and partnerships are significant and
largely irreversible, and the risk to the development outcome of this aspect was therefore
rated “moderate”. The risk that the other outcomes would not be maintained or realized was
rated “moderate” (see Table 2 for details). For these reasons, the risk to development outcome
of ASFP was also rated “moderate”.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The strengths of the original project design are:
   Strategic relevance. The CDD approach was suitable to address the needs of the conflict-
    affected area (promote social cohesion and partnerships, and promote socio-economic
    development), and was consistent with development plans of the GPH and the ARMM
    Government.
   Simplicity. Because conflict-affected areas require support that can be provided without
    major government or private sector capacity, and because few communities were
    familiar with CDD projects, the design was deliberately kept simple.
   Flexibility. The design enabled the project to respond flexibly to demands of
    communities and their LGUs (resulting in, for example, the upscaling of the literacy
    component and the introduction of the municipal block grant).
These strengths were partly offset by weaknesses in the project’s original results framework,
the most important of which are the following:
 Focus on measuring inputs and intermediate results. Most of the original performance
     indicators measured inputs and intermediate results as opposed to outcomes.
 No targets set for KPIs. The original results framework did not contain time-bound
     targets against which progress could be measured.
 Optimistic disbursement targets. The original project design underestimated the
     difficulties in starting a CDD project in an area with high governance and security risks.
Because of moderate shortcomings in the project’s results framework, the Bank’s perfor-
mance in ensuring quality at entry was rated “moderately satisfactory

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank mobilized a multi-disciplinary supervision team with considerable expertise in
project management, financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, rural
infrastructure and safeguards. Intensive supervision enabled the Bank to identify and
proactively address key issues adversely affecting achievement of the PDOs at an early stage,
notably problems with delays in consultant mobilization, facilitator recruitment, and
compliance with financial management procedures, procurement guidelines, and safeguards.

                                               21
In addition to regular implementation support missions, the Bank provided intensive hands-
on support to the PMO in a difficult operating environment. The Bank also introduced third
party spot-checking and geo-tagging as means of monitoring to overcome security concerns.
Because of these supervision efforts, performance in most of these areas improved over time
(as described in detail in the ISRs). However, in spite of intensive supervision, the project
continued to be affected by less than satisfactory performance of financial management,
project management, and monitoring and evaluation. These shortcomings partially negated
the otherwise excellent quality of supervision in an environment characterized by substantial
governance and security risks. Against this background, the quality of supervision was rated
“satisfactory”.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In light of the “moderately satisfactory” ratings of ensuring quality at entry and the
“satisfactory” rating of the quality of supervision, the Bank’s overall performance was rated
“moderately satisfactory.”

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government of the Philippines. The GPH took bold steps to further the peace process in
Mindanao during the life of the project, notably by signing the Comprehensive Agreement on
the Bangsamoro to create a new autonomous political entity to supersede ARMM. Because of
these and other actions taken by the GPH, the risk of major outbreaks of conflict in ARMM
was lower at the loan closing date than at the time of appraisal in 2002. This facilitated the
implementation of the project and was especially instrumental in developing social cohesion
and partnerships among communities. The government also deserves credit for taking the
decision to devolve control from the central to the ARMM Regional Government following
the early delays. In spite of concerns about the ARMM Government’s limited experience with
projects financed by development partners, the GPH remained committed to its “Mindanaon-
driven” development policies.
ARMM Government. During the Ampatuan administration (see Section 2.2), the project
operated under more difficult circumstances than in later years. The Maguindanao massacre
also caused delays in project implementation. Political uncertainties in the aftermath of the
massacre caused delayed project implementation, necessitating a one-year extension of the
AF. On the positive side, both during and after the Ampatuan administration, ASFP was
widely known as a clean project (signifying limited suspected misuse of funds) that was
subject to much less political interference than other ARMM Government projects. The PMO
delivered the project through output-based Project Implementation Agreements with the
regional Departments of Social Welfare & Development and Interior & Local Government.
These agreements stipulated deliverables to be produced by the departments, with payments
attached to concrete outputs. This approach was unique in ARMM and helped ensure
accountability for results in a region associated with weak governance.
The shortcomings of the political leadership of the ARMM Government for part of the
project adversely affected outcomes. However, in view of the substantial progress of the
                                              22
peace process and improved governance in ARMM after the Maguindanao massacre, the
performance of the Governments was, on balance, rated “moderately satisfactory”.
(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
From the outset, the implementing agency supported a bottom-up, community-driven
approach to poverty alleviation. It also supported continuous improvement of the M&E
system to maintain transparency of the outcomes of the project, took steps to modify
implementation arrangements where needed and responded to complaints or suspicions of
misuse of funds—which was especially commendable in view of the difficult working
environment. Most importantly, the Implementing Agency delivered almost 3,000 subprojects
in over 1,200 villages in a region facing challenges including but not limited to the following:
(i) a Project Manager was murdered; (ii) the Regional Governor was arrested for a massacre;
(iii) three of the five project provinces were beyond the reach of Bank implementation
support for most of the life of the project; (iv) two major spikes in conflict displaced
hundreds of thousands of people; and (v) elections were suspended in the region in 2010 and
an interim government appointed by the national government to clean up corruption. In spite
of the substantial achievements that were realized in this difficult working environment, there
were, however, several avoidable problems that stronger management may have been able to
correct. These include misuse of funds (which, as mentioned before, was limited but not
zero), late compliance with loan covenants, late submission of reports, and limited use of the
monitoring and evaluation system for strategic purposes. These shortcomings are minor, and
the performance of the implementing agency was subsequently rated “satisfactory”.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Because the Government’s performance was rated “moderately satisfactory” and the
performance of the implementing agency “satisfactory”, the overall performance of the
Borrower was rated “moderately satisfactory.”

6. Lessons Learned
   Regional governments are able to implement community-driven development programs.
    At the time of appraisal, there were widespread concerns about the ability of the ARMM
    Government to execute and implement a World Bank-financed CDD project. As
    described in Section 5.2, these concerns were misplaced. An obvious advantage of
    selecting a regional government as Executing Agency is that it has more knowledge
    about local communities than a central government. Local know-how is particularly
    valuable in a conflict-affected location where knowledge of the context and important
    local stakeholders is fundamental to project success. At the same time, a regional
    government will have limited experience with donor-driven projects (and CDD projects
    in general) and will therefore require substantial supervision and implementation support.
   CDD projects are an effective means to foster social cohesion and partnerships in
    conflict-affected areas, but are less effective in alleviating poverty. Field visits,
    supervision missions and reports from PMO consistently affirm that the CDD approach
    was effective in fostering partnerships at the local level, by bringing community
    members (who normally do not meet or do not want to meet) together to plan activities

                                              23
    that benefit the community as a whole. ASFP also demonstrated that CDD projects in
    conflict-affected areas do not necessarily reduce poverty more than in localities that
    were not covered by the project, presumably because an improvement of the security
    situation has a much more important impact on poverty reduction than investments in
    community-based infrastructure.
   CDD projects in conflict-affected areas are effective if their design is simple yet flexible.
    Communities in conflict-affected areas are often hostile to other communities and to
    governments. In such an environment, it is important that a CDD project is designed to
    respond to community needs (to lend credibility to the claim that the project is genuinely
    driven by communities instead of by government). ASFP offered communities an open
    menu of activities eligible for block grant financing, and introduced the LLFS program,
    in response to demands from communities. In addition, it is recommended to keep the
    design of a CDD project in a conflict-affected area as simple as possible, at least initially.
    This is because communities in conflict-affected areas are unlikely to be familiar with
    CDD concepts and not used to regular communication with other communities or
    government agencies. ASFP offered communities the same options of block grants
    (community-based infrastructure and LLFS) from 2003-2010, and only introduced a
    more complex scheme––municipal block grants––in a later stage.
   Set realistic targets that can be measured accurately. As described in Section 3, ASFP did
    not meet the targets of several of its outcome and intermediate results indicators. This is
    partly because some indicators could not be measured accurately (such as “proportion of
    households attributing improvement in their wellbeing to participation in collective
    community work” or “number of persons who gained employment as a result of
    subproject implementation”), or were overly ambitious (such as setting targets for IP
    participation that exceeded the IP population in the region).
   Facilitators require incentives to promote innovation. Over time, the community block
    grants tended to be allocated to a narrow range of subproject types (even though ASFP
    offered an open menu). This discourages innovation and potentially suppresses
    economic benefits. To encourage innovation, facilitators need to be given financial and
    organizational incentives to help communities consider a broader range of options
    beyond standard subproject types such as access roads and basic service facilities.
   CDD projects are highly appropriate to improve literacy. The literacy sub-component
    was one of the most successful and appreciated activities financed by ASFP in an area
    where literacy rates are relatively low, particularly among women.
   Spot checking and geo-tagging are effective means for Bank supervision in otherwise
    inaccessible areas. However, the basic geo-tagging module should be enhanced to
    include a small set of questions on the quality of implementation in addition to capturing
    data on physical outputs.
   Output-based Project Implementation Agreements help ensure accountability and foster
    an environment of responsibility. To be more effective, however, such agreements
    should not exclusively focus on quantitative output indicators but also measure quality.
All lessons have general applicability for similar operations in the Philippines and
comparable countries.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
The ARMM Government rates the process, outcome and implementation of the project as
“satisfactory”. More specifically, it considers ASFP a model for providing support to the
poor in post-conflict areas, using a demand-driven and community-based planning process.
The implementation of the project was deemed “satisfactory”, as it not only delivered much-
needed basic infrastructure and social support to conflict-affected areas, but also helped foster
social cohesion and partnerships. The implementing agency rates the performance of the
Bank as “satisfactory”, mainly because of project design (the CDD approach was deemed a
suitable instrument in a post-conflict situation), flexibility and general support to the
Implementing Agency, especially in matters concerning fund allocation and disbursement.
(b) Cofinanciers/Donors
Not applicable.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
On 8 May 2014, the PMO and the Bank organized a joint workshop to discuss the main
findings of the implementation of ASFP and identify lessons learned during the
implementation of the project. Refer to Annex 7 for a summary of the key issues raised
during this workshop.

This Annex summarizes the outputs of the project, based on a review of the achievements of
the outcome and intermediate results indicators mentioned in the PAD (see Table A3.3 for a
complete overview of targeted and achieved values for key performance indicators).
Component 1: Community Development Assistance
Overview. This component financed: (i) community based infrastructure (CBI); (ii)
municipal infrastructure; and (iii) learning, livelihood and food security (LLFS) programs.

Community-based infrastructure. The project financed 2,777 CBI subprojects at an
estimated cost of PhP 1.8 billion (US$41.8 million), or approximately 55% of the total
project cost. Of these, 1,659 were financed from the original loan, and 1,118 by the
Additional Financing. The average cost of a CBI subproject was about US$15,000. The
subprojects were implemented in 1,260 barangays, or 47 percent of all barangays in the
ARMM. About 80 percent of block grants for CBI was allocated to five subproject types: (i)
pre-and post-harvest facilities; (ii) school buildings/classrooms; (iii) multi-purpose centers,
(iv) roads, bridges and footpaths; and (v) water supply systems (Table A3.1). At the loan
closing date, 1,118 of 1,171 subprojects (or 95 % of the total) planned for implementation
during the Additional Financing were completed. The remaining 53 subprojects were either
cancelled (14), not started (1) or completed with government funds (38).

Municipal infrastructure. A pilot sub-component for municipal infrastructure in high
performing Municipal LGUs was included in Component 1 in 2009 to support greater
integration of CDD principles into local government systems and to promote performance-
based financing. Grants were provided to 24 municipalities, but five were cancelled because
of non-compliance with project requirements (3), lack of interest (1) and political instability
(1). At the loan closing date, 17 municipal infrastructure subprojects were completed. Two
more were delayed and completed with government funds. These subprojects were similar to

                                               28
CBI subprojects, but larger (average cost was about US$50,000) and planned and
implemented with the LGU. See Table A3.2 below for more details.

LLFS programs. This sub-component comprised three activities: (i) functional literacy and
numeracy training, (ii) training for income-generating activities, and (iii) activities aimed at
improving household food sufficiency. Each participating barangay received an allocation of
PhP300,000 (or about US$7,000) in support of these programs, which targeted marginalized
women and out-of-school youth. More specifically, the LLFS enabled these groups to gain
knowledge and skills that would help them develop their economic self-reliance, family
welfare, leadership, peace-building abilities and awareness of environmental protection.
Functional literacy and numeracy training reached an estimated 62,400 beneficiaries, with all
but 1 percent increasing their literacy level on a scale of 0-4 based on pre- and post-tests.

Component 2: Strategic Regional Infrastructure
This component financed the rehabilitation or construction of thirteen major infrastructure
subprojects, largely in accordance with priorities outlined in the ARMM Government
Regional Development Plan. The strategic regional infrastructure projects consisted of
facilities for health, education, human resources development, social services, and ports. The
average cost was about US$440,000. At the loan closing date, the passenger terminal of the
Polloc Port was no longer operational even though it remained in good condition (it was
closed in 2009 because passenger traffic to Polloc Port was discontinued due to security
concerns and lack of demand). The Regional Teacher’s Training College is being used but
not fully maximized, partly because its location was driven by political rather than strategic
considerations and also due to operations and maintenance problems. The remaining eleven
subprojects were fully functional. (As mentioned in Section 1.3, strategic regional
infrastructure was not included in the Additional Financing, because JICA committed to
continue financing the component from its own resources.)
Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Governance
This component did not finance outputs, but served as the support mechanism by providing
(i) information, education and communication (IEC) and advocacy, (ii) project management
and training support, and (iii) a grievance redress system. It also provided significant training


                                               29
and capacity-building on financial management, procurement, project management, and
development planning for the regional government and local government units in ARMM.

                          Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis
Introduction. Shortly after the loan closing date, the Bank estimated EIRRs of community-
based infrastructure (CBI) subprojects financed by ASFP. From January 2003 until May 2014,
ASFP financed almost 2,800 CBI subprojects at an estimated cost of US$46.9 million, or
62% of the total project cost. This Annex summarizes the estimates, which cover the EIRRs
of over 2,600 subprojects.19 It also presents qualitative data on the economic benefits of
other AFSP-funded subprojects. Because none of the subprojects were designed to cover their
full costs from incremental financial revenue, no financial analysis was undertaken.
Overall Assumptions for the EIRR Estimates of CBIs
(i)       Analysis only includes CBIs that comprise at least 5% of the Project’s total capital
          investment. In total, 95% of the 2,777 completed CBIs are used in the analysis.
          Excluded are Wharfs (3.6%) and Sanitation facilities (0.7%).
(ii)      NEDA uses a standard discount rate of 15% to assess the viability of infrastructure
          projects.20 This is the minimum rate by which the government sees investing in a
          specific project as more beneficial than foregoing other projects. However, to be
          consistent with assumptions used at baseline and set targets at project completion, for
          this economic analysis we apply a rate of 12%.
(iii)     For simplicity, full development of all CBIs is assumed at year 1, ie, full benefits start
          accruing to beneficiary households 1 year after capitalization at year 0 and continues
          throughout the assumed life of the sub-project.
(iv)      Utility of the subprojects assumes their expected lifetime. While there are findings
          from the 2009 Post-project Assessment that some CBIs were destroyed by armed
          conflict in some project areas and did not live out their maximum utility, there are no
          indications that these incidences were widespread.
(v)       SP capital investments include local counterpart funding. Estimates for EIRR and net
          present value include O&M and other administrative costs (i.e., M&E, staffing, and
          other operating costs), which were imputed at varying rates depending on the type of
          subproject.
(vi)      A fixed amount of P300,000 for administrative costs throughout the life of each SP is
          applied based on the average cost in the Project data. This includes the cost of social
          preparation, facilitation and advocacy, and project management.
Economic internal rate of return of CBI subprojects. The World Bank’s Handbook on
Economic Analysis of Investment Operations requires the real economic rate of return (EIRR)
of Bank-financed projects to be equal or higher than the opportunity cost of capital of the
country (which the Bank estimates at 12% per annum for developing country members,
including the Philippines). The Bank estimated EIRRs for subproject types that accounted for
at least 5% of all CBI subprojects. These were: (i) pre-and post-harvest facilities (PPHFs); (ii)
school buildings and classrooms; (iii) roads; (iv) multi-purpose centers; (v) water supply
systems; (vi) health stations; and (vii) day care centers. Taken together, the project financed
2,627 subprojects in these categories, accounting for 95% of ASFP-financed CBI subprojects

(Table A4.1). The average weighted EIRR of these subprojects was about 14.5%, higher than
the Bank’s minimum required rate of 12%, and also higher than the target set for the project
itself (14%). EIRRs per subproject type are as follows: multi-purpose centers (18.2%), health
stations (17.6%) and water systems (16.3%). Taken together, subprojects of these three types
account for over 65% of the economic net present value (ENPV) of the subprojects for which
the exercise was undertaken. School buildings and class rooms were the only type of
community-based infrastructure for which the average EIRR did not exceed the 12% hurdle,
primarily because they are relatively costly to maintain and yet unable to increase enrolment
significantly.
The estimation of EIRRs was based on realistic and conservative assumptions, verified with
observations from other CDD projects in Mindanao. The analysis also recognized that the
economic benefit of some CBI subprojects was affected by armed conflict. However, a post-
project assessment of 2009 and spot-checking by independent third parties found that the
(partial or full) destruction of CBI subprojects was not widespread.

Cost effectiveness analysis of CBI subprojects. To assess the cost-effectiveness of CBI
subprojects financed by ASFP, the average cost of these subprojects was compared to the
average cost of similar subprojects financed by KALAHI-CIDSS, its sister project at the
national level. This comparison was made for four types of CBI subprojects: (i) school
buildings, (ii) roads, (iii) water supply systems, and (iv) health stations. The results of the
analysis are as follows:
   The average cost of all four subproject types was lower for ASFP than KALAHI-CIDSS,
    especially for roads and water supply systems (Table A4.2). This is an important finding,
    given that the overall project costs for KALAHI-CIDSS are lower than similar projects
    contracted out by line agencies.
   The average cost per beneficiary household is higher for ASFP for school buildings
    (339% of the average for KALAHI-CIDSS) and health stations (105%). A possible
    explanation for the discrepancy is that the ASPF project area has a lower population
    density and contains more geographically isolated villages than the rest of the
    Philippines (i.e., the KALAHI-CIDSS project area).
It should be noted that the above comparisons are only valid if the average quality of the
subprojects financed by both projects are similar. It is also worth noting that overheads,
expressed as a percentage of the total project cost, are relatively high for both ASFP (37%)

                                                33
and KALAHI-CIDSS (36%) compared to other Bank-financed CDD projects (11-18% for
projects in Liberia and Sri Lanka).

Economic benefits of other ASFP-funded subprojects. In addition to CBI subprojects,
AFSP also financed municipal infrastructure; learning, livelihood and food sufficiency
(LLFS) programs; strategic regional infrastructure; and institutional strengthening and
governance. For municipal infrastructure, indicative EIRRs were estimated. No recent
quantitative analysis was undertaken for any of the other investments. The economic benefits
can be summarized as follows:
      Municipal infrastructure. The project financed 19 municipal infrastructure subprojects,
       16 of which were one of the seven infrastructure types listed in Table A4.1. Because the
       municipal infrastructure subprojects were very similar in nature (albeit not in scale) to
       the CBI infrastructure, it was assumed that the same EIRRs would apply to each of the
       seven types identified above. Based on this assumption, the weighted average EIRR of
       the 16 municipal infrastructure subprojects was estimated at 13.8%.
      LLFS programs. The literacy component of this program exceeded targets and was
       considered one of the more successful components of ASFP. Pre- and post-test results
       demonstrated increased reading and writing skills for virtually all beneficiaries.
       According to a recently completed survey, the livelihood and food security sub-program
       was far less successful (less than one-third of community members who started training
       on improved food security completed the training, against 90% for literacy, and 80% for
       livelihood).21 Because the vast majority of the funds invested in LLFS programs were
       allocated to improving literacy, it was assumed that the economic benefits of the
       program exceeded its economic costs.
      Strategic regional infrastructure. The project completion report for the original loan,
       which was prepared in 2010, estimated EIRRs for three strategic regional infrastructure
       subprojects as ranging between 14.7 – 22.1 percent. At the loan closing date, eleven of
       13 strategic infrastructure subprojects financed by the proceeds of the original loan were
       fully functional, and were deemed to generate intended economic benefits. This
       includes the rehabilitation of five hospitals. The Blah T. Sinsuat District Hospital
       subproject was estimated to deliver a 22.1% EIRR, so it can be extrapolated that the
       other hospital rehabilitation subprojects could also deliver similar benefits. Of the other

    two subprojects the passenger terminal of the Polloc Port is closed as the Port does not
    currently receive passenger traffic. The Regional Teacher’s Training College is
    functioning at 50 percent capacity because it was constructed in a location of limited
    strategic relevance and has maintenance problems. These two subprojects, therefore, are
    currently generating no or fewer economic benefits than anticipated. Because the
    investments in strategic regional infrastructure accounted for less than 8% of the total
    project and the remaining eleven subprojects are expected to be delivering intended
    benefits, the shortcomings in two of them did not have a significant adverse impact on
    the project’s overall EIRR.
   Institutional strengthening and governance. Investment in this component did not
    generate direct economic benefits, but supported the implementation of Community
    Development Assistance (CBI, municipal infrastructure, and the LLFS program) and
    Strategic Regional Infrastructure. The total cost of this component was US$9.5 million,
    or about 12% of the total project cost.
Weighing the total cost of the CBI subprojects, municipal infrastructure and strategic regional
infrastructure, the total project EIRR is 14.47%.

                         Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results

This Annex includes the summary of beneficiary surveys undertaken after the original loan
phase in 2009 and then covering the Additional Financing phase from 2010-2014. Both
assessments included before-after/treatment-control samples. The 2014 Additional Financing
assessment covered all five provinces, with targeting using Propensity Score Matching. The
2009 original loan assessment covered Lanao del Sur and Sulu provinces.

Part 1: 2009 Impact Assessment

Four years after a baseline survey in late 2004-early 2005, a follow up survey was conducted
in selected ARMM Social Fund Project locations to evaluate the impact of the project against
the project development objectives, namely:

   1. Provide and/or improve sustained access to social and economic infrastructure and
      services by the poor and conflict-affected poor communities;
   2. Provide capacity-building activities for women, youth and other community groups
      for improving food security, employment opportunities and household incomes;
   3. Strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and within communities in the
      ARMM region; and
   4. Improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the
      ARMM region, with focus on improved transparency and accountability in the
      allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities,
      local government units and ARMM Regional Government.

This Annex provides a summary of the main outcomes of the Impact Evaluation against each
objective. The findings are based on a quantitative survey plus focus group discussions and
key informant interviews in six treatment and six control barangay in Lanao del Sur and Sulu
provinces. In reading this summary, data limitations should be kept in mind. In some cases,
significant improvements are evident in both treatment and control areas, suggesting
contamination of non-project areas either by ASFP investments and/or by other government
or donors projects. The absence of information on contamination complicates the drawing of
firm conclusions in some cases, but the data presented here remains of interest nonetheless.

Project Process

The Impact Evaluation demonstrated that the ARMM Social Fund Project (ASFP) followed a
strong community-driven development process. Government officials in the areas stated that
ASFP was the first and largest initiative in the area to employ participatory processes and
was considered something of a breakthrough project.

The quality of community participation was reported as very inclusive in each project stage –
initial project identification, formation of people’s organizations (POs), development of a
community investment plan, making of a formal proposal, project approval and then
implementation. Communities abided by the 60 percent minimum participation requirement,
including representation from all sectors (women, youth, religious minorities and indigenous
peoples). The high level of public awareness of ASFP (95 % in Lanao del Sur, for instance),
is indicative of the quality of public participation in project planning and implementation.


                                             39
Instances of elite capture, whereby local officials overlooked community preferences or took
control of project assets, were documented, but these were rare. Equally, cases where
communities directly defied the wishes of their Barangay Captain were identified, indicating
that facilitation was strong and computer empowerment gains were made in some locations.

PDO 1: Provide and/or improve sustained access to social and economic services by the
poor as well as conflict-affected communities; and PDO 2: Provide capacity-building
activities for women, youth and other community groups for improving food security,
employment opportunities and household incomes

These two PDOs are combined, as they both relate to economic/ income-related outcomes.
Multiple indicators were used to measure these PDOs, including: (i) a Human Welfare Index
to measure impacts on poverty; (ii) Food Security and Sustainable Development; (iii)
Vulnerability; (iv) Access to Social and Economic Services; and (v) Perceptions About
Quality of Life.

Human Welfare Index (HWI) 22: Created to measure the impact of the project on poverty, the
HWI showed no overall change between treatment and control areas before and after the
project. However, the overall figure obscures regional differences. As the table below
indicates, positive impacts in Lanao del Sur were offset by negative outcomes in the more
conflict-prone Sulu province. In Lanao del Sur, 38.9% of villages in treatment areas were in
the lower tercile of villages in the province before the project, compared to 27.4% in control
areas. By the end of the project, the number of control areas in the lower tercile for human
welfare had increased to 35.8%, whereas in treatment areas, the figure had declined to 30.5%.

Vulnerability: The project mostly made a positive contribution to the reduction of
vulnerability. Performance was significantly better in Lanao del Sur than in Sulu, where
levels of violent conflict were higher and more damaging. Impressively, ASFP succeeded in

  Variables in the index are: total number of household members; number of members
15-64 years old; number of female household members; education of household head;

ownership of cell phone’ ownership of bicycle; expenses for clothing, footwear and other
wear.

 bringing about a decline in the proportion of households that had experienced reduction in
 food consumption during the past twelve months (17.9% in Lanao del Sur and 7.6% in Sulu).
 This suggests either an increase in income and/or better access to food.

 Minor positive impacts were seen in terms of the proportion of people who sold or mortgaged
 land in the previous twelve months (7.4% in Lanao and 1.0% in Sulu).23 The project brought
 about a 24.1% decline in the proportion of households that had to borrow money from friends
 in the previous 12 months in Lanao del Sur, though there was a negative impact of 14% in
 Sulu.

 Access to services: Impacts on access to services were marginal, with travel time to health
 facilities declining by 6.1 minutes in Lanao del Sur and 4.2 minutes in Sulu. For schools
 there was no significant impact either way. However, it possible that the impacts were
 actually larger than recorded due to contamination of control areas. It was reported that
 ASFP-funded health centers were utilized by residents in project and non-project barangay,
 so reductions in travel times in both locations could potentially be attributable to the project.

 With respect to water supply, in Lanao del Sur a 13.6% increase in access to household water
 connections was recorded in project areas, however, a larger increase was also recorded in
 control areas (15.8%). This reflects the existence of local government funded water projects
 in non-ASFP locations. No impacts were evident in Sulu, where the water facility
 constructed was destroyed and looted after conflict broke out in 2006.

 Perception of quality of life: the impact of the ASFP on people’s perception of the quality of
 their life was not significant. Lanao del Sur recorded a 1 percent and Sulu a 3.5 percent
 increase in the number of respondents reporting that the quality of their life was good. On
 one hand, this reflects the limited movement in the Human Welfare Index over the course of
 the project. On the other hand, however, it fails to reflect the recorded improvements in
 vulnerability. This might suggest that the poor need an extended period without vulnerability
 before they gain confidence to make the kind of longer-term investments that will support
 better living conditions.

Although little improvement in the perception of the quality of life was evident, it seems that
the project benefits did give respondents cause for optimism for the future. In control areas
in Lanao del Sur, the proportion of respondents reporting a big chance of improving their
lives declined by 4.8 percent, compared to an increase of 6.3 percent in treatment areas, for a
total impact of 11.1 percent. A positive impact of 8.9 percent was recorded in Sulu. With
regard to the chances of their children to improve their present situation, similar positive
impacts of 7.3 percent in Lanao and 4.9 percent in Sulu were recorded.

PDO 3: Strengthen social cohesion and partnerships between and within communities
in the ARMM region

The project evaluates impact on community cohesion and social capital against three main
measures: (i) membership in organizations; (iii) participation in collective action; and (iii)
trust. It also assesses impact on violence and conflict.

Membership in organizations: minor increases were seen in terms of membership in
organizations, perhaps reflecting that ASFP formed some POs for the purposes of project
implementation. Membership of community groups increased by 8.4% in treatment areas
compared to control in Lanao del Sur, though it should be mentioned that membership
actually declined in both locations. In Sulu a positive impact of 1.6% was observed, though
this cannot be considered significant.

Although the impact of the project on this aspect of social capital is not major, interesting
results emerged with respect to the role of women. In Sulu, women’s representation in local
organizations increased from 36.7% to 53.5%. In Lanao del Sur, although the total
representation of women declined, there was a shift in the position of women from mostly
ordinary members to almost 50% serving as officials with decision-making roles.

Participation in collective work increased significantly in both treatment and control areas,
with a 6.2% higher increase in control areas in Lanao del Sur, but a 5.5% higher participation
rate in treatment areas in Sulu. The major increases in control areas suggests that the project
itself had limited or no impact. However, the qualitative research indicated that non-ASFP

                                                           42
   areas were aware that people’s organizations were necessary to secure project resources. So,
   while quantitative impact was not significant or in fact negative, it is possible that ASFP had
   spillover effects into control areas in this case. It is also possible that time spent working on
   ASFP construction actually took away from other collective action. The time that poor
   villagers have to dedicate to communal work and communal contributions is finite, so ASFP
   contributions of time may well have come at the expense of other routine community
   activities.

   negotiation between community members over development needs, it was hoped that ASFP
   would enhance trust both between and within communities. ASFP showed small positive
   impacts with respect to trust within communities, with a 9.5% better outcome in treatment
   compared to control areas in Lanao del Sur (albeit with a reduction in trust in both locations)
   and a 3% increase in Sulu. No data was collected on trust between communities, however,
   little change could be anticipated as ASFP activities are barangay-based and do not cross
   boundaries or encourage trans-communal cooperation.

   Violence & Conflict: ASFP targets a reduction in violence and conflict through two major
   means. Firstly, it attempts to address an underlying cause of conflict by improving living
   conditions. Secondly, the project provides forums for communities to negotiate peacefully
   over a neutral issue – development needs – and work together to fulfill a common good. It is


                                                                          43
expected that this can help to build stronger communal relations, enhance social capital and
reduce violence.

Results against this indicator are mixed. Data collected on the nature of disputes showed that
some increased in occurrence in Lanao del Sur but decreased in Sulu (property disputes).
Whereas communal disputes (rido) increased in Sulu but decreased in Lanao del Sur. No
data was gathered on the intensity, damage or level of violence related to these disputes, so it
is difficult to draw general conclusions as to whether conflict incidence and intensity
increased or declined.

A proxy measure for this is whether respondents feel safe from crime and violence. As
evident in Table 6 below, results are again mixed. A significant positive impact of 11.9%
was recorded in Sulu, but respondents in Lanao del Sur suffered a 5.3 % decline in feelings
of safety. This indicates that in a region characterized by major conflict, there are limits as to
what a CDD project can achieve. This outcome is consistent with most literature on the topic,
that suggests that CDD projects can help reduce development-related conflicts, but are
unlikely to enhance capacity to reduce other forms of conflict in the absence of specific
interventions targeted at that purpose.

PDO 4: Improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the
ARMM region, with focus on improved transparency and accountability in the
allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities, local
government units and ARMM Regional Government.

Indicators to measure improvements in local governance were as follows: (i) knowledge
about Barangay Assemblies; (ii) awareness of Barangay Development Councils; (iii)
knowledge of barangay income and expenses; and (iv) a series of perception indicators about
the local government’s capacity to deliver better public services and reduce poverty.

In summary, the project made significant gains in terms of building local government
capacity to deliver projects in a transparent and accountable manner. Participatory processes
were followed, with strong results on the ground. The decision to shift responsibility for
implementation to ARMM government officials in 2006 means that benefits of institutional
capacity building will stay with the government. Both government officials and communities
interviewed for the Impact Evaluation felt confident they could repeat the ASFP approach for
future projects.

                                               44
However, governance benefits remain somewhat trapped in the “project bubble”. The lack of
fiscal space available at the barangay or municipal level prevents LGUs or communities from
replicating the ASFP processes. Consequently, communities see little improvement in
governance practices.

Awareness of Barangay Assemblies: starting from a very low base of 17.9% in control areas
and 9.5 % in treatment areas in Lanao del Sur, awareness increased significantly to 54.7%
and 56.8% respectively, a 6.9% positive impact for the project. In Sulu awareness declined
by 3.9% in treatment compared to control locations, although overall awareness increased in
both areas. The significant increases in awareness in control areas suggests that factors
outside ASFP were responsible, such as the Mayor making a strong push to enhance
Barangay Assemblies, or perhaps other projects also mandating barangay assemblies like
ASFP. An alternative explanation is that ASFP might have generated spillover effects, with
neighboring villages energizing Barangay Assemblies in the hope of attracting ASFP
resources. Either way, the increased engagement of communities in LGU affairs at the
barangay level could help to enhance transparency and accountability in the long-term.

Knowledge about functioning Barangay Development Council (BDC): BDCs were little
known or completely non-functional in both survey locations at the time of the baseline, with
no respondents reporting awareness, other than 1% in control areas in Sulu. Not much had
changed in Lanao del Sur by the end of the project, with awareness increasing to 8.4% in
control areas and 7.0% in treatment areas, a negative impact for ASFP. This suggests factors
beyond the project were responsible for the increase and that ASFP did not energize the
BDCs. This is not a surprise given that BDCs had no official role in the project. However,
awareness rose to 18.9% and 26.9% in control and treatment areas respectively in Sulu, an
8% impact for the project. The significant increase in control areas suggests contamination
by initiatives other than ASFP.

Knowledge of barangay income and expenditures: table 7 below demonstrates how the
transparency requirements of ASFP have not translated across to governance in general.
Impact against this indicator was negligible or negative, with few villagers being aware of the
content of the barangay budget either before or after ASFP.

Perception of local government performance: despite the strong community support for the
ASFP participatory process and the benefits derived from ASFP investments, project
implementation did not correlate with improved community perceptions of local government.
Table 8 below demonstrates a negative impact on perceptions of the ability of LGUs to tackle
poverty.

Sustainability

Although it is premature to fully assess the sustainability of the project, there were examples
of local action to ensure sustainability of the physical project investments. In barangay in
Lanao del Sur, users of the warehouse and solar dryer are charged ten centavos per kilogram
of any commodity stored, with the barangay captain collecting the fees. A similar scheme is
in operation in Sulu, where the People’s Organization collects the fees for submission to the
LGU. In Lanao del Sur, the water system is supported financially by the LGU.

In governance terms, skills and knowledge acquired by government officials, POs and
communities on how to conduct participatory development processes will stay with them.


                                                                            46
However, in the absence of additional external financing, the limited fiscal space available at
the LGU level militates against the prospects of replication.

The minimal impact of the project in terms of governance and social cohesion suggests that
more concerted efforts are required to achieve project aims in these fields.
Institutionalization of the ASFP CDD approach would require regulatory change to make it
part of the standard planning process. Efforts to energize BDCs and Barangay Assemblies
would need to be more explicit. Specific conflict mitigation activities could be integrated
into future project activities to support the broader aim of enhancing the enabling
environment for development by reducing violence.

Conclusions

In summary, the ARMM Social Fund Project has had mixed outcomes. Through a strong
participatory process, it has delivered clear benefits for local merchants and traders and those
directly utilizing other investments such as warehouses, solar dryers, schools, health centers
and water supply systems. Positive economic impacts that significantly reduced vulnerability
occurred in Lanao del Sur, reflected in a rise in the overall Human Welfare Index.

In the case of Sulu, however, the volatile law and order condition appears to have offset the
project benefits, with minimal welfare impacts evident.

Some improvement was seen in terms of both governance and social cohesion. Public
participation in the project seemed to spark interest in greater community engagement with
local governance through Barangay Assemblies. Membership in local organizations
increased, with women in particular taking on more decision-making roles. However, at this
stage at least, these positive outcomes have not yet evidently improved local government
performance – the project benefits of participation, transparency and accountability remain
trapped in the project bubble. Consequently, the project has not yet generated increased
public belief that LGUs are delivering for them on poverty and public service outcomes.
Regulatory changes and stronger efforts to institutionalize participation could assist.

With respect to social cohesion, trust within communities increased, providing a stronger
basis for future collective action. However, in a region that continues to be affected by
multiple inter-related forms of violence that emanate from beyond the community realm, this
has not translated into feelings of increased safety and security. More intensive and explicit
action beyond CDD projects is recommended to tackle conflict.

Part 2: 2014 Impact Assessment
Introduction. Shortly before the loan closing date, PMO recruited a firm (“the PMO
Consultant”) to assess the impact of ASFP. The purpose of the assessment was to measure
the achievement of the outcome indicators which were not measured by the MIS or other
methods and assess to what extent the achievements met the targets set for the project’s loan
closing date. The five main indicators assessed were:
   percentage of households reporting reduced travel time and cost of access to communal
    basic services,



                                              47
   percentage of households reporting reduced cost of access to local agricultural
    production facilities,
   proportion of people confident in their ability to influence decisions on identifying local
    development priorities,
   increase in household consumption, and
   beneficiaries that feel project investments reflected their needs.
All indicators are outcome indicators except “beneficiaries that feel project investments
reflected their needs”, which is an intermediate results indicator. The first three indicators are
explicitly mentioned in the Loan Agreement to the Additional Financing. The fourth was
introduced in a 2013 restructuring and the fifth is a Core Sector Indicator that was included in
line with Bank procedures at the time.
To measure the impact of the project on the dimensions to be measured by the indicators, the
PMO Consultant tracked and interviewed 1,244 persons in 48 locations that were covered by
the project (“the treatment group”) and 1,030 persons in 40 locations that did not participate
in the project (“the control group”). The treatment and control locations were identified
utilizing Propensity Score Matching. The remainder of this Annex firstly describes the
findings of the PMO consultant for each of the five indicators. It then presents a summary of
the full beneficiary survey results.
Percentage of households reporting reduced travel time and cost of access to communal
basic services. Four types of communal basic services were considered: (i) educational
facilities, (ii) health facilities, (iii) markets, and (iv) water supply systems. A significant
portion of the respondents in the treatment group reported “good” or “very good” access to
these facilities, and access levels increased over time (by 7% to 14% from 2012 to 2014,
depending on the service). In all four areas, improvements in treatment areas exceeded
improvements in control areas; however, the results were not statistically significant (Table
A6.1). This means that despite changes in project areas being in the right direction and
exceeding those in control areas, there is not enough statistical evidence at this point to
attribute such changes to the project alone. Given the open menu nature of the project,
different types of communal service were introduced in different treatment locations, which
effectively dilutes the benefits of a specific service when measured across all treatment
locations. Major contamination of both treatment and control sites was evident during the
project implementation, as the government massively increased expenditure on community
development during the 2011-2014 period as part of its support for the peace process.
Percentage of households reporting reduced cost of access to local agricultural
production facilities. In 2012, about 40% of households in both the treatment group and
control group had access to local agricultural facilities (such as solar dryers, warehouses and
coconut grillers). In 2014, access in the treatment group was approximately 20% higher
compared to control areas. The difference was statistically significant.

* Double difference (calculated as [T2014 – T2012] - [C2014 – C2012]). None of the observed double differences
  was statistically significant at the 10% level, except piped water supply.

Proportion of people confident in their ability to influence decisions on identifying local
development priorities. From 2012 to 2014, confidence levels remained virtually unchanged
both in the treatment group and the control group. Moreover, confidence levels in the
treatment group were not different, in a statistically significant sense, from the control group.
This suggests that, during 2012-2014, the project did not have a measureable impact on the
confidence of persons living in project locations in their ability to influence decisions on
identifying local development priorities.
Increase in household consumption. Despite improving access to agricultural facilities and
markets, the impact evaluation did not detect a positive relationship between participation in
ASFP and an increase in household consumption. In fact, the opposite correlation was
observed, albeit not to a statistically significant level. During 2012-2014, household
consumption (as measured by monthly per capita expenditures) actually decreased in the
treatment group, while it increased in the control group. The difference, however, was not
statistically significant. The absence of a statistically significant impact of participation in the
project and increase in household consumption may be explained by:
    The relatively high number of barangays from Maguindanao Province in the treatment
     group. During 2012-2014, this province experienced more droughts and irregular rainfall
     than most barangays in the control group, and these conditions may have offset a
     project-induced increase in household incomes.
    The relatively small size of the project. During 2003-2014, ASFP invested about US$76
     million in an area with a population of over 1 million people. This is equivalent to an
     investment of US$10 per person per year. It is conceivable that other factors, such
     improved macroeconomic stability and an overall improvement of the security situation
     in both the treatment group and the control group have drowned out the statistical
     significance of the project’s impact on household consumption rates.

    The timing of the assessment. When the endline survey was undertaken, project
     implementation was still ongoing in 14 sites and was only just completed in another
     twenty. This means it is very likely that the assessment understates project benefits.
Beneficiaries that feel project investments reflected their needs. About 86% of
beneficiaries feel that project investments reflect their needs. These perceptions were checked
against the respondent’s ability to correctly identify the type of subproject implemented in a
barangay and are, thus, subproject specific.

                                                     49
Summary of beneficiary survey results. The impact evaluation provides strong evidence
that the project has significantly improved access to local agricultural production facilities
and piped water supply, and indicated that the vast majority of project beneficiaries feels that
project investments reflect their needs. The impact evaluation did not provide sufficient
statistical evidence that access to communal basic services had improved because of the
project alone. The assessment showed no effect on household consumption or confidence of
people in their ability of influence local development priorities. It should be noted, however,
that the impact evaluation was limited to a two-year period (2012-2014), and the impact of
the project such ASFP on household consumption or local politics may require more time to
materialize. It is also worth noting that the statistical analysis of the project’s intended
impacts was deemed of high quality and deserves to be replicated in other Bank-financed
CDD projects.

               Annex 7. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Overview. On 8 May 2014, the PMO and the World Bank organized a joint workshop to
discuss the main findings of the implementation of ASFP and identify lessons learned. The
workshop was attended by key staff of the PMO and DSWD-ARMM, members of the World
Bank supervision team, representatives of LGUs, barangays, PO members, and facilitators.
The main findings of the implementation of ASFP are described in the main text of this
report, and in Annex 7 (which contains a summary of the Borrower’s project completion
report). The lessons learned by the World Bank and the implementing agency can be
summarized as follows:

Lessons learned presented by PMO.
      Proper Identification of Target Communities and Beneficiaries. The adoption of
       project selection criteria ensured that target communities were properly identified as
       those truly needing assistance, rather than being determined by political
       considerations.
      Equal Allocation and Proper Utilization of Resources. With clear targets, the CDA
       process ensured that the budget was properly allocated to needy communities and
       their priority development agenda. In this process, the utilization of meager resources
       at the community level was maximized to ensure optimum benefits. The capacity
       building training provided to the Peoples Organizations enable them to handle funds
       properly.
      Promotion of Multi-Stakeholder Cooperation and Community Decision-Making.
       The participatory and inclusive CDA processes encouraged local stakeholders to see
       the value of coordination between and among CDA stakeholders. Barangay and
       Municipal LGUs provided cash and non-cash contributions and support to the CDA
       subprojects while community members provided labor counterpart. In most cases,
       local counterpart exceeded the 15 percent requirement of the project.
      Enhancement of Leadership skills. Community empowerment enhanced leadership
       through capacity-building interventions and involvement in subproject
       implementation.
      Political Interference of Local Officials. In some areas, local officials took the lead
       in subproject implementation, controlling activities to the detriment of the community.
      Alleged manipulation of some barangay officials and project staff in the
       identification of priority subprojects. Instead of going through the process in
       identification of priority subprojects, they shortcut the process because they already
       have pre-identified subprojects.
      Subproject appraisal were done for compliance only. Project staff (engineers) did
       not always conduct subproject appraisal comprehensively and seriously. Thus, a
       number of variations between what was planned and what was built were evident.
      Recognition of women improved their self-confidence, self-worth, access to basic
       services and participation in community activities.
      Involvement of the PO in subproject implementation is very strong.



                                             51
      PO’s experience of managing and implementing community identified subprojects
       has provided a foundation to build relationships among its members and some BLGU
       officials
      The installation of the Municipal Multi Stakeholders Committee (MMSC) was
       instrumental in facilitating the approval of priority barangays and subprojects
       because decision-making was closer to the barangay level.
      In subproject identification, the consultative and participatory process in the social
       preparation stage generally ensured that small infrastructure projects address
       community needs. However, identification of subprojects needs to be strengthened so
       that underutilized subprojects are avoided.
      Technical assistance to support POs to craft solid operations and management plans
       could also improve the usage and sustainability of subprojects. However, POs only
       often look out for maintenance of facilities, rather than systematizing operations or
       making their endeavors profitable.
      Recommendations:
       - Local officials should also be involved in the social preparation but they should
         not take the lead and dominate in the process.
       - The step-by-step process should be followed in the identification of priority
         subprojects. The process undertaken should always be documented.
       - The project staff should always conduct subproject appraisal comprehensively and
         seriously to avoid variations. The procedure how the appraisal is done should be
         documented and be reviewed by responsible project staff before implementation
         starts.

Lessons learned presented by World Bank (initial findings). A “+” sign indicates a
positive lesson, whereas “-“ indicates a negative lesson.
Lessons about project design:
+      Project objective highly relevant to ARMM, GPH and World Bank
+      CDD appropriate means to empower citizens and promote social cohesion and
       partnerships
+      Project design relatively simple
+      Strategy to move from project-hired staff to organic staff in PMO and DSWD-
       ARMM
+      Inclusion of LLFS (addressed clear need and increased community involvement)
-      Heavy reliance on impact evaluations for M&E
-      Project initially managed from Manila
-      Late inclusion of Grievance Redress System

Lessons about implementation in general:
+      Demonstration effect: ARMM government capable of implementing projects
+      Project widely seen as clean in a region where misuse of funds remains common
+      Mobilization of co-financing (JICA, AusAID, counterpart funding by LGUs)
-      Political and security challenges
-      Misuse of funds was low but not zero

                                             52
Lessons about implementation of Component 1:
+      CDD approach appears to have promoted social cohesion and partnerships
+      General agreement between priorities identified in household surveys and community
       assemblies
+      Generally fair selection process of PO members
+      Subprojects addressed community needs
+      Increased access to basic services
+      Empowerment through LLFS (especially literacy)
-      Limited innovation (open menu in theory, closed menu in practice)
-      Incomplete information about items eligible for block grants
-      Incomplete compliance with FM guidelines, resulting in delays in subproject
       completion
-      Subproject selection partly based on political considerations

Lessons about implementation of Component 2:
+      Most subprojects addressed strategic needs of ARMM
+      Clear link with regional development plans
-      Delays in subproject implementation; 4 of 13 on time or ahead of schedule

Lessons about implementation of Component 3:
+      Training generally well-received
+      Institutional strengthening of DSWD-ARMM, DILG-ARMM and PMO
+      Cadre of experienced facilitators and technical staff developed
+      Planning skills developed in LGUs and barangays through involvement of DILG
+      High levels of awareness (strong brand!)
-      Training did not always provide PO members with skills needed to comply with
       requirements (especially in financial management)
-      Limited time for training (interest in more staggered training)
-      Limited interest from LGUs in municipal infrastructure
-      Avoidable delays in implementation of municipal infrastructure subprojects
       (counterpart fund contributions)
-      Less involvement of communities in municipal infrastructure than in CBI subprojects

Lessons about monitoring and evaluation:
+      Timely submission of reports
+      Timely and accurate information available on subproject implementation
-      Limited M&E of technical quality and social preparation activities
-      Limited effectiveness of GRS in localities where needed most
-      M&E information not used strategically
-      Infrequent spot checks

       Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR

(a) Summary of Borrower’s Completion Report
In September 2014, the Implementing Agency submitted a 50-page Project Completion
Report (PCR) to the Bank. The Borrower’s PCR covered the part of the project that was
funded by the Additional Financing, although it also refers to achievements during the
implementation period of the original project. The report rated the performance of the Bank
“satisfactory”, primarily because of the project design (the CDD approach was deemed a
suitable instrument in a post-conflict situation), flexibility and general support to the
Implementing Agency, especially in matters concerning fund allocation and disbursement.
The PCR rated the Borrower’s own performance as “moderately satisfactory”, but did not
mention shortcomings to justify the adjective “moderately”. Section III of the PCR
summarizes the conclusions and recommendations of the Borrower with respect to ASFP.
This section is copied below.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A.      Conclusion

The loan closing date of Additional Financing of ARMM Social Fund Project was originally
scheduled on May 31, 2013 but it was extended to one year, upon approval by the World Bank,
to complete the remaining activities and other deliverables of the Project. However, at the final
close of the loan on May 31, 2014, there were still a number of deliverables left unaccomplished,
i.e., 128 CBI subprojects not yet completed and one not started; and six MBG-MI subprojects
not yet completed.

Although a grace period of four months (June-September 2014) was granted by the World Bank
for the Project to wind-up and accomplish other unfinished deliverables, as of September 30,
2014 there were still 38 CBI subprojects not yet completed and one not started; and two MBG-
MI subprojects not yet completed.

The annual financial targets were not met due to some factors beyond the control of the Project,
as follows: (a) The Loan Agreement was signed and became effective in 2010 but there was no
budget approved for the Project; (b) Special Account was not also available in 2010. It was
released by the Bank in 2011; and, (c) Slow delivery of expected outputs for CDA component
under the Program Implementation Agreements with the Department of Social Welfare and
Development-ARMM. This became evident beginning 2013 when DSWD-ARMM started to
be primarily engaged with other programs, thus, their attention, time and efforts had been
divided.

The cancellation of MBG-MI subprojects for five (5) MLGUs was triggered by the following
factors, viz: (a) political instability and security; (b) non-compliance of the requirements; and (c)
non-interest of the Local Chief Executive. Thus, out of the twenty-four (24) recipient MLGUs,
only nineteen (19) implemented their respective subprojects.




                                                 54
B.     Lessons Learned

LGU Support and Participation. The support of local government units is assured even in a
region marred by challenges on governance. The active involvement of LGU in project
activities and willingness to provide counterpart contributions (cash or in kind) in every
project are manifestation of approval inasmuch as the prospective beneficiaries are their
respective constituents.

Skills Transfer to People’s Organizations (POs). The ability to absorb new technology is
not as easy as what we thought to be. Much more that we deal with farmers and other
community folks who are less educated or have not gone to school, either. But the
significance of every step in project implementation pushed the PO members to acquire the
knowledge and learn the skills. The process seemed tedious that some LGU find it
challenging. But with the CDA experience wherein communities are directly involved, the
process was properly internalized and instilled in their minds as they go along with other
development initiatives.

Diligence and Commitment to Ensure Output. These attitudes towards work should go
hand-in-hand if we want to produce results. An individual can be very diligent in work but
not committed to see his outputs at the end of the day. In like manner that one can have high
commitment to deliver goods but do not value completion of works on time.

Promote Peace and Harmony. The implementation of CDA subprojects as well as its
inclusive and participatory planning and subproject management processes provided
communities an opportunity to exchange views and in the process settled old differences.

Compliance to Environmental and Social Safeguard Laws. Communities were enlightened
on the global advocacy on environmental and social safeguard policies. They adhered to
environmental laws, requirements and procedures from subproject planning, implementation
and execution and monitoring.

Community Actual Audit & Validation. The regular conduct of audit & assessment of
People’s Organizations was a unique feature in the Project. Accordingly, it was an exciting
experience to be audited about the project process and identification of various accounting
forms and interview on financial management and procurement. They have recalled their
trainings and workshop on seven (7) CDA steps & other learnings. The audit and assessment
conducted in far flung communities indicated the presence of government even at the lowest
level of ARMM communities.

Gender Awareness. With the aim of promoting gender perspective as a cross cutting issues,
the incorporation of gender and development orientation has contributed in a more consistent
way with the culture of the community. It introduces gender equity in accessing resources
and economic opportunities. The LLFS subcomponent of CDA supported women to be more
productive in their economic activities and enhanced female leadership.

Approval of Barangay and Subproject in the Local Level Fast Tracked Implementation.
The installation of Municipal Multi-Sectoral Committee (MMSC) fast tracked approval of
priority barangays and subprojects as decision-making was brought down nearer to the
ground pursuant to E.O. 518 which amended E.O. 124.


                                             55
Right Identification of Target Communities and Beneficiaries. The adoption of project
selection criteria ensured that target communities were properly identified as those truly
needing assistance.

Equal Allocation and Proper Utilization of Resources. With clear targets, the CDA process
ensured that the budget was properly allocated to needy communities and their priority
development agenda. In this process, the utilization of meager resources at the community
level was maximized to ensure optimum benefits. The capacity- building training provided
to the POs enabled them to manage funds properly.

Multi-Stakeholders Coordination Established and Enhanced Community Decision-Making.
The participatory and inclusive processes encouraged local stakeholders to see the value of
coordination among one another. Barangay and Municipal LGUs provided cash and non-cash
contributions and support of the CDA subprojects while community members provided labor
counterpart. In most cases, local counterpart exceeded the 15% requirement of the project.

Leadership Skills Strengthened through Empowerment. Community empowerment
enhances leadership through capacity-building interventions and involvement in subproject
implementation processes.

Active Involvement of IPs was triggered by Fair Treatment of their Community and
Ancestral Domain. In areas where there are IPs, they are necessarily involved in subproject
implementation in recognition of their rights, culture and traditions.

Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach ensures sustainability of subprojects. It is
believed that this particular approach is an effective tool in the promotion of team work and
achievement of community empowerment.

The Final Phase of Transition of the Project to the ARG Manifest Good Performance
Output The project outlook has become even brighter with the strong support from the new
ARMM Regional Government leadership.

The Project contributed to the socio-economic growth of the region. The Project aimed at
improving the living standard of the community through the various subprojects assisted
thereon. Community residents are given opportunity into the manpower complements of the
subproject.

Observance of Transparency and Accountability in all phases of subproject
implementation. Identification of subproject is based on an open set of criteria to ensure that
selected subproject is the real and felt need in the community.

C.     Recommendations

The Project reiterated the two (2) recommendations contained in the PCR of Original Loan,
viz: (1) That the Autonomous Regional Government (ARG) shall, consistent with its
mandates under RA 9054, as amended, continue helping the communities by providing them
improved access to social and economic infrastructures and services; and, (2) That the ARG
shall also explore other financial resources in order to assist the remaining 65% unserved
communities and needy sectors of society, albeit the interventions of other development
partners extended to some of these communities.


                                              56
The ARG should encourage the regional line agencies to adopt and institutionalize the
Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach in the implementation of community
development programs, institute some modification in the institutional arrangements, e.g.
Involvement of local government units, partner agencies, civil society group and other
stakeholders to ensure smooth delivery of expected outputs.


(b) Borrower Comments on Draft ICR

In an official letter dated January 22, 2015, the ARMM Executive Secretary Laisa Alamia
provided the following comments on the draft ICR, plus detailed technical comments (which
were incorporated into the final version of the ICR).

“Generally we find the report substantial and reported in a straightforward manner.

However, we are putting forward here the latest implementation status as of December 31,
2014, of the Community-Based Infrastructure and the Municipal Infrastructure-Municipal
Block Grant subprojects, although the loan agreement between the GOP and WB has
officially closed on May 31, 2014.

We also appreciate the satisfactory rating given to the ARMM Regional Government through
its implementing unit, the ARMM Social Fund Project, under the current administration.

Our sincere thanks for the fruitful partnership.”

Additional technical comments received from the Office of the Executive Secretary on
January 26, 2015:
