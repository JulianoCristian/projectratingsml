                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to reduce poverty and to support mechanisms for the promotion of a peaceful and safe environment in the conflict-
                         affected areas in the ARMM Region and in particular to: (a) improve access to social and economic infrastructure and livelihood opportunities; (b) strengthen social
                         cohesion and partnerships between and within targeted communities; and (c) improve local governance and institutional capacities for implementation in the ARMM
                         Region, with a focus on improved participation, transparency and accountability in the allocation and management of public resources by the participating communities,
                         local government units and ARMM Regional Government.

                         At the request of the Department of Finance, the project has been extended by twelve months from May 2013 to May 2014 due to delays caused by security concerns and a lengthy
                         political transition in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. With five months remaining until the project closes, much work remains, but solid progress is being made towards

                         the Additional Financing phase have been completed, with 423 ongoing and 135 yet to commence construction. The remaining sub-projects are expected to be completed by March
                         2014. The completed sub-projects in the Additional Financing phase have benefited 353,000 people so far, taking the total number to 891,000 since the program began in 2003.

                         members of the community in all 342 target villages for the current Additional Financing phase of the project. Progress has been slow under the Municipal Block Grant sub-
                         component, with sub-projects completed in only five of the 24 participating municipalities. Activities have been canceled in five of these municipalities due either to political instability
                         or failure to comply with program requirements. Given these municipalities were identified as the better performing local government units in the Autonomous Region in Muslim
                         Mindanao (ARMM), the experience of the Municipal Block Grant sub-component highlights the challenges of promoting good governance and genuinely participatory development
