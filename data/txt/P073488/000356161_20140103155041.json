          for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Social\n            Fund Project from April 1-6, 2013. This Aide Memoire\n            reflects the findings and conclusions of the mission and is\n            subject to confirmation by the Management of the World Bank.\n            With design of the new National Community Driven Development\n            Program (NCDDP) in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao\n            set to be launched soon, the Mission focused on a number of\n            key design elements of the ASFP that could generate lessons\n            learned of relevance to the future program. To that end -\n            and in addition to the regular assessment of the state of\n            implementation - the Mission focused specifically on\n            assessing: (i) implementation of the performance-based\n            Municipal Block Grant sub-component; (ii) operation of the\n            Program Implementation Agreements between the Project\n            Management Office (PMO) and the regional Departments of\n            Social Welfare and Development and Interior and Local\n            Government; and (iii) how governance and anti-corruption\n            mechanisms are being implemented. The main findings of the\n            mission were presented to ARMM officials and PMO staff on\n            April 5, 2013 in Cotabato City. The mission noted that\n            progress delivered has been moderately satisfactory since\n            the loan for the Additional Financing became effective in\n            November 2010. Implementation is ongoing in 596 of the 597\n            target barangays. 1163 of the target 1175 sub-project\n            proposals have been approved, with 272 completed and 528\n            ongoing. The Mission was encouraged by the results of third\n            party spot checks conducted by Devcon that noted high levels\n            of awareness of the project, strong beneficiary feedback\n            about impacts and no evident discrimination in terms of\n            access to facilities constructed under the project."}, "docdt": "2013-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
