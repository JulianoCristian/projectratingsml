            Honorable Mujiv S. Hataman
            OIC Regional Governor
            ARMM Regional Government
            Cotabato City

            Dear Governor Hataman:




                    The 18th Implementation Support Mission for the ARMM Social Fund Project (ASFP)
           was conducted from April I to 6, 2013. With design ofthe new National Community Driven
           Development Program (NCDDP) in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao set to be
           launched soon, the Mission focused on a number of key design elements of the ASFP that could
           generate lessons learned of relevance to the future program. To that end- and in addition to the
           regular assessment of the state of implementation- the Mission focused specifically on assessing:
           (i) implementation of the performance-based Municipal Block Grant sub-component; (ii)
           operation of the Program Implementation Agreements between the Project Management Office
           and the regional Departments of Social Welfare and Development and Interior and Local
           Government; and (iii) how governance and anti-corruption mechanisms are being implemented.

                     We would like to convey our thanks to your staff, the members of ARMM line agencies,
           staff of the Project Management Office (PMO) and LGU officials, who provided full cooperation
           to the mission.

                   The main findings of the mission were presented to ARMM officials and PMO staff on
           AprilS, 2013 in Cotabato City. Please find attached the mission Aide-Memoire, the findings of
           which I hereby confirm.

                     The mission noted that progress delivered has been moderately satisfactory since the loan
           for the Additional Financing became effective in November 2010. Implementation is ongoing in
           596 of the 597 target barangays. 1163 of the target 1175 sub-project proposals have been
           approved, with 272 completed and 528 ongoing. The Mission was encouraged by the results of
           third party spot checks conducted by Devcon that noted high levels of awareness of the project,
           strong beneficiary feedback about impacts and no evident discrimination in terms of access to
           facilities constructed under the project. We were also pleased to see geo-tagging being rolled out
           to enhance supervision and transparency, in line with ARMM Regional Government policy.

                   Despite these achievements, the program remains behind schedule. The World Bank has
           received the government's formal request to extend the program by 12 months. This request is
           under review and will be finalized before the end of this month.
Governor Mujiv S. Hataman                       -2-                                  May 14,2013


      A detailed list of actions was agreed between the World Bank team and the Project
Management Office to address implementation challenges. It is attached as an Annex to the
Aide-Memoire, but we would like to highlight the following priority actions for follow up:

         I. Submit spot check report and plan for future spot checking.

        2.   Upload geo-tagged data on to the public website.

        3.   Establish a Rural Infrastructure Unit within the PMO to lead quality control and
             quality assurance of technical standards.

        4. Communicate with DILG-ARMM the need to liquidate all funds downloaded to them
           under the Project Implementation Agreement.

       We look forward to your support and attention to this important project and to continuing
the World Bank's cooperation with the ARMM Region.

                                  Implementation Support Mission #18
                                                      April 1-6, 2013
                                                       Aide Memoire


 Introduction

 1.       A World Bank team 1 conducted the 18 111 Implementation Support Mission for the Autonomous
 Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Social Fund Project from April 1-6, 2013, in coordination with the
 Project Management Office (PMO), DSWD-ARMM, DILG-ARMM and concerned local government
 units in the region.

 2.     This Aide Memoire reflects the findings and conclusions of the mission and is subject to
 confirmation by the Management of the World Bank.

 Objectives and Scope of the Mission

 3.       The main objectives of the mission were to:

      •   Review the state of implementation of the ASFP Additional Financing, including:
             o   Assess social preparation and subproject implementation.
             o   Assess the technical quality of subprojects as well as the quality of supervision by the
                 PMO and DSWD-ARMM field personnel.
             o   Evaluate compliance with safeguards, procurement and financial management standards.
             o   Review progress of implementation of the 1i 11 Implementation Support Mission Key
                 Agreed Actions and related concerns.
             o   Assess PMO preparation in relation to the proposed extension of the Additional
                 Financing phase.

      •   Look at three specific issues in depth:

               o    Assess the implementation progress of the Municipal Block Grant, discuss operational
                    issues and identify measures to improve its incentive and development impacts.
               o    Review the Program Implementation Agreements (PIAs) between the PMO and DSWD-
                    ARMM for the Community Development Assistance (CDA) component and DILG-
                    ARMM for community investment planning/barangay development planning.
               o    Governance and Anti-Corruption measures, particularly geo-tagging and the work of the
                    third party independent monitor charged with conducting spot checks.

Overall Mission Assessment of Progress to Date

4.     Overall, the Mission finds that progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective
(PDO) is moderately satisfactory.


1
  The Bank Team comprised Matt Stephens, Task Team Leader; Roy Tordecilla, Operations Officer; Rene Manuel, Senior
Procurement Specialist; Tomas Sta. Maria, Financial Management Specialist; and Raoul Azanza, Rural Infrastructure Consultant.
The ASFP-PMO was led by Mr. Abba Kuaman, Project Manager; Alejandro Coscos, Finance and Admin Director; Irene
Gonzales, ISG Head; Norodin Lumambas, M&E Head; and Ayrin Sales, Community Development Specialist. Regional Planning
and Development Office Executive Director Engr. Baintan Ampatuan led the delegation of the ARMM Regional Government
which attended the wrap-up meeting on April 5. DILG-ARMM Regional Secretary Atty. Macmod Mending, Jr. headed the
DILG-ARMM team for discussions on April 4. Assistant Regional Secretary Hja. Pombaen Kader of DSWD-ARMM joined for
discussions with DSWD and the wrap-up meeting.

5.       Significant physical accomplishments have been achieved. Subproject implementation under the
Community Development Assistance component has commenced in all but one of the target 597
barangays under the Additional Financing. 1,163 of 1,175 subproject proposals have been generated, of
which 272 are complete and 528 ongoing. For the Municipal Block Grant, implementation is under way
in 22 of the 24 target municipalities, with construction ongoing in nine sites. Two sites have been
cancelled due to political instability in one case, and apparent non-interest by the MLGU in the other.

6.      Despite these achievements, performance remains short of the target of completing all subprojects
by the original May 20 13 closing date. The proposed twelve month extension will be required to
complete the remaining targets.

7.      In terms of local governance impacts, the collaboration with the Department of Interior and Local
Government (DILG-ARMM) has delivered 341 of the 359 targeted Barangay Development
Plans/Community Investments Plans (BDP/CIP) under the second Program Implementation Agreement.
DILG reports that the planning process has become more inclusive and participatory, engaging
communities in the process rather than just the barangay chair and barangay councilors (as is the practice
in non-ASFP locations). Whether this translates into better governance and development investments at
the barangay level remains an open question, but inclusive planning is an important first step.

8.        Importantly, the ASFP process has been utilized by DILG-ARMM for the purposes of preparing
Local Poverty Reduction Action Plans, as required under the government's Bottom up Budgeting
initiative. This means that the investment in process made by ASFP is now helping to leverage
significant additional national government budget for community development.

9.        Preliminary results of the Third Party Spot Check conducted by Development Consultants, Inc.
(Devcon) demonstrated encouraging results, including: (a) strong awareness about the project; (b)
consistent views that the project was delivering tangible and intangible impacts; (c) no reported
discrimination in terms of access to facilities, even in areas with rido or clan conflict; (d) perceived
increase in income; and (e) children are encouraged to attend school with new school buildings
constructed by the project. The spot check, however, also indicated the need to improve community
facilitation as there are signs that: (a) LGU officials both at the municipal and barangay levels have
influenced key decisions; (b) criteria for selecting beneficiaries under the learning, livelihood and food
self-sufficiency sub-component were not clear to the public; and (c) in general the project CDD steps are
being complied with for bureaucratic reasons rather than for community empowerment.

10.      The mission visited 14 ongoing subprojects (including 3 Municipal Block Grant subprojects) and
six proposed sites. The quality of technical design and construction was generally good. Communication
and information materials about the project are visible in project sites and community members have
general awareness about project processes. Vibrant POs were evident, with active officers and members
able to articulate community issues and project processes.

11.     However, it remains evident that in the effort to meet physical targets, the quality of project
implementation is inconsistent. Technical supervision- the main concern from the previous mission-
has improved but only marginally. Site inspection templates are not being used by Rural Infrastructure
Engineers (RIE) and the RIE performance assessment tool is also yet to be rolled out. There is a need
within the project structure to strengthen oversight, clarify responsibility for technical supervision and
make more strategic use of available engineering resources.

12.      There have been improvements in the governance and anti-corruption aspects ofthe project. The
3rd Party Spot Check has commenced (although well after the agreed schedule). It was agreed that the
spot check report and plans for the next round of spot checking would be submitted to the Bank by May
17, 2013. Geo-tagging has now covered 12 per cent of subprojects under the Additional Financing,

                                                Page 2 of38
though it will be important to make this data public. It was agreed that this would be completed by April
30, 2013. Gee-tagging has caught the attention of the Regional Government, which has requested
training for its Open Data initiative. The Grievance Redress System has been set up and running but
ongoing intensive efforts are still required to ensure wide community awareness and usage of the system.

Disbursement

13.     As of April3, 2013, total disbursements amount to US$21.36 million (including the balance in
the Designated Account ofUS$2.18 million) or 71.21% of the total loan amount ofUS$30.0 million.

Extension

14.     The government has filed a request for an extension of the closing date for twelve months. The
extension request is now under review by the Bank. The work and financial plan for the extension period
foresees completion of all subproject implementation by December 2013, leaving January-May 2014 for
completion and wrap up activities.

Community Development Assistance (CDA) Component

 15.     Tables 1 and 2 below show the implementation progress of both the Community-Based
Infrastructure (CBI) and Learning, Livelihood and Food Sufficiency (LLFS) sub-components. As Table 1
shows, 1145 out of 1175 target subproject proposals have been prepared by POs and approved by Multi-
Sectoral Committees as of February 28, 2013. Close to the original closing date, about a quarter of the
target subprojects have been completed and turned over, with 528 in on-going construction and 346 set
for completion after May 2013. Under LLFS implementation, 45 per cent of the total target areas have
completed the three key stages Functional Literacy Training (FLT), Household Food Sufficiency
Assistance (HSF A), and Income Generating Activity (IGA). On LLFS, the PMO has agreed to submit to
the Bank by May 17, 2013 (and in future regular reports) consolidated data on pre- and post-test results
for easier monitoring of outcomes, not just outputs.

Quality of Social Preparation

16.     Encouraging signs vis-a-vis the project's empowerment goal were seen during site visits. Sub-
projects identified by communities clearly address their priority needs. POs are functional and show basic
capacity in procurement and financial management, and are engaging the LGUs. Participation from
community members in sites visited was high, especially from women. In the graduation ceremony
witnessed by the mission team in Lanao del Sur, beneficiaries recounted not only how the project had
helped them learn to read, write and count, but also how it had increased their social awareness (e.g.,
gender and environmental awareness) and self-confidence. Generally, membership of people's
organizations is representative of the different sitios and reflective of the different ethnic affiliation in the
community. In Brgy. Banago, Balabagan, in Lanao del Sur, for instance, the PO covered all sitios and
included Muslims, Christians and Indigenous Peoples, in line with the tri-people composition of the
population.

 17.     The mission noted ongoing areas for improvement, however. Local elites- particularly barangay
chairs - continued to exercise significant influence over many decisions, from site location to subproject
type. In Barangay Igabay, Balabagan, Lanao del Sur, for instance, the rainwater reservoir that was
supposed to be located adjacent to the school building was constructed instead next to the barangay hall.
The PO officers simply explained they could not say no to "barrio" (the barangay chair). In Barangay
Kabakaba, Upi, Maguidanao, the subproject location was settled by splitting the two solar dryers; one for
the location preferred by the barangay chair and one by the PO President. The former chose a section in
her brother's lot, the latter a section in her own property. The 3rd Party spot check also gathered
complaints that even the selection of LLFS beneficiaries sometimes favored those close to local elites.
Questions were also raised as to how much time Municipal Facilitators (MF) are actually spending in
target communities supporting the POs. To address this concern, it was agreed that the PMO would more
closely monitor MF activity sheets to assess time spent in the field.

Technical Quality of Construction

18.     Overall the quality of construction in the subprojects visited was rated as good (for the full
technical report, see Annex 3). For instance, the tire path project in the MBG site in Sefegefen, Upi, was
rated by the mission's Rural Infrastructure Consultant as one ofthe better quality subprojects he had seen
anywhere in the country.

19.     However, a number of ongoing concerns were identified: (a) continued failure to document
deviations from detailed engineering designs with variation orders; (b) poor site selection that sees a
number of subprojects being located in flood-prone areas; (c) failure to use the agreed site inspection
reporting template to systematically capture and analyze information on construction quality.

                                                      Page 4 of38
20.      The latter failure means that at the management level, neither the PMO nor DSWD-ARMM has a
strong handle on which provinces or locations have either good or poor technical quality. Neither are
they identifying areas where the MLGU is failing to provide sufficient technical support through the
Municipal Engineer. Accordingly, the project's engineering resources at the PMO and DSWD-ARMM
levels are not being deployed strategically to areas that need extra help. There seems to be some
uncertainty in the PMO as to which unit is charged with overseeing technical quality.

21.      To address this and the other technical issues, it was agreed that the PMO would establish a Rural
Infrastructure Unit (RIU) to refine a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) system for
construction. The main function of the RIU would be as follows:

        a. Rationalize the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of PMO-Rural Infrastructure
           Engineers & Provincial RIEs in the context of QAIQC System.
        b. Establish a monitoring system taking into consideration the present monitoring set-up of the
           Project (applicability of existing forms and necessity of updating the RI manual).
        c. Set-up design control for the subprojects including cost control to ensure the cost
           effectiveness of each subproject.
        d. Develop an effective subproject inspection mechanism to ensure strict compliance with the
           requirements of the Detailed Engineering Plans and technical specifications.
        e. Develop a sustainable operations and maintenance program for each specific type of
           subproject.

22.      The World Bank team offered technical support to help establish the RIU, including advice on
defining the function, TOR for staff, reporting templates, etc.

Program Implementation Agreement

23.     The CDA component is being carried out through a Program Implementation Agreement (PIA)
between the PMO and DSWD-ARMM. The mission team reviewed the state of progress ofthe PIA,
yielding the following findings:

        a.The PIA with DSWD-ARMM is functional, with systems for accountability, coordination,
          and monitoring. The partnership meets quarterly to update each other and flesh out measures
          to address operational challenges. They also conduct their own separate annual reviews,
          though there are some questions as to whether both are needed.
       b. The main issue that confronts the PIA is delay in fund transfer to the POs because of the
          document review process. Delays range from one to six months due to the volume of
          transactions. Problems arise when requests for fund release (RFR) come first to the desk of
          the provincial teams and later to the PMO. Delays occur as the PMO has limited staff to
          review documents. Recently, the PMO has come up with a system of mobilizing staff from
          other units to speed up the process through a "mass review". DSWD-ARMM observed that
          they often are not aware of delays, as the flow of documents is PO-Provincial Office-PMO,
          without information reaching the DSWD regional office.
       c. Another major issue related to RFR delays is the lack of sufficient engineers at the PMO to
          do physical and technical evaluation of subprojects as a requirement for the succeeding
          transfer of funds to the POs, particularly for the final tranche.
       d. DSWD-ARMM also raised some questions over recruitment under the Additional Financing
          phase. Under the current PIA, the PMO shortlisted applicants for CDA field staff (Rural
          Infra Engineers, Provincial Facilitators, and Municipal Facilitators). DSWD-ARMM came in
          only to select from the shortlist, something which the agency saw as too late in the process to
          ensure quality staffing. DSWD's view is that the PMO placed too much emphasis on

                                              Page 5 of38
             academic background, training and a formal test as opposed to experience and
             communication/facilitation skills. DSWD sees personal skills as more important than a test
             score, particularly as they feel that cheating in the test is common.

24.      To further explore and address some of the issues raised by DSWD, the PMO agreed to the
following actions by May 17, 2013: (a) on recruitment, to analyze turnover rates for the recruitment
practices under the current two PIAs as compared to the previous arrangement; (b) on review and
approval of RFRs, the PMO will compare delays across provinces, analyze the reasons for delay and
develop recommendations to address the problem; and (c) assess together with DSWD-ARMM whether
there is a need for separate annual reviews or whether these can be combined for the sake of efficiency.

Environmental and Social Safeguards

25.      Overall, safeguards practice is rated as satisfactory. However, improvements need to be made in
site selection, housekeeping/cleanliness, and Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
preparation.

26.     On site selection, the mission observed that some subprojects were constructed without due
regard to environmental considerations. For instance, the solar dryer in Barangay Bungcog, Upi,
Maguindanao is located in a gully prone to soil erosion. The school classroom in Barangay Igabay,
Balabagan, Lanao del Sur was built in the lowest section of the school complex, a natural waterway.

2 7.     It was apparent during the field visits that site selection (except for subprojects inside government
properties such as a school) is mainly determined by land acquisition decisions. The most common
justification provided is that there are only a few people in the community willing to donate land.
Incidentally, these people usually happen to be the barangay chair, the PO President, or their relatives.
This issue has been flagged in previous missions but the practice seems to be continuing- a number of
the sites for upcoming subprojects visited by the mission are inside fenced properties.

28.      Poor housekeeping was seen in Bgy. Igabay's tire path project with no side ditches.
Consequently, one section was submerged in water, mud and trash. In Bgy. Banago, Balabagan, a deep
open pit (for septic tank) next to the school building was left unfenced, representing a safety hazard,
particularly for children.

29.      On the social safeguards side, the mission was pleased to see safeguards documents such as
ESMPs and deeds of donation available at the community level. However, as in past missions, most of
the documents were prepared by the facilitating teams rather than community members themselves. PO
officers demonstrated litt!e understanding of their content or importance. Some documents sighted
seemed to be a cut and paste from other locations. For example, the ESMP in Bgy. Kabakaba, a
landlocked barangay, assessed environmental impacts of a school building on sea grass and corals. This
evident lack of understanding tends to contradict the claim of the PMO that POs and communities prefer
to have safeguards documents in English or Tagalog. Validation in the field does not support this
assertion, particularly with respect to English.

30.       The mission commends the PMO for taking action the agreement from the previous mission to
comply with the terms of the memorandum of agreement with DENR-ARMM. Two letters were sent to
DENR-ARMM last year (October 8, 2012 and December 20, 2012) providing the agency with the
progress of the Project's compliance to the agreement. It should be noted though that the October 8, 2012
letter did not have the necessary attachments (242 ESMPs for IBRD, 639 ESMPs for JICA) and promised
submission later.




                                                Page 6 of38
 31.     Agreed actions to improve Safeguards compliance include: (a) conduct due diligence on site
 selection and land acquisition for proposed subprojects, with strong consciousness about possible elite
 capture; (b) continue reminding DSWD-ARMM on the importance ofPOs taking the lead in preparing
 safeguards instruments and their full understanding of such documents, including translating at least into
 Tagalog; and (c) submit compliance report on the progress of compliance to PMO-DENR-ARMM
 agreement.

 Institutional Strengthening and Governance (ISG) Component

Municipal Block Grant CMBG)

32.      Twenty-two of the 24 selected MLGUs for the Municipal Block Grants (MBG) are now in
different stages of implementation: nine have on-going construction, 12 have just completed social
preparation and are about to start construction, while one is still in social preparation. Two LGUs were
dropped from the list. Omar in Sulu was dropped due to on-going conflict while Pata, also in Sulu, was
due to lack of interest of the mayor to proceed. The two MLGUs will not be replaced.

33.     While the quality. of subproject construction in the sites visited was good, it is evident that most
LGUs are cutting corners in the social preparation phase, with LGUs dictating subproject selection. The
most obvious example of this was in Brgy. Salman in Ampatuan, Maguindanao, where the members of
the "people's organization" were in fact all municipal officials.

34.     This suggests that the intent of the MBG sub-component- to mainstream the CDD approach into
LGU systems- has not been fully met. The PMO identified the following lessons learned: (a) The PMO
should not rush the selection and provide sufficient time for ground validation and; (b) intensity and
length of training for the Municipal Facilitators should be the same with that of the CDA training.

35.      To improve MBG performance, the PMO agreed to the following actions: (a) designate
responsible person/s for MBG supervision to monitor LGU compliance with the Operations Manual; and
(b) take corrective action on the Salman case. Both actions would be completed by May 17, 2013.

Information, Education and Communication

36.      The Mission notes the continued improvements made by the project on IEC materials. Most of
the targets for IEC materials to be developed, produced and distributed have been met. Some targets have
even been surpassed, such as radio plugs (46/3 7), TV plugs (20116), video documentation of subprojects
(8/7), press releases (34/20), regular forums with media (9/8) and radio and TV appearances (28/20). The
project webpage is now running again as well as its Facebook account which feeds regular updates.

Program Implementation Agreement with DILG-ARMM

3 7.    Discussions with DILG-ARMM on the PIA with the PMO revealed the following key findings:

        a. DILG-ARMM has a positive perception of the PIA, seeing it as a vehicle to pursue its
           mandate to improve governance at the barangay level. When plans are formulated in a
           participatory manner, the barangay LGUs are helped not just to comply with the law (Local
           Government Code) but also to start mainstreaming the system for civil society participation.
        b. DILG-ARMM is also using the community development planning under ASFP as an input to
           the Local Poverty Reduction Action Planning (LPRAP) requirement of the Bottom-Up
           Budgeting (BUB) initiative of the national government.
        c. Inter-agency coordination between the PMO and the DILG-ARMM is working well, despite
           the absence of regular meetings between the two.

                                                Page 7 of 38
 38.    To strengthen what appears to be a well-functioning relationship, it was agreed that the PMO
 would consider instituting regular tri-partite (PMO, DSWD and DILG) meetings to enhance coordination.

Procurement

39.     Overall rating. The mission maintains a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for procurement for
three major reasons: (i) repeated failure to fulfill a simple but important key agreed action related to
procurement (revision of the procurement section of the operations manual); (ii) repeated patterns of
deficiencies in community procurement; and (iii) failure to observe proper procurement procedures for
PMO-level procurement (for additional tablets for geo-tagging, which was not included in the
procurement plan). However, the mission noted progress in the procurement of consultants (M&E and 3rd
Party Spot Check) and expects improvement following the PMO's decision to designate a new
procurement officer after the last mission.

40.     The mission conducted a post review of completed and on-going CDA and MBG subprojects
during site visits and a desk review of procurement transactions. This included the review report ofthe
PMO internal monitor. The post review revealed a lack of improvement of community procurement and
the apparent lack of proper supervision or coaching of concerned field staff. The key identified
deficiencies are:

        a. In Brgy. Sefegefen in Upi, award was made to a supplier who did not submit the lowest
           quote.
        b. In Brgy. Kabakaba in North Upi, the purchase order was received and dated by the supplier
           earlier than the date of the PO itself.
        c. In Brgy. Bungcog in North Upi, quotations from 3 suppliers are on file, but prices are blank
           on the 2 losing suppliers.
        d. In Brgy. Banago in Balabagan, copy of individual quotes on file with that of the winning
           supplier dated 1/3113, while the quotes from the 2 others were dated 11/10112; in addition, the
           quotes of these 2 seem to have been interchanged in the abstract.

41.      The validation report of the internal monitor makes similar observations. While procurement
documents were usually available during review, some were found to be deficient in important aspects
such as: (i) purchase order without date received by supplier; (ii) disbursement voucher issued prior to
opening of quotations; (iii) official receipt issued before disbursement voucher was prepared; and (iv)
signature of supplier differed across official receipt and disbursement voucher. Annex 4 (Procurement
Specialist Report) provides more details.

42.     The key agreed action for procurement is to update the procurement plan to cover remaining
items to be procured beyond end-May 2013, plus those that are still to be procured under both the CDA
and ISG components of the project as reported above. The updated procurement plan should be approved
by the Project Manager, and submitted to the Bank on or before April30, 2013.

Financial Management

43.      Overall rating. Sound financial management arrangements are in place and implementation of
the FM system at the PMO is rated satisfactory. Certain concerns remain at both the Program and
Community levels that need to be addressed, but these are assessed to be manageable. Implementation of
FM arrangements by Peoples Organizations (PO) visited continues to show varying FM capacity, but is
still considered acceptable.




                                               Page 8 of38
44.      Compliance with the financial covenants. The Project has submitted the required financial
reports on time: (a) Audited Project Financial Statements- financial reports for 2012 are expected to be
completed within February 2013 for immediate submission to COA; (b) Quarterly Interim Un-audited
Financial Reports (IFRs): the second, third and fourth quarter IFRs for2012 were submitted to the Bank
within due dates. The 1st quarter IFR for 20 13 will be due by May 14, 2013.

45.     Program Implementation Agreement 2 (P IA2) Implementation with DILG-ARMM. Under the
second PIA between the ASFP PMO and DILG-ARMM, PhP10.231 million is budgeted for capacity
building activities for the Municipal Technical Working Groups/Municipal Teams on BDP/CIP
Preparation. Out of this amount, PhP8.185 million is from the Loan Proceeds and PhP2.046 from GOP
counterpart funds. During implementation, the funds were downloaded as follows:




46.     The mission noted that some requests for replenishments by DILG-ARMM were not fully
accepted/replenished by ASFP PMO due to deficient documentation. Hence, the amounts actually
replenished were lower than the amounts requested. At the end of the Program Contract however, the
amounts allocated were fully disbursed but an amount totaling PhP4.51 million still needs to be
documented /liquidated by DILG-ARMM.

47.     The following actions were agreed with the ASFP PMO: (a) communicate with DILG-ARMM
the need to liquidate all funds downloaded to them; (b) provide DILG-ARMM with the list of previously
submitted liquidations/replenishments that need additional supporting documents or were considered not
acceptable; (c) request DILG-ARMM to reconcile discrepancies in the Fund Utilization Reports as
against Statement of Expenditures (amounts reported in Fund Utilization Reports do not tally with those
reported in SOE). Full details are in Annex 5.

Monitoring & Evaluation

Amendment to Results Framework

48.     During the mission the Bank team and the PMO discussed the government's extension request
and the opportunity it presented to revisit and refine the project Results Framework as part of the World
Bank restructuring package. A copy of the revised Results Framework that has been submitted to Bank
management for approval is attached as Annex 6 to this Aide Memoire.

Overview

A joint Technical Team from ARMM Social Fund Project (ASFP), Department of Social Welfare and
Development (DSWD) and the World Bank {WB) visited the province of Maguindanao to conduct an
ocular inspection on selected completed and ongoing rural infrastructure subprojects under the
Additional Financing Phase in the municipalities of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Upi, Datu Paglas and_ Ampatuan.
Proposed rural infrastructure subprojects sites were also visited in these municipalities.

The Team also visited the municipality of Balabagan in the province of Lanao del Sur to inspect selected
completed and ongoing rural infrastructure subprojects including proposed sites.

The objective of the mission on the rural infrastructure component was to conduct technical and quality
assessment of the subprojects in terms of (a) technical quality of subproject designs based on
engineering standards, {b) technical quality of subproject based on the detailed engineering design and
program of works; determining whether there were deviations and whether such deviations were
reflected in the subproject cost and a variation order, (c) quality of materials used, {d) timeliness of
construction, and {e) preparations for operation and maintenance.

The Team conducted a technical audit on eleven (11) on-going /completed subprojects and six (6)
proposed subproject sites under the CDA component. Three (3) on-going MGB subprojects were also
inspected. The following tables summarized the results of the four (4) day Mission.

Key Observations and Assessments with Reference to the Objectives of the Mission

The PMO was able to provide the necessary detailed engineering designs (DEPs) technical specifications
and program of works for the subprojects visited.

1. Technical Quality of Subproject Design based on Engineering Standard

     Overall, the structural design requirements of the subprojects conformed to the engineering
     standard as set forth by the Project. The only modification noted was the size of the classrooms; the
     standard classroom size of the Department of Education (DepEd) is 7m x 9m while the modified
     classroom size by the Project is 7m x 8m only. Nevertheless, the structural requirements of the
     school buildings conformed to the engineering standard.

2.   Technical Quality of Subproject based on the Detailed Engineering Design and Program of Work

     Most of the subprojects inspected conformed to requirements of the detailed engineering designs
     and program of works. Th.e following innovations were introduced by the proponents to further
     enhance the quality of the subproject:

         •   provision of concrete curb at perimeter of constructed solar driers to further reduce post
             harvest losses
         •   provision of wire mesh on window frames of a school bldg. to protect the jalousie glasses
         •   provision of concrete ledge at a school bldg. walkway that serves as an additional
             sitting/rest area

     Three subprojects were however identified to have deviated from the approved detailed
     engineering designs and program of works. One school bldg. subproject used coconut lumber for its
     roof framing instead of th·e prescribed hardwood. The other subproject resorted to rebar
     substitution for the columns; the DEPs requires 8-16mm0 vertical bars for each of the 12 columns
     but the proponent opted to install a combination of 4-12mm0 and 4-16mm0 vertical bars for each
     of the ten columns and 8-12mm0 each for the other to columns. The substitution is technically
     acceptable but would still require the approval from the PMO thru a deviation order. For the other
     school bldg., jalousie windows were deleted.

3.   Work Deviations and Deviation Order

     There were no records/evidence that deviation orders were made for the identified subprojects
     with innovations and subprojects with substitution/deletion of materials. Additional costs incurred
     or savings generated due to the variations should be properly reflected in the revised program of
     work and properly documented.

4.   Quality of Materials Used

     Most materials in the construction of the subprojects are of quality and acceptable except for the
     substitution of coconut lumber in lieu of hardwood for the roof framing.

5.   Timeliness of Construction

     The completion of subprojects is still dependent on the release of funds.

                                               Page 17 of38
 6. Site Selection

     Most of the sites for the proposed subprojects are within a fenced private lot. The PMO should
     ensure that the donation of the land is properly documented and the land title properly annotated.

Overall Recommendations

There is a need by the PMO to create a Rural Infrastructure Unit (RIU} whose main function is to
establish a Quality Assurance/Quality Control {QA/QC) System for the CBA and MGB subprojects. This is
to sustain initial improvements gained in construction management/supervision and the
implementation of the enhanced engineering reporting system.

The RIU shall undertake the following activities:

     •   Rationalize the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of PMO-RIEs & PRIEs in the context of
         QA/QC System.
     •   Establish a monitoring system taking into consideration the present monitoring set-up of the
         Project {applicability of existing forms and necessity of updating the Rl manual}.
     •    Set-up a design control for the subprojects including cost control to ensure the cost
         effectiveness of each subproject.
     •   Develop an effective subproject inspection mechanism to ascertain strict compliance with the
         requirements of the DEPs and technical specifications.
    •    Develop a sustainable operations and maintenance program for each specific type of subproject.

Specific Assessment/Findings per Subproject

                                         The detailed engineering plans (DEPs) provides for 6.00m x 6.00m
                                         warehouse building with timber trusses as its roof framing. Part of
                                         the subproject component is the construction of a 12m x 20m
                                         solar drier.

                                         Observations made:
                                          • Dimensions of the constructed warehouse building conformed
                                            to the DEPs.
                                          • Additional 200mm x 300mm cross beam was provided as
                                            support to the middle timber truss (not part of the DEPs).
                                          • Only one bottom chord was installed at the end trusses. The
                                            requirement is two bottom chords per truss.
                                          • Dimensions of the constructed solar drier; 12m x 19.87m.
                                          • Additional curb was provided at the perimeter of the solar
                                            drier, this was constructed to minimize post harvest losses
                                            during the drying period (not part of the DEP). This innovation
                                            could be included in the design template for solar drier.
                                          • No site inspection report was issued by the PMO to the DSWD
                                            RIE/PO after the conduct of inspection.

                               ASFP-AF Implementation Support Mission
                                          1-6 April 2013

Procurement
The main objective of the mission is to review the state of implementation of the project's additional
financing, and the progress made by the PMO in the implementation of the recommended key actions and
related concerns from the previous mission. The result of this review in relation to procurement is given
below.

CDA Component

1.   Status. As reported during the mission, a total of 1,145 subproject proposals (out of 1,175 targeted
     number) have been approved as of end-February 2013, and out of this total, 1,077 subprojects are
     under implementation (with SPIAs). Of this number, 789 subprojects are reported as on-going
     construction, 262 of which are completed. It was further reported that 346 subprojects will not be
     completed prior to the current project closing date of end-May 2013; hence the need to extend the
     project in order to get these subprojects completed and turned over.

2. Site Visits to Completed and On-going Subprojects funded under the Additional Financing. Visits to
   various subprojects were made by mission members and PMO staff, and discussions were held with
   LGU officials (Municipal and Barangay levels), People's Organization (PO) staff, and community
   members. In particular, the Bank's designated procurement specialist visited completed and on-going
   subprojects in Barangays Sefegefen, Kabakaba and Bungcog in North Upi, in the province of
   Maguindanao. It was evident during the visits that procurement documents of these subprojects are
   available in project files, including copies of actual quotations received from three suppliers,
   comparisons made of these quotations and signed purchase orders; though deficiencies are noted in
   some cases.

3. Municipal Block Grants (MBG). As of mission date, it was reported that a total of 24 subprojects
   have been identified, and two (2) has since been cancelled due to political instability in one case, and
   apparent non-interest by the MLGU in the other case. Of the remaining 22 subprojects, nine (9) was
   reported to be under implementation with construction on-going as of end-February 2013. Site visits
   were made to some selected sites, and a post review of procurement activities was likewise done
   during the mission.

4. Gee-tagging of Subprojects. It was reported during the mission that geo-tagging of the subprojects
   have been started, and to date I 0% of the total number of subprojects have been uploaded for the
   PMOs monitoring purposes. The PMO was exhorted to expedite uploading of geo-tagged photos and
   allow access to the public so all will be informed of the statuses of the various subprojects. This
   activity is in line with the Bank's efforts to have all its funded projects geo-tagged.

 5.   Selection of Consultants for Various Activities. The selection process for the hiring of an
      independent 3rd party to perform spot checks on the CDA subprojects was- finally completed, and the
      Bank issued the "no objection letter" to the initialed negotiated contract on December 13, 2012. The
      contract was signed on December 17 and the Notice to Proceed was received by the consultant on
      December 28. To date, however, the results of the first set of spot checks have not been reported, and
      it was agreed during the mission that this would be submitted to the PMO on or before 15 April 2013.
      The PMO also completed the selection process for the hiring of an M&E Specialist, and the
      Consultant mobilized in January 2013. The consultant participated in the mission.

ISG Component

6.    Selection of Service Providers for Story Writing and Publication of Compiled Success Stories. The
      ISG Head reported the need to hire a consultant to prepare stories from the field, as well as for the
      publication of success stories. It would be good if the terms of references (TORs) for these two
      activities can be prepared at the earliest time possible, and the selection process to follow thereafter.
      Both of these services should be included in the updated procurement plan.

7.    Procurement of Goods by the PMO. It was reported during the mission that the only remaining
      procurement is for the additional computer tablets for geo-tagging purposes, the process of which has
      apparently been completed, and the purchase order issued to the winning supplier (though units have
      not been delivered yet). The mission reiterated to the PMO that the procurement of computer tablets
      for geo-tagging purposes is not included in the original procurement plan, with no amount budgeted
      for this, and the Bank had to issue a "no objection' for the procurement of the initial set of tablets.
      The procurement, therefore, of the additional tablets should have been approved by the Bank prior to
      the start of the procurement process. There is also a need to check if there are still funds available
      from the project's Goods sub-category to pay for these additional tablets.

Procurement Plan. There is a need for an updated procurement plan to be submitted to the Bank for
concurrence, and this has to be done prior to the current project closing date of end-May 2013. The
updated plan should show what remains to be procured beyond end-May 2013, and those that are still to
be procured under both the CDA and ISG components of the project as reported above. The updated
Procurement Plan should be approved by the Project Manager, and submitted to the Bank on or before 30
April2013.

Procurement Section of the Project Operations Manual COM). A review of the Procurement Section of
the OM was made during the mission, and it showed that the previous comments remained to be complied
with. These are: i) the version of the Bank's guidelines stated in the OM is the old one (dated January
1995 and revised up to January 1999) and not the correct one which should be dated "May 2004, revised
October 2006"; ii) also, the Consultant Guidelines' "Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, published by the Bank in May 2004, revised October 2006" is not
written but should be included; and iii) the threshold for the various procurement methods are the same
amount of $50,000 which is high for the CDA component, and should be revised based on the thresholds
indicated in the original OM. The OM was revised in September 2011 and the above comments were
made based on a review of the Procurement section made in November 2011.

Capacity of the PMO to Undertake Procurement. A change in the designated Procurement Officer for the
project was made after the last mission, and it is expected that procurement activities will now move
according to plans and agreed procedures. Especially on CDA related procurement, it is expected that
procurement activities will be improved since the same person looking at the infrastructure aspects is the
same person now looking at procurement from the PMO leveL The validations done by the Internal
Monitor, and the required compliances from the communities, is expected to improve further the
procurement activities.

Ex-post Review of Signed Contracts

1. Procurement Activities for the Completed and On-going CDA Subprojects: a review of the
   procurement transactions and relevant documents of the visited completed subprojects, including two
   subprojects filed at the PMO, was made, and the findings are as follows: i) quotations from three
   suppliers were received; ii) abstract of quotations prepared; iii) purchase orders are issued to the
   lowest submitted quotation; iv) copy of cash invoices or ORs from suppliers on file; and v) an
   inspection and acceptance report is also on file. There are deficiencies also, and these include: i)
   purchase order dated 7/7/12, received by the supplier on 7/5/12 and OR dated 7/6/12 (for Brgy.
   Kabakaba); ii) individual quotes are blank for the 2 losing suppliers, but there are prices entered in the
   abstract of quotations (for Brgy. Bungcog); and iii) copy of three individual quotes on file with that of
   the winning supplier dated 1/3/13, while the quotes from the losing suppliers were dated 11110/12, in
   addition, the quotes of these 2 seem to have been interchanged in the abstract (for Brgy. Banago).

2.   In addition, the mission was provided by the PMO a copy of the validation reports prepared by the
     Internal Monitor Unit and these were also considered by the Bank's Designated Procurement
     Specialist (DPS) during the review. The validation reports included a total of99 subprojects (out of
     the total 789 subprojects reported as either completed or on-going as of end-February 2013) broken

     Of these 99 subprojects, 2 subprojects were also reviewed by the Bank's DPS, which reduces the
     number to 97. Over-all, the total number of subprojects that had been reviewed prior to and during
     the mission is 101. Adding the seven (7) subprojects reviewed by the Bank's DPS during the
     previous mission, a total of 108 subprojects would have been reviewed to date, and this number
     represents 13.7% of the total number of subprojects that have been reported as completed as of end-
     February 2013. This percentage complies with the Bank's ex-post review requirement of 10% for the
     project.

3. The detailed list of subprojects covered by the validation reports, and the findings are shown in the
   attached table. These findings were provided to DSWD for compliance, and the PMO was requested
   by the mission to provide the Bank a copy of all compliance reports as well.

4. For the MBG component, a review of the procurement documents for the subproject in Brgy.
   Sefegefen in Upi, Maguindanao was undertaken during the site visit, and the review found a number
   of deficiencies as follows: i) disbursement vouchers not signed received by the suppliers; ii) purchase
   orders undated and not received by the suppliers; iii) abstract of canvass not dated and also not signed
   by members of the Procurement Team; and iv) in one case, award seemed to have been made not to
   the lowest quotation received, further review showed award made to supplier who quoted "free
   delivery" which is not quoted by the other two suppliers.

The validation reports by the PMOs Internal Monitor Unit were also looked into, and three (3) MBG
subprojects in Tawi-Tawi (Municipalities ofBongao, Sitangkai and Tandubas) were included in the
review. The review, however, showed that procurement documents were not available; hence a proper
review of the procurement transactions could not be made. The Bank's DPS also reviewed the documents
of two (2) subprojects filed at the PMO (for the Municipalities of Ampatuan and Datu Paglas in
Maguindanao ), and since these were RFRs (request for funds releases) for the 1st tranche, there are also
no procurement documents included. The PMOs Procurement Officer visited these two sites in
Maguindanao, together with the Bank's Infrastructure consultant, and reported that only a copy of the
quotations received from three suppliers for various construction materials was available in Municipality
of Ampatuan, while not at all for the Municipality of Datu Paglas.

         ARMM SOCIAL FUND PROJECT (ASFP) -Additional Financing (LN 7912-PH)
           FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT
                    February 4 to 8, 2013 (Updated in Apri13, 2013)

 1. Objective and scope of review A review of the implementation of the financial management (FM)
arrangements of the of the ARMM Social Fund Project - Additional Financing (LN 7912-PH) and
compliance with the financial covenants under the Loan Agreement was conducted from February 4 to 8,
2013 by the World Bank's FM Consultant, Mohammad Zidni S. Marohombsar at the ASFP-Project
Management Office (PMO). The review is aimed to ensure that the FM arrangements for the loan
continue to be adequate for the successful achievement of project development objectives. The review
included an assessment of the progress of the Additional Financing in terms of financial management
(FM) arrangements; review of selected transactions at the PMO; the status of actions in the previous Bank
mission; and evaluation of other FM concerns at the Project Management Office (PMO). Site visits were
also conducted in the municipalities of Sultan Mastura, Sultan Kudarat, Datu Paglas and Datu Abdullah
Sangki in Maguindanao Province to review selected People's Organizations' (POs) financial records and
their FM implementation at the community. During the Task Team's implementation support mission
from April 1- 5, 2013, the Bank's FM Specialist, Tomas A. Sta. Maria, Jr. followed up the
recommendations and provided updates on the disbursement status.

2. Overall financial management system rating Sound financial management arrangements are in
place and its implementation by the ASFP-PMO is still considered acceptable. There remain certain
concerns at both the Program and Community levels that need to be addressed but are assessed to be
manageable.

3. Status of disbursements for the loan - As of April 3, 2013, total documented disbursements
amounted to US$21.36 million (including the balance in the Designated Account of US$2.18 million) or
71.21% of the total loan amount ofUS$30.0 million.

As of February 28, 2013, community block grant totaling PhP 481.43 million (US$12.035 million) and
PhP 4.33 million (US$ 1.075 million) for MBG have been released to various POs. As ofthe same date,
operational funds intended for training, travel expenses, maintenance and repairs, totaling PhP221.43
million (US$5.53 million) were released to various DSWD ARMM Regional and Provincial Offices and
the DILG ARMM.

In relation to the loan's closing date on May 31,2013, the Bank has recovered a total ofUS$820 thousand
(PhP1.80 million) since December 2012 from withdrawal applications nos. 37 to 41. The request by the
ASFP-PMO for an extension of the closing date is currently being processed by the Bank. In view of the
request for extension, the ASFP PMO shall request to defer further recovery of the DA and shall submit
withdrawal applications for additional advance to maximize the ceiling.

4. Adequacy of accounting staff and maintenance of accounting records There were no significant
changes in the FM staffing arrangements at the ASFP-PMO. The FM structure and staffing at the PMO
were retained, particularly those of critical functions such as the Finance and Admin Department (FAD)
Director, the Finance Head, the Accountants and the Cashier. The FAD also has adequate FM staff in
terms of number and qualification to undertake the financial management affairs of the project.

The Director leads the FAD in handling the financial management arrangements of the project. The FAD
Director is being assisted by the Finance Head that is involved in the review and approval process of
financial documents and reports. The current staff members under the Finance Department include two
(2) Accountants, two (2) Accounting Clerks, a Cashier and an Assistant Cashier, which perform their
corresponding functions in the financial planning, budgeting, processing and reviewing of financial

                                             Page 28 of38
transactions, facilitation of timely release and disbursement of funds, evaluation and analysis of claims for
payments, maintenance of the journal and books of accounts under NGAS, and preparation of financial
reports. Separate books of accounts to record project financial transactions are maintained. Trial balance
as of December 31, 2012, was made available during the FM review.

5. Internal Controls and Internal Audit Unit- There is proper segregation of incompatible duties and
responsibilities. Physical controls over cash, documents and records remain adequate. Levels of review
and approval are also considered generally adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the policies and
procedures for recognition and recording assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are being complied
except for certain findings which are discussed below.

The ASFP-PMO Internal Audit Unit (IAU) structure remains the same. The IAU has continued to
implement its activities during the additional financing phase of the project, mainly conduct of financial,
operations and compliance audit of the activities of the project, particularly POs' operations in the
implementation of community development sub-projects. The IAU also tasked to conduct management
audit of all aspects of project implementation to ascertain compliance with policies and procedures in the
Operations and Financial Management Manuals.

The IAU had conducted review of various CDA sub-project implementation in 2012. During the mission,
the ASFP-PMO transmitted copies of the completed internal audit reports on the recent reviews
conducted by the IAU. It was agreed that PMO shall submit the updates on POs' compliance to audit
recommendations as soon as validation have been completed by DSWD Provinces but not later than May
10,2013.

7. Program Contract (PC2) Implementation with DILG ARMM - Under the second Program
Contract between ASFP PMO and DILG ARMM, a total amount of PhP10.231 million is budgeted for
the conduct of capacity building activities for the Municipal Technical Working Groups/Municipal Teams
on BDP/CIP Preparation. Out of this amount, PhP8.185 million will come from the Loan Proceeds and
PhP2.046 will come from the GOP counterpart funds. During implementation, the funds were

                                               Page 30 of38
The mission noted that some requests for replenishments by DILG ARMM were not fully accepted/
replenished by ASFP PMO due to lacking or deficient documentation. Hence, the amounts actually
replenished were lower than the amounts requested. At the end of the Program Contract however, the
amounts allocated were fully disbursed but an amount totaling PhP4.51 million still needs to be
documented /liquidated by DILG ARMM.

The mission recommended the following:
   • PMO to communicate with DILG on the need to liquidate all funds downloaded to them;
   • Provide DILG the list of previously submitted liquidations/ replenishments which need additional
       supporting documents or were considered not acceptable;
   • Request DILG to reconcile discrepancies in the Fund Utilization Reports vs Statement of
       Expenditures (Amounts reported in Fund Utilization Reports do not tally with those reported in
       SOE)

8.    Other FM Concerns -

     A. The mission noted that in one instance, the cash advance granted to the FAD Director amounting
         to PhP2.3 million exceeded the maximum accountability of PhP 1 million indicated in the
         approved Bond by the Bureau of Treasury. Further, the ASFP-PMO has yet to post bond for the
         PM as the head of agency. The ASFP-PMO Finance should assess adequacy of bonds posted and
        the need to post bond for the PM to promote effective and efficient cash management.
     B. As of the end of the 3rd Quarter of2012, the Grievance Redress System (GRS) has received 152
         queries and complaints regarding sub-project implementation (i.e., sub-project fund releases,
        delayed salaries, deviation from sub-project processes, etc.) The ASFP-PMO has not received
         feedback on issues concerning DSWD and the actions it has taken. The ASFP-PMO should
        monitor status and resolution of all issues raised in the GRS,· provide the Bank with the details for
        complaints or queries received as of December 31, 2012, including its status and actions taken on
        or before May 15, 2013; and include a quarterly report of the grievances involving financial
        management, disbursement and procurement (i.e., details, status, and actions taken) in the IFR
        beginning in the submission for the quarter ending March 31, 2013.
     C. The ASFP-PMO Finance monitors fund releases and counterpart contributions of each sub-project
        through a consolidated report it maintains. The said report, however, do not include the liquidated
        amount by POs, particularly for completed sub-projects. There were also sub-projects that still
        have no actual counterpart made. The ASFP-P MO Finance should ensure proper and complete
        liquidation by the POs of block grants by: including in its monitoring report the liquidations it has
        received and validated; and coordinate with DSWD Provincial Teams to monitor and follow up
        POs on liquidations and counterpart contributions.
     D. Program funds under PIA 09 released to DSWD-Lanao Del Sur A exceeded its approved amount
        by PhP781.52 thousand. The amount was subsequently refunded to ASFP-PMO. However, at the
        time of mission, the schedule of fund releases showed another excess amount of funds downloaded
        to Lanao del Sur B amounting to PhP64 7 thousand. ASFP PMO committed to deduct the amount
        from the funds to be downloaded to LSB under PIA 011.

8. Compliance with the financial covenants -The Project remained updated in submitting required
financial reports within due dates. (a) Audited Project Financial Statements- Financial reports for 2012
are expected to be completed within February 2013 for immediate submission to COA. The FAD was
reminded to submit to the Bank the 2012 audited financial statements not later than June 30, 2013. (b)
Quarterly Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) The 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarter IFRs for 2012 were
submitted to the Bank within due dates. The IFRs were reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. The
1st quarter IFR for 2013 will be due by May 14, 2013.

  10. Status of Agreed Actions from Previous Mission- Previous agreed action plans were satisfactorily
  complied.          ·

  11. Recent Action Plan- The following actions has been agreed with the PMO.

 ceiling.                                                              ·
 2. ASFP PMO shall submit the updates on POs' compliance to audit                                                                                                                                                                  IAU

PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/indicators:

The table below captures the proposed changes to the Results Framework, including a brief
explanation of the reason for each change. The overall thrust of the revisions is to: (i)
accommodate relevant Core Sector Indicators; (ii) add an indicator on increased consumption to
strengthen the link to the PDO objective of reducing poverty; (iii) simplify the Results Framework
by eliminating duplication and reducing the number of indicators for which no credible data is
available or which are not completely relevant to the PDQ or an Intermediate Outcome; and (iv)
update targets for the final year of the project in light of the proposed one-year extension of the
closing date.
