the south-\n            western region to the rest of the country in order to\n            stimulate economic growth by facilitating inter-regional,\n            cross-river transport of passengers and freight, and\n            transmission of natural gas, telecommunication and\n            electricity in a cost effective manner. There are five\n            components to the project, the first component being main\n            bridge and approach roads. This component will include\n            construction of foundation, substructure and superstructure\n            of the main bridge and services on the bridge, road\n            viaducts, approach roads, toll plazas and bridge end\n            facilities. This would be a 'rail ready' road\n            bridge. The second component is the river training works.\n            The third component is the implementation of social action\n            and environmental management plans. This component will\n            support implementation of the social action plan including\n            the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP), public health action,\n            gender action, charland monitoring and public consultation\n            plans. The fourth component is the construction supervision,\n            monitoring and evaluation of the project impact and social\n            and environmental management plans. This component will\n            cover the cost of consulting and other services for project\n            implementation, including construction supervision and\n            project management support. Finally, the fifth component is\n            the project management support, capacity building of\n            Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "2011-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
