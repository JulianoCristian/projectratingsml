The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) was approved by the Board of
Directors on February 24, 2011. The project was designed to connect the isolated
southwestern region with the rest of the country, as well as reduce travel times country-
wide and connect the country’s two seaports. The bridge would also have completed the
corridor connecting Tokyo and Istanbul, benefitting trade throughout the region.

Subsequently, the Bank investigated allegations of corruption and provided evidence to
the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), which referred these to the Anti-Corruption
Commission of Bangladesh (ACC). In April 2012, the Bank provided further evidence to
the GoB, and also specified conditions that would need to be met for the financing to
continue to be made available for the project. On June 29, 2012, the Bank informed the
GoB that, in the absence of satisfaction of these conditions, it had decided to terminate
the legal agreements with immediate effect. Subsequently, the Bank reached an
agreement with the GoB on the appointment by the Bank of an External Expert Panel to
assess the adequacy of the Government’s investigation of the allegations. Following
completion of the Panel’s report, the GoB informed the Bank on January 31, 2013 that it
was withdrawing its request for World Bank financing for the Padma Bridge project.
