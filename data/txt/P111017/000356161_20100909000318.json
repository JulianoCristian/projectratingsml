Multipurpose Bridge Project for Bangladesh is to\n            establish a permanent road crossing, including a provision\n            for a future railway crossing over the Padma River,\n            replacing the existing unreliable and unsafe ferries.\n            Negative impacts include: air quality, noise pollution,\n            surface water quality, traffic, groundwater quality,\n            riverbed sediment quality, and stockpiling of dredged\n            material. Mitigation measures include: 1) use piling system\n            with lowest sound generation, silent sleepers on bridge; 2)\n            consider creation of an artificial char at a location with\n            low erosion; 3) clearance from relevant environmental\n            authorities; 4) suitable waste disposal and processing\n            facilities; 5) restrict movement of vessels, barges,\n            dredgers to designated areas; 6) keep night-time activities\n            to a minimum; and 7) speed reduction devices on bridge for traffic/train."}, "docdt": "2010-09-06T00:00:00Z"}
