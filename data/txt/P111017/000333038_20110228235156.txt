                              Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                       February 24, 2011


        The Executive Directors approved the Credit for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project
for the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh in the amount of SDR779.3 million (US$1.2 billion
equivalent) on the terms and conditions set out in the President's Memorandum.

        Executive Directors expressed strong support for this transformative investment which
will connect the isolated southwest region, the home of about 30 million people, to the rest of the
country. Directors endorsed the World Bank's role as the coordinating financier and took note of
the strong Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), the envisaged robust social and
environmental safeguard measures, and the implementation arrangements. They underscored the
need for careful monitoring of the governance, fiduciary, as well the social and environmental
aspects of this technically challenging operation, and the proper coordination among the
cofinanciers.
