PADMA BRIDGE AND\n            SOUTH WEST REGION", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "A prefeasibility study for the Padma\n            Multipurpose Bridge Project was carried out in 2000. It\n            investigated a number of potential alignments for the\n            proposed bridge. On the basis of the outcome of that study\n            Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), at the\n            request of Government of Bangladesh (GOB), carried out a\n            feasibility study (FS) in 2002-2004. This study concluded\n            that the most feasible bridge site is at Mawa-Janjira point.\n            The selection of this site was subsequently approved by GOB.\n            The FS included, among others, a preliminary technical\n            design, economic and financial evaluation, a framework for\n            land acquisition and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP),\n            Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), and an\n            Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). As the FS concluded\n            that Padma Bridge is economically viable, GOB moved forward\n            for implementation and accordingly BBA conducted a study to\n            update the previous EIA and to prepare an Environmental\n            Management Plan (EMP), a Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and a\n            Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in 2006. The Asian\n            Development Bank (ADB) also conducted a FS including an EIA\n            and resettlement plan in 2007. The studies formed the basis\n            for the decision of GOB to proceed with second phase, which\n            includes the detailed engineering design and implementation\n            of the project funded by an ADB technical assistance (TA)\n            loan. In 2009 a safeguard team on environmental and social\n            issues, and part of the design consultant's team,\n            started the detailed EIA study in accordance with the\n            relevant laws and regulations in Bangladesh and EIA\n            guidelines of all the co-financiers. The main development\n            objective of the project is to establish a permanent road\n            crossing, including a provision for a future railway\n            crossing over the Padma River, replacing the existing\n            unreliable and unsafe ferries."}, "docdt": "2010-09-06T00:00:00Z"}
