                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) is expecting plot allocation to start by October 2011 and household construction and relocation by end of 2011.
                         The staffing in the social and environmental unit is satisfactory but the next 12 months is a critical period and BBA will need to accelerate its mobilization and move into full
                         implementation mode.
                         The final draft Public Communication strategy has been completed and BBA has been requested to accelerate the recruitment process to start this line of work as soon as possible.
