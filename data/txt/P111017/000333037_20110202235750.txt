I.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT

 A. Country Context

 1.   Bangladesh, with an average of about 1,084 inhabitants per square kilometers, is among the most
 densely-populated countries in the world. It remains a low-income country, with a per capita income of
 US$ 645 (Atlas method) in FY10 and an estimated 40 percent of its population living in poverty.

 2.     Geography is a strong determinant of Bangladesh's development. The country is bounded by India
 on the west, north, and north-east, Myanmar on the south-east, and the Bay of Bengal on the south.
 Eighty percent of its area consists of floodplains created by more than 300 rivers and channels, including
 three major rivers: the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. Bangladesh forms only a small part of
 a large regional hydrologic system--less than 10 percent of the river basin falls within the national
 territory. Its southern part is nestled in the Bay of Bengal with a 710 km long coastal belt that is home to
 nearly 35 million people. Bangladesh's geographical position and very high population density makes it
 extremely vulnerable to natural disasters including floods, droughts, and cyclones. Global climate change
 has magnified these vulnerabilities.

 3.     Due to this dynamic riverine morphology, the development of transport and communication
 networks across the floodplain is a challenge, particularly the construction of fixed crossings over major
 rivers. The first fixed crossing across the Brahmaputra/Jamuna River was undertaken in 1998 with the
 construction of the Jamuna Bridge, which connected the eastern part of the country to the north-west.
 The proposed Padma Multipurpose Bridge will be the second large fixed crossing, and will connect the
 southwest region (SWR) with the rest of the country.

 4.    The Project is a centerpiece of the country assistance strategy (CAS) for fiscal year (FY) F2011-14
 which would support Bangladesh's ambitions by contributing to accelerated, sustainable and inclusive
 growth, underpinned by stronger governance at central and local levels. The project is expected to have a
 transformative impact on the socio-economic development of the country as a whole, and on the
 southwest region in particular.

 5.     Economic Developments. Despite periods of political turmoil and frequent natural disasters, the
 past decade in Bangladesh has been marked by sustained growth, stable macroeconomic management,
 significant poverty reduction and rapid social transformation and human development. During FY01-09,
 GDP grew by a healthy 5.8 percent per annum (including 6.3 percent per annum in FY06-09),
 accelerating by one percentage point compared to the previous decade. Despite natural disasters and
 political volatility, GDP growth has been remarkably stable, with a low standard deviation of 0.7 during
 this decade (half the volatility of growth in the 1980s). Growth has been led by industry and services
 sectors, while agriculture - as in other South Asian countries ­ has performed less well with an average
 annual growth rate of only 3 percent. Remittances and exports have been twin drivers of the Bangladeshi
 economy as well as the balance of payments.

 6.     Sustained macroeconomic stabilization measures have underpinned GDP growth, and resulted in
 lower inflation and smaller internal/external balances in the 1990s and the past decade. Responsible fiscal
 and monetary policies have kept inflation in single digits. Fiscal prudence has also kept public borrowing
 in check, preventing the crowding out of private investment. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary discipline
 along with periodic adjustments in the exchange rate, have helped keep the external sector in balance. On
 the structural side, wide-ranging reforms have increased the market orientation of the economy. These
 include easing of trade and exchange restrictions, relaxation of restrictions on private investment, reform
 of state-owned banks, and deepening of agriculture reforms. The country has a relatively low risk of debt
 distress. Continued prudent foreign borrowing amid robust economic growth and recent real appreciation
 of the taka has put the external debt to GDP ratio on a declining path. However, if domestic public debt is

                                                      1
also taken into account, the risk of debt distress is somewhat more elevated, with the ratio of total public
debt to GDP projected to remain at around 44 percent of GDP over the medium term.

7.     The recent economic performance of Bangladesh continues to be encouraging as: (a) the global
economic crises did little to dampen growth in Bangladesh so far, with real GDP growing at around 5.8
percent in last two years showing only a slight deceleration from FY04-08; (b) inflationary pressures
arose largely due to increase in food prices ; (c) the overall fiscal deficit remained at 4 percent (same as
in FY09) and external current account surplus has increased (over 50% higher than last year), foreign
exchange reserves, currently stand at around US$11 billion or equivalent of about 5.5 month of imports;
(d) a low risk of debt distress based on external debt as shown by the joint IMF-World Bank debt
sustainability analysis. Over medium term, strong economic growth is likely to be sustained in
Bangladesh and real GDP growth is projected to be around 6.1-6.3% in FY11 although downside risks
remain, particularly related to serious energy shortages. Growth of around 6 percent per annum is
insufficient to achieve Bangladesh's goals for development and poverty reduction. The country aims to
boost growth to at least 8 percent per annum to achieve middle-income status by 2021. To do so in an
inclusive way that maximizes poverty reduction, Government will need to dramatically upgrade energy
and transport infrastructure. The Padma bridge is an important aspect of unlocking isolated regions and
populations, enhancing connectivity for economic activity throughout the country and fostering better
links to neighboring India and beyond for long-term trade, investment and growth.

8.     Public Expenditure and Development Budget. The FY11 budget is moderately expansionary,
in the face of uncertain global prospects. Its successful implementation will hinge on the rapid execution
of fiscal reforms aimed at increasing the tax take and improving Annual Development Program (ADP)
implementation. Overall, the budget deficit is projected to rise to 5 percent of GDP from the
Government's expected FY10 outturn of 4 percent of GDP. The rise in deficit is projected to be financed
entirely through domestic borrowing. Consequently, domestic financing of the deficit is projected to rise
from 2.0 percent of GDP in the FY10 revised budget to 3.0 percent in the FY11 budget, while external
financing would remain unchanged at 2 percent of GDP. The primary deficit (overall budget deficit minus
interest) is projected to increase from 2.4 percent of GDP in FY10 to 3.2 percent in FY11.

9.      Fiscal space for development spending--including for large-scale infrastructure projects--is quite
limited in Bangladesh, with the Annual Development Program (government's capital budget) for this year
equivalent to only about 5 percent of GDP, up from less than 4 percent the year before. About half is
financed from external resources. Government has budgeted its counterpart contributions for the PMBP
within the prioritization of the Annual Development Program this year. The PMBP is more than 80
percent foreign-financed, and the project is self-financing through future bridge tolls. Therefore, future
debt service or other Padma-related public spending will not crowd out development spending in the
future.

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context

10.      Bangladesh has a vast network of highways and rural roads, inland waterways, two seaports,
maritime shipping, a railway system, and civil aviation and a national airliner. Yet, this has not always
been the case. At the time of the Indian sub-continent's partition in 1947, the landmass comprising
today's Bangladesh was served primarily by a network of inland waterways that provided informal boat
services to isolated rural communities and some long-distance cargo and passenger services. The road
network was almost non-existent, with only 600 km of narrow paved roads. The railways inherited from
the British Indian Railway system were a disjointed network of about 2,800 km in route length, separated
by the Jamuna/Padma River with two separate and incompatible gauges.

11.    From this low-level of transport endowment, Bangladesh has made big strides to develop a
modern transport system to support the needs of a developing economy. Most of the improvement has
happened in the roads, followed by the ports and civil aviation. The road network expanded to an
                                                     2
impressive 271,000 km. Bangladesh has developed major road corridors connecting Dhaka with key
economic centers and towns, and a network of village roads connecting communities to market centers
and the main roads. New bridges connect communities with road transport and integrate whole regions,
including the Jamuna Bridge (with official name as Bangabandhu Bridge) which combined roadways, a
rail track and a natural gas pipeline, providing uninterrupted northeast-northwest road and rail connection
for the first time. Completion of the Jamuna Bridge had a transformational effect on the Northwest
Region, and the proposed Padma Bridge is expected to do the same for the Southwest region.

12.     Transport demand has grown vigorously. The economic expansion and social development
witnessed in Bangladesh since independence was accompanied by rapid growth in transport demand, at 9
percent per year. Much of this growth was met by road transport, which emerged as a dominant mode of
transport over the years. The share of passenger transport demand provided by road transport increased
from 54 percent in 1975 to 88 percent in 2005, while rail declined from 30 to 4 percent and inland water
transport from 16 to 8 percent. A similar change also happened for freight transport demand.

13.      The key challenges the transport sector faces include: (a) Road transport falls short of quality
and safety. Roads have been under-maintained, and rural roads should better benefit the poor; (b)
Bangladesh Railway has played a limited role in the economy, due to the limited infrastructure, poor
condition of the physical assets, and low efficiency of services vis-à-vis competing transportation modes.
Railway reform is urgently needed; (c) Inland waterways system is not used to its full potential, due in
part to inadequate dredging and shortage of berthing facilities. While lack of resources is the main cause,
the quality of sector management and services provided by the operators has also contributed to inland
water transport's overall decline; (d) Seaports are a bottleneck to trade. Due to several reforms in the last
few years, Chittagong Port has achieved large improvements in port efficiency (turn-around time for
container ships) and in the reduction of cost of doing business. The country's other seaport, Mongla, is
grossly under-used because among other things, there is no bridge over the Padma River to facilitate road
and rail connections to Dhaka; (f) State airline is struggling to survive. A major reform in air transport
occurred in 2007 when the state-owned Biman Bangladesh Airlines became a public limited company. A
more rewarding approach for Government efforts may be to aid the Bangladeshi private carriers to
acquire Biman's route operating rights, and to negotiate royalties with foreign carriers wishing to fly into
Dhaka.

14.      Budget for Transport Sector. The dense land use and the flat terrain are advantages when it
comes to supplying infrastructure. Countries with such advantages need to spend a smaller share of GDP
to ensure connectivity to their population: 1.5-2 percent of GDP may be adequate, if well used and
sustained over time. Public expenditure in the transport sector was Taka 413 billion ($6.7 billion) during
fiscal years 2002-3 to 2006-07. This constituted about 2.2 percent of GDP, which is comparable to many
other countries in the world. Of this, 69 percent was allocated to development projects through the
Annual Development Plan, and 31 percent was allocated to recurrent and maintenance expenditure
through the Revenue Budget. Adding in funds to clear the backlog of deferred maintenance, 2.5 percent
of GDP may be a reasonable budget share, recognizing other priorities that the Government has to fund.
That said, Bangladesh faces the special challenges of financing certain mega-projects of long-term
significance to the structuring of the economy, which are hard to reconcile with the regular budgets: the
proposed Padma Bridge, the rail-based mass transit network for Dhaka that is being debated, and
expansion of capacity on the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor ­road or rail or both.

15.     The state budget is small: government revenues are only 11 percent of GDP. Funding these
mega-projects will require either an exceptional share of the state budget at its present level, or a big
increase in the collection of tax revenues. Perhaps most practical in short to medium run is to structure
such investments to be self-financing through collection of tolls, as was the case for the Jamuna Bridge.

16.     Transport Sector Institutions. Four separate line ministries ­communication (road, rail and
bridges), shipping (inland water transport and ports), aviation and local government (rural roads)--plus
                                                     3
other ministries such as planning and finance, are involved in the transport sector. In addition, there are
nine parastatals. The result has been a lack of integrated sector planning and policy development. The
second issue is the poor performance of most of the transport parastatals. The implementation of
transport policy approved in April 2004 is also hampered by the weak institutional framework governing
the sector.

17.       For construction of the Jamuna Bridge, the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA)
was established in 1985. At completion of the Jamuna Bridge, the BBA was established by GoB by a
gazette notification (October 6, 2009) by amendment to the JMBA Ordinance. The BBA is headed by an
Executive Director with status of a Secretary of GoB. Subsequently, by Cabinet Division's Gazette
notification on March 31, 2008, two divisions were created under the Ministry of Communication
(MOC), the Roads and Railways Division, and the Bridges Division. BBA is now an authority under the
Bridges Division with a Board. The Executive Director of BBA is concurrently the Secretary of the
Bridges Division. The mandate of the BBA is development and O&M of the bridges having length of 1.5
kilometers or more, flyovers, toll roads, elevated expressways, causeways, etc.

18.        BBA is a relatively lean and more effective organization than other transport sector institutions.
It performance has been good in planning and development of Jamuna Bridge and also in preparation of
feasibility studies, designs, other preparatory work for the Padma Bridge. Though it has full mandate and
authority to take all decisions related to planning, financing, development procurement and O&M of
infrastructure it owns, in practice it refers key issues to the MOC and the Cabinet for decision. It lacks
capacity in carrying out development of large infrastructure projects which is being strengthened. Given
that BBA is a separate authority and not a department of MOC, and given the nature of PMBP with just a
few large international contracts, the project can be effectively implemented by strengthening BBA
(which started through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) funds and will continue throughout the
project period) and proper ring-fencing as proposed under implementing arrangements for the Project.

Southwest Region (SWR)

19.      Bangladesh is divided into four major regions by the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers 1
(see Map IBRD 38325). Of particular relevance to this project is the southwest region (SWR), which
covers approximately 27 percent of the country and contains nearly a quarter of its population. At the
time of independence from Great Britain in 1947, this region lost a major trade connection to Calcutta,
which was a major commercial center and trading hub for the region. Today, this region has remained
one of the least developed parts of Bangladesh, primarily due to lack of connectivity to the rest of the
country.

20.      The proportion of the population below the poverty line in the SWR remains about 5 percentage
points higher than in the rest of the country. Taking the core districts of the SWR, Khulna and Barisal, 2
the difference of percentage of population under poverty line is even more glaring--almost 10 percentage
points higher than the national average. This region includes several upazilas with the highest incidences
of extreme poverty; the two poorest districts in the country are in the south-west region. Household
income and expenditure data also show a similar difference between the SWR and the rest of the country.
Besides loss of old trade connections and limited linkages with growing centers of activity (that explain
the region's slow growth of manufacturing and other non-farm activities), agricultural growth has been
comparatively slow in this area. This is due to the lack of access to markets and soil degradation due to
saline intrusion and lack of fresh water in the dry seasons.

1
  The Brahmaputra River on entry into Bangladesh is called the Jamuna River. The Ganges River upon entry into Bangladesh is
called the Padma River. The river is called the Padma River after the confluence of the Padma and Jamuna Rivers. When the
Meghan River joins from the eastern side it is called Meghna River and discharges into the Bay of Bengal.
2
   The core southwest area would include the following zilas: Bagherhat, Barguna,Barisal,Bhola, Chuadanga, Faridpur,
Gopalganj,Jessore, Jhalokhati, Jhenaidah, Khulna, Kushtia, Madaripur, Magura, Meherpur,Narail,Patuakhali. Pirojpur, Rajbari,
Shariatpur and Sathkira
                                                              4
21.      Compounding isolation and relative poverty, the SWR is more vulnerable than other regions to
natural calamities. The incidence of cyclones and tidal floods and impact of climate change are more
pronounced in this region. This area was severely affected by two recent cyclones--Sidr in 2007 and Aila
in 2009. The communities in this region also face several unique geographical challenges. For example,
saline groundwater in the SWR makes groundwater irrigated agriculture impossible, especially during the
dry season. The region also contains areas that are the most vulnerable to climate change and sea level
rise.

22.     The SWR suffers from transport and road bottlenecks. The most important bottleneck is the lack
of a bridge on the Padma River, which keeps the region more isolated from the eastern and north-east
areas. Besides this lack of connection, the density of other road and transportation systems is much less
developed than in other regions. The SWR river transportation system is facing increasing congestion
and problems of siltation. At present, six river ports in the SWR are operating at levels much below
capacity due to a lack of proper dredging and maintenance.

23.      The SWR has the second largest sea port of the country--Mongla port-- which is operating at 20
percent of its capacity. The key constraints facing Mongla port include the following: (i) absence of a
bridge over the Padma river that adds to the long travel time between Dhaka and Mongla (even though
the road distance between Dhaka and Mongla is shorter than Chittagong --170 km versus 264 km --the
travel time is longer due to the absence of a bridge); (ii) the decline in jute exports, which used to be the
main cargo for Mongla port; (iii) the lack of a rail connection between Mongla port and the existing rail
network and obsolete handling equipment at the port; and (iv) the draft restriction in the port channels due
to chronic siltation problem. Padma Bridge will ease the key constraint of travel time and difficulty,
while other constraints can be removed by additional, selective investments.

24.      The SWR has a limited supply of power. Rural electrification in this region is much less
developed than in other regions: only 24% of rural households in the Barisal division have electricity
connections, compared to 35% nationally. A survey of rural enterprises shows that the enterprises in
Khulna and Barisal areas use modern sources of power (such as gas and electricity) much less frequently
than in other regions.

25.      Characteristics of Padma River. The Padma is the third largest river in the world in terms of
mean average annual discharge and the second largest river in terms of sediment transport. The Padma
River is fundamentally different from its two tributaries, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. While the Ganges
is a more-predictably meandering river, in places contained by natural nodal points, the Brahmaputra is
one of the largest braided sand-bed rivers in the world, characterized by short temporal bursts of erosion
and deposition. The combined flow forms the young Padma River. While it flows mostly as a single
thread channel at the bridge area, there have been periods when multiple channels occur. At present the
Padma is in a stage of transforming again from a straight channel at the bridge site into a meandering one.
This means the existing south bank upstream of the bridge will likely experience major erosion again.
Historically, the location where the bridge is to be built has not been stable and major parts of the south
bank approach road are situated on young deposits of old major channels. Since 2005, the river has
eroded about 0.5 km of the south bank. However, this location is better than the available alternatives. In
contrast, the north (Mawa) bank is characterized by very slow erosion processes and can be termed as
quite stable. For more information on the river morphology and hydraulics see Annex 2.1.

26.      The Proposed Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is a large-scale infrastructure
project that will significantly benefit diverse sectors of the economy in Bangladesh. Currently, the Padma
River isolates the SWR of Bangladesh from other parts of the country. Despite substantial improvements
and development in the road network in Bangladesh, this zone remains beyond the advantages of an
integrated road network due to the lack of a bridge over the Padma River. Currently, transportation
between the SWR and the rest of the country across the Padma River can only be done by ferry. The
capacity of ferry services is very limited, given the waiting time at ferry ghats (docking stations) of more
                                                        5
than 2 hours for buses and light vehicles and more than 10 hours for trucks. In addition, the riverbanks of
the Padma are unstable, leaving approach ferry ghats seasonally inoperative. The expansion of existing
ferry terminals is difficult due to these conditions.

27.      The proposed bridge will provide direct links between two major seaports of the country and will
be an integral part of the Asian Highway No 1 and Trans-Asian railway network systems (Sylhet-
Kanchpur-Dhaka-Mawa-Jessore-Benapole, connecting Calcutta to the eastern part of India on the eastern
side of Bangladesh). The distance from Dhaka to nearly all major destinations in the SWR will be
reduced by 100 kilometers (km) or more with greater reduction in transport time. A multi-purpose bridge
will enhance freight, passenger transportation, and utility crossings (high pressure gas transmission, high
voltage power transmission, and optical fiber telecommunication cable) between Dhaka and major points
in the southwest zone. It will contribute substantially to the development of the southwest zone as well as
to national and regional economic growth. The Project will boost the GDP of the SWR and the country
and generate substantial employment opportunities. Its river training works will also help control river
erosion in these areas which is a recurrent acute problem in Bangladesh and one of the major causes of
landlessness and extreme poverty.

28.      Plans for Development of Railway in the Southwest Region. Bangladesh Railway (BR) is a
large Government undertaking and employs 37,000 staff. Its network comprises 2,835 km of railway
track. In FY 2008, BR carried 53.8 million passengers and 3.3 million tons of freight. In the SWR, BR is
currently running 134 passenger trains and 20 freight trains daily. Because of a missing link between
Dhaka and Southwest, regional movement of passenger and freight by railway suffered. Once the Padma
Bridge is built, the railway connection between Dhaka and the SWR can be developed. This would lead
to manifold increase in the movement of passenger and goods between Dhaka and SWR and movement of
freight between Dhaka-Mongla port reducing the congestion at the Chittagong port

29.       The Bangladesh Railway has taken up a scheme of four projects (Dhaka-Mawaa-Janjira-Bhanga-
link, Faridpur-Pakuria link, Bhanga-Jessore link, and Bhanga-Barisal link) of constructing new railway
lines to connect Dhaka over the Padma Bridge and southwest region (308 km of new railway track) with
an estimated cost of about US$ 1.5 billion. A plan has been prepared for these rail connections for which
implementation could take a decade to get underway. The railway on Padma Bridge will form part of the
Trans Asian railway, provision for the Indian dedicated freight network loading has been kept on the
bridge. This would be a rail-ready bridge, and the track will be put in place when the link between Dhaka
and SWR is established. The railway line was also established a few years after the opening of the
Jamuna Bridge.

30.      Regional connectivity. Padma Bridge is an important transport infrastructure to ensure physical
continuity along the longest corridor defined under the Asian Highway Network 3 linking Tokyo to
Istanbul (AH1: 20,557 km or 12,845 miles). At regional level, AH1 runs from Kabul to Dhaka, via
Lahore, Delhi and Kolkata. Beyond improving significantly the road connection between two major
highly populated urban areas of the South Asian Region, i.e., Kolkata (16 million inhabitants) and Dhaka
(12 million inhabitants) and opening a continuous road connection between the SWR and Dhaka, Padma
Bridge also opens alternative routes for the North Western Region of Bangladesh for using Mongla port,
the second major port in Bangladesh. Beyond Bangladesh, trade to/from Nepal would also directly
benefit from Padma Bridge, offering a competitive alternative in the current use of the highly congested
port of Kolkata for Nepalese trade.

 The Asian Highway (AH) project, also known as the Great Asian Highway, is a cooperative project among countries in Asia
and Europe and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), to improve the highway
systems in Asia. Agreements have been signed by 32 countries to allow the highway to cross the continent and also reach to
Europe. Some of the countries taking part in the highway project are India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China, Japan, South Korea and
Bangladesh

Southwest Region ­Comprehensive Development Program

31.     The bridge would have considerable spill-over (wider economic) effects. But these effects, as
well as direct (traffic) benefits, can be expanded with selected investments, in addition to the Padma
Bridge. In fact, to maximize the multiplier effects of the Padma Bridge Project, and to accelerate growth
and poverty reduction in the SWR, a more integrated and cross-sectoral approach would be highly
desirable. Given the mega investment, the Padma Bridge Project has to be used as an anchor investment
for other selective complementary and supplementary investments to fully exploit the opportunities
opened by the bridge for the SWR, and thereby help contribute to the growth and progress of the entire
country in a major way. The Bank and the GoB have started the preparation of a comprehensive
development program that would achieve this objective. The studies and preparation of program are still
ongoing and they are expected to be completed by June 2011, with the final report issued in October
2011.
32.      The preliminary findings of the on-going study on south-west development indicates that with the
opening of the bridge, the likely sources of growth of south-west region will consist of the following
activities: (a) South-west having considerable marshy land, fisheries will have a huge potential. Already
shrimp cultivation is an important activity and will likely become a significant source of growth. (b) In
crop agriculture, jute was an important cash crop in the region and recently its prospect of revival seems
stronger than before. Rice production will have better prospects especially with some saline-resistant rice
seeds. Besides, saline resistant rice, some crops (such as maize, mong-dal and chillies) are naturally saline
resistant and will have good prospects. Potato and oil-seed production also have good prospects. (c)
Livestock and poultry have been an important activity and will become even more important in future. (d)
As for agro-processing and manufacturing, dairy processing, fish processing and fish products, grain
milling and various food products; jute processing and jute textile manufacture, and saw milling and
furniture making, small and medium scale manufacturing have stronger prospects. With the opening of
the bridge and concomitant development of the region, one can expect migration of garment factories and
other industrial activities to the region. (e) Trade and tourism could be another important source of
growth. Besides internal trade, trade with India will receive a boost from lower transport time and cost.
With improved connectivity, tourism to some popular tourist spots (including the world-class Sundarban
mangrove forests) in coastal area of Barisal has strong prospects.

33.      Aside from the lack of a bridge over the Padma River, the study analyzed other constraints that
hinder growth of the region (as well as identified factors that hamper better coping of the natural
disasters). Based on preliminary findings, a tentative program has been developed consisting of
essentially two broad types: (a) additional, complementary investments that are needed to extend and
deepen the benefits already expected from commissioning of the bridge; and (b) adjustment or
realignment that will have to be made to take the bridge into account so that the existing development
programs become more effective and productive.

34.     Key elements of the program may include the following:

(i) Development of a multi-model transport linkage within SWRs and with Dhaka.
  (a) This includes western and southern bypass of Dhaka by a toll expressway to provide better access
      to the bridge for traffic from the north and west of Dhaka and from the Chittagong road now
      causing congestion in the Dhaka city, and widening of Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga road to provide a fast
      connection to SWR. This would be start of the Dhaka Beltway which can be completed by
      construction of eastern bypass. Dhaka beltway would also be the main element for reducing
      congestion and expansion of Dhaka metropolitan area that is becoming unlivable due to
      extraordinary density and congestion. Thus, in addition to improving connectivity to the Padma
      Bridge and SWR, this investment has substantial merits on its own due to the considerable impact
      it can have in reducing congestion in Dhaka city and its expansion;


                                                     7
  (b) Improvement of road and transport infrastructure in the SWR such as improvement of Mawa-
      Barisal-Patuakhali road, Mongla-Bagerhat-Khulna road, Patuakhali-Khulna road, Bhatiapara-
      Narial-Jessor-Benapole road, Faridpur-Barisal road, and Madripur-Bandar-Muktapure road. In
      addition, five smaller bridges will have to be completed to connect a few important urban centers
      and tourist spots in the region-- Patuakhali and Barisal coastal area.
  (c) Development of rail network in particular four links (i.e. Dhaka-Mawaa-Bhanga-Janjira, Faridpur-
      Pakuria, Bhanga-Jessore, and Bhanga-Barisal) covering about 308 km to connect SWR to Dhaka.
      In addition, there would be need for extension of a rail link to Mongla port particularly in the
      second phase of Mongla port development when the port is moved further out to the sea;

(ii) Revival of Mongla port, and establishment of export free zones. This is to be achieved in three
      phases, starting from improvement of the existing port facility, moving the port to an outer point or
      close to sea to avoid dredging issues and get better draft. The port closer to sea should be developed
      with facilities for import of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This would allow installation of a power
      generation plant close to the port and the electricity from which can be transmitted to SWR and
      Dhaka through the transmission line across the Padma River. Development of Mongla Port would
      be next pivotal investment for Bangladesh after the Padma Bridge around which additional
      investments can (such as imported gas based power plant) be centered to remove the constraints to
      growth and for the regional connectivity, transit and trade with other countries in the region;
(iii) Improved power connection and supply. To improve connectivity the electrical grid, the plan is to
      install new substations and to construct about 2,000 km of distribution lines. In the long run, this
      could be increased to about 1,500 MW of new electrical generation plants based on domestic and
      important gas as mentioned above close to Mongla and at Khula and Bhola where gas is available;
(iv) Maximizing farm and non-farm growth possibilities, diversification of crops and agriculture in saline
      environment, availing trade potential within the country due to connectivity and with India. This
      includes dairy and fish processing, in particular shrimp, saw milling, jute textile and jute-bailing.
      With transport and energy constraints removed the small and medium enterprises such as garment
      industry, export oriented small scale manufacturing etc. will have strong prospects for growth;
(v) Improved infrastructure and capability for disaster risk management, coastal and river bank
      protection and restoration of fresh water flows during dry season; and
(vi) Institutional development and capacity building of local, regional and national institutions to support
      the integrated development program, and provision of services, etc. which is crucial for
      implementation of the investments, realization and appropriate distribution of benefits and impact on
      poverty reduction.

35.      The preliminary estimates are that the cost of the comprehensive development program over 20
years would be about US$6 billion or about US$300 million per year. The phasing of each investment
under the program is to be done considering the absorptive capacity of the regional and national
institutions and by ensuring proper linkages with the ongoing and planned development program for the
region to realize full benefits of each investment. The program with proper phasing and planning will fit
within the available fiscal space under the development budget of the country. Besides improvements in
the existing road network and completing and improving any missing links, the highest priority would be
(a) the Dhaka Beltway which is to be developed in three phases over about 12-14 years period; (b)
Mongla port development also in three phases in about 15 years period; (c) power generation and
improving connectivity to the grid over a 10-12 year period; and (d) institutional development and reform
throughout the program period. The Bank and the Government are working together to include the
elements of this program into the Government development plan after the completion the SWR
Comprehensive Development Program.




                                                    8
 Rationale for Bank's involvement

 36.      The construction of the bridge over the Padma River is a top development priority agenda for the
 Government of Bangladesh (GoB) that will benefit not only the SWR, but the country as a whole. The
 Bank has a long history of partnership and collaboration with Bangladesh in the water and transport
 sectors, and is seen as a trusted partner and a coordinator for international financial institutions and other
 development partners. It has provided previous support to large scale infrastructure interventions
 including the financing of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge. Thus, the Bank has experience in delivering
 technically complex and challenging operations working with institutions with relatively low capacity and
 weak governance.

 37.      The Bank has also been providing support to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), the entity
 responsible for the Jamuna and Padma Bridges and all bridges longer than 1.5 km. The GoB not only
 regards the Bank as a primary source of financing but also a source of technical knowledge, professional
 and policy advice, and expertise in the sector. The Bank is viewed as an entity that can support strong
 management of a large international project (since the contracts will likely interest international
 contractors and consultants, BBA would have to deal with these contactors and possibly their
 Governments) and thus was asked by the GoB to provide a leading/coordinating role in the development
 and implementation of this Project. Given the governance environment in the country, the Bank has a
 comparative advantage in ensuring that the resources will be utilized effectively for the country. In sum,
 Bank is well placed to assist the country with this Project to support accelerated, sustainable growth in
 line with the CAS objectives.

 C. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

 38.      Bangladesh has ambitious aspirations of reaching middle-income country status and reducing the
 poverty rate from 40 percent to 15 percent of the population by 2021. To achieve this goal an annual
 growth rate of around eight percent per annum would be required. This would call for massive
 infrastructure investments both to stimulate the growth and to meet the requirements of the expanding
 economy. The Bank supports a goal for accelerated growth, and the Project is a centrepiece of the Bank's
 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY11-14. The Project contributes to the overarching goal of the
 country by connecting and making a large region more accessible. The analysis shows that the benefits of
 the Project would be equivalent to annual increase of at least 1.7 percent of SWR GDP in value and of the
 0.56 percent of annual increase of national GDP. The poverty reduction rate would increase by 1.0
 percentage points in the SWR and by 0.8 the percentage points at the national level. The impacts are
 quite similar to the Jamuna Bridge (connecting the Northwest Region to the country), which were
 estimated about five years after the opening of the bridge.

II.      PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE (PDO)

 A. PDO

 39.      The Project development objective is to connect the south- western region to the rest of the
 country in order to stimulate economic growth by facilitating inter-regional, cross-river transport of
 passengers and freight, and transmission of natural gas, telecommunication and electricity in a cost
 effective manner.

1. Project Beneficiaries.

 40.      The Project would provide benefits for diverse sectors of the economy in Bangladesh. The
 Project is transformational in nature with significant countrywide benefits. In particular, beneficiaries
 would be the people of the Southwest region (over 30 million people) who would be integrated into the
 rest of the country through safe and reliable linkages across the banks of the Padma River. The extent of
                                                       9
  benefits would vary depending upon vicinity to the bridge. The project impact area is classified into four
  main areas: local south zone, local north zone, south western Bangladesh and the rest of Bangladesh. The
  project would have positive benefits for households in all regions, but would have the highest benefits for
  the local south and north zones, followed by the south western Bangladesh and remaining Bangladesh
  (Table 1).

  41.     With the completion of the proposed Padma Bridge, distances to almost all the major destinations
  from Dhaka would be reduced by 100 km or more, and travel time would be reduced by 2 hours for cars
  and more than 10 hours for trucks. This would bring positive economic impacts for trade, transportation,
  agriculture, education, health and other sectors, to lives and livelihoods of the people in the region and the
  country as a whole. The benefits are clearly recognized by the local communities in the region.

  2.        PDO Level Results Indicators

  42.     Progress towards achieving the development objective will be measured through the following
  key performance indicators:

           ·     Connectivity between the Southwest region and rest of the country is established
           ·     Quantum of passenger and freight traffic crossing over the bridge and transmission of
                 natural gas and telecommunication systems over the Padma River;
           ·     River training works of bridge provide help in overall training of the river and areas in the
                 vicinity of the bridge are protected from river bank erosion;
           ·     Number of people directly benefiting from the bridge
           ·     Savings in travel time by the bridge users

  43.      Some of the indicators will see progress during the project period (such as completion of bridge
  etc.), or towards the project's end such as the quantum of passengers, number of people directly
  benefiting from the bridge and savings in travel time. Progress on several other indicators would be
  realized several years after the project completion. These include economic growth and poverty reduction
  as well as transmission of gas and electricity. As with the Jamuna Bridge Project, post evaluation studies
  would have to be initiated five and ten years after the project completion in order to assess the impact of
  the project on the region surrounding both sides of the river.

III.        PROJECT DESCRIPTION

  A. Project Components

  44.     The Project is designed to support the development objectives. The Project consists of the
  following components (See Annex 2 for more details):




                                                       10
Component A: Main Bridge and Approach Roads (US$1,626.2 million).

45.     This component will include construction of the foundation, substructure and superstructure of
the main bridge and services on the bridge, road viaducts, approach roads, toll plazas and various bridge
end facilities. This would be a "rail ready" road bridge. The bridge design incorporates adaptation to
impacts of long term climate change and can withstand earthquake loading.

    A1: Main Bridge and construction Yards (US$1,397.3 Million)

    A1.1: Main Bridge and viaducts (US$1,339.8 million). The main bridge would be about 6.15 km
    long consisting of a two-level steel truss bridge with a concrete top deck slab. It would accommodate
    a four lane divided highway on the top (about 22.5 meter wide) and would have provision for a single
    rail track on the lower deck. It would allow passing of a high pressure gas pipeline, and a fibre optic
    cable. The crossing for power transmission to support 400KV line would be installed about 1 km
    downstream from the main bridge using piers similar to the bridge with a span of about 1 km (see
    Annex 2).

    A1.2: Development of Construction Yards (US$57.5 million). This would include preparation of
    construction yards for the main bridge contract covering some 147 hectares (ha) on both sides of the
    river. The high reflects the need to raise the land above flood level and establish river protection.
    This would be done prior to the award of the main bridge contract. The cost for installation of
    equipment etc. in the construction yard is included in component A1.1 of the project.

    A2: Approach Roads and Bridge End Facilities (US$228.9 million). This component would
    support construction of approach roads connecting the existing road work to the bridge. On the left
    bank side (Mawa side) only a limited stretch of road (about 1.5 km) needs to be constructed. One
    culvert would be rehabilitated. The approach road on the right bank (Janjira side) is approximately
    about 10.5 km, which includes 5 small bridges (total length 270m), 20 culverts and 8 underpasses.
    Provision has been made for about 10 km of local service roads, access roads, roundabouts, etc..

    The component would also finance the toll plazas on both ends of the bridge along with the
    equipment and facilities for collection of toll. Toll plazas on the Mawa and Janjira sides would be
    identical, with ancillary facilities and weighbridge. On the Mawa side one Service Area (SA-1, about
    27 ha) and on Janjira side service areas SA2 (about 64 ha) and SA3 (about 6.6 ha) for housing the
    construction supervision consultants (CSC) and management support consultants (MSC) on site with
    all basic amenities (office, dormitory, mess, residences etc.) would be constructed, along with police
    stations and other faculties for operation of the bridge in the long run.

Component B: River Training Works (US$799.9 million).

46.      Padma is one of the major rivers in the world with an alluvial bed and complex morphology. The
river has a tendency to shift westwards. Though the main consideration in site selection for the bridge is
stability of the river, keeping the river stable under the bridge in the long run is a challenge. The river
training works are designed to meet this challenge. The left side (Mawa side) bank is relatively high and
stable. The river training works (RTWs) on the Mawa side are about 1.5 km long and about 1 km on
upstream side. On the Janjira side construction of RTWs is more extensive and heavily designed. The
length of the RTWs on the Janjira side would be about 10.5 km.

Component C: Implementation of Social Action and Environmental Management Plans (US$291.9
million).

        C1: Social Action Plan (US$273.2 million). The PMBP is a large, complex and challenging
        project involving a variety of issues ranging from land acquisition, physical and economic
                                                    11
       displacement, impacts on vulnerable groups and other unanticipated impacts. This component
       would support implementation of the Social Action Plan including the Resettlement Action Plans
       (RAP), public health action, gender action, charland monitoring and public consultation plans

       C2: Environmental Management Plan (US$18.7 million). This would support implementation
       of the environmental management plan (EMP). Though much of the EMP activities have been
       included on the construction contracts under other components, some activities, like tree
       plantations, development of protected area on charland, community environment management
       plan etc. may be funded under this component.

Component D: Construction Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact and
Social and Environmental Management Plans (US$72 million).

       D1: Construction Supervision and Implementation Support (US$65 million). This
       component will cover the cost of consulting and other services for project implementation,
       including construction supervision and project management support.

       D2: Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact and Social and Environmental
       Management Plans (US$7 million). This would support monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of
       the project implementation activities, the socio-economic, physical, environmental impact, and
       supervision of implementation of EMP and RAP. As such, it would provide continuous feedback
       to the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), Project Coordination Committee (PCC), Project
       Steering Committee (PSC), BBA and the project cofinanciers/development partners (DPs). This
       component would also provide support for BBA in project management. For implementation of
       this component, an independent consultant team, namely the Management Support Consultants
       (MSC), would be recruited under the project.

Component E: Project Management Support, Capacity Building of BBA, Technical Assistance and
Training (US$26.0 million).

       E1: Project Management Support and Audits (US$7.0 million). This component will support
       the BBA in implementing the project related activities. It will include support for operation of
       Project Management Unit (PMU) and audits etc.

       E2. Strengthening of BBA, IPOE and Technical Assistance (US$14.0 million). This
       component would build the capacity of the BBA to effectively implement the project, O&M of
       the bridges it manages and carrying out its full functions as defined in its mandate. This would
       include, but not be limited to: (i) enhancing BBA's capacity in planning and programming,
       engineering and O&M of the bridges, financial management, procurement, and management of
       the environment and social issues; (ii) technical assistance and training in such areas as designing
       of bridges, river training works, approach road, hydraulics; detailed designs of structures; contract
       administration and construction supervision; procurement; operations and management planning;
       asset management plans; financial management; and legal issues (this will include on the job
       training, post graduate programs, seminars, workshops, and study tours, etc); and (iii) an
       independent panel of experts for design and construction quality and safety enhancement or any
       other issues that may have to be addressed during project implementation.

       E3. Strategic Studies (US$5 million). This component would support strategic studies to
       address technical, financial or management issues, mitigation measures and pilot projects that
       may be identified during the project implementation and agreed upon with the Association.

B. Project Financing

1.         Lending Instrument.          The lending instrument is Specific Investment Loan (SIL)

2.         Project Financing Plan

47.      The project financing plan is provided in the Table 2. The Project would be financed by an IDA
credit (US$1,200 million), an ADB credit of US$76 million and a loan of US$539 million, a JICA credit
of US$400 million, an Islamic Development Bank (IDB) loan of US$140 million and funds from the
Government of Bangladesh (about US$560 million). The total cost is about US$2,915 million with a tax
content estimate around 19.5% (about US$549.1 million). With these commitments the Project is fully
financed by the DPs and the GoB and there is no financing gap. However, additional availability of
concessional funds for the Project would reduce pressure on the GoB's development budget thus allowing
reallocation of scarce development funds to other programs which cannot be funded by entities like BBA
through generation of their own resources.

48.      Capitalization of Service and Commitment Charges. BBA is a financially autonomous entity
and its revenue comes from the collection of tolls from the bridge and all debt service would be paid by
the BBA. The service and commitment charge during the project period is substantial (US$29 million),
and financing this would be a strain on the resources BBA can make available for the construction of
Padma Bridge. After completion of the Project, BBA will have income from the bridge toll and will be
able to repay the loans and service charges. For effective implementation of the project, it is proposed that
                                                     13
the service and commitment charges on the IDA credit during the period be financed from the proceeds of
IDA Credit. Also the charges for the ADB loan would be capitalized, while similar charges for JICA loan
(which are very small) would be paid by BBA.

49.     The main bridge contract (Component A1) would be jointly financed by IDA, ADB, JICA and
the GoB. The approach roads (Component A2) would be financed in parallel by IDA and IDB with
counterpart contributions by GoB. The river training works contract (Component B) would be financed
by IDA, ADB and GoB. All other contract/components would be financed by IDA and GoB as indicated
in the Table 2.

50.      Coordination among Development Partners (DPs). The Project would be implemented using
the Bank's policies in relation to, inter alia, procurement, safeguards, fraud and corruption, financial
management, communication, etc. Within these limits, issues that have arisen so far as a result of the
DPs' different policy regimes have been dealt with pragmatically, and have been addressed through
consultations and the sharing of documents among DPs. For example, all DPs agreed to apply the
safeguards policies of the DP whose policies provide for the strictest standards, and to use two-stage
procurement procedures for the Main Bridge and RTWs contracts. This process is expected to continue
throughout Project implementation by trying to accommodate, to the extent permitted under Bank
policies, the concerns and procedures of the other DPs.

51.      A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is expected to be signed among all DPs after the DPs'
financing agreements have been signed. The MOU would provide, among other things, for (a)
cooperation and monitoring arrangements among DPs in the safeguards area during implementation (b)
the establishment and functioning of a DPs' coordination committee, composed of representatives of each
DP, to ensure smooth implementation and monitoring of the Project (c) the use of World Bank Standard
Bidding Documents for jointly financed contracts, specifying the application of the World Bank
Procurement and Consultant Guidelines (d) the right of GoB to approach any of the DPs, in the context of
disbursement under jointly financed contracts, seeking to withdraw the entire amount of that DP's
financing, subject to any retention conditions and upper limit of DPs' contribution (e) IDA to act as the
Coordinating Donor, and to communicate various decisions related to the Project to the Borrower; and (f)
a consultation process among the DPs to resolve issues relating to inconsistent policies and procedures
among the different DPs, but provision that in the event that an agreement cannot be reached, the
decisions on procurement and safeguards taken by IDA will prevail.

52.     Advance procurement has been initiated for the two large contracts for construction of the Main
Bridge (to be financed by IDA, ADB, JICA and GoB) and the River Training Works (to be financed by
IDA, ADB and GoB). The pool of applicants for pre-qualification for these two contracts includes no
applicant that is debarred by any of the DPs. Given that the DPs' respective debarment lists are not
identical, should a firm debarred by ADB be proposed as a subcontractor or supplier in connection with
either contract, or should such a firm submit bids for the jointly financed contracts either as a prime
contractor or subcontractor (in the unlikely event that the current pre-qualification process is abandoned),
IDA will explore all avenues, including seeking a policy waiver from its Board of Executive Directors, to
ensure that it does not finance such a firm.

C. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

53.      The project design draws on lessons learned from infrastructure projects both in and outside
Bangladesh, most notably the Jamuna Bridge Project in Bangladesh. Bank-wide experience has shown
that infrastructure is crucial for socio-economic development and this is particularly true in case of
Bangladesh which has a significant infrastructure gap and where the country is divided in four parts by
the major rivers. The primary lesson incorporated in the project is that of improving connectivity
between regions of the country creates an enabling environment for exchange of goods and people in the
country and regionally. Other lessons include: (i) project design should be based on thorough analysis,
                                                    14
and investigation using state-of-the-art design concepts and methods. The designs of the main bridge,
RTWs and related infrastructures are based on a series of studies, site investigation and using the best
talent and methodologies available in the world; (ii) design (and bidding documents) of key works should
be completed prior to negotiations; (iii) upstream detailed assessment and plans for social and
environmental issues should be carried out early in the preparation; (iv) extensive a priori consultation is
needed with various stakeholders and consideration of alternatives to minimize the adverse affects and to
make interventions most effective; (v) proper review of construction planning to identify and minimize
negative effects during construction and operation of the river and navigation network without major
interruptions, and preparation of necessary mitigation measures; (vi) implementation of the project works
through large civil contracts following the best contract management models whereby competent
consultants with adequate resources provide the best construction supervision (vii) deal up front with any
resettlement and land acquisition issues; (viii) contingencies planning based on risk analysis so that the
people are not affected by the construction works, thus proper plans would be in place in case of any
disturbances, floods, and other disasters, (ix) strong government leadership and properly staffed project
management office, indispensable to effective project preparation and implementation; (x) procurement
needs to be flexible and procurement processes should start early, and retroactive financing can be very
helpful to ensure an early project start-up; (xi) the speed of appraisal and implementation is critical to
project success; (xii) use of checking engineer and independent panel of experts to oversee the technical
designs and analysis; and (xii) dealing with the long term sustainability and O&M issues.

Lessons Learned from the Jamuna Bridge Project

54.      The Jamuna Bridge was completed in 1998 fulfilling the long standing desire, since the beginning
of the 20th century, to construct a permanent, all-season, Northwest-east linkage. It was a brave step at
the time to bridge the braiding river like Jamuna with continuous shifting channels and movement of its
course in lateral direction such that at any point along its course neither the overall width of the river nor
its location stays the same for a long period of time, unless it is forced to do so through river training
works. The project was funded by IDA, ADB, JICA and GoB. IDA helped in preparation of the project
also (using UNDP technical assistance funds) and was lead donor for the project.

55.     The Jamuna Bridge project has been a transformational operation with very high impact on the
economic opportunities, economic growth and poverty reduction in the north-west region. This was also
shown by 2007 ex-post impact assessment that carried out a careful study of project villages (which were
most impacted by outcomes of the bridge) and control villages (not benefiting by the bridge). The study
concluded that per capita income in project villages increased at least 3 percent per annum; in contrast,
the income in control villages increased at less than one percent per annum during the same period. The
decline in extreme poverty in project villages was 2.5 times more than that of control villages.

56.      The PMBP being a project in the same environment with many of the same actors involved,
lessons learned from the Jamuna Bridge Project are being fully internalized in the project preparation,
design of environmental and social safeguards, engineering designs for the bridge, river training works,
institutional arrangements, construction and implementation, O&M plans. These include:
(i)   thorough consideration of environmental and social issues and preparation of EMP and SAP using
      the concept of "development and enhancement approach" instead of mitigation and compensation
      approach, in particular a long term livelihood restoration program and development of ecological
      enhancement sites. Ensuring that fund would remain available for addressing any outstanding EMP
      and SAP issues even after closure of the Project. Comprehensive prior consultations and the design
      of an effective communications strategy during construction;
(ii) preparation of high quality designs using internationally available expertise and review by an
     independent panel of experts;


                                                     15
(iii) due attention to procurement packaging and procurement procedures to get the best construction
      expertise available in the world. This includes large packages (Main Bridge covering all aspects
      river training works and approach roads) and thorough procedure for pre-qualification of the
      contractors followed by a two-stage bidding procedure. Strengthening of BBA's capacity in project
      management and provision of advisors and project management consultants. The construction to be
      supervised by international consultants who are to be designated as the "engineer" in works
      contracts;
(iv) well planned construction schedule, including the location of construction yards and plants, traffic
     movement, identification of areas for borrowed material, land required for contractors and camps
     and other construction purposes. Design of the operation of ferries, ongoing traffic and other uses of
     river during construction and thorough contingency planning for unexpected events, floods,
     accidents;
(v) ensuring strong commitment by the GoB and the DPs to address any design and implementation
    issues and design of proper coordination among the development partners;
(vi) establishment of a thorough monitoring program to identify issues early on. This would consist of:
     (a) monitoring by PMU with dedicated staff for Engineering, and Environment and Social aspects;
     (b) support from the project implementation consultants; (c) independent M&E consultancy to
     monitor progress and supervise the EMP and SAP activities; (d) bidding documents would require
     the contractor to have dedicated staff for monitoring EMP implementation; (e) the Bank Project
     team would place a consultant in the country who would visit the project site on a regular basis (at
     least twice a week) in the first two years of the project when construction will take place, keeping
     the Bank and the Project Coordination Committee informed of any issue arising during project
     implementation.
57.      Operations and maintenance. After completion of the Jamuna Bridge, for O&M of the
infrastructure a contract was awarded based on international competitive bidding procedure. Overall
O&M of the bridge has been satisfactory. Adequate funds have always been available with BBA to carry
out the O&M, including any major repairs that may be required for the bridge and associated
infrastructure. Despite this, a few major maintenance aspects seem to have been ignored for a long time.
These include: (a) fixing up of cracks that appeared on the surface of the bridge a while back. There seem
to be several points of views for reasons and explanations provided for emergence of these cracks on
which there is no agreement among the technical specialists. All agree that these cracks are not
detrimental to the structural integrity of the bridge. However, they need to be fixed, and if they are left
for a long time they would damage the structure. It has taken a long time to agree on a solution for fixing
the cracks. The second major item that has been pending is repair to the west guide bund which was
damaged during floods after completion of the project. This involves strengthening the guide bunds and
widening the falling apron on both sides of the bridge. Gaps between appointments of the O&M operators
have exacerbated the delays.

58.      Measures are underway to address the delayed O&M. The design has been prepared and the bids
have been invited from the international contractors for fixing the cracks and strengthening the deck
surface. The estimated cost of this contract is about US$50 million, and implementation is estimated at
about one year. Designs are also being carried out for strengthening of the guide bunds. The estimated
cost of these works is about US$30 million, and would be carried out in two years.

59.      The main reasons for delays in carrying out these repairs, though funds have always been
available with BBA, seem to be lack of timely assessment of technical aspects of damage, scope and
nature of the repairs required, agreement on appropriate solution, and slow and avoidance to take
controversial decision that would be under scrutiny and publicized at national level. Based on this lesson
learned, it has been agreed that the bridge safety review system of BBA would be enhanced and
strengthened to allow timely decision making with assigned responsibility. A regular annual and three-
year intensive safety review system would be instituted by the BBA for all infrastructure it owns.. Such a
                                                    16
safety review would be carried out by a panel of experts with appropriate skills, and consisting of
national, international and expatriate experts that would visit the site, carry out the review and assessment
and provide proposals for the appropriate solution and methodology to design such a solution. The panel
will issue these reports to BBA (they would be discussed by the BBA Board), to the Cabinet, and these
reports would also be made available to the public and other stakeholders. The panel would also carry out
an advisory/supervisory role in the implementation of the major repairs as it does during construction of
the bridge.
60.      Secondly, the contract for O&M operation would be issued six months prior to expiry of the
ongoing O&M contract. The O&M contract would also cover carrying out of major repairs required
including carrying the detailed design of such repairs under the overall guidance of BBA and safety
review panel mentioned above.

D. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

61.     A fixed crossing is essential to link the SWR with the rest of Bangladesh. Continuing with the
status quo transportation by ferries and boats is not an option for the country and, in particular, for the
SWR to develop faster and address long-term poverty issues.

62.      Bridge Site. In locating the bridge, four sites were considered based on the plan form of the
Padma River: Paturia-Goalundo, Dohar-Charbhardrasan, Mawa-Janjira and Chandpur-Bhedargani. After
an initial screening, two sites ­Mawa Janjira and Patuiria-Goalundo were selected based on comparative
studies for physical, technical, economic, local infrastructural and social/environmental perspectives. The
two sites were compared using a more in-depth analysis covering issues related to economic aspects,
regional development, increased GDP, poverty reduction and social and environmental aspects. The
Mawa-Janjira site was selected for construction of the proposed bridge due to, among other things, higher
river bankline stability, higher traffic forecast, lower construction costs, better returns, and other indirect
benefits such as improved accessibility to the SWR and foundation of an international road network.

63.     Main Bridge Design. For the Main Bridge structure, five main superstructure concepts were
investigated:
    · Option 1: Single level bridge - variable depth concrete twin cell box girder, with and without
        extra dosed cables
    · Option 2: Two level bridge - steel truss acting compositely with concrete upper deck
    · Option 3: Two level bridge - extra dosed concrete truss
    · Option 4: Two level bridge - variable depth concrete twin-box girders built precast segmental,
        and central railway envelope built in-situ, with sheltered utility envelopes
    · Option 5: Two level bridge - constant depth single cell concrete box girder with side struts
        supporting thin cantilever wings, all precast segmental, with exposed utility envelopes

64.     The options were evaluated principally with respect to construction costs, durability, future
maintenance provisions, constructability, construction program, and aesthetics, leading to the selection of
the two level, composite steel truss (Option 2). A further study of span lengths in the range of 120m to
180m was undertaken leading to the selected span of 150m.

65.      For the foundation design, two main piling concepts have been investigated: driven tubular steel
piles (raked or vertical), and vertical bored concrete piles. Investigations concluded raking steel piles to
be the only viable option, the vertical bored piles were not found to be flexible enough when subjected to
earthquake/seismic loading.

66.      Approach Roads. Similarly, different alignments for the approach viaducts were considered, to
match the several concepts (one-level and two-level) for the main spans, to ensure compatibility with the
future railway, and to minimise land acquisition. Favourable construction cost and time led to the

                                                      17
 adoption of precast beams for the approach viaducts. Different spans and cross sections were considered,
 leading to precast super T-beams for the road viaduct and I-beams for the railway viaduct. Steel and
 concrete piling options were considered, with vertical concrete piles preferred in the approach viaducts.
 The smaller bridges on the approach roads have similar structural form to the approach road viaduct of
 the main bridge.

 67.      River Trainings Works (RTWs). The differences in soil characteristics between the north bank
 and the south bank required different approaches to be adopted for the design of the river training works.
 The north bank at the bridge site includes erosion resistant strata and has been fairly stable for many
 decades. In contrast, the south bank with its loose, fine sand and silt soils is relatively unstable and has
 undergone periodic major shifts associated with overall changes in river channel patterns. Furthermore,
 the new south approach road parallels the south bank, which makes it vulnerable to future shifting.
 Therefore the river training works on the south bank need to account for the high potential for channel
 instability and future outflanking from upstream of the bridge approach works.

 68.       Initially three RTW layout concepts were investigated:
       ·   Concept 1 ­ revetments along both north and south banks;
       ·   Concept 2 ­ an 8km long guide bund on the south bank extending mainly upstream of the bridge
           centreline and curving into the present minor south channel with a revetment along the north
           bank.
       ·   Concept 3 ­ continuous revetments or embankments on both sides of the river for 20km or more
           upstream of the bridge, intended to maintain the present favourable alignment through the life of
           the bridge.

 69.     Concept 3 was subsequently rejected as impractical due to construction time, cost and
 uncertainties over maintenance. The remaining concepts were modified and expanded during the course
 of the design. After assessing and reviewing a wide range of options, three river training alternatives
 were considered technically feasible and were subject to detailed assessment:
     · Alternative 1 ­ revetments on both north and south banks
     · Alternative 2 ­ guide bund placed on the south side of the river along the south bank of the minor
         channel and two hard points, shaped like short guide bunds were constructed further upstream
         along the south bank to protect the approach road.
     · Alternative 2 Modified ­ similar to Alternative 2 but the two hard points were shifted northwards
         onto the char and the south channel was blocked off.

 70.      The above three alternatives were assessed based on their expected hydraulic performance,
 robustness, maintenance requirements and cost as well as social and environmental impacts. Based on
 this assessment, Alternative 1 was selected as the preferred alternative river training works design.

IV.        IMPLEMENTATION

 A. Institutional and implementation arrangements

 71.     The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) was created in 1985 through an ordinance as an
 independent Authority, reporting to the Bridges Division of the Ministry of Communication. BBA will
 be responsible for the execution and implementation of the Project through the Project Management Unit
 (PMU). The PMU has been strengthened by providing additional staff. It would be supported by
 consultants, advisors and appropriate Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for implementation of
 the Project. For more detail, see Annex 3.

 72.     Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU, created within the BBA structure, will be
 responsible for all aspects of project implementation and day-to-day operations and management. The

                                                      18
PMU will be headed by a Project Director with three units: (i) Procurement and Finance Unit; (ii)
Engineering Unit; and (iii) Environment and Sociology or Safeguards Unit. Key specialists have been
recruited, and the staffing with qualified personnel is largely completed.

73.     The PMU would be supported by two sets of consultants, Construction Supervision Consultants
(CSCs) who would help in construction supervision, contract management, and management aspects of
the project. For civil works contracts, the Project Director will serve as the Employer representative, and
the CSCs supervising consultant will serve as the Engineer for construction supervision. At the site,
Resident Engineers, appointed by the CSCs, with a team of specialists and inspectors will supervise the
Contractor. The Management Support Consultants (MSCs) would support in carrying out the role of the
employer. The MSC would also supervise the implementation of SAP and EMP, and carry out
independent M&E for the project activities and implementation.
74.      The PMU would be responsible for implementation of components A, and B, through its
engineering unit with support from the CSC and MSC. PMU would implement Component C in
coordination with the Deputy Commissioners of the three districts in which the Project is located
(Munshiganaj, Shariatpur, Madaripur) and the NGOs. The Centre for Environmental and Geographic
Information Services (CEGIS) has been engaged to computerize land acquisition data with GPS
reference. The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) has been engaged to undertake
surveys and verify field data for preparation of RAPs. An experienced NGO (Christian Commission for
Development in Bangladesh -CCDB) has already been mobilized for implementation of the three RAPs at
field level. Four more NGOs would be mobilized for various parts of SAP. IUCN is likely to support in
implementation and monitoring of parts of EMP. PMU would also implement the Components D and E
with the help of other BBA staff and its engineering, procurement and finance unit.

75.     Project Coordination Committee (PCC). A Project Coordination Committee (PCC) has been
constituted to oversee the Project, provide policy-level guidance and inter-agency coordination for the
project. The PCC is chaired by the Minister of Finance, or another person acting on his/her behalf with
Secretaries of Planning, Economic Relations Division, Finance, Bridge Division, Agriculture, Forest,
Water Resources, Roads and Railway, Environment, Local Government, Implementation Monitoring and
Evaluation Division (IMED), Member (Physical Infrastructure) Planning Commission, Chief Executive
Officer of the selected NGOs, representatives of the local/district administration as its members and the
Project Director of PMBP. The PD PMBP would be the secretary of the PSC.

76.     Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC would help resolve project management issues
and address day-to-day implementation problems. It would be chaired by the Secretary and Executive
Director of BBA, and Secretaries of Planning, Economic Relations Division, Finance, Environment,
Roads and Highways, Local Governments, Agriculture, Water Resources, Forest, IMED, Member
(Physical Infrastructure) Planning Commission, Chief Executive Officer of the selected NGOs, Project
Director and representatives of and the consultants (CSCs, and MSCs) will be members. The Project
Director (PD) PMBP would be the secretary of the PSC.

B. Results Monitoring and Evaluation.

77.     The BBA will submit quarterly reports in an appropriate format to the GoB/Ministry of
Communication, PCC, and PSC and the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter. The
PD/PMU will be responsible for preparation of the quarterly report that will cover the progress and
expected completion dates for civil works and equipment supply contracts, progress on institutional
components, implementation of SAP and EMP, training and studies, and activities of the BBA/PMUs
engineering, M&E, procurement and financial consultants and NGOs. The reports will cover financial
and procurement information, including: (a) comparison of actual physical and financial outputs with
forecasts, and updated six-months project forecasts; (b) project financial statements, including sources


                                                    19
and application of funds, expenditures by category statement, and special accounts reconciliation
statement; and (c) a procurement management report, showing status and contract commitments.

78.       The PD/PMU will also prepare annual reports by no later than September 30 of each year of
project implementation. The report will cover: (a) the progress of each component, implementation of key
features of the environmental management plan, key performance indicators, operation of project
facilities, and financial statements; and (b) the Annual Work Plan for implementation, annual funds
required for implementation with breakdown by each co-financier, an updated disbursement profile,
planned actions for mitigating negative effects during construction, and target indicators for the coming
fiscal year. In addition semi-annual reviews by the DPs, detailed annual reviews would be undertaken in
October each year. A mid-term review of the Project would be undertaken by October 31, 2014. An
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after
the closing date.

79.      The management support consultants (MSC) shall be recruited for M&E of the Project impact,
including the implementation and monitoring of the EMP, and the SAP/RAP. The M&E studies will
evaluate the success in project implementation in terms of meeting the project's objectives, and assess its
physical, hydrological, environmental, social, and economic impacts. The M&E activities will provide
continuous feedback to the GoB the PSC and DPs on the project's performance, and on mitigation of
negative impact under various components, so that corrective actions can be undertaken in a timely
manner if necessary. Changes to the Project, if any, will be reflected in the implementation review aide
memoires and or communicated through exchange of letters between the Bank and the Government. The
Bank Team will place a Staff and/or a consultant in the country who will visit the project site on a regular
basis (twice a week), particularly in first two years of the project, to monitor the project planning,
implementation program for construction activities, communication strategy, and EMP and SAP/RAP
activities.

C. Implementation Support and Governance and Accountability Framework (Annex 5)

80.      Strategy and Approach for Implementation Support. The strategy for implementation
support has been developed based on the nature and high risk profile of the proposed project. It will aim at
making implementation support to the client more flexible and efficient, and focus on the
implementation of the risk mitigation measures defined in the ORAF. Support would be provided in all
aspects covering procurement, financial management, environment and social safeguards, anti-
corruption, technical aspects including instituting an independent panel of experts, coordination among
development partners and O&M of the bridge, institutional strengthening of BBA and other issues as
they arise during the project.

81.      The Bank Project Team consisting of multi-disciplinary members, will be based in the
Bangladesh country office, some members would be in Washington and others in country offices in the
region to ensure timely, efficient and effective implementation support to the client. Adequate budget
would be allocated to oversee implementation of the project. Highly specialized consultants in Bridge
Engineering and River Engineering have been recruited and would be maintained throughout the
project implementation period. Additional consultants with specialized skills would be recruited as
required. Timely monitoring and support to BBA will be mainly provided by the team members in the
country offices of the region, as well as in the Washington office, especially for the first 18 months.
Formal supervision and field trips will be carried out semiannually, and more frequently as needed in
the first year of the Project. The supervision missions will be coordinated with other Development
Partners (DPs) financing the project. To the extent possible, supervision missions will be undertaken
jointly with the other DPs. The detailed are provided in Annex 5.



                                                     20
82.      Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) The PMBP will be implemented in a
high-risk environment, however, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) is fully committed to the
Project and its proper implementation because of its importance and transformative impact on the
economy and on the development of Bangladesh as a whole and the Southwest Region (SWR) in
particular. To mitigate and guard against governance, corruption and fraud risks and improve
transparency and accountability in implementation of project activities a comprehensive Governance
and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) was prepared in consultation with INT and GoB and will be
implemented by the BBA.

83.     The key features of the GAPP are described below and described in detail in Annex 5.1 along
with full risk analysis and measures incorporated in the project:
(i) to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency, recruitment of expert staff under the PMU
    responsible for dealing with the project, retention of independent, internationally-recruited
    consultants for design and construction supervision (CSC) and for monitoring and evaluation (MSC),
    and support by a number of NGOs and other institutions like CEGIS, and universities;
(ii) to enhance internal accountability, establishment of a Project Steering Committee with both
     Government and NGO representation, establishment of a high-level Project Coordination Committee,
     chaired by the Minister of Finance or his designee. The most senior oversight entity will be a Project
     Integrity Advisor appointed by, and solely accountable to, the Prime Minister. The Project Integrity
     Advisor will have the authority to take decisions and report to the Prime Minister concerning project
     governance issues independent of staff and individuals engaged in project implementation. This
     individual will serve as a figure of institutional integrity for the project, and as such must be a person
     who is recognized within Bangladeshi society for integrity, independence, and concern for the public
     good. The Project Integrity Advisor will serve as the liaison to the World Bank and other co-
     financiers on all issues related to governance and corruption. Terms of reference for the Project
     Integrity Advisor will be developed in consultation with IDA.
    The GoB will, by not later than March 15, 2011, issue an order, in form and substance satisfactory to
    IDA, which shall include inter alia: (a) the appointment of a Project Integrity advisor, with the Project
    Implementation Entity and concerned staff, satisfactory to IDA, and (b) the terms of reference of such
    Project Integrity Advisor.
(iii) for proactive provision of information and enhanced transparency, designation of an information
      officer, regular reporting by MSC and PMU, establishment of a website with all procurement,
      contract and financial management information, complaints and resolution of complaints and
      implementation issues, implementation of a communication strategy, accountability meetings with
      NGOs, and media in the project area and Dhaka;
(iv) to mitigate procurement risks, smart design of a small number of contracts, publication of mapping of
     the procurement process, ensuring multiple parties are legitimately involved at all stages of
     procurement, including public openings of bids in the presence of NGOs, establishment of complaint
     filing and reporting mechanisms, procurement information to be placed on the website;
(v) to avoid potential for conflict of interest among participants in procurement, certification of no
    conflict of interest by project management, members of evaluation committee members and bidders,
    review of statement of financial interests encompassing key staff, requirements that bidders would
    declare their agents and other possible connections to the persons involved in procurement
    management; and
(vi) to guard against improper targeting of beneficiaries and/or false delivery of benefits in case of
     SAP/RAP, implementation by NGOs with reputable track records, monitoring by MSC, disclosure of
     information and website etc, and enhanced two-tiered grievance redressal and complaint mechanisms.



                                                      21
D. Sustainability

84.       The Padma Bridge Project is vital for accelerated economic growth of the country, in particular
the SWR. The GoB is committed to the Project, and appreciates the importance of its sustainability
which is crucial for the Project to continue to provide benefits. The Project is of national importance
supported by all political parties and, most importantly by people of the area even, those affected by
involuntary resettlement. As evidenced in the case of the Jamuna Bridge, operation and maintenance
(O&M) have remained important since its inception. Ensuring sustainability would involve: (i) setting
aside adequate funds for proper operation and maintenance each year from the toll revenue; (ii)
satisfactory institutional arrangements and capacity for carrying out the O&M of infrastructure and
facilities; (iii) appropriate regime for bridge safety review, assessment, designing solutions for remedial
and mitigation measure and for their proper implementation; and (iii) adequate capacity and performance
of the BBA to manage and monitor the O&M of both Jamuna and Padma Bridges.

85.     BBA's financial objectives are to keep the toll level affordable to encourage use of the bridges
and while raising enough funds from the users to meet the O&M costs and debts servicing obligations.
Financial issues are discussed in more detail in the Financial Analysis section. In order to the keep toll
affordable for the Padma Bridge, BBA will use a combined toll policy. Since Jamuna Bridge has lower
and "mature" debt servicing requirements, the combined toll for Jamuna and Padma Bridges would be
much more affordable than the toll required for the Padma Bridge alone.

86.      As described in Section VI A (Financial Analysis) agreements have been reached with GoB
regarding revision of the toll policies for Jamuna and Padma Bridges and an implementation plan,
satisfactory to the Association, that would continue to ensure BBA's objectives of financial self
sustainability.

87.     For arrangements for O&M, it has been agreed that at completion of the Project, the BBA would:
(a) enter into a five-year contract with a renowned O&M contractor based on international competitive
bidding for monitoring and O&M of all project facilities, main bridge, RTWs, approach roads, toll plazas,
and collection of toll, etc. as was done in case of the Jamuna Bridge; (b) the O&M contract would also
cover carrying out of major repairs and their detailed design as guided by the bridge safety review panel;
and (c) put in place new contract for O&M six months prior to expiry of the ongoing contract thus
avoiding the risk of any time gap between the old and new contracts.

88.      In addition, to ensure the bridge safety issues, avoid any backlog of repairs and timely
implementation of major repairs, the BBA would institute a regular annual and three yearly more
intensive bridge safety reviews by a panel of experts with appropriate skills consisting of national,
international and expatriate experts. The panel would carry out the safety assessment, provide appropriate
solutions, guidelines and methodology and will also play a advisory/supervisory role during
implementation of major repairs. The panel's reports would be discussed at the BBA Board and shared
with the Cabinet, public and the concerned stakeholders. BBA would ensure that first safety review of
the Jamuna Bridge under this system would be carried out by October 31, 2011.

89.       To enhance BBA capacity to monitor and manage the two bridges, and make it a more dynamic
organization, an institutional reform program has been agreed. Its implementation has started in a modest
way during the project preparation using Project Preparation Facility (PPF) resources. Capacity building
of BBA would continue during the Project implementation period in a range of areas, including the O&M
activities, and for that purpose sufficient funds have been allocated under Component E2 of the project.

V.       KEY RISKS

90.      The potential risks (and proposed mitigation) associated with the project are summarized below:
 Risks                  Risk Mitigation Measures                                                    Risk Rating
 Technical: Poor        An internationally reputed company is responsible for designing the          Medium-I
 designs and            works. A checking engineer has been employed to review and check
 engineering works,     the designs according to standard practices for such projects. An
 leading to             independent panel of experts (IPOE) is involved throughout the
 catastrophic failure   project to provide the best technical advice regarding these designs
 or poor                and engineering issues. Additional expertise would be mobilized
 performance            when required to review and check the technical issues.
                        An institutional study was carried out on the Bangladesh Bridge                High
 Project
                        Authority. Under this study, a plan for capacity building of the
 Management:
                        organization was identified. This will be undertaken as a sub-
 Overall government
                        component (i.e. strengthening of BBA) of this Project. The project
 capacity to manage
                        will also provide a variety of support consultants to help with the
 such a sizeable
                        overall management of the Project. Track record of Jamuna Bridge
 investment
                        inspires confidence.
                        Different procurement, financial management and safeguard                    Medium-I
                        requirements by the development partners could become an issue in
                        project implementation. Efforts have been made to harmonize the
                        procedures to the extent possible. In the area of safeguards, the process
 Coordination of        is working well. In case of procurement the issues are being sorted out
 Development            through discussion and meetings.               The World Bank is
 Partners; conflict     Lead/Coordinating Development Partner and so far the coordination
 with differing         among donors has been working very well. An MOU is being
 preferences from       negotiated defining coordination arrangements among the DPs that
 individual             would be signed after signing of the Financing Agreement. While
 financiers.            World Bank Guidelines would be followed in all aspects of the
                        Project, efforts would be made to accommodate the requirements of all
                        DPs as it has been done so far without any deviation from the Bank
                        Guidelines. See details provided in the section on financing plan for
                        more details.
                        Project design has included several measures to bring more                     High
                        accountability and transparency to the overall procurement and
                        Financial Management process. A proper system of procurement

                        BBA would establish a fund of US$10 million equivalent to help

 Overestimate of        The economic benefit calculations in large part are based on estimates      Medium-L

                           carefully and conservative assumptions have been made to estimate
                           project benefits. However, experience from Jamuna and other bridges
                           in Bangladesh is that actual traffic is generally higher than what was
                           estimated at the project planning stage. Moreover, early indication
                           suggests that several multiplier benefits exist. Also the sensitivity
                           analysis shows that the bridge is economically viable over a wide
                           range of fluctuations in revenue and costs.
                           Preliminary estimates show that with the current amount of                             High

  and
                           Agreement has been reached with BBA (and GoB) on toll policies for
                           the two bridges (Jamuna and Padma) and an implementation plan,
  Financial                satisfactory to the Association, that would continue to support BBA's
  Sustainability           objectives of financial self-sustainability. See Section IV A Financial

                           BBA capacity would be strengthened. For monitoring and O&M of
                           the bridge and related infrastructure and facilities, at the completion of
  Proper operations

                           arrangements outlined above the risk of inadequate O&M that could
                           lead to deterioration of the bridge would be minimized.
  Overall Risk             Every effort has been made to learn from past experience and plan                      High
  Rating:                  accordingly, including prior completion of detailed design of the
                           construction works, implementation plans, construction plans and
                           operational plans. The overall risk ratings at preparation and
                           implementation are HIGH because of the following main factors: (i)
                           the mere size of the Project; (ii) the large size of construction contracts
                           on a very mighty river like the Padma river with meandering and
                           unpredictable morphology; (iii) the number of people affected; (iv) the
                           issues in construction due to unforeseen circumstances; (v) the
                           possible coordination issues between DPs; and (vii) significant
                           reputational risk to the Bank that may arise due to technical issues
                           during construction, and safeguards aspects.
 High: A risk with a high impact on the PDOs and a high likelihood that it will occur.
 Medium-I(medium driven by impact): A risk that would have high impact if it took place but a low likelihood of it occurring.
 Medium-L(medium driven by likelihood):A risk that would have low impact even if there is high likelihood that it would happen.
 Low: A risk with a low impact if it does happen and a low likelihood of it occurring;

 91.     The major risky aspect of the project would be the implementation of the social/resettlement
 action plan, in which over 75,000 affected people are involved. Also the sheer scale of the project and
 nature of construction on a river like the Padma is challenging and the country has a weak governance
 environment. This is the reasoning behind rating risk as "high" for this operation.

VI.       APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 A. Economic and Financial Analyses (Annex 9)

 Economic Analysis

 92.     The Padma Multipurpose Bridge will provide a vital missing link in the national road network of
 Bangladesh particularly for the Southwest Region (SWR) of the country. A fixed crossing is essential to
 link SWR with the rest of the country. Continuing with transportation through ferries and boats is not an
                                                              24
option for the country, because without effective connectivity of the bridge, the SWR would continue to
lag behind the rest of the economy and suffer from concentration of poverty.

93.      The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is an important large scale infrastructure project
of transformational nature with broad impact that would provide substantial benefits to all sectors of the
economy. The analysis shows that the benefits of the Project would be equivalent to annual increase of at
least 1.7 percent of SWR GDP value and of the 0.56 percent of annual increase of national GDP. The
poverty reduction rate would increase by 1.0 percentage points in the SWR and by 0.8 the percentage
points at the national level. The impacts are quite similar to the Jamuna Bridge (connecting Northwest
Region to the country), which were estimated about five years after the opening of the bridge. This is
quite similar to the estimated impact of the Jamuna Bridge measured in 2003, i.e. four years after
opening of the bridge

94.       Estimation of Project Benefits. The expected benefits of the Project can be divided into: (i)
road users' benefits or transportation benefits directly realized by the operators of the vehicles, which
were estimated using traffic models; (ii) other direct benefits such as land development, protection against
river bank erosion and flooding around the bridge area as well as the cost avoided of separately providing
for utility crossings such as gas pipeline, electric telecommunication lines and railway bridge, which were
estimated by assessing the value of the land developed and alternative cost of construction; and (iii)
wider economic benefits (WEB) with increased economic activity that would develop with reduced cost
of transportation and generating a surplus for other economic activities, which were estimated using a
Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model.

95.      The road users' benefits were estimated using the traffic projections and value of travel time and
cost saved with the bridge. Traffic surveys were carried out for estimating the traffic projections, which
is quite a challenging task in the absence of any existing fixed crossing of the Padma River. Similarly the
estimates were prepared for value of time and cost of operation of vehicles. The assumptions and
methodology are explained in detail in Annex 9.

96.      The SAM model was used to assess the direct and indirect income effects of a particular
exogenous impact (such as the opening of the Padma Bridge) that leads to different expenditure patterns.
A SAM model is a square matrix with columns for expenditure and rows covering income accounts. It
combines input-output data with national accounts data to reflect the circular flow of income at a
particular point in time. In this context, its key use is to assess the direct and indirect income effects of a
particular exogenous impact (such as the opening of the Padma Bridge) that leads to different expenditure
patterns.

97.      CGE analysis also allowed for the assessment of the impacts of exogenous shocks but within a
constrained optimization framework (i.e. changes in quantity are restricted as supplies of primary factors
are fixed ­ labor, capital and land). The SAM approach does not have capacity constraints, meaning that
matching outputs are always supplied, resulting in higher factor incomes and household consumption
expenditure. The CGE approach, working with constraints, does not generate extra income by employing
additional factors of production--additional income would come from increased productivity in use of
given factor of production and diversion of factors to more productive possibilities arising from a fall in
transport costs because of the bridge. At the core of the model is a set of equations describing the
behavior of various economic agents (such as industries and households) when faced with changes in
relative prices.

98.     The elimination of a major transport barrier and the significant improvement in accessibility to
factor and product markets between Dhaka and the Southwest Region, where resources are not fully
employed, means that the SAM approach (without any capacity constraints) can be considered suitable
for modelling to quantify the income effects of the Padma Bridge. These income effects would be

                                                      25
additional to the value of travel time savings for passenger and freight vehicles and would come about by
the bridge providing the link between consumers and producers in a wide range of markets.

99.     Estimation of Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis. The ERR for the base case
is 19 percent, and the benefit-cost ratio is over 2.0. The Base Case reflects a conservative estimate, and
ERR to be realized post project is likely to be higher than this. The base case includes benefits for the
road users' based on conservative estimates of traffic forecasts, the value of the land developed (also a
conservative estimate as river bank and flood protection benefits are not included), utility crossings (quite
conservative in the case of the gas pipeline crossing) and wider economic benefits. The ERR would be
20%, if savings in ferry closings or the avoided cost of a railway bridge are included, and 21% if both are
included. The NPV of the net benefits stream at the discount rate of 12% is US$1.2 billion.

100.     Sensitivity Analysis. The Project ERR is robust and not sensitive to variations in the project
costs or benefits. Switching values have been computed to determine the effects of increase in costs and
decrease in benefits. With increase in capital cost by 20% or reduction in benefits by 20% the ERR is
17% and it is 15% with a combination of two. The ERR would remain above 12%, which is considered
as the opportunity cost of capital with a 90% increase in cost or a 40% reduction in benefits. The delay in
completion of the project by two years would have no impact on the ERR. The sensitivity based on
various risks that the project may face shows that it is highly unlikely that unfavorable developments
would reduce the project ERR below the OCC.

101.     The reasons that the ERR is so robust is that river crossing through ferry services only fulfils
partial requirements of connectivity, passengers and goods perhaps to a limited scale, and even that at a
very high cost as indicated by the reduction in travel times to various destinations in the SWR. Crossing
of utilities such as gas and electricity and telecommunication are prohibitively expensive without a
bridge. The scour depth of Padma River is over 60 meters. So for crossing a gas pipeline, for example,
either gas line is to be supported by a foundation piers similar to Padma Bridge (over 130 meter deep) or
pipeline is to be crossed under the river say at over 60 meters depth and both are extremely costly.
Similar is the case for electrical and other utility crossings. The Project also develops a lot of land during
construction which would be used for other economic activities. The land is Bangladesh raised above the
flood level is extremely valuable that also adds to the robustness of ERR estimated. The details are
provided in Annex 9.

Financial Analysis (Annex 9)

102.     The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA), the precursor to BBA, was created in 1985.
Its ordinance envisaged it to be an Authority that would enjoy financial and organizational autonomy.
Financial objectives of BBA are to (i) levy tolls at minimum levels so as not to discourage traffic from
using the bridges and (ii) to raise enough funds from road users and other uses (such as power
interconnector) to meet all operation and maintenance costs (including toll collection charges) and to meet
debt servicing obligations.
103.     Toward achieving these objectives, the Jamuna Bridge Project required JMBA to levy tolls and
other user charges (such as the rent on land controlled by JMBA, and charges for carrying the power
inter-connector) at a level sufficient to meet all maintenance and operation costs (including toll collection
charges) and to meet debt servicing obligations. Indicative tolls were agreed at appraisal subject to
confirmation in a toll study to be carried out by JMBA by June 30, 1997 of the level and structure of tolls.
This study provided the basis for the tolls that were implemented at the time of the opening of the Jamuna
Bridge. 4

 The current toll rates for Jamuna Bridge are: Taka 750, 1,000, 1,250 for small, medium and large trucks (US$10.71, 14.29 and
17.86 equivalent respectvely), Taka 550 and 800 for small and large bus (US$7.14 and US$11.4 equivalent respectively); Taka
400 and 30 for cars or light vehicles and motor cycles respectively (US$5.71 and 4.3 equivalent respectively).
                                                             26
104.    Political Economy of Toll Increases. Not only was the Jamuna Bridge the first mega scale
investment in Bangladesh but it also carried a high level of uncertainty and anxiety about the
unpredictable behavior of the river, that could have been detrimental to the project. Thus, the
Government took extraordinary measures to ensure that the project would be completed and it could be
maintained properly after its completion. All three credits for Jamuna Bridge (IDA, ADB, and Japan)
required a buildup of a cash reserve for ensuring funds in case of any emergencies which may happen
during and after the construction. The JMBA was headed by strong management, and it was given full
autonomy to make decisions about the toll structure for the Jamuna Bridge. Using the 1997 study as a
basis, JMBA decided the toll level, which was considered very high at that time. With a long grace
period for loan repayments, very low O&M requirements (as both bridge and the river training works
performed extremely well), growth in traffic resulting in a revenue surplus, and accumulated cash
reserves, there was no immediate necessity to increase the toll.

105.     With change in the exchange rate and inflation over time, the value of the toll decreased in real
terms. With the debt service burden increasing and with the imposition of VAT and other taxes by the
Government, BBA recently started experiencing negative cash flows. The mandate of BBA allows it to
make toll adjustments without approval from the Government. Because of political and social
implications such increases may have, in practice BBA is not able to make changes without prior
approval from the Government. Two ideas might help in rationalizing the decision-making on tolls: (a)
using a formula-based approach of linking toll levels to an appropriate indicator such as inflation; and (b)
institutional changes which would allow BBA to have the level of autonomy envisaged in its mandate.
Details of these aspects would be developed during the study proposed to be completed prior to opening
of the bridge as described below.

106.     BBA's Past Finances. Since the opening of the Jamuna Bridge in 1998, BBA has been in
compliance with its financial objectives, and ostensibly generated a cumulative surplus of over Taka 8
billion (US$114 million) by June 30, 2010, despite not having revised the tolls over the last 12 years.
This is because all loans were on concessionary terms (IDA, ADB, and JICA), and had a grace period of
10 years. Thus, debt servicing was not a major burden on the BBA in the initial years of operation of the
Jamuna Bridge, and the traffic growth rate was good over this period. BBA has not been spending
adequately for O&M of the Jamuna Bridge, a deficiency that now needs to be rectified by carrying out
major repairs over the next 4 to 5 years, thus consuming most of the surplus accumulated so far.

107.     BBA's financial statements also show an operating deficit starting from 2007-08 (Taka 195
million, Taka 137 million and Taka 1,125 million in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively). This
deficit will grow in coming years due to the increase in debt service burden in local currency terms, and
with the repayment of IDA and ADB loans doubling from June 2014, BBA's net annual cash flow is
expected to be negative. Financial projections at the current toll levels indicate that the Jamuna Bridge
will have a deficit of about Tk 10,000 million in the 2010-2020 period, before reverting to surplus in 2021
when the debt service obligations would end. Thus, an increase in the Jamuna toll rate is required
immediately to address deficits in the coming decade.

108.      BBA's Future Finances. BBA is now embarking on the construction of Padma Bridge, and
much of the funds required for construction of the Padma Bridge would be provided by the DPs and the
GoB. Compared to the Jamuna Bridge, the Padma Bridge is more costly and the funds provided are less
concessionary, thus, the future revenues of BBA depend on two main factors: the growth in traffic for
both Jamuna and Padma Bridges, and the level of tolls. Other revenue from bridge usage fees from
utilities and rent from land will be relatively insignificant. The main cost elements are debt servicing, the
bridge O&M costs and BBA's administrative costs. A model was constructed to project BBA's future
finances under different assumptions of traffic and toll charges.



                                                     27
109.     Padma Bridge Finances. Projections show that at the current toll level of Jamuna Bridge, the
Padma Bridge would generate deficits of Tk 22 billion in 2015-2020, Tk 45 billion in 2021-2025 and Tk
51 billion in 2026-2030. In order for the Padma Bridge to generate sufficient revenues to meet its debt
service and other expenditure needs, toll rates would have to be about 350% of the current tolls at Jamuna
Bridge. Such a large increase is untenable, both from the economic and the social points of view.
Government subsidies would be possible, but not desirable, or in line with the financial mandate of BBA.

110.    Jamuna and Padma Bridge combined finances. The best way to have BBA meet the financial
obligations arising from the construction of Padma Bridge is to consider toll levels for both Jamuna
Bridge and Padma Bridge as a package source of revenue. This would allow the "mature" Jamuna Bridge
with lower (and after 2020 declining) debt service needs to cross-subsidize the Padma Bridge. Such a
policy would also allow the tolls for the two bridges to be kept the same or proportionate to their size and
cost, something that would be understandable to the users.

111.     The financial model was run with a variety of toll scenarios that would both eliminate the
anticipated deficit at Jamuna Bridge in 2011-2020 period, and generate sufficient funds for meeting
obligations of the Padma Bridge. All of the scenarios show a need for a significant increase in toll rates
for the Jamuna Bridge and a further increase at the Padma Bridge at opening. The various options are
summarized below, and details are in Annex 9.

112.      Keeping with the financial objectives of BBA, i.e. minimum level of tolls to encourage the use of
bridge and raise sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations, the most optimal scenario seem to be to:
(i) increase the Jamuna toll now by 40 percent which would be adequate to meet the financial obligations
over the next few years till the opening of the Padma Bridge; and (ii) before opening of the Padma Bridge
increase the toll of Jamuna Bridge by another 45 percent and set the tolls for Padma Bridge at the same
level i.e. 103% of the current level. This would leave about Taka 5 billion deficit during 2011-2015 (less
than the cash reserves of BBA) but overall BBA would be able to meet all its obligations for the two
bridges. This is perhaps the most pragmatic option from the implementation point of view, particularly, if
a differential toll is not considered desirable for the two bridges. While recent Jamuna data is available
and very reliable, this assessment for the Padma Bridge is based on the data and traffic surveys carried out
during the feasibility studies (before 2005), with updated information in 2009. Therefore, as explained
below, a study has to be undertaken not more than one year prior to the opening of the Padma Bridge to
determine more accurately the desired toll levels at the opening of the Padma Bridge.

113.      Need for a Toll Study Prior to Opening of the Padma Bridge. The revenue collected from the
bridge(s) depends upon the volume of traffic and the toll rates. The traffic in Bangladesh has been
increasing about 8 percent per year. The growth rate is higher in the recent years, about 10-11% per year.
Forecasting future traffic and in particular estimating opening traffic for the Padma Bridge is quite a
challenging task due to several factors. The opening traffic for the Padma Bridge would depend upon:
(a) current and growth in traffic over all the river crossings till the opening of the Padma Bridge. A lot of
passenger movement across the river is on the speed boats and small launches which is difficult to capture
in traffic surveys. Often buses operate on both sides of the river. The buses drop the passengers on one
side and they cross the river through several way, ferry, boats, launches etc, and get the busses on the
other side; (b) with the start of the construction of the bridge, there would be population moving into the
zone of the bridge influence with greater economic impact, thus resulting in generated traffic which is
very difficult to predict; and (c) diversion of traffic from other river crossings. Expected diversion from
other crossings is more difficult to estimate as it depends on the savings in travel time, cost of the trips
and speed of development of infrastructure and road network leading to the bridge. All these factors
would influence the size of traffic, and the forecast will vary according to assumptions made about the
likely nature and roles of the factors. For the purpose of economic analysis, a conservative estimate of
traffic at opening was assumed.


                                                     28
114.    In view of all the factors mentioned above, the approach to developing an appropriate toll strategy
is:

    (i) To increase the Jamuna Bridge toll by 40% on average to ensure positive cash flow and avoid a
        major deficit from the Jamuna Bridge till the opening of the Padma Bridge. This would also
        provide a better basis for further increase in toll levels before opening of the Padma Bridge; and

    (ii) To carry out a detailed study, as it was done in case of Jamuna Bridge, one year before the
         opening of the bridge based on the actual and more realistic traffic data and information
         determine the toll levels required for financial sustainability of both bridges and of BBA. Then
         six months before opening of the Padma Bridge toll rates would be set for both bridges that
         would achieve the self-financing objectives of BBA. The study would also examine a formula-
         based approach perhaps linked to inflation or other appropriate indicators that would help make
         toll adjustments more automatic and less politically contentious, and institutional reforms that
         would let BBA practice autonomy in reality. The study would also develop legislative, legal or
         administrative instruments required for implementation of such a strategy.

115.    Based on the above approach and in view of the importance of the toll increases for the future
financial sustainability of BBA, and the risk of serious fiscal burden on GoB if the increases are not
implemented, agreement has been reached with GoB on the approach and implementation plan for the toll
policy that would continue to support the financial objectives of BBA. The agreements includes:
(a) BBA shall, as soon as possible but before award of civil works contracts for the main bridge or river
    training works, or by such date agreed with the Association, raise the Jamuna Bridge toll rates
    applicable to various vehicle categories by an overall average of not less than 40% on the existing toll
    rates. BBA shall notify the Association of the increase once it is brought into effect;

(b) BBA shall: (a) by December 31, 2012 complete a study in accordance with a methodology and terms
    of reference, satisfactory to the Association, on: the level and structure of tolls and other user charges
    to be levied on the Jamuna Bridge and Padma Bridge after its completion; and future tariff and
    financial policies for BBA; and (b) by June 30, 2013 propose to the Association for its review: (i) the
    level and structure of such tolls and user charges to be applied upon opening of the bridge for traffic,
    which shall generate an operating cash flow (net of operations and maintenance expenses) sufficient
    to cover debt service requirements of BBA; and (ii) future tariff, preferably use of a formula based
    approach linked with inflation or other appropriate indicators that would make tariff adjustments
    automatic and less controversial, and financial and institutional policies for BBA; and

(c) BBA shall promptly thereafter increase the tolls and take all the proposed measures mentioned in
    paragraph (b) above, modified as needed to take into account the Association's comments thereon, in
    accordance with the schedule identified therein;

116.    In addition, assurances have been obtained that:
    (i) The GoB's financial counterpart funding contribution towards the Project cost indicated in the
        project financing arrangements would be passed on to the BBA as a grant. Such contributions
        would be made at such intervals, satisfactory to the Association, as shall be necessary or required
        by BBA to carry out the Project in accordance with the project implementation program.
    (ii) GoB shall on-lend the proceeds of the Credit to BBA under a subsidiary agreement to be entered
         into between the GoB and BBA, under terms and conditions agreed with the Association, which
         shall include inter alia, that:
       (a) The proceeds of the IDA Credit shall be relent to BBA at the same terms and conditions as of
           the Credit; and

                                                     29
       (b) The re-payment of each maturity by BBA to the GoB shall be made in Bangladeshi currency.
           The rate of exchange to be applied to the repayment in Bangladeshi currency of the amount
           payable by BBA to GoB shall be the rate of exchange applicable on the date of the repayment.

117.    BBA shall:
        (a) not later than the start of the civil works for the main bridge or the river training works (parts
            A and B of the Project) open and maintain in a commercial bank, under terms and conditions
            satisfactory to the Association, a Padma Bridge Fund of at least US$15 million equivalent
            which shall be used by BBA to finance expenditures of an emergency nature during
            construction of the Padma Bridge;

        (b) gradually increase the level of the emergency fund to US$50 million equivalent after
            completion of the project; and

        (c) six months prior to completion of the Project, BBA would establish a fund of US$10 million
             equivalent, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association to address any
             outstanding environmental and social/resettlement issues after completion and closing of the
             Project and loans/credits.

B. Technical

118.     Technically the works are extensive, complex and challenging. It has been a challenge so far to
construct fixed crossing across the Padma River (confluence of two of world longest rivers, Brahmaputra,
2,900 km and Ganges, 2,700 km) as the river is large with very dynamic morphology. However,
significant experience has been gained through construction of Jamuna Bridge on the
Brahmaputra/Jamuna River upstream from the proposed Padma Bridge. This experience has been fully
utilized in designing of the bridge, river training works as well as in dealing with environmental and
social issues. Due to geological conditions (deep alluvium deposits) and the deep scour depth estimated
(more than 61 meters for 100 year return period about 46.7 general scour and 15 meter at the pier
location) at the bridge location, designing of foundation of the bridge has been a challenging task.
Similarly, the unpredictable behavior at the bridge site has resulted in extra-ordinary designs for river
training works. Behavior of the river is rather unpredictable and varies between braiding, straight and
meandering in cycles of about 20 years. Historically, the main channel can be located anywhere. At
present time, it runs near to the North (left Mawa side) bank, but it is expected to move towards South
channel (Janjira side). This has made the designing of river training works a daunting challenge.

119.     The works for the bridge have been designed using the best possible expertise and experience
available worldwide by a team of international consultants who have significant experience in designing
such works. An Independent Panel of Experts (IPOE) with expertise in such works and in construction
of Jamuna Bridge has been reviewing investigation programs, analysis and the designs and advising BBA
and the detailed Design Consultants. A Checking Engineer was recruited to check, verify and certify all
designs (main bridge and RTWs) and confirm security, safety and technical soundness of the proposed
designs.

120.    The works are packaged into large contracts and bidding would be carried out through a two
staged bidding procedure to get competent contractors for construction of these works. This process
would ensure that the nature of the works are understood by the contractors and allow for clarifications on
technical aspects of the designs and construction techniques and methodology, etc.




                                                     30
121.     As indicated in the environment section, climate change impact studies were undertaken to
predict possible scenarios, and these findings have been incorporated in the project design. Also for each
structure, bridge, RTWs, and approach roads, various alternatives were considered (as outlined above)
and the best alternative has been selected for the Project.

122.     To ensure that technical issues are addressed during implementation and that proper supervision
is carried out, an international team of Construction Supervision Consultants (CSC) has been recruited
who would be designated as the "engineers" for the civil works contract. BBA would have management
support consultants (MSC) to provide support in implementation of this project and also in carrying out
its role as "employer" under the civil works contracts. BBA would continue to use the services of
technical advisors for reviewing project issues and help in managing this very challenging operation,
including the day-to-day activities. The POE would continue to review the implementation of the project
and advise BBA in crucial issues as they may arise. Sufficient resources are allocated under the project
for BBA to carry out any specific studies or pilots and obtain advice and expertise to address any
technical issues that may arise during the project implementation. As indicated above, extraordinary
measures have been taken in proper planning, design and ensuring quality in implementation of the
project to accommodate the "Substantial" risk rating of the technical aspects of the Project.
C. Financial Management (Annex 3)

123.     The Financial Management (FM) established in the BBA is acceptable for the Project and meets
the requirements of OP 10.02. However, due to the country environment, size of the operation and nature
of transactions involved particularly in implementation of the RAP, the overall financial management risk
for the project is assessed as `Substantial'.

124.    The financial management would be carried out by BBA's PMU. PMU's financial unit will be
responsible for financial, planning, management and day-to-day payments. In carrying out financial
management, the PMU would be supported by qualified individual consultants, by Construction
Supervision Consultants (CSC), and the Management Support Consultants (MSC). A qualified
professional accountant with adequate experience on financial management of large infrastructure project
would work in the PMU as the Senior Financial Management Specialist (SFMS) with terms of reference
agreed with the Bank. Reporting to the Project Director, the SFMS will lead the FM functions of the
project with the assistance of a Deputy Director (Finance), an Assistant Director (Finance) and a few
other support staff. BBA would also maintain a Project Audit Committee to help in addressing the audit
issues.

125.    On-Lending of Credit Funds and Disbursement. The GoB would onlend the IDA Credit
funds to BBA. GoB would authorize BBA to withdraw proceeds of the IDA Credit and proceeds
withdrawn by BBA would be considered withdrawn by GoB. Most of the Project funds would be
disbursed against large ICB contracts through direct payments by IDA and other development partners.
Such payments would be certified by the CSC (the Engineer) of the civil works contracts. The internal
control procedure and audit arrangements are described in more detail in Annex 3. The Project would use
the IFR based method to access/withdraw the Bank funds. The advance and subsequent replenishment of
funds would be deposited to the US dollar Designated Account. Detailed Disbursement arrangements are
described in Annex 3.

126.     Retroactive Financing. To meet the urgent project start-up needs, the IDA credit could be used
to retroactively finance expenditures incurred during the period between December 1, 2010 and Credit
signing of up to US$60 million, provided that procurement procedures acceptable to the IDA are
followed.




                                                   31
D. Procurement (Annex 3)

127.     BBA has experience in similar IDA funded projects, most notably the Jamuna Bridge. However,
the BBA's capacity is inadequate for procurement and contract management of such scale and
complexity. The Procurement capacity will be strengthened by: (i) providing an advisor with
international experience in carrying procurement and contract management; (ii) the design consultants
(DCs) and the construction supervision consultants (CSC) internationally recruited will help in carrying
out pre-qualification (PQ), preparation of the bidding documents, evaluation of the PQ submission and
bids and the CSC will be designated as the "engineer" under the civil works contracts; and (iii)
management support consultants (MSC) who would support BBA, among other things, in contract
management and in carrying out the role of the employer.

128.     Given the procurement environment in the country and nature of procurement in significantly
large value contracts, the project is rated as "High-Risk" from procurement operation and contract
administration viewpoint. Key risks include inadequacy in skilled and professional staff to handle
significantly large contracts (in both value and scope). An international consultant will assist in
procurement, as mentioned in the above paragraph. In addition, other measures to mitigate risks include:
(i) establishment of procurement website; (ii) establishment of a credible procurement complaint handling
system; and (iii) BBA would provide semi-annual report based on an agreed procurement risk mitigation
plan (PRMP) covering about 10 key features for better procurement management related to internal
control, bid openings, coercive practices, record keeping, publication of award of contracts etc, described
in more detail in Annex 3.
E. Social (Annex 7)

129.     The project will have significant social benefits in the project areas, the immediate neighboring
areas, and the entire SWR of Bangladesh. Improved transportation linkages are anticipated to facilitate
access to employment opportunities in Dhaka, as well as to lead to employment generation in the SWR as
a whole. In addition, embankment works planned under the project will control erosion that negatively
affects households close to the river banks.

130.    The project will have major adverse impacts through land acquisition and involuntary
resettlement. The project will affect 76,211 people in 13,578 households. This includes 47,637 people in
8,526 households who will lose farmland, 20,972 people in 3,886 households who will lose their
residential houses and need relocation and 5,179 people in 960 households will suffer from loss of
business. There are about 2,882 people whose jobs as daily wagers along the river will be affected. In
addition, the project is expected to have impacts on public health and might have impacts on people living
on charlands near the project sites. Field surveys and consultations have confirmed that there are no
indigenous communities in the project areas.

131.    The project will mitigate these adverse impacts through a carefully planned two-phased
resettlement and rehabilitation program that will provide compensation payments and resettlement
arrangements for households displaced during construction and implementation of the project, as well as
a longer term livelihood restoration program that is anticipated to extend beyond the life of the project.
The resettlement action plan will be implemented in phases to ensure that all households affected by
continuous erosion of the river banks will be supported in their effort for livelihood restoration and
improvement. It is worth noting that about one third of the displaced households are actually erosion-
displaced households who are renting or squatting along the river. Most of them are moving to the
resettlement sites where living conditions will be much better.

132.    Resettlement planning has been going on over the past decade as part of project preparation.
Major planning efforts started under separate technical assistance by JICA and ADB since 2005. Various
surveys were conducted on socioeconomic conditions, impact inventory and census, impacts on physical

                                                    32
cultural resources, gender, public health and charlands. The planning process followed a participatory
approach, involving extensive consultations and participation of the local communities, particularly over
entitlement policies, relocation options, livelihood development approaches and packages. A series of
action plans have been developed to address the adverse impacts. They include a three component
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), a Resettlement Policy Framework, a Gender Action Plan, a Public
Consultation and Participation Plan, a Public Health Action Plan, a Charland Impact Monitoring and
Management Framework. These action plans are consolidated in one project Social Action Plan (SAP).
Key features of the SAP are summarized below.

133.     Resettlement and livelihood restoration. Three RAPs have been prepared for the bridge, river
training works and the development of four resettlement sites. The RAPs were prepared in compliance
with relevant domestic and World Bank policies. They detail the socioeconomics in the project areas,
resettlement planning efforts, project impacts, entitlement policies and packages, resettlement and
rehabilitation approaches and action plans, implementation arrangements, institutional, monitoring and
grievance redress mechanisms as well as cost and financing arrangements.

134.     The resettlement approach proposed consists of group resettlement and self-resettlement options.
This was adopted following the Jamuna Project experiences as well as extensive consultations with the
affected communities. Four resettlement sites have been selected along the river and confirmed through
participation of the affected population and technical assessment. The sites will be fully developed with
infrastructure services. For households who prefer to relocate to places of their own choice, either as
individual households or smaller groups, the project will assist them in identifying, securing and
preparing their identified sites. The livelihood package has been developed consisting of cash
compensation upfront and long-term livelihood assistance planned to last for a period of 10 years. The
cash payment includes compensation at replacement cost to be determined through the Land Evaluation
Committee and various other allowances. The long-term livelihood program will be developed in full at
the household level during implementation through facilitation by an experienced implementing NGO and
with participation of the local communities. This aims at helping the affected households to use their cash
compensation productively for an improved livelihood. A Social Development Fund has been established
and included in the budget to support the program.

135.     Gender Action Plan (GAP). The GAP has been developed on the basis of a gender analysis. It
aims to translate the gender concerns and social vulnerabilities identified into actions, with a focus on (i)
increasing participation of women in the project implementation; (ii) maximizing women's access to
project benefits; (iii) increasing women's skills, incomes and participation in decision making; and (iv)
reducing women's social vulnerability, such as domestic violence against women, public sexual
harassment, vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV/AIDS, human
trafficking. The GAP will be implemented by the project NGOs. A national gender adviser will be
engaged to guide and supervise its implementation.

136.     Public Heath Action Plans (PHAP). The PHAP has been prepared on the basis of an evaluation
of project public health impacts and existing services in the project area as well as the additional
requirements of health services during the project construction. The overall objective of the plan is to
minimize and mitigate the risks on public health due to the construction activities and contribute to public
health services in the project areas. The main target groups include (i) the relocating households; (ii) the
general public in the project areas; and (iii) the construction workforce estimated at 5000 at peak. The
plan is scheduled for a period of five years, with a total budget of US$ 8.67 million. A BBA health team,
in consultation with the Ministry of Public Health And Family Welfare, will be responsible for the PHAP
implementation. This team will be strengthened with a program implementation NGO.




                                                     33
137.    Charland Impact Monitoring and Management Framework (CMMF). Assessment from the
Design Team indicates that the project would not have impacts on the charlands in the project areas.
However, given the apprehension from the charland people, BBA has planned to continue monitoring the
river behavior to assess any possible impacts on charlands due to the project, develop and implement any
required mitigation measures. The CMMF is developed to guide such monitoring efforts and
development of necessary mitigation measures.

138.     Information, Consultation and Communication. Project preparation has followed a vigorous
consultation process. Project design information has been shared with local communities at various
stages of project preparation. The development of the resettlement entitlement policy, finalization of the
resettlement sites and formulation of the livelihood restoration approach has all been achieved through
consultations with local communities. This consultation process will continue through detailed planning
and implementation of the SAP. Three Public Information Centres will be established in the project areas
and managed by an NGO. An information booklet in Bangla has been developed and distributed among
the affected people. A household entitlement card will be distributed each and every affected household,
summarizing their household losses, entitlements and payments. Additionally, project information
disclosure will continue through newspapers, radio, television, posters, community workshops,
information brochures and village level meetings. BBA has been developing a communication strategy
to systematically and regularly disseminate project progress information to the public and seek timely
public feedback to improve project implementation.

139.     Grievance Redress Mechanism. Project has a two-tier grievance redress mechanism. A project
Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) will be established at local community level, with representations
from BBA, implementation NGOs, local elected officials, representatives of affected people and women
in the project area to allow voices of the affected communities to be heard and ensure a participatory
decision-making process. A second tier GRC will be an independent three-member body comprising of a
retired judge or a senior professor with legal background, a BBA representative and a representative from
civil societies. The role of the BBA representative is to provide project background information,
clarifying relevant project policies to facilitate the deliberation. Decisions of this independent body will
be by two-thirds majority and are binding upon the project. GRC decisions will be publicized among the
local communities. Where the complaining parties are not satisfied with the GRC decisions, they can
always file their cases in court. The SAP describes in detail the GRC composition, complaint filing
procedures, GRC operation principles and procedures, and timetable for grievance redress.

140.     Project Management. BBA will be responsible for the SAP implementation. A Resettlement
Unit has been established within the PMU. It has already opened two field offices and is completing its
staff recruitment. BBA will be supported by other local institutions, including district administrations,
five specialized NGOs to be contracted for implementation, the Ministry of Health And Family Welfare
for the PHAP implementation, the Detail Design Consultant, Construction Supervision Consultant and an
independent monitoring agency. The roles and responsibilities of various institutions involved are defined
and elaborated in the SAP. One implementing NGO has already engaged for compensation payment. It
has opened three field offices, with over 60 staff members in operation. The other four implementing
NGOs are in recruitment and they are expected to be mobilized early 2011.

141.     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). BBA has planned to set up an M&E system for SAP
implementation. The M&E system consists of internal and external monitoring. The internal M&E
system is part of BBA management setup, consisting of regular progress reporting and monitoring. For
internal monitoring, BBA has started to develop a GIS-based Management Information System. This
system will cover all component activities under the SAP. It will keep and maintain records of plot-wise
and household-wise information on land and structure impacts, as well as household entitlements and
payment progress. This will enable a transparent and updated record of all entitlements and compensation
payments for every affected household. This will help control fraudulent claims and possible corrupt
practices. Some parts of the system are already developed and in operation. The external M&E will be
                                                    34
conducted by an independent monitor to be recruited through a competitive process. The M&E will cover
all aspects of SAP implementation, including detailed planning, physical progress, public consultation
and participation, grievance mechanism and assessment of SAP performance on the progress information
collected through the internal monitoring system. Its scope of work, methodology and M&E
arrangements are detailed in the SAP. The total cost of the resettlement program is included in
component C1 of the Project. The major cost is for the RAP and about US$8 million are for
implementation of PHAPs.

Environment (Annex 8)

142.      The most important benefit of the Padma Bridge will be the establishment of an easy, safe and
reliable communication link between the banks of the Padma River. Road connections with the
Southwest will improve considerably and this will both have an accelerating effect on local as well as
regional socio-economic development. A river crossing utility infrastructure will facilitate connection of
the Southwest to the gas, electricity and telecommunication networks in the rest of the country and avoid
expensive alternative construction. In the project area, new employment and business opportunities will
be created and the improved connectivity will enhance access to healthcare, educational and recreational
facilities. Air and noise pollution will be reduced and traffic congestion and long waiting times for ferries
will disappear.

143.    On the other hand, the Project involves large-scale construction on the Padma River covering a
large area that will be affected. The Project is categorized as Environmental Category "A". A full
environmental assessment of the impacts has been carried out by BBA during project preparation to
ensure that the impacts are identified, prioritized, and appropriately managed during all stages of the
project. Since the project is also financed by ADB, JICA, and IDB, in addition to the World Bank, the
co-financiers worked with the BBA for a common approach of environmental management in Padma
Bridge preparation fulfilling the national requirement as well as the requirement of several development
partners.

144.     Extensive work has been done in carrying out the environmental assessment for this project. This
is described in more detail in the Annex 8. The environmental assessment has also considered the
previous work done between 2000 and 2007­ Environmental Screening, Initial Environmental
Examination, and preliminary EIA with several specialized studies on key aspects ­ such as charlands,
ecology etc. One of the major outcomes of all these studies is finalization of the bridge alignment at
Mawa ­ Janjira site after a study of various possible alignments at (i) Paturia-Goalundo site, (ii) Mawa-
Janjira site, (iii) Dohar ­ Charbhadrasan site, and (iv) Chandpur ­ Bhedarganj site. The final EA/EMP
report prepared by BBA with support from an independent team of consultants consisted of three
volumes, and an Executive Summary summarizing all aspects of EA/EMP and SAP. The second volume
provides more details of the EA/EMP, and the third volume summarizes the SAP. This is supported by
several volumes of reports and field work carried out by the Design Consultants during the feasibility
studies and updated by special consultants.

145.    The EA considered an area that stretches 10 km (6 km on Mawa and 4 km on Janzira side) in
direction perpendicular to the flow, 15 km upstream and 7 km downstream along the flow of the river.
There are no notified wildlife protected havens within this area, however, several important features in the
area were recognized as sensitive and management of impacts on these has been a key feature of the
assessment. The river also serves as the migration route for the Hilsa fish, which goes upriver for
breeding and pass the project site during the period from March to May. Other important species in the
area include the Gangetic Dolphin, Otters, etc. The charlands serve as an important haven for several
fauna species, including migratory birds. The pre-project levels of pollution are not very high except for
bacteriological quality of surface water which makes it unsuitable for drinking without boiling, and
presence of contamination in shallow tube wells on the Mawa side.

                                                     35
146.     The EA identified impacts prior to construction of the bridge, during construction of the bridge
and during operation of the bridge. During the design of the bridge, an associated works analysis of the
alternatives was carried out and alternatives with minimum environmental and social impacts have been
selected. One of the key decisions to keep the RTW on the Janjira side along the bank has resulted in
keeping the south channel open. Potential environmental and social impacts associated with project
design, construction and operation were evaluated. Based on this evaluation, an EMP has been proposed
for the Project, designed to mitigate, minimize, and compensate any negative effects and to enhance the
ecological benefits of the Project (summary of EIA and EMP is provided in Annex 8).

147.    The assessment of impacts prior to construction of the bridge covers: (i) social impacts including
land acquisition, loss of income and livelihood, shifting of ferry ghats, etc(these aspects are discussed in
more detail in the social section); and (ii) environmental impacts including land clearing (about 200,000
trees would be cut), loss of agriculture land (about 650 ha), loss of fish pond (about 12 ha of fish ponds
with annual production level of about 2,000 kg/ha), and loss of charland with high biodiversity.

148.     In addition, during construction of such massive infrastructure, several impacts can have the
potential to cause large environmental damage if proper care is not taken. These include: (i) impact on the
natural drainage; (ii) impacts on local flora and fauna as well as land from dredge material use, storage,
and disposal; (iii) impacts of piling and vibration under water that can hamper movement/migration and
can cause disturbance to aquatic fauna; (iv) risks to the health and safety of personnel working in risky
situations; and (v) temporary increases in air, soil, water pollution during transport of very large quantities
of material ­ steel, stone, sand, etc. - over land and water. The assessment of impacts during operation
includes, in addition to the social impacts, increased traffic, contribution to greenhouse gas emission and
increased accident risks.

149.    Environmental Management Plan. The EMP prepared as part of the EA describes in detail the
measures needed to minimize, mitigate or compensate for expected environmental impacts from the
proposed works. The EMP prepared for the project including details for implementation, including
specifications for contractors, detailed description of activities, necessary arrangements and costs for all
mitigation measures. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) includes various categories of
mitigating measures. These are potential impacts or risks that could be either prevented or mitigated or
compensated by adopting appropriate measures. These include: (i) measures that can be included in
design and contract documents; (ii) stand-alone mitigation measures; and (iii) proactive compensatory
measures, e.g. measures to preserve specific habitats.

150.     Much of the construction stage EMP activities would be included in the civil works contracts. It
requires the contractors to: (i) prepare a dredge management plan ­ covering the use, storage and disposal
of excess material to be removed from the river; (ii) prepare a plan to ensure that piling does not cause
hindrance/damage to the migrating aquatic life (in order to safeguard fish migration, pilling in water will
be discontinued during March-May in areas deeper than 7 meters); (iii) preserve top-soil; and (iv) follow
guidelines in the form of Environmental Codes of Practice that cover the important aspects of the
Contractors work including safety, labor camps, transport of material, etc. Training and capacity building
for the contractor, consultant and BBA staff are included in the EMP.

151.    While most parts of the EMP are being suitably incorporated into the contracts to be monitored
by the Supervision Consultant, there are several measures that require implementation by BBA without
the contractor being involved. These include: (i) plantation of trees under in about 400,000 trees will be
planted to compensate for loss of trees on land to be acquired by the project; (ii) distribution of around
720,000 bamboo and banana saplings to the people of the host villages at the ratio of bamboo and banana
60:40 in lieu of the about 360,000 of these trees; (iii) development of protected wetland area ( 500 ha




                                                      36
charland and 500 ha river sanctuary 5 and charlands visitor centre; and (iv) community environmental
management plan for resettlement sites and an emergency response plan. The costs of these activities
have been included in Component C2 of the project.

152.     GoB has agreed to establish an Environmental Enhancement Fund to finance sustained
environmental development and protection of the project area during the O&M stage and to address any
outstanding social and environmental issues during operation of the Project. The level of this fund will be
not less than US$10 million equivalent.

153.     Monitoring Plan. The environmental monitoring program has been designed (i) to monitor the
contractor's work during project implementation in order to check contractual compliance with specified
mitigation measures, and subsequently (ii) to assess the actual environmental impacts of the project over
the years following completion of the various project components. The first type of monitoring will be the
done by the construction supervision consultant (CSC). The second type of monitoring will be
commissioned out by local organizations/consultants with sufficient experience in hydrological and
ecological monitoring. Result of monitoring of impacts will have to be reviewed and evaluated from time
to time by the M&E/MSC consultants. Findings might be used to revise the operational rules of the
project. Details of the institutional responsibilities have been described in implementation arrangement.

154.     Implementation Arrangements. The institutional arrangements for project implementation take
cognizance of the various tasks involved and envisage a multi-layered supervision and monitoring
arrangement. BBA has already constituted an Environment Management Committee and appointed Panel
of Experts to provide specific guidance on project design, implementation and monitoring. The Project
Management Unit has established a separate Safeguard (Environment and Resettlement) unit to be
responsible for overall coordination, management and monitoring of safeguard issues in the projects.
BBA will establish a Safeguard Division later on and the staff working in the Safeguard Unit of the PIU
will be integrated into the Safeguard Division. The environmental management system at BBA will also
be certified to ISO 14001 during the project duration. The implementation responsibility of EMP will
mainly rest on the different contractors and NGOs assigned by the BBA. The PIU will employ a
construction supervision consultant (CSC) for supervision of civil works, including supervision of
implementation of portions of the EMP to be implemented by the Contractor responsible for the bridge
and RTW. Environmental specialists of CSC, in coordination with environmental specialists in the
Safeguards Unit, will ensure the implementation of environmental management practices at each stage of
the project activities. The CSC will also be responsible for updating the EMP, if required. BBA will also
contract specialist expertise for the delineation of the sanctuary and the development of the visitor centre.
In addition, the PMU will engage independent M&E consultants to undertake monitoring of EMP and
RAP. The PMU will work together with, relevant Ministries and some national organizations and training
institutes like Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), Bangladesh
University of Engineering and Technology, etc. which will act as `twinning institutions' to build the
capacity of its own staff. These institutions will support the PMU through providing their laboratories for
analyses and other technical facilities. An organogram describing the relationships between the various
actors is in Annex 8.

155.     Consultation and Disclosure: The process of public consultation and participation has been an
integral part of all project preparations since 2003. During the prefeasibility and feasibility study a series
of consultations were organized and these were stepped up during detailed design. These consultations
were held as proposed in the Public Consultation and Participation Plan with formal and informal
meetings, village level workshops and disclosures of project impacts to the affected households and
communities. The views, needs and aspirations of the affected people as expressed during these
consultations have been incorporated in the project design and the proposed mitigating measures with the

 Establishment of a protected char area (the first in the country), incouding a fisheries sanctuary will have a positive
effect on the country's natural resources.

objective to maximize benefits and minimize adverse social and environmental effects. Focus group
discussions were held with groups of affected persons covering the issues like anticipated impacts,
possible solutions, etc. Formal consultations at three locations involving about 350 participants
representing affected persons, union and upazila leaders, NGOs, and national and local government
representatives were also held. The recommendations from the public consultations have been
incorporated in the engineering design and the resettlement and compensation plan for the affected
communities. In addition, consultations with experts were held during the detailed design phase to share
information on the project and to obtain feedback on important social and environmental aspects.
Guidance and expert advice on the social and environmental studies was also received from the Panel of
Experts appointed by BBA consisting of 10 national and international experts charged with periodic
review of procedures and progress of the PMBP.

156.     Five consultation meetings to disclose the results of the environmental and social assessment
and the EMP and SAP were held in the project area March 16 ­ 19, 2010. A national workshop was held
October 23, 2010. After completion of the Environmental Impact and Social Assessment, a summary in
Bengali has been prepared and distributed to local authorities and relevant stakeholders. The draft
Summary and the EIA and EMP have been published on the website of BBA and placed in various places
in the Project area and Dhaka. The hard copies of these documents will also be available at the BBA
office, project site offices and deputy commissioner offices for general public access. The EA/EMP and
SAP/RAP were approved by the Department of Environment on September 6, 2010. The reports were
submitted to the bank Info Shop on September 8, 2010. The reports have been disclosed on ADB and
JICA websites.

157.     Climate Change Impact on Bridge Design. A special study was carried out as part of the EA to
quantify the potential effects of climate change. Based on the results of the climate change studies the
following extreme situations were taken into consideration in the design of the Padma Bridge, a
maximum: (i) extra water-level increase at the bridge site of 0.4 m, which is the combined impact of sea
level rise (extreme scenario) and increased rainfall in the catchment area leading to a maximum water
level of 7.8m PWD for 100 year flood and 8.2 for check flood of 500 year ; (ii) temperature of 46.6 ºC
and a minimum temperature of 9.3 ºC; (iii) rainfall of 372 mm in 1-day period and 514 mm in a 2-day
period; (iv) discharge of 151,100 m3/sec and a lowest flow of 7,345 m3/sec; and (v) wind speed of 126
km/h.

                      BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

Background

158.     The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) aims to remove the last major physical
barrier in the road connection between Dhaka and the Southwest and South Central regions of
Bangladesh, home to about one quarter of the Bangladesh population. Currently there is a rather
unreliable ferry connection over the Padma River with limited capacity and long waiting times. Ferry
services are sometimes interrupted for days during fog and high floods. The construction of the Padma
Bridge will replace the unreliable and unsafe ferry connection with a reliable and safe fixed river
crossing. The bridge will shorten the distance from the Southwest to Dhaka by 100 km and travelling time
will be considerably reduced, by about two hours for cars and more than ten hours for trucks. When
completed, a reliable highway connection will be established 6 between Dhaka and the land port of
Benapole, the seaport of Mongla and the district headquarter of Khulna and Barisal. The provisions for a
railway line on the Padma Bridge will make it possible to construct a new railway connection between
Dhaka and the Southwest within the framework of the Trans Asian Railway network. Padma Bridge will
also include options for major utility connections to the Southwest including gas, power transmission, and
communication lines.

159.     The project area is located 40 km southwest of Dhaka (Map IBRD 28235). The bridge will be
constructed between a site near the village of Mawa, lying north of the Padma River and Janjira on the
south side. Components of the project such as approach roads and bridge end facilities will affect an area
of 6 km inland on the Mawa side and four kilometers (km) inland on the Janjira side; bridge and river
training works may even affect a corridor 15 km upstream and seven km downstream in the river. The
250 km2 project area comprises areas located in three separate administrative districts: Munshigansj
district on the Mawa side (north bank) and Shariatpur and Madaripur districts on the south side.
Lauhaujong and Sreenagar upazilla (sub-district) lie on the north bank and Janjira and Shibchar upazila
lie along the south bank.

160.     The new bridge, which will be over 6 km long, will form an integral part of the realization of the
Transnational Asian Highway network (Asian Highway no1), whose construction program was ratified by
the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) in 2004. The Road Masterplan for Bangladesh prepared in 2007,
earmarks the development of this highway (also called National Highway no 8), the Padma Bridge and
the two missing links as high-priority projects. The highway is of national importance since it will link
Dhaka to the Southwest of the country as well as to two major ports of the country. GoB has approved
this plan and earmarked the project as a national priority project for early implementation. The
completion of this project opens the way for accelerated socio-economic development of the SWR, which
is currently a relatively isolated and underdeveloped area. The incidence of poverty in the SWR is higher
than in the rest of the country. The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of the SWR (Khulna and Barisal
divisions) is only 17.4 % of the GDP compared to 38 % in Dhaka division. The Padma Bridge will help to
stimulate economic activity in the SWR by providing a reliable and rapid transport connection.

161.    Morphology of Padma River. The Padma is the third largest river in the world in terms of mean
average annual discharge and the second largest in terms of sediment transport. The Padma River is
fundamentally different from its two tributaries Ganges and Brahmaputra. While the Ganges is a more
predictably meandering river, in places contained by natural nodal points, the Brahmaputra is one of the
largest braided sand-bed rivers in the world, characterized by short temporal bursts of erosion and
deposition. The combined flow forms the young Padma River. While it flows mostly as single thread
channel at the bridge area, there have been periods when multiple channels occur. At present the Padma is

6
    Currently there are still two sections between Dhaka and Banapole which are not up to standard
                                                                42
in a stage of transforming again from a straight channel planform at the bridge site into a meandering one.
This means the existing south bank upstream of the bridge will likely experience major erosion again.
Historically, the bridge location has not been stable and major parts of the south bank approach road are
situated on young deposits of old major channels. Since 2005 river has eroded about 0.5 Km of this bank.
However, this location is better than the alternatives available. The north (Mawa) bank on the other hand
is characterized by very slow erosion processes and can be termed as quite stable. For more information
on the river morphology and hydraulics see Annex 2.1.

162.    Plans for Development of Railway in the Region. Bangladesh Railway (BR) is a large
Government undertaking and employs 37,000 staff. Its network comprises 2,835 km of railway track. In
FY 2008, BR carried 53.8 million passengers and 3.3 million tons of freight. In the SWR, BR is currently
running 134 passenger trains and 20 freight trains daily. Because of a missing link between Dhaka and
Southwest, regional movement of passenger and freight by railway suffered. Once the Padma Bridge is
built and the railway connection restored, there will be manifold increase in the movement of passenger
and goods between Dhaka and South west. Once the link is established through the Padma Bridge,
movement of freight between Dhaka-Mongla port and Chittagong port to Mongla port will reduce
congestion at the Chittagong port. The Bangladesh Railway has taken up a scheme of four projects
(Dhaka-Mawaa-Bhanga-Janjira link, Faridpur-Pakuria link,Bhanga-Jessore link, and Bhanga-Barisal link)
of constructing new railway lines to connect Dhaka to the Padma Bridge and southwest region (308 km of
new railway track) with an estimated cost of US$ 1.5billion. A plan has been prepared for these works,
however their implementation could take as much as another decade to get underway. The railway on
Padma Bridge will form part of the Trans Asian railway, provision of DFC (Indian Dedicated Freight
Corridor) loading has been kept on the bridge. This would be rail ready bridge, and track will be put in
place when the link between Dhaka and SWR is established. For the Jamuna Bridge, the railway line was
also established a few years after the opening of the bridge. During September 2010, GoB negotiated a
TA loan of US$23 million with ADB (Transport Project Preparatory Facility Loan for the Ministry of
Communication) out of which US$12 million will be used by BR to carry out a feasibility study of the
Dhaka-Bhanga railway link and a feasibility study and design of the Khulna-Mongla railway bridge.

163.     Climate Change Impact on the Design of the Project. Climate change may result in the rise of
future sea levels, higher temperatures, wind speeds and increased cyclone intensities and rainfall patterns,
which are all factors that may affect the design of the Padma Bridge. A study was carried out as part of
the EIA into the potential effects of climate change. Findings of this study are summarized in Annex 8.

164.   Impacts on bridge design. Based on the results of the climate change studies the following
extreme situations were taken into consideration in the design of the Padma Bridge:
        -       A maximum extra water-level increase at the bridge site of 0.4 m, which is the combined
                impact of sea level rise (extreme scenario) and increased rainfall in the catchment area
                leading to a maximum water level of 7.8m PWD for 100 year flood and 8.2 m for the
                check flood of 500 years;
        -       A maximum temperature of 46.6 ºC and a minimum temperature of 9.3 ºC;
        -       A maximum rainfall of 372 mm in 1-day period and 514 mm in a 2-day period;
        -       A predicted maximum peak discharge of 151,100 m3/sec and a lowest flow of 7,345
                m3/sec and associated scour depth and river bank erosion consideration;
        -       Maximum wind speed of 126 km/hour.

Project Components

165.    The Project is designed to support the development objectives. The layout of the project (in plan
form) is given in the Figure 1 below. The Project has following the following components:



                                                    43
166.    Component A: Main Bridge and Approach Roads (US$1,626.2 million). This component
will include construction of the foundation, substructure and superstructure of the main bridge and
services on the bridge, road viaducts, approach roads, toll plazas and various bridge end facilities.

167.     Sub-component A1.1: Main Bridge and viaducts (US$1,339.8 million). This would be a "rail
ready" road bridge. The main bridge would be about 6.15 km long consisting of a two-level steel truss
bridge with a concrete top deck slab. It would accommodate four lane divided highway on the top (about
22.5 meter wide) and would have provision for a single track on the lower deck. It would allow the
passing of a high pressure gas pipeline, and fibre optic cable. The crossing for power transmission would
be installed about 500 meters downstream from the main bridge using piers similar to the bridge.

168.     The bridge would consist of 41 spans (42 piers) with a span length of 150 meters found to be
most cost effective. The bridge piers would be placed on a foundation cap supported by six piles each
about 120 meters deep. Every fifth pier would be V shaped. The road viaducts linking the main bridge
with the approach roads would be about 2 km on each side with a gradient of about 4%. The span length
of road viaduct is 30 meters. Rail viaducts would be extended about 250 meters from the main bridge on
both sides that would allow appropriate connection with the rail viaduct to be constructed in the future
when the railway line is constructed in the region. About 4.8 km length of the bridge would allow
sufficient clearance for navigation (vertical clearance of 18.3 meters and horizontal clearance of 76.2
meters) of the river traffic passing through the Padma Bridge site. A general river bed scour depth of 46.7
meters for 100 year scour is used for the design with provision of 15 meters additional scour at the pier
location.

169.     The structural design is based on the assumption that an earthquake and the maximum scour
depth would occur at the same time. An earthquake with peak ground acceleration (PGA) with a 475 year
return interval is used for Padma Bridge. 7 As indicated above, impacts from climate change are
considered in the design of the bridge facilities. Future changes include expected large scale climate
change impacts and smaller scale changes in the catchment area. Recognizing the highly speculative
nature of the assumptions, the river discharges have been increased to account for increased rainfall and
runoff and the river water level has been increased by 0.4 meters to account for higher discharges and bed
level rises due to morphological changes.

170.    In an effort to optimize the bridge span and other factors of construction, the steel truss type of
bridge came to be the most efficient/economic solution with two levels. With this type of bridge it was
estimated that the incremental cost of accommodating a rail track is negligible. Therefore, given the
uncertainty of railway development in the future it is prudent to make a provision for railway loading on
the bridge that would be installed in the future. The rail loading provision was also made in accordance
with the Indian Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) standard (32.5 tons per axel instead of 25 tons
Bangladesh Railway standard) since the bridge is expected to cater to regional transport. The bridge
would have capacity to install rail track that would be laid in future.

171.     Provision of electricity transmission lines downstream of the bridge instead of on the lower deck
of the bridge is a better solution. Based on the generation capacity installed and plans in the near future,
a 400 KV transmission line is required in Bangladesh instead of 220 KV which was installed on the
Jamuna Bridge. A special study carried out for the installation of a power line on the bridge showed that it

7
  Intensity of an earthquake is usually measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (no mathematical
basis) and is based on observed damage and perception/ Magnitude of an earthquake is measured using the Richter
Scale and usually relates to the energy release; Peak ground acceleration (pga) is measurable and is used in the
design (for Padma 475 year return interval PGA of 0.144g). The pga will decrease as the distance from the
epicentre increases. Approximate relationship is that for a PGA of about 0.15g, the Mercalli intensity is
approximately VI to VII and corresponding Richter value would be say 6.0.

                                                       44
was very costly and complex to install the power transmission line on the lower deck (over US$300
million). Instead, passing the power line from around 1 to 2 Km downstream from the bridge on a pile
foundation, similar the bridge would be a better and cheaper solution. Approximately six towers would
be required to cross the power line. It would be very economical to install these piers under the Main
Bridge contract.

172.     Sub-component A1.2. Development of Construction Yards (US$57.5 million).                 This
would include preparation of construction yards for the main bridge contract covering some 147 ha on
both sides of the river. The cost is for raising the land to above flood level and river protection. This
would be done prior to the award of the main bridge contract. The cost for installation of equipment etc.
in the construction yard is included in component A1 of the project.

173.    Sub-component A2: Approach Roads and Bridge end Facilities (US$228.9 million). This
component would support construction of approach roads connecting the existing road work to the bridge
and Bridge end facilities and would include the following two sub-components:

174.    Subcomponent A2.1: Approach Road and Bridge end Facilities on Mawa side (US$35
million). On the left bank side (Mawa side) only a limited stretch of road, 1,5 km needs to be
constructed. One culvert would be rehabilitated. In addition this would include construction of a Toll
Plaza and Service Area 1 (SA1). Service Area (SA-1, about 27 ha) would house the consultants for
construction supervision (CSC) and management support consultants (MSC) on site with all basic
amenities (office, dormitory, mess, residences etc.).

175.    Subcomponent A2.2 Approach Road and Bridge end Facilities on Janjira Side (US$193.9
million). The approach road on the right bank (Janjira side) is approximately 10.5 km, which includes 5
small bridges (total length 270m), 20 culverts and 8 underpasses. In addition, there is provision for about
10 km of local service roads, access roads, roundabout, etc. The width of the approach roads on both
sides of the river will be 23.6 meters. They will consist of two lanes on both sides with a lane width of
3.65 m and two meters of hard shoulders. The roads are designed with a four meter central median with a
30 cm up-stand to prevent vehicles from crossing this central reserve. Along the road there is sufficient
space on both sides for a service road and for plantation of trees. The roads would be raised above the
maximum flood level.

176.     The component would provide financing for the toll plaza along with the equipment and facilities
for collection of toll. Toll plazas on Mawa and Janjira side would be identical. Both sides would have
ancillary facilities and a weighbridge.

177.     Of the two Service Areas in Janjira side, Service Area 2 (SA2 about 56 ha) will house the main
construction supervision office in Janjira with residences, offices, hostels and mess. The SA 2 will also
house the "bridge experience" consisting of a resort-type area, museum, offices, and associated facilities.
The Service Area 3 (SA 3 about 6 ha) has provision for office and lab for BBA staff/engineers,
residences/dormitory, indoor sports, parking etc. The Janira site would also have an emergency response
station, including trauma facilities to ensure proper handling of traffic accidents and as a stand-by in case
of any other emergencies or accidents on the bridge. Both service areas will be designated to
accommodate during operation a police station, restaurants, food courts, shops, mosque, visitor centre,
and sufficient parking for visitor and staff. Approach road on Janira side along with all bridges, SA3 and
Toll Plaza 2 would be financed by an IDB loan through a separate contract. SA2 and any remaining
works on Janjira side that are or cannot be financed under the IDB contract would be financed by IDA.

178.    Component B: River Training Works (U$799.9 million). The geo-morphologically young
Padma River is the third largest river in the world in terms of average annual discharge with an alluvial
bed and a complex rapidly changing morphology, flowing mostly as single thread channel in the reach at
the bridge. The river has a tendency to switch from straight to meandering and widens overall. The main
                                                     45
considerations in selecting river training options are the bridge length and low-risk alternatives for
stabilizing the river in the vicinity of the bridge. The river training works (RTW) are designed to meet this
challenge.

179.     The left bank (Mawa) is relatively high and stable. The river training works at the Mawa side are
about 1.5 km long with about 1 km upstream of the bridge tying into the low erodible, existing clay layer
that extends for some length into upstream direction.       The right (Janjira) bank is characterized by
periodic river attacks from a meandering planform. Presently the river is straight and the last meandering
channel from the mid 1990s is silted up. However it is expected that the meandering channel will be
active several times during the lifetime of the bridge. In addition to the bridge abutment and end facilities
the upstream approach road requires protection due to its vicinity to the riverbank. On the Janjira side the
length of the river training works is about 10.5 km.

180.    The river training works would involve substantial dredging (up to about 30 meters below
workable low water levels). The slopes above low water would be covered with concrete block, while the
slope under water would be covered with rock and alternatively geo-textile bags depending upon the
location (and the outcome of ongoing testing). The work is secured at the toe by a wide apron, designed
to launch in steps to the design scour depth. The slope of RTWs is in general 1V:6H, with local
adaptations. The total amount of dredging involved is estimated about 50 million m3 with about 10
million m3 on the Mawa side. About 4.5 million tons of rock would be used in construction of the RTWs.

181.     Component C: Implementation of Social Action and Environmental Management Plans
(US$291.9 million).      The PMBP is a large, complex and challenging project involving a variety of
issues ranging from land acquisition, physical and economic displacement, impacts on vulnerable groups
and other unanticipated impacts. This necessitates proper attention to the social and environmental issues
with focus on consultation, participation, gender, livelihoods, public health upstream and downstream
impacts on the charland settlements, ecology, and aquatic life during construction and operation of the
project. This component would support implementation of Social Action Plan including the Resettlement
Action Plans (RAP), public health action, gender action, charland monitoring and public consultation
plans and the environmental management plan (EMP).

182.      The component would cover the cost of land acquisition, payments for houses, trees, and other
assets, development of resettlement sites, relocation, reconstruction and transfer grants and special
assistance to the households headed by females, disabled and vulnerable and various measures for income
restoration. The public health action plan, aimed at minimizing risks and possible harmful effect on
health due to construction of the bridge, would support establishing and operation of health facilities and
implementation of preventive, and curative activities.

183.  Many of the EMP activities have been included with the construction contracts under other
components. However, some like tree plantations, establishment of protected area on charland,
community environment management plan etc. would be funded under this component.

184.   Component D: Construction Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact
and Social and Environmental Management Plans (US$72.0 million).

185.     Sub-component D1: Construction Supervision and Implementation Support (US$65.0
million). This component will cover the cost of consulting and other services for project implementation,
including construction supervision and project management support. It will also cover implementation of
all activities under the project: procurement, contract administration, quality control, certification of
payments, financial management, preparation of any additional designs, and bidding documents, etc.

186.   Sub-Component D2: Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact and Social and
Environmental Management Plans (US$7 million). The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities
                                                     46
would provide continuous feedback to the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), Project Coordination
Committee (PCC), Project Steering Committee (PSC), BBA and the project cofinanciers/development
partners (DPs) on the project's performance and impact of its various components, so that corrective
actions could be undertaken in a timely manner. The monitoring will be carried out by an independent
M&E consultants. They will also supervise implementation of the overall social and environmental
management plans and provide independent monitoring of various activities, assess positive and negative
impacts and propose alternatives to address any long-term or, during construction, social and
environmental issues. These consultants, namely the Management Support Consultants (MSC) would
also provide management support thus enhancing the capacity of BBA in project implementation and in
contract management, and help in playing the role of employer effectively.

187.     The M&E activities are likely to cover, but not be limited to: (i) the impact of the project during
and after completion on the communities at various levels; (ii) impact on various productive activities,
including, industrial, manufacturing sectors, crops, livestock, fisheries, commerce, and trade; (iii)
environmental impact of construction activities in the project area, particularly on any ecologically
important sites; (iv) acquisition of public and private land and assets, agreements reached and
arrangements made for acquisition of assets; (v) socio-economic impacts and the impact on the level of
employment, livelihood and household incomes in the project area; and (vi) evaluation of the SAP and
EMP implementation at completion; and (vii) estimation of the project's overall benefits and economic
rate of return at completion and prepare Borrowers ICR, etc.

188.      Component E: Project Management Support, Capacity Building of BBA, Technical
Assistance and Training (US$26.0 million). This component will support the BBA implementing the
project by coordinating all project related activities. It will include support for: (i) the operation of the
PIU including procurement and tendering of contracts, contract management, implementation of social
and environmental management plan, managing operation of the site, river systems, communication
strategy, project audits, liaison with stakeholders, civil administration, local and central Government and
the DPs etc; (ii) building the capacity of the BBA to effectively implement the project, O&M of the
bridges it manages and carrying out its full functions as defined in its mandate. In particular its capacity
would be enhanced in planning and programming, engineering section and O&M of the bridges, financial
management, procurement, and management of the environment and social issues; (iii) technical
assistance and training in such areas as designing of bridges, river training works, approach road,
hydraulics; detailed designs of structures; contract administration and construction supervision;
procurement; operations and management planning; asset management plans; financial management;
legal issues. This will include on the job training, post graduate programs, seminars, workshops, and
study tours, etc; (iv) an independent panel of experts for design and construction quality and safety
enhancement or any other issues that may have to be addressed during project implementation; and (v)
strategic studies, audits, mitigation measures and pilot projects, that may be identified during the project
implementation. This component would finance provision of consulting services, goods, minor works,
and incremental operating expenditures.

Project Cost and Financing

189.    The project cost is estimated to be about US$2,915 million. Cost by component, including and
excluding contingencies and estimates of IDC is given in Table 1. Project cost by component including
contingencies and category of expenditures is given in Table 2.

190.    Project financing has been secured and at this stage there is no major financing gap. The part to
be financed by GoB is not so extraordinary that it would strain the public expenditure program of the
Government. With appropriate toll policies, it can be financed with revenue surplus generated by the
Jamuna Bridge during the construction period of the Project. Also the amount to be financed by GoB is
not much more than the tax receipts from the investment.

                                                     47
191.     The agreed financing arrangements are that JICA, ADB, IDA and GoB would finance the main
bridge contract. IDA, ADB and GoB would finance the RTWs. IDB would solely finance a clearly
identified approach road contract on the Janjira side. Other works and activities would be financed by the
IDA. IDA Credit would finance 100% of cost of implementation of EA/EMP (Component C1) and bulk
of the SAP/RAP related cost (Component C2).

US$615 million and JICA US$400 million. With these commitments the Project is fully financed by the
DPs and the GoB and there is no financing gap. However, additional availability of concessional funds
for the Project would reduce pressure on the GoB's development budget thus allowing reallocation of
scarce development funds to other programs which cannot be funded by entities like BBA through
generation of their own resources.

                                      Morphology and Hydraulics


193.      Geology and Soils. The left-bank floodplain of the Padma River has been formed by relatively
old (5000 years Before Present) alluvial sediments, a patch of which is also present at the right bank of
the Padma River close to the confluence with the Meghna River. This material is considered to be more
resistant to erosion than the recent alluvial deposits. Most of the floodplain along the right bank of the
Padma River is formed by recent courses of the Ganges/Padma River and a patch of older and more
erosion-resistant sediment is located approximately 20 km downstream of the crossing site. Consequently,
most of the right bank (south side) of the river is relatively easily eroded alluvial sediments consisting of
very fine sand and silt, whereas much of the left bank (north side) consists of older, more erosion-resistant
materials. The different types of materials are illustrated on Figure 1.

      Figure 1: Location and extent of highly erodible bank materials along the Padma River




194.     Historical Development. The Padma River has undergone major changes in its alignment over
the last 230 years. Up until 1779 the Padma River was simply the downstream continuation of the
Ganges River. Between 1779 and 1826 the Brahmaputra started to occupy the Jamuna river course in
present day Bangladesh, flowing south along its present path to meet the Ganges near Aricha, more than
doubling its discharge. At that time, the Padma entered the Bay of Bengal approximately along the
present course of the Arial Khan. In response, the Padma widened and increased its braiding intensity,
although it initially maintained its course along the line of the Arial Khan. As more water of the
Brahmaputra River was diverted through the Jamuna River, the Padma River became wider. Over time
the river shifted towards the northwest direction by cutting through the Tippera and Arai-gur Surfaces
sediments. After 1826 the combined flow of the Ganges and the Jamuna Rivers was flowing through the
Padma River. Consequently the Padma River channel is exceptionally young in comparison to any other
major river in the world. Since the time-scales for morphological processes on large alluvial rivers are
commonly measured in decades or even centuries, it is likely that the influence of these developments has
affected the morphology and hydraulic characteristics of the river throughout its recent history.

195.    Channel Stability. Overlaying the channel boundaries from each year produces a map of
channel incidence (See Figure 2). At the bridge location and also along a 15 km long reach upstream of

                                                     51
Mawa, there was always some form of channel running along the left bank (channel incidence was
100%). However, the northern approach road is beyond the limit of historic channel incidence. Within the
bridge span, the channel incidence varies from 100% to 50%. On the right (south) bank the new approach
road falls within the historic river channel corridor, with the channel incidence ranging between 20% to
50%. Previous investigation, which did not have access to the long historic record available for this
study, concluded that the bridge crossing is situated at a stable nodal point. However, based on the more
comprehensive data set that has been compiled, it is evident that nodal points on the Padma River are
rather transient and will periodically disappear and re-form. It is conceivable that the river could shift
back to its configuration in 1942 to 1952 if river training works are not installed.

                         Figure 2: Shifting of the river boundaries over time




196.      The variation of the river width along the alignment of the Padma Bridge crossing was very
erratic. In 1860, it was about 16.2 km (See Figure 3), due to the presence of multiple channels. The width
reduced to 6.9 km in 1925 but rapidly increased to 15 km due to the appearance of multiple channels. In
the following decades the river width reduced drastically to about 2 km at the end of 1960s and early
1970s. Since 1980, the width of the river section became relatively stable and river width variation from 4
to 6 km range. During the last one and half decades the river width at this section has been showing a
persistently widening trend.

                      Figure 3: Changes in width of the river at bridge location




                                                    52
197.    Recent research has shown that during the second half of twentieth century there were huge
changes in the width and braiding intensity of the Jamuna, Padma and Lower Meghna Rivers. It
concluded that these changes were due to the propagation of a sediment wave generated by the Assam
earthquake of 1950. The sediment wave took several decades to propagate through the Brahmaputra-
Jamuna-Padma-Lower Meghna river system and finally to reached into the Bay of Bengal. A conceptual
model was developed to illustrate the processes of the sediment wave and the subsequent morphological
changes. The conceptual model for the Padma River is shown in Figure 7. In addition to the earthquake-
induced effects, the rapid morphological changes during the last few decades are probably affected by
several other factors such as the long-term northeast migration of the river courses and its interaction of
the cohesive bank along the left bank.

198.     Short-term Prediction of Future Channel Changes. Predictions of the short-term planform
changes at the bridge site were based on (i) an analysis of char development and migration, (ii) review of
historic meander bend movement and (iii) assessment of bathymetric surveys from 2008 and 2009. It
should be noted that the predictions involve considerable judgement and are tentative, subject to receipt of
additional monitoring surveys and other model results. A planform prediction for the year 2011 is
presented in Figure 4.

                   Figure 4: Padma River at bridge crossing (Prediction for 2011)




199.     Bathymetry surveys and satellite images indicate that the probability that Ch2 will develop
further and enlarge is less than 25%. The maximum probable extent of bank erosion along the right bank
at the bridge crossing is expected to be 80 m (probability 20%). As it is expected that the river at Mawa is
going to evolve to a single-thread channel, the overall trend is for channels Ch1 and Ch2. to decline in
2011. There is only a 5 to 10% probability that Channel Ch2 or Ch1 will increase further. In such a case,
the maximum extent of bank erosion at bridge crossing would be 150 m from the present position
(probability < 10%). Bar Br1 is expected to move further downstream and reach the bridge crossing. It is
likely that the right flanking channel at the bridge crossing will be silted up. In such case bar Br2 would
become an attached char.

200.     Hydraulic Properties. Figure 5 shows a three dimensional rendering of the Padma channel
based on the 2008-2009 bathymetry. The Padma River has a deep meandering thalweg that shifts from the
left (south) bank upstream from the Arial Khan offtake, to the opposite right (north) bank downstream
from it. Although the channel width at bankfull level is about 5 km wide, it is constricted in most parts by
large bars, especially at the bridge section. Contraction scour caused by these bars during low flows, plus
meandering flow impinging against the inerodible north bank, might help explain the deep channel
located near the north bank at the proposed bridge crossing. The lowest bed elevations reached values of
El. -28.7 m PWD. It is interesting to note that despite the relative straight alignment of the river, the 2008
bed elevation at cross section closest to the bridge crossing is the lowest observed in the past two decades.

             Figure 5: Padma River and adjacent south floodplain (near bridge location)




201.     A difference in 2008 and 2009 bed elevation plot near Mawa (Figure 6) shows that substantial
morphological changes can occur over a single flood season. The 2008 thalweg was partially filled in
2009 and migrated north by means of erosion. At the same time, large shallow bars present in 2008 were
significantly eroded.

202.     On August 29, 2009, NHC measured flow velocity and discharge at eight transects on the Padma
River near Mawa using an Aquatic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Water levels during the ADCP
survey were about 5.7 m at Mawa, while discharges were around 76,000 m3/s, which is the approximate
bankfull discharge and dominant discharge in the river. For a transect (101418) located upstream of the
proposed bridge crossing (See Figure 6) the average depth and velocity at this section are 9.7 m and 1.5
m/s respectively. However, depth varies between 6 and 25 m, while velocity peaked at 2.7 m/s (70%
larger than the mean). A deep channel is located in the first 1000 m from the left (north) bank, where unit
discharge (the product of depth and velocity) clearly shows values that are significantly higher than in the
rest of the channel. At this particular section, about half of the total discharge is concentrated in only one
quarter of the channel width. A large shallow bar (where depth is about 5 m) occupies about half of the
entire channel width, but it only conveys about 20% of the total flow discharge. Other ADCP transects
also show similar uneven flow distributions.

                BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

1.      Project Institutional and Implementations Arrangements

Project Administration Mechanisms.

203.     The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) under the Bridges Division of the Ministry of
Communication of the Government of Bangladesh shall be responsible for the execution and
implementation of the Project. The BBA was established in 1985 through an Ordinance establishing the
Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) to implement the Jamuna Bridge Project. The authority
constructed the Jamuna Bridge during 1993 to 1998 and has been maintaining it since then. Its mandate
was amended and broadened in 1998 to develop bridges greater than 1.5 km length. Through a
Presidential Order in 2007, its name was changed from JMBA to BBA. Since completion of the Jamuna
Bridge, BBA has completed the Mukhtepur Bridge in February 2008 with financing from China.

204.     Project Management Unit (PMU). BBA has established a PMU that would be primarily
responsible for carrying out day-to-day project implementation activities. The implementation
arrangements are shown in the Chart I. The PMU has been strengthened by providing additional staff. It
would be supported by consultants, advisors and appropriate Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for
implementation of the Project. The PMU would be responsible for all aspects of project implementation.
The PMU will be headed by a Project Director with four units: (i) Finance Unit; (ii) Procurement Unit;
(iii) Engineering Unit; and (iv) Environment and Sociology (Safeguard) Unit. Key specialists have been
recruited and the units have largely been staffed with qualified personnel. The PMU would be supported
by two sets of consultants, Construction Supervision Consultants (CSCs) who would help in construction
supervision, contract management, and management aspects of the project. An NGO would support PMU
in implementation of RAP and SAP, already selected and operating in the field. For civil works
contracts, the Project Director will serve as the Employer representative, and the CSCs supervising
consultant will serve as the Engineer for construction supervision. At the site, Resident Engineers,
appointed by the CSCs, with a team of specialists and inspectors will supervise the Contractor. The
Management Support Consultants (MSCs) would provide management support and in carrying out the
role of the employer. The MSC would also supervise the implementation of SAP and EMP, and carry out
independent M&E for the project activities and implementation. For implementation of communication
strategy and management of information and public awareness PMU would be support by qualified
communication officers.

205.     The PMU would supervise the implementation of Components A and B through its Engineering
unit, that would be supported by the CSC, also designated as the "Engineer' for the civil works contracts
and MSC who would provide management support and help it in the role of the "employer" under the
civil works contracts

206.     For implementation of SAP and EMP (Component C) of the Project, BBA/PMU has engaged
specialized NGOs (and will engage additional NGOs) and agencies to implement the safeguard plans
developed under the SAP and EMP. BBA through its Safeguard/RAP unit coordinates the property
acquisition with respective DCs and with the help of NGOs, regarding compensation according to the
land acquisition act and according to the World Bank Guidelines. BBA is assisted in its task by the DCs
of Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts for acquisition of land for the project and relevant
Ministries of Land, Environment, Agriculture, Forest livestock etc.. The Centre for Environmental and
Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) has been engaged to computerize land acquisition data with
GPS reference. The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) has been engaged to undertake
surveys and verify field data for preparation of RAPs.

An experienced NGO (Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh) has already been
mobilized for implementation of the three RAPs at field level. The implementation/monitoring of EMP is
likely to be supported by IUCN under a suitable institutional and contractual agreement.

207.    From previous experience it is now widely recognized that the task of successfully implementing
resettlement programs requires the typical experience, attitude and skills of NGOs working at grassroots
level. Most of the components of the SAP will therefore be implemented with the help of such
organizations. In total it is expected that five NGOs will be hired to implement RAP I, II and III, the
Public Health Action Plan, the Gender Action Plan and the Charland Impact Monitoring and
Development Framework. Also the development of a nature conservation reserve and the establishment
and management of a Charland Visitors Centre could best be carried in consultation with an NGO like
IUCN. The bidding document for Works Contracts will provide the guidance to prospective contractors,
based on the EMP, to prepare their own Construction Environmental Action Plan (CEAP), which will be
reviewed and approved for the successful bidder. The supervision by the CSC will also cover the CEAP.
A separate Management Support Consultant to be hired by BBA, will provide regular M&E support to the
PIU. Certain elements of the EMP, not implemented by Contractors, would be implemented through
NGOs.

208.     The PMU would also be responsible for Components D and E related to recruitment of
consulting services, and project management, BBA strengthening, strategic studies, audits and panel of
experts, etc.

209.    Project Coordination Committee (PCC). A Project Coordination Committee (PCC) has been
constituted to oversee the Project, provide policy-level guidance and inter-agency coordination for the
project. The PCC is chaired by the Minister of Finance, or another person acting on his/her behalf with
Secretaries of Planning, Economic Relations Division, Finance, Bridge Division, Agriculture, Forest,
Water Resources, Roads and Railway, Environment, Local Government, Implementation Monitoring and
Evaluation Division (IMED), Member (Physical Infrastructure) Planning Commission, Chief Executive
Officer of the selected NGOs, representatives of the local/district administration as its members and the
Project Director (PD) of PMBP. The PD PMBP would be the secretary of the PCC.

210.    Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC would help resolve project management issues
and address day-to-day implementation problems. It would be chaired by the Secretary and Executive
Director of BBA, and Secretaries of Planning, Economic Relations Division, Finance, Environment,
Roads and Highways, Local Governments, Agriculture, Water Resources, Forest, IMED, Member
(Physical Infrastructure) Planning Commission, Chief Executive Officer of the selected NGOs, Project
Director and representatives of and the consultants (CSCs, and MSCs) will be members. The Project
Director of PMBP would be the secretary of the PCC.

Financial Management, Disbursements and Procurement

Financial Management

211.    The financial management would be carried out by BBA's PMU. The PMU's financial unit will
be responsible for financial, planning, management and day-to-day payments. In carrying out financial
management, the PMU would be supported by qualified individual consultants, by Construction
Supervision Consultants (CSC), and the Management Support Consultants (MSC).

212.     A qualified professional accountant with adequate experience on financial management of large
infrastructure project is working with as the Senior Financial Management Specialist (SFMS). Reporting
to the Project Director, the SFMS will lead the FM functions of the project with the assistance of a
Deputy Director (Finance), an Assistant Director (Finance) and a few other support staff.
                                                     58
213.     Accounting and Financial Reporting. The Project accounting would be a subset of the BBA
entity accounting system that would be maintained under accrual basis meeting International Accounting
Standards and International Financial Reporting standards. A computerized accounting system would be
required to record accounting data and produce financial reports and statements on a timely and reliable
basis. BBA would develop this with support from the consultants. The chart of accounts will be
designed to capture project financial transactions in terms of different dimensions such as project
components, disbursement category and economic classifications. Until a computerized accounting
system is fully operational, books of accounts will be maintained manually using spread sheets for
analysis and reporting. Manual/excel based registers will be used to adequately record acquisition and use
of all projects' fixed assets. Physical inventory at the end of each financial year will ensure updated status
on usability condition and safe custody of the assets. Fixed assets such as vehicles, office furniture and
equipment, computers etc. that would be supplied under different works and services contracts will be
identified and recorded in the Asset Register.

214.    Until such time as a computerized accounting system for the project is fully operational, an excel-
based consolidated statement will be used for generation of quarterly IFRs as well as the annual financial
statements. The Project will follow the GoB Project Accounting Manual in maintaining books of accounts
and in complying with monthly, quarterly and annual financial reporting requirements of various
government agencies and also of IDA and other development partners. The project will produce Interim
Unaudited Financial Reports (IUFRs) on a quarterly basis showing project progress on all components
and sources and uses of funds from all stakeholders on a user friendly harmonized format and submit the
same to IDA and other stakeholders within 45 days from the end of each quarter. The contents and the
formats of the draft Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IUFRs) have been developed in discussion with
the BBA and the partners. IUFRs would include realistic expenditures forecasts based on the
procurement plan, updated implementation plan, and an analysis of payment obligations arising out of
contracts having regard to contractual progress milestones.

215.    Nature of Transactions. The project would be implemented through a few large sized ICB
contracts in which case most of the payments would be made to the contractors perhaps directly by IDA.
The payments to the contractors would be certified by Construction Supervision Consultants (CSC)
would be designated as the "engineer" for the works contracts. These arrangements would reduce the
financial management issues. The number of transactions would be higher in case of resettlement action
plan where several thousand beneficiaries would be paid compensation payments. For this purpose the
BBA would be supported by an NGO. Also the CSC would help to develop a financial management
system to ensure adequate control on and proper accounting of these small payments. All such payments
under Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be made through bank transfer to the bank accounts of the
beneficiaries. The FM unit of the PMU will undertake the independent pre-payment checking of such
payments. Having regard to the irregularities on implementation of RAP in Jamuna Bridge Project as
indicated in its ICR, Pre ­audit by the project auditor of all payments under RAPs would minimize the
fiduciary risk on this. IDA's FM supervision would also include review of controls in place on such
payments.

216.     Internal Control. Internal control on the separation and segregation of various functions under
financial management of the project will be applied as far as practicable. The bank account(s) will be
reconciled monthly by an Accountant and such reconciliation will be verified by the AD(F)/ DD(F) and
all identified unusual differences will be investigated expeditiously. The SFMS will oversee the monthly
bank reconciliation, countersign the cash book every month end and scrutinize before payment all bills of
contractors, consultants and other providers of goods and services. All bills of works contracts will be
certified for payment by the CSC. To facilitate cross checking of the invoices by the FM section of the
Project, the soft copy of all invoices should be submitted in addition to hard copy in original by the
contractor/ construction supervision consultant. All payments shall be approved by the Project Director.
Check signing arrangements will follow the two panel system.

                                                     59
217.     Internal Audit. BBA does not have an adequately functional internal audit unit that can be used
for performing the internal audit function of the project. Therefore, internal audit functions of the Project
will be conducted by hiring a chartered accountant firm with international affiliation, on the basis of a
Terms of Reference (TOR) agreed with IDA, by June 30, 2011. The firm will be selected through
appropriate competitive process to be prior reviewed by IDA. The internal audit report would be
submitted to the Executive Director, BBA with a copy to the Chair, Project Audit Committee and the
Project Director.

218.    External Audit. In addition to the annual entity audit by a firm of Chartered Accountants, the
Directorate of Commercial Audit under C&AG would audit the BBA accounts as per their constitutional
mandate. The entity audit would continue throughout the project implementation period.

219.     The Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate under C&AG would undertake the annual project
audit in line with the country system on audit of development projects with external financing.
Considering the magnitude of the Project, BBA would agree with C&AG on FAPAD assigning one
dedicated audit team under one Deputy Director for continuous audit of the Project throughout the project
period and report on a semi-annual basis with a copy to IDA. In all future audits during the project
period, audit TORs for the entity audit will be shared with IDA. FAPAD under C&AG will audit the
annual project financial statements. A Statement of Audit Needs (SAN) will be prepared by the BBA and
agreed with the C&AG. BBA will submit to IDA the audited financial statements for the project not later
than December 31 each year. The SAN will include audit focus on testing the efficacy of internal control
arrangements at various agencies and transaction testing for detection of fraud and corruption.

220.     BBA is currently implementing a PPF for the Project, there is no outstanding audit report or
ineligible expenditures. However, a large number of audit observations on the Bank financed Jamuna
Bridge Project (ended in December 1999) implemented by the same agency is still outstanding though
there is no declared ineligible expenditures. Though BBA has made some progress recently, the pace of
settlement of the objections is very slow. BBA is preparing an Action Plan to resolve the outstanding
audit issues. The following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit Report Compliance System:

                                                          Auditor General

221.    Project Audit Committee: To ensure that the audit reports generated by the external, internal
and operational audits of the project have met the TORs, the reports are reviewed and audit
recommendations are followed up, BBA will set up a Project Audit Committee (PAC) with a composition
acceptable to IDA by June 30, 2011. The PAC will conduct its business as per Audit Committee Charter
(TOR) prepared by BBA and shared with IDA. The PAC would meet at least twice a year

222.    Supervision Plan. The initial supervision will focus on compliance with all agreed actions,
terms, and conditions including Project FM staff being assigned and on board, identifying any FM or
disbursement issues in project implementation and agreeing on redressing measures. Padma Bridge
Project's readiness for access to Project funds, use of computerized entity accounting system for Project
                                                     60
financial management, production of first Interim Unaudited Financial Report (IUFR) on time, and use of
internal controls on FM functions will be closely reviewed by IDA's FM unit both on the desk and at site
as deemed appropriate for fulfilment of fiduciary objectives. In addition, supervision efforts will focus on
testing transactions, reviewing payment processes against the defined control framework, and monitoring
the progress of institutional preparedness and strengthening. The task team will also keep a watch on the
progress of main stream FM reforms through implementation.

223.     Risk Analysis and Mitigation. The overall project FM risk is rated as "High" in consideration
of the country level high inherent risks, FM capacity at entity level, inherent project level high risks due
to the large size with multiple financing agencies and substantial control risks on internal control, flow of
funds and audit assurance.

224.   Financial Management Action Plan. The following action plan has been prepared to address
the weaknesses identified in the FM assessment. This has been discussed and will be finally agreed with
BBA during appraisal:

Disbursements

225.    Financing Plan. The Project would be financed by an IDA credit SDR 779.3 million (US$1,200
million equivalent), and ADB credit of US$76 million and a loan of US$539 million, a JICA credit of
US$400 million, Islamic Development Bank (IDB) financing of US$140 million and the Government of
Bangladesh (about US$560 million).

226.     As indicated in the procurement section, the main bridge would be financed by IDA, JICA and
ADB. The River Training Works would be financed by IDA and ADB. Part of the approach road on the
Janjira side (one the right bank of the river) would be solely financed by the IDB. Any remaining works
on Janjira side that are not funded under the IDB financed contract would be funded by IDA. IDA would
also fund the Component D (consulting services), Component E (Project Management, TA and Training)
and implementation of EMP (Component C2) and part of the Component C1 (implementation of SAP).

227.   On-lending to BBA. The IDA credit proceeds would be re-lent by GoB to BBA at the original
terms. GoB would authorize BBA to withdraw the proceeds of the IDA credit and proceeds withdrawn
by BBA would be considered withdrawn by GoB.

228.    Flow of Funds and Designated Account (DA). Based on the onlending arrangements
mentioned above, funds from IDA credit proceeds would be passed to BBA. BBA will open a
Designated Account with such branch of any commercial bank as having adequate experience (in
maintaining such accounts), acceptable to IDA. BBA would be managing the Designated Account. In
addition to DA, the funds will also flow through Special Commitments and Direct Payments to the
contractors and suppliers of works, goods and services.

229.     IDA funds will flow to a Designated Account on the basis of six month forecasts through
quarterly Interim Unaudited Financial reports (IUFRs). Such expenditures forecast would be realistic
based on the procurement plan, updated implementation schedule, and an analysis of payment obligations
arising out of contracts regarding contractual progress milestones. The minimum application size for
reimbursement, and direct payment would be 20% of the advances to the Designated Account and will be
reflected in the additional instructions.

230.    Categories of Expenditures and Disbursement rate. The disbursement schedule is provided in
the Table 1 below. Part of the IDA credit for each component is allocated to the unallocated category so
there would not be an exact match between the project cost/financing table figures and the IDA credit
allocated to the expenditures categories --the difference is in the unallocated category. IDA would also
finance Category 3 covering SAP/RAP related expenditures covering purchase of properties,
compensation of assets for livelihood restoration etc, 100% up to US$206.3 million and any expenditures
above this amount would be financed by the GoB. Approval for the financing has been granted by the
Land Committee.

231.    Works for the Main Bridge procured as one contract are cofinanced by the ADB Loan, JICA
Loan, IDA Credit and GoB. Similarly, works as one contract for river training works would be financed
by the ADB Loan, GoB and IDA Credit, both would be financed from expenditure Category 1.            An
agreement has been reached with ADB and JICA that the disbursements for these works (Category 1)
would be made sequentially by each development partner by the GoB/BBA. Based on advanced
consultations during project implementation, the Borrower (GoB/BBA) would submit specific
invoices/payment requests to a specific development partner against which the development partner
would make full payment up to its total allocation for the category. Such payment requests by BBA
would include an update of disbursement position indicating the cumulative disbursement made by each
co financer against the amount committed and the balance remaining. Based on this procedure IDA
financing rate of works category is shown as 100%. The actual financing share is shown in the table for
financing plan.

a/      The main bridge works and river training works each contracted through a single ICB contract would be
        and financed by IDA, JICA and ADB, and IDA and ADB respectively, and using GoB contributions.
        Based on the agreements reached various bills/invoices of the contract would be 100% financed by a
        specific cofinancier.
b/      SAP/RAP cost under component C1 of project cover purchase of properties, and compensation for assets
        assistance to the affected people and , and provision of related goods, works and services. IDA would
        disburse 100% of such costs up to US$206.3 million and remaining expenditures are to be met by GoB.

                                                      63
c/       Part of the IDA credit for each component is allocated to the unallocated category so there would not be an
         exact match between the project cost/financing table figures and the IDA credit allocated to the
         expenditures categories --the difference is in the unallocated category.

232.    Operating Costs. These costs will include incremental operating costs for office utilities, office
supplies and stationeries, operation and maintenance of equipment and vehicles, hiring of vehicles, fuel,
office rent, events, bank charges, advertising costs, and incremental staff salaries and contractual
allowances of contracted staff but excluding salaries of Government officials.
Procurement

233.    Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, Revised October 2006
and May 2010 (Procurement Guidelines); and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, Revised October 2006 and May 2010 (Consultant Guidelines))
and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.

234.   All expected major procurement of works and consultants' services has been announced in the
General Procurement Notice (GPN), published in the dgMarket and United Nations Development
Business (UNDB).

235.    Procurement Responsibility. The overall responsibility of project implementation would be
with the BBA under the Bridge Division of the Ministry of communication. The BBA would be
responsible for carrying out all procurement under the project.
236.    Procurement of Works.         The project would have a few high value works contracts as
described below that would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) following
Bank's Procurement Guidelines and using the Bank's Standard Prequalification and Bidding Documents:

     (i) Main Bridge Contract, consisting of construction of main bridge, road viaducts, minimum
           required length of rail viaducts, services on the bridge, including minimum requirements for the
           installation of rail track in future, and separate facility for passing a power line. The contract is
           being procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) method, with pre-qualification (PQ)
           of the bidders, followed by          two stage bidding procedure with alternate options for few
           parameters;
     (ii) River Training Works, the river training works contract for both sides (estimated to cost over
           US$799.9 million) is being procured through ICB procedure using PQ and two stage method;
     (iii) Approach Roads and Bridge end Facilities on Mawa side would be an ICB contact (estimated
           to cost around US$35 million) could be procured using PQ, followed by bidding. This would
           cover approach roads, Toll Plaza 1 and Service area 1;
     (iv) Janjira Side Service Area 2 with office and other facilities estimated to cost around US$31.7
           million (and possibly approach road works that are not financed by IDB) would be procured
           through an ICB contract using PQ, followed by bidding.

237.    In addition to the above four contracts, there will be another ICB contract for Approach Roads
and Bridge end Facilities on Janjira side with an estimated cost of US$162 to be financed by IDB
following its Guidelines.

238.    The works contracts estimated to cost less than US$5 million for development of resettlement
sites may be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB). NCB would be carried out under
Bank Procurement Guidelines following the procedures for "Open Tendering Method" of the People's
Republic of Bangladesh (Public Procurement Act 2006, Public Procurement Act (1st Amendment) 2009,
and Public Procurement Rules 2008 (as amended in August 2009)- collectively referenced as PPA) with


                                                         64
the modifications outlined in the paragraph below and using standard bidding documents satisfactory to
IDA.

239.    For the purpose of National Competitive Bidding (goods and works), the following shall apply:
        (a)     post bidding negotiations shall not be allowed with the lowest evaluated or any other
                bidder;
        (b)     bids should be submitted and opened in public in one location immediately after the
                deadline for submission;
        (c)     rebidding shall not be carried out, except with the Association's prior agreement;
        (d)     lottery in award of contracts shall not be allowed;
        (e)     bidders' qualification / experience requirement shall be mandatory;
        (f)     bids shall not be invited on the basis of percentage above or below the estimated cost and
                contract award shall be based on the lowest evaluated bid price of compliant bid from
                eligible and qualified bidder; and
        (g)     single stage two envelope procurement system shall not be allowed.

240.    Procurement of Goods. Procurement of goods would be carried out using the Bank's standard
bidding documents (SBD) for all ICB. Goods contracts estimated to cost less than US$500,000 may be
procured through NCB. NCB would be carried out under Bank Procurement Guidelines following the
procedures for "Open Tendering Method" of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (Public Procurement
Act 2006, Public Procurement Act (1st Amendment) 2009, and Public Procurement Rules 2008 (as
amended in August 2009)- collectively referenced as PPA) with modifications as outlined in above
paragraph and using standard bidding documents satisfactory to IDA.

241.   Works. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and goods contracts estimated to cost
US$50,000 may be procured through Shopping. The Request for Quotation" under PPA is acceptable to
IDA as a form of shopping.

242.     Procurement of non-consulting services: Procurement of non-consulting services estimated to
cost up to US$2.0 million equivalent will follow NCB and contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or less
will follow Shopping. Depending on the nature of procurement, BBA will carry out such procurement
using Bank Guidelines.

243.    Selection of Consultants. Selection of consultants will follow the Consultant Guidelines.
There will be two high value consultancy firm contract using Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)
method. These two services are (i) construction supervision consultancy and (ii) management service
consultancy. Besides, for RAP implementation and monitoring, audit, etc. the following methods will
apply: Quality-based selection, Fixed Budget Selection (FBS), Consultants' Qualification (CQ), Least
Cost Selection (LCS), and Single Source Selection (SSS). Selection of individual consultants will follow
Section V of the Consultant Guidelines. The Procurement Plan will specify the circumstances and
threshold under which specific methods will be applicable.

244.    Shortlist of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per
contract may be composed entirely of national consultants. For the selection of these national
consultants, the request for proposal prepared on the basis of PPA and acceptable to the Bank may be
used.

245.     Operating Costs. These costs will include incremental operating costs for office utilities, office
supplies and stationeries, operation and maintenance of equipment and vehicles, hiring of vehicles, fuel,
office rent, souvenirs, events, bank charges, advertising costs, and salaries and contractual allowances of
contracted staff but excluding salaries of Government officials.

Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

246.     Procurement Environment. Bangladesh has a nodal procurement policy agency and a Public
Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 with associated Public Procurement Rules 2008 (PPR) and bidding
documents. It created a critical mass of about 25 procurement professionals and, as of now, provided
training to over 3200 staff of about 300 organizations. To sustain the reform, with Bank's assistance, the
Government has been implementing a second procurement reform project since late 2007, focusing
largely on the implementation and monitoring of PPA including introduction of e-government
procurement at key sectoral agencies.

247.    Notwithstanding the above, progress over the past years in reshaping the procurement
environment through procurement reform that include harmonized procedures, recently the new
Government made few amendments to the PPA that were found to be inconsistent with the Bank's
Guidelines and good procurement practices. The Bank as well as other key development partners raised
concern over those. The Bank for its projects did not accept those provisions for NCB as provided in the
sections above.

248.     Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment. The procurement capacity assessment was
carried out in BBA with web based Procurement Risk Assessment Management System (P-RAM S). The
assessment covered legislative framework, procurement planning, procurement processing, organizational
functions and staffing, internal control and support system, record keeping, and contract administration.
A detailed capacity assessment report is available in the file. The agency lacks adequate procurement
staff to manage such significantly high value procurements under this project. BBA had experience in a
similar IDA funded project (i.e. Jamuna Bridge Project), but that project was completed in 1998. The staff
that managed and implemented that project are no longer available in BBA. In addition to that, given the
country environment, BBA is not immune to systematic issues affecting procurement efficiency and
performance. Key weaknesses identified are: inadequacy in skilled procurement staff especially to deal
with bidding documents and evaluations of significantly large value contracts; inadequate capacity in
administering large and complex contracts; weak process of handling complaints; possible inappropriate
and/or collusive bidding practice; vested interests and political intervention. In addition, the following
areas need improvement: information dissemination, delivery follow up, and payments. Considering all
the facts and the nature of large value contracts, the project is rated as "High-Risk"(High Impact/ High
Likelihood) from procurement operation and contract administration viewpoint. Several measures to
mitigate the risks are either in place or being put in place and have been described below

249.    Measures for Improving Governance in Procurement. In order to minimize procurement
associated risks, the following measures have been agreed with the Government, part of which are already
in place while the remaining will be implemented as the project preparation moves and the project is
implemented. . Additional procurement associated governance risks and measures are described in
Annex 5.1.
        i)      A panel of experts with high reputation in the associated fields has been advising BBA on
                management issues including commenting on the PQ documents;
        ii)     A design consultant (firm) has been assisting BBA in preparing the pre-qualification and
                bidding documents for the main bridge and river training works. As part of the advance
                procurement actions, both of these contracts are currently at the prequalification stage;
                the consultant will also assist BBA in evaluations;
        iii)    A checking engineer is reviewing the designs and technical aspects of the bidding
                documents including commenting upon them;
        iv)     A short-term international consultant has been assisting BBA in the selection of a
                construction supervision consultant (CSC) and management consultants including short-
                listing, request for proposals, and evaluations;


                                                   66
       v)          BBA will hire by January 31, 2011 an individual national procurement consultant with
                   sound knowledge of both local and international procurement;
       vi)         BBA will establish a functional webpage as mentioned below with procurement related
                   information accessible to public by December 31, 2011;
       vii)        BBA will establish a system for handling complaints as described below and a database
                   for recording, monitoring and follow up those complaints under the project by June 30,
                   2011; and
       viii)       BBA will provide semi-annual report based on an agreed procurement risk mitigation
                   plan (PRMP) with a set of features as mentioned below.

250.     Establish a system for handling complaints. A credible system for handling complaints will be
put in place in BBA. The database of BBA should also record, monitor and follow up the procurement
activities under this project. The salient features of the system will be an oversight of a complaint
database including provisions of ascertaining by a bidder from the implementing agency the grounds for
rejection of its bid, a standard protocol with appropriate triggers for carrying out investigations, and
actions taken against involved parties. The system will be developed and managed by the implementing
agencies.

251.   The Procurement Risk Mitigation plan (PRMP) will have following features:
       1) Alert bidders in pre-bid meeting. BBA through a notification will alert bidders during pre-
               bid meeting on consequences of corrupt practices (fraud and corruption, collusion, coercion,
               etc.). The alert message, among others, will include that if bidders are found to have adopted
               such practices, there may be remedial actions including debarment from bidding processes in
               conformity with the Bank's Guidelines. For national competitive bidding, national bidders be
               barred, if any, under the PPA will not be able to participate. In addition, in the pre-bid
               meeting, the bidders will be clarified for preparation of bids correctly.
       2)      Alert internal officers/staff. BBA will issue alert letter(s) notifying about the fraud and
               corruption indicators and the possible consequences of corrupt and similar behavior in
               procurement practices and actions to be taken against the official staff if they get involved in
               such practices. Moreover, BBA will highlight that in case of noncompliance or material
               deviation from IDA's Procurement Guidelines, IDA may take remedial actions (i.e.,
               withdrawal of funds, declaration of misprocurement) for concerned contracts.
       3)      Multiple dropping. Multiple dropping of bids (bids submitted in more than one location and
               opened in one location) will not be permissible for any procurement under this project.
       4)      Bid opening committee (BOC) & Bid evaluation committee (BEC). A formal structured
               BOC will be constituted for each contract package. The BEC will have at least five members
               with two experts from outside the procuring entity with proven track record of experience in
               procurement; depending on the type of procurement such experts shall be either from public
               offices and/or from professional bodies/ individuals of known probity. Formation of such
               BEC shall be in conformity with the Bank's Guidelines and be acceptable to the Bank.
               Individual consultants and / or representative of the consulting firm may participate as a
               member of the BEC.
       5)      Bid opening minutes. During the same day of bid opening, photocopies of the Bid Opening
               Minutes (BOM) with readout bid prices of participating bidders will be submitted by BBA
               for circulation to all concerned. For prior review packages, such BOM will be shared with
               IDA.
       6)      Low competition among bidders and high price of bids. The case(s) of low competition
               (not solely based on number of bidders) in ICB and NCB cases coupled with high priced bids
               will be inquired into and further reviewed by BBA. The review and decision in this regard
               would be in the context of qualification criteria, the contract size (too small or too large),
               location and accessibility of the site, capacity of the contractors, etc.

                                                       67
       7) Measures to reduce coercive practices. Upon receiving allegations of coercive practices
           resulting in low competition, BBA will look into the matter and take appropriate measures.
           For prior review contracts, observations of BBA will be shared with IDA, along with the
           evaluation reports. BBA may seek assistance from law enforcing agencies to provide
           adequate security for bidders during bid submission. For ICB contracts, provision for bid
           submission through international/national courier services will be allowed and confirmation
           of the receipt of the bid will be informed to the bidders through e-mail.
       8) Rebidding. In case of re-bidding, BBA will inquire into the matter, record and highlight the
           grounds of re-bidding (i.e. corruption or similar, high bid prices etc.) along with
           recommended actions to be taken. For prior review cases, all such detailed reports will be
           sent to IDA.
       9) Filing and record-keeping. BBA will preserve records and all documents regarding their
           public procurement in accordance with provisions of the PPA, and these records will be made
           readily available on request for audit/investigation/review by the Development Partners and
           the Government.
       10) Publication of award of contract. BBA will publish contract award information within two
           weeks of contract award in its website, dgMarket/ UNDB online, and CPTU's websites with
           the following information: identity of contract package, date of advertisement, number of
           bids sold, number of submitted bids along with names, bid prices as read out at bid opening,
           name and evaluated price of each bid, number of responsive bids along with name of bidder ,
           name of bidders whose bids were rejected and brief reasons for rejection of bids, name of the
           winning bidder and the price it offered, proposed completion date of contract as well as brief
           description of the contract awarded.

252.    Procurement Plan. A draft procurement plan covering all major procurement packages in ICB
has been prepared for the entire duration of the project. This plan will be finally agreed between the

254.     Review by IDA of Procurement Decisions. The review by IDA of procurement decisions and
selection of consultants will be governed by Appendix 1 of the Bank's Guidelines. For each contract to
be financed by the Credit, threshold for prior review requirements and post review contracts will be
identified in the Procurement Plan. During the first 18 months of the project, IDA will carry out prior
review of the following contracts; this prior review threshold will be updated annually based on the
performance of BBA:
(i)           For Goods. All the ICB contracts and Direct Contracts irrespective of estimated cost. The NCB
              Contracts estimated cost equivalent or more than US$500,000.
(ii)          For Works. All the ICB contracts and Direct Contract irrespective of estimated cost. First NCB
              contract regardless of value and thereafter contracts estimated to cost equivalent US$5,000,000 or
              more.
(iii)         For Consultant's Services. Prior review will be required for consultants' services contracts
              estimated to cost US$ 200,000 equivalent or more for firms and US$ 50,000 equivalent or more
              for individuals. All single-source contracts will be subject to prior review by and in agreement
              with IDA. All Terms of references of the consultants are subject to the IDA's prior review; and

255.    Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision to be
carried out by IDA, the capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended semi-annual
supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review of procurement action

Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) Costs.

256.     The RAP related costs i.e. contracts for purchase of land and property and for other social costs
would be based on the procedures agreed in the RAP and negotiated by the implementing agencies
following Bangladesh law and guidelines for land/property acquisition and providing compensation to the
project-affected people. The RAP costs would cover, purchase of land and properties, compensation of
assets, assistance in moving and making such arrangements, consulting services, goods, works and any
other related costs. Payments for purchase of properties and other compensation made by the Deputy
Commissioners over US$40,000 equivalent and by BBA above US$100,000 equivalent for each


                                                         69
beneficiary would be subject to prior review by IDA and other payments would be subject to post review.
The prior review threshold level would be reviewed after one year and adjusted as appropriately.

Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

257.    The BBA will submit quarterly reports in an appropriate format to the GoB, PSC, and PCC and
the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter. The quarterly report would cover the progress
and expected completion dates for civil works and equipment supply contracts, progress on institutional
components, implementation of SAP and EMP, training and studies, and activities of the BBA/PMUs
engineering, M&E, procurement and financial consultants. The reports would cover financial and
procurement information, including: (a) comparison of actual physical and financial outputs with
forecasts, and updated six-months project forecasts; (b) project financial statements, including sources
and application of funds, expenditures by category statement, and special accounts reconciliation
statement; and (c) a procurement management report, showing status and contract commitments.

258.      The PMO will also prepare annual reports by no later than September 30 of each year of project
implementation. The report will cover: (a) the progress of each component, implementation of key
features of the environmental management plan, key performance indicators, operation of project
facilities, and financial statements; and (b) the Annual Work Plan for implementation, annual funds
required for implementation with breakdown by each co-financier, an updated disbursement profile,
planned actions for mitigating negative effects during construction, and target indicators for the coming
year. A mid-term review of the Project would be undertaken by October 31, 2013. An Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the closing date

259.     A group of consultants shall be recruited for M&E of the Project impact, including the
implementation and monitoring of the EMP, and the RAP. The M&E studies will evaluate the success in
project implementation in terms of meeting the project's objectives, and assess its physical, hydrological,
environmental, social, and economic impacts. The M&E activities will provide continuous feedback to
the GoB and the PSC on the project's performance, in mitigating its impact on the various components, so
that corrective actions can be undertaken in a timely manner. Changes in the PAD or the Project, if any,
will be reflected in the implementation review aide memoires and or communicated through exchange of
letters between the Bank and the Government. The Bank team would place an individual consultant in the
country who would visit the project site on a regular basis (twice a week), particularly in first two years of
the project, to monitor the project planning, implementation program for construction activities,
communication strategy, and EMP and SDAP activities.
Role of Partners
260.    The Project would also be financed by the ADB, JICA and IDB. The financing plan and mode of
financing is described in the PAD already. The World Bank is Lead/Coordinator Donor for this Project.
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) will be signed among the cofinanciers of the Project outlining
the coordination arrangements and modalities for project implementation, application of procedures etc.
Overall, the World Bank operations policies and guidelines would be applied to the Project. However, it
is has been agreed that cofinanciers would use their best reasonable endeavours to harmonize and
accommodate the procedures and guidelines of other cofinanciers. The MOU outlines that for:
a.    Safeguards requirements. Cofinanciers recognize the importance of environmental and social
     safeguards compliance requirements under the Project and agree to cooperate in implementation and
     monitoring of each safeguard document all of which have been are prepared for the Project and
     endorsed by each Cofinancier.
b. Coordination. To ensure smooth operation an efficient implementation and monitoring of the
   Project implementation, cofinanciers coordination committee (CCC) composed of representatives of
   each cofinancier is put in place.

                                                     70
c. Procurement. For contracts financed jointly, World Bank Standard bidding documents would be
   used and all cofinanciers would follow the requirements of World Bank Guidelines and the same
   would be specified in the bidding documents;
d. The ADB would make adjustments to their procedures as needed to allow joint cofinancing of the
   contract with the World Bank, these may include participation of contractors form the non-ADB
   member countries, etc. The World Bank would make best efforts to ensure that the contractors,
   suppliers or individuals debarred by the ADB are not eligible for financing under contracts jointly
   financed by IDA and ADB.
e. Disbursements. For contracts finance jointly, the Borrower may approach any of the cofinanciers to
   disburse entire amount of disbursement applications, subject to any retention conditions and upper
   limit of cofinacier's contribution.
f.   Cofinanciers also agree that changes in the safeguard and procurement documents (or any
     project documents) and other safeguard and procurement decisions would be subject to written
     agreement of each Cofinancier. The safeguard compliance review would be conducted jointly with
     a view to reach mutually agreed decisions. However, if a mutually agreed decision cannot be
     reached with 30 days then views of the Lead Cofinancier would prevail. If the cofinancier is unable
     to accept the Lead Cofinancier's view then such cofinancier will have a right to take actions as it
     reasonably considers necessary.

                  BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

Strategy and approach for Implementation Support 8

261.     The strategy for implementation support (IS) has been developed based on nature and "High" risk
profiles of the proposed project. It will aim at making the support to the client for implementation more
flexible and efficient and focus on the implementation of the risk mitigation measures defined in the
ORAF.

    ·    Procurement: There are two very large ICB contracts, Main Bridge (US$1.4 billion) and RTWs
         (US$800 million), three medium size contracts for approach roads. Several small contracts for
         development of RAP sites etc. The Bank team have been providing and continue to provide
         implementation support by: (a) technical, management and procurement expertise funded form
         the ongoing PPF; (b) training to members of the procurement committee and related staff in the
         regional project offices, as well as the project management consultant; (b) reviewing procurement
         documents and providing timely feedback to the procurement committee; (c) providing detailed
         guidance on the Bank's procurement guidelines to the procurement committee; and (d)
         monitoring procurement progress against the detailed procurement plan developed by BBA.

    ·    Financial management: Supervision will review the project's financial management system,
         including but not limited to accounting, reporting and internal controls. Supervision will also
         cover sub- projects on a random sample basis. The Bank team will also work with the project
         management consultant to assist BBA in improving coordination among different departments
         and units for financial management and reporting.
    ·    Environmental and social safeguards: The Bank team will supervise and provide supports to
         BBA for the implementation of the agreed Environmental Management Plan and the Simplified
         Resettlement Action Plan.
    ·    Anti Corruption: the Bank team will supervise the implementation of the agreed Governance and
         Accountability Action Plan.
    ·   Technical Aspects/Independent Panel of Experts: The Bank credit would support an
        independent panel of experts consisting of internationally renowned experts in the fields of
        Bridge, river, and structural engineering, geotechnical and foundations expertise, structural
        construction technology, environmental and social, and institutional and livelihood restoration
        aspects.
    ·   Coordination with the Development Partners. Bank team would help Government in
        coordination among the Development Partners, help in addressing project management,
        procurement, disbursement, financial management as well as the safeguard issues.
    ·   Other issues: Some issues like toll strategy, O&M of the bridges, strengthening of BBA, etc.
        will not be addressed just at the Project level but through Bank's policy dialogue with the GoB,
        Ministry of Finance, and BBA.

 This is an indicative and flexible instrument which will be revised during implementation as part of the ISR and
adjusted based on what is happening on the ground. The implementation plan should be consistent with the design
and riskiness of the operation, and should be adequately resourced.

                                                        78
Implementation Support Plan

262.    Most of the Bank team members will be based in the Bangladesh country office, some would
be in Washington and others in country offices in the region to ensure timely, efficient and effective
implementation support to the client. Timely monitoring and support to BBA will be mainly provided
by the team members in the country offices of the region, especially for the first 18 months. Formal
supervision and field trips will be carried out semiannually. The supervision mission would be
coordinated with the other Development Partners (DPs) jointly financing the project. To the extent
most almost all supervision missions would be undertaken jointly with other DPs.

263.    Detailed inputs from the Bank team are outlined below:

   ·    Technical inputs. Bridge engineering and river engineering inputs are required to review of
        bidding documents to ensure fair competition through proper technical specifications in the
        bidding documents and fair assessment of the technical aspects of the bids. The task team has
        contracted with individual consultants for these skills. Specialist and high level procurement
        skills are required for review if the major works contracts as well as the two consulting services
        CSC and MSC. During construction and commissioning, technical supervision is required to
        ensure contractual obligations are met on technical grounds. Field visits by the team's Bridge
        and River Engineers will be conducted on a semiannual basis throughout project
        implementation.
   ·    Fiduciary requirements and inputs. Training will be provided by the Bank's financial
        management specialist and procurement specialist. The team will also help BBA identify capacity
        building needs to strengthen its financial management capacity and to improve procurement
        management efficiency. Both financial management and procurement specialists will be based in
        the country office to provide timely support. Formal supervision of financial management will
        be carried out semi-annually, while procurement supervision will be carried out on a timely basis as
        required by the client. The BBA would be provided by the consulting services in this area and
        assistance by CSC and MSC. In addition under component E of the project funds are available to
        the BBA for recruitment of specialized skills as needed. Bank can help in identifying the
        consultants needed for these required skills.
   ·    Safeguards. Inputs from an environment and a social specialist are required, though the project's
        social and environmental impacts are limited and the client capacity is generally adequate. Training
        is required on environment monitoring and reporting. On the social side, the supervision will
        focus on the implementation of the agreed land acquisition and resettlement plan. Field visits are
        required on a semi-annual basis. Both social and environmental specialists are country office
        based. The MSC would help in independent monitoring of the safeguard issues and highlighting
        to the Bank team any issues, possible alternative solutions in a timely manner.
   ·    Institutional Review of BBA and capacity building. Input would be required from highly
        qualified institutional specialist to support and monitor BBA in capacity building component of the
        Project.
   ·   Financial review of BBA corporate finance. Input is required from a highly skilled financial
       specialist for regular review of BBA financial status to verify compliance of financial covenants.

   · Operation. An operations officer based in the country office will provide day to day supervision
       of all operational aspects and coordination with the client and among Bank team members.

        ANNEX 5.1: GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACTION PLAN (GAAP)

                 BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT


264.    The Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge
Project (PMBP) is designed to reflect the specific responsibilities of the implementing agency, the
Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), and the World Bank to facilitate effective and appropriate use of the
funds for the project, preclude the incidence of corruption and enhance good governance. This plan is
based on an assessment of the governance risks, particularly fraud and corruption, the context for
addressing Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) issues in Bangladesh and specifically for the entities
involved with the PMBP. It also is based on Bank experience in addressing governance and anti-
corruption issues, and, in particular, the Bank's experience in having financed the earlier Jamuna Bridge
project. The GAAP will be adjusted as necessary during implementation to reflect governance issues
which may emerge and/or to strengthen or add actions. It will be monitored regularly through indicators
and reflected in monthly progress reports by the implementing agency, as well as in World Bank
implementation supervision reports and aide memoires for supervision missions.

Country Context and Background Analysis.

265.    Bangladesh is a high risk environment. It scores poorly on international corruption monitoring
indices although there have been some improvements in recent years, Its efforts to bolster its legal
framework to counter corruption, including the empowerment of an Anti-Corruption Commission,
passage of an Anti-Money Laundering Act, a soon-to-be adopted law protecting whistle-blowers, and
joining the UN Convention against corruption have not yet yielded substantial gains. Institutions of
accountability are weak and country systems to deter corruption such as asset statements or prosecution of
corruption cases are spottily enforced. These capacity and governance shortcomings in the public sector,
combined with the susceptibility of large civil works projects worldwide to fraud and corruption,
underline the importance of an action plan that utilizes a robust range of tools to mitigate corruption and
poor governance risks. This GAAP seeks to achieve these objectives, and will be adjusted as is necessary
to new circumstances and to challenges and risks throughout project implementation.

266.     The PMBP is an extremely high-profile project, which in itself has important implications for
governance. On the one hand, the people of Bangladesh, the majority of civil society, and especially the
people of the Southwest Region and the project area support the project. They are keen to ensure that it is
implemented properly and on time. It is the signature project of this Government, whose current political
mandate expires in 2013. Prominence invites scrutiny: media are constantly examining the status of the
project, tracking various activities such as prequalification, procurement, contracting land acquisition,
compensation, etc. Moreover, the size of the works involved are so large that they will be observed by
major organizations and governments of contractors' countries of origin, other contractors internationally,
professional and engineering societies and the international press. For this reason, strong latent demand
for good governance exists.

267.    The project's prominence is also significant for potentially providing a model for good
governance and sound institutional arrangements, thereby generating positive demand-side pressures on
other institutions in the public sector. Several GAC measures and robust arrangements have been
introduced in this project to provide additional checks which are somewhat unique to this megaproject,
and may be less transferrable in terms of institutional development to public sector performance as a
whole. However, some good practices contributing to successful implementation, such as extensive suo
motto disclosure as per Bangladesh's Right to Information Act or third party monitoring of procurement
practices will serve as a valuable example for other public sector bodies and development projects.

                                                    82
268.     The Bank's strategy for improving governance in Bangladesh, laid out in its 2011-2014 Country
Assistance Strategy, focuses on developing accountability mechanisms in public sector operations,
especially through increased transparency. The Bank seeks to align with Government priorities in
developing the means of accountability, especially strengthening of public financial management, support
for local government, use of information and communication technology (ICT) and the adoption of a
Right to Information (RTI) regime. In particular, the Bank is working with the Government to improve
budgeting practices among line agencies in conjunction with enhanced accountability mechanisms. It is
working to increase the role and quality of oversight of public finances by the Parliamentary Accounts
Committee, improve capacity of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office, and promote greater
public understanding of public financial management to build more informed demand and ability to hold
Government accountable. The Bank's strategy also focuses on improving public service delivery, a key
component of which is fostering greater accountability to recipients of services including through a
strengthened role for local government. The Bank supports the Government's efforts to establish
functioning RTI regime, including building capacity in all agencies to provide information more fully and
efficiently. The Bank also continues to emphasize the importance of building demand for good
governance among civil society, which in turn requires facilitation of avenues for civil society to engage
with, and monitor the performance of, the public sector.

269.    The Bank maintains a strong policy against corruption, and presses for sanctions on those who
engage in it. Similarly, the Bank recognizes the importance of strengthening country systems to prevent
corruption from occurring. Given the heightened integrity risks for this project, the GAAP is based on
ensuring that every action in the project is identified in detail and subject to heightened multi-party
scrutiny. Complementing this GAAP is the Bank's regular system of investigation and potential
sanctions for fraud and corruption operated by its Integrity (INT) Vice Presidency (including cross-
debarment provisions with other multilateral development banks). INT's preventive services unit was
consulted in defining this project's GAAP.

270.     The Jamuna Bridge Project and experience with other large infrastructure projects offer lessons
for addressing GAC concerns which have been internalized in the PMBP. These include: (i) designing a
procurement plan that allows for extensive scrutiny and obtains the best construction expertise available;
(ii) engaging in comprehensive prior consultations and designing an effective communications strategy
during construction; and (iii) ensuring multiple, robust monitoring mechanisms. The Project Monitoring
will involve dedicated staff in the Project Management Unit (PMU) for engineering, construction
supervision by internationally recruited Construction Supervision Consultants (CSC) who would be the
"engineer" for the civil works contracts, consultant support for environment and social aspects and an
independent M&E consultancy (internationally recruited Management Support Consultants) to monitor
progress and supervise the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Social Action Plan (SAP)
activities. It will also involve enhanced Bank supervision, including an in-country consultant who would
visit the project site on a regular basis in the first two years of the project, when construction will be
taking place, to keep the Bank and the project coordination committee and project steering committee
informed of issues arising in project implementation.

271.    However, audit observations on the Bank-financed Jamuna Bridge Project (ended in December
1999) implemented by the same agency are still outstanding, though no ineligible expenditures were
declared. Though BBA has made some progress recently, the pace of settlement of the objections is slow.
BBA has prepared an action plan to resolve the outstanding audit issues, which will be reviewed by the
task team.
272.     Institutional arrangements for implementation were determined through analysis of the relevant
institutions and lessons learned from the past. The BBA, an entity under the Bridges Division of the
Ministry of Communication, was a priori the appropriate institution given its mandate. It is the successor

                                                   83
entity to the Jamuna Bridge Authority, the special purpose entity which successfully implemented (on
time and on budget) the previously largest bridge project in Bangladesh. The BBA has demonstrated a
good track record of on time and on-budget implementation of large infrastructure projects in Bangladesh.
Contrary to the Roads and Highway Department, the BBA has a stronger record of performance and a
higher degree of transparency, accountability, and integrity. For these reasons, the BBA has been
entrusted with the implementation of the PMBP in conjunction with robust monitoring measures.

273.     The BBA underwent an external institutional review in two phases in late 2009 in anticipation of
its role as implementing agency under PMBP. The review found that the BBA had a small range of
functions related to the maintenance of several large bridges despite the broader, if vaguely worded,
mandate set forth in the Act which created it. The review noted that, in part because of the low volume
of work, the agency had a top-heavy structure with weak technical capacity with the partial exception of
the Engineering Department. It also suffered from low morale and a bureaucratic culture that was not
results-oriented. Key staff from the Jamuna Bridge project were no longer at BBA. These findings
informed a capacity building plan involving the establishment of a robust Project Management Unit in
recognition of the one-off nature of intensive work during the tendering and construction for this major
bridge, expected to be the last such megaproject for the foreseeable future.

274.     BBA also underwent a review of its procurement and financial management systems. This
included a procurement capacity assessment with the web-based Procurement Risk Assessment
Management System (P-RAM S). The assessment covered the legislative framework, procurement
planning, procurement processing, organizational functions and staffing, internal control and support
system, record keeping, and contract administration. Capacity in all these areas was found to be in need
of strengthening. In addition, a review of financial management systems was conducted and identified
significant accounting and internal audit weaknesses that will need to be addressed under the project. On
this basis, Government prepared a capacity enhancement plan for BBA in 2010, the implementation of
which has been incorporated in this GAAP. The capacity building and strengthening of BBA is supported
through ongoing Project Preparation Facility (PPF of US$3 million), and ADB support technical
assistance loan and substantial resources are incorporated in the project (component E2 about US$14
million) to continue enhancing BBA's institutional capacity.

Governance and Corruption Risks

275.     Four areas of GAC risk have been identified under the PMBP: institutional and organizational
weaknesses in the implementing agency; specific procurement risks; contract management and execution
risks; and fraud and corruption in implementing the SAP/RAP.

276.    Institutional Risks. The BBA suffers from systemic issues involving the civil service which
affect procurement efficiency and performance, including a need for greater accountability. Stronger
accountability for performance and internal controls to counter fraud and corruption are needed. Systems
for provision of information to the public and handling complaints or feedback from third parties on
performance are nascent. As noted above, assessments of capacity for procurement and financial
management have been identified areas for strengthening.

277.     Procurement risks. Possible risks include fraud, corruption, collusion, and coercion amongst
parties involved in the procurement process. For example: collusion among the bidders; corruption
involving bidders and government officials; fraudulent documents; corruption between the bidder and the
engineer; and corruption between the winning bidder and the approving authority. Conflicts of interest
may present a serious problem, most notably through relationships with government officials, whether
direct or indirect, including through companies and/or relatives of officials.


                                                   84
278.    Contract execution and project management risks. Collusion is also possible between the
contractor and the PMU, including but not limited to aspects related to quality assurance, extension of
time, variations to contract and price adjustment. Collusion can also involve the independent
Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC) retained to serve as engineer on the contracts and oversee
technical implementation. However, this would be a substantial reputational risk for the internationally
recruited consultants, also the Bank Standard Bidding Documents modeled on the FIDIC documents have
provision to deal with possibility of such collusion.

279.     Risks in delivery of benefits under the Social/Resettlement Action Plan (SAP/RAP). Fraud is
possible in the identification of recipients by either delivery agents or individuals seeking benefits, as well
as in inflating numbers of benefits recipients with false or `ghost' entries.

Actions to Mitigate GAC Risks

280.     GAC concerns will be addressed through a combination of project design and special measures to
reflect three basic principles: maximum transparency and provision of information about every step or
action undertaken including the individuals or entities involved; ensuring that multiple parties are in place
to provide external assessment of the actions that are undertaken in order to have a robust system of
scrutiny and checks; and enhanced use of mechanisms for feedback from individuals outside the
implementation of the project, particularly through use of ICT. Below is a summary of the actions to be
undertaken followed by a matrix summarizing the actions, responsible entities, timelines, and warning
signs to trigger additional review through Bank supervision and/or investigation. It is important to stress
that these measures are not meant to be exhaustive. Depending upon emerging risks highlighted by more
intense project monitoring, additional measures may be necessary

281.     Institutional risks. BBA is provided with (using PPF Funds) more skilled and professional staff
to deal with bidding documents and evaluations of large value contracts, and to administer large and
complex contracts. To strengthen financial management systems with enhanced internal controls,
including a more robust internal audit capacity additional staff have also been recruited. BBA will also
adopt a code of ethics for its staff's conduct in order to emphasize the need for propriety and to strengthen
internal controls.

282.    The Project Management Unit has been strengthened with externally-hired staff to be responsible
for day-to-day implementation within the BBA (a detailed description of administrative and project
oversight arrangements is in Annex 3). Specifically, there will be dedicated staff in the Project
Management Unit for engineering construction supervision by an internationally recruited Construction
Supervision Consultants who would be the "engineer" for the civil works contracts, consultant support for
environment and social aspects, and an independent M&E consultancy (internationally recruited
Management Support Consultants) to monitor progress and supervise the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) and Social Action Plan (SAP) activities.

283.     The BBA will also designate as per the Right to Information Act an information officer dedicated
to PMBP as well as an internal appellate authority (having jurisdiction to hear appeals and review
decision) for requests for information. The information officer and appellate officer will be provided with
sufficient training on the Right to Information regime and adequate staff and administrative support to
carry out an expansive communications program of proactive disclosure (described below)

284.    Multiple oversight entities will scrutinize BBA's performance, particularly on governance and
countering corruption. First, the BBA's performance will be overseen by a Project Coordination
Committee chaired by the Minister of Finance or his/her designee. Second, the Management Support
Consultants (MSC),which reports to the Bridges Division and the Project Steering Committee,) will also

                                                      85
commission an additional outside party to carry out monitoring and evaluation of project performance,
including of financial management. Third, the project will continue to have an Independent Panel of
Experts (IPOE) consisting of an equal number of eminent Bangladeshi and expatriate experts to review
the designs for the project. The IPOE primarily provides technical review but also will ensure additional
scrutiny to guard against corruption. With individuals of professional competence and well-regarded
reputations, it has unique technical capacity to recognize misconduct in performance of works that others
might miss. It is anticipated that some individuals on the panel may be substituted as the project goes to
the construction phase, but the principle of a mixed Bangladeshi-expatriate grouping will remain.

285.     The most senior oversight entity will be a Project Integrity Advisor appointed by, and solely
accountable to, the Prime Minister. The Project Integrity Advisor will have the authority to take decisions
and report to the Prime Minister concerning project governance issues independent of staff and
individuals engaged in project implementation. This individual will serve as a figure of institutional
integrity for the project, and as such must be a person who is recognized within Bangladeshi society for
integrity, independence, and concern for the public good. The position will be endowed with powers to
require provision of information and documents from all project-related entities and individuals which, if
there is cause, may be subject to further investigation and legal action. The Project Integrity Advisor will
serve as the liaison to the World Bank and other co-financiers on all issues related to governance and
corruption. The creation of this institutional arrangement will signal the commitment of the Government
to ensure the highest standards of integrity in carrying out the project. Terms of reference for the Project
Integrity Advisor will be developed in consultation with IDA. The GoB will not later than March 15,
2011 issue an order, in form and substance satisfactory to IDA, which shall include inter alia: (a) the
appointment of a Project Integrity advisor, with independence from Project implementation satisfactory to
IDA, and (b) the terms of reference of such Project Integrity Advisor.

286.     The project will provide extensive access to a broad range of civil society organizations and
media regarding all aspects of project performance as part of its communications strategy. This will
entail regular Accountability meetings with civil society organizations (CSOs) operating near the project
site and in Dhaka as well as visits at BBA offices and the project site to demonstrate project progress and
allow for questions. CSOs will be expressly informed that they are free to ask any questions and receive
any information about the project.

287.      A qualified professional accountant with appropriate experience in financial management of large
infrastructure project will work in the PMU as the Senior Financial Management Specialist (SFMS),
reporting to the Project Director, with terms of reference agreed with the Bank. Because BBA's internal
audit unit requires enhancement, these functions (including capacity building) will be conducted by hiring
a local chartered accountant firm with international affiliation, selected through appropriate competitive
process subject to prior review by the Bank. Another firm of chartered accountants with international
affiliation will carry out the external audit throughout the project implementation period. Given the
magnitude of the project, BBA would agree with the Comptroller & Auditor General's Foreign Aided
Project Audit Directorate to assign one audit team for continuous audit of the Project throughout the
project period and report on a semi-annual basis with a copy to IDA and co-financiers.

288.    Procurement Risks. These risks are addressed through the overall design of the project and
through enhanced transparency, in addition to following Bank ICB guidelines with its requirements for
firm timelines, transparency, and other mechanisms to guard against corruption. Works, goods, and
services procured under the project have been grouped into five large contracts (four of which involve
IDA financing) to be carried out at one site. This concentration of contracts allows for extensive scrutiny
and special arrangements for each procurement and subsequent management of execution. In order to
avoid undue influence on procurements, a detailed mapping of each step in the procurement process with
a designation of a finite list of persons with access to specified documents and associated information will

                                                    86
be put in place and shared with the World Bank and monitored/verified through Bank supervision. The
mapping will be reviewed by the Bank in order to ensure appropriate access to sensitive documents on a
need-to-know basis and maximum publication of other documents. Technical Evaluation Committee
(TEC) for each of the contracts will have a mixed composition to provide for system of checks and
monitoring to guard against collusion. The TEC for evaluation of bids will include eminent external
representatives (such as well recognized staff from technical universities), representatives from other
government agencies outside of the Ministry of Communications, as well as one or more internationally
selected expatriate experts.

289.     All officials of the Ministry of Communications, its Bridges Division, and the BBA who are
involved with the process of procurement for the PMBP, including issuance of recommendations for
contract awards, as well as TEC members, shall be required to submit declarations of no conflict of
interest in these procurements. These declarations shall specify that there is no conflict of interest
between bidding organizations and their personnel and (a) TEC members or their close relatives, or (b)
other officials of the Ministry of Communications, Bridges Division, and the BBA involved with the
procurement process or their close relatives. The declarations will be submitted prior to the
commencement of evaluation of bids. The BBA will maintain these declarations on file as well as
provide them to the Bank. If during the procurement process a TEC member is found by any Project
oversight entity or by the Bank to have concealed a conflict of interest, that individual shall be
immediately replaced on the TEC. The GoB is aware that if such information is revealed following the
conclusion of the procurement process the Bank will consider appropriate remedies.

290.    All senior personnel of BBA, including the Executive Director, Project Director, and heads of
departments in the PMU as well as any other BBA staff participating on a TEC, will be required to submit
a statement of his/her financial interests and affiliations at present and in the preceding year as well the
analogous affiliations and interests for the same period for his/her spouse 9. These statements will be filed
on an annual basis. A standard format for reporting financial interests/affiliations will be agreed in
advance with the Bank. These statements will be shared with the World Bank and an ethics subcommittee
for the project consisting of three members of the Project Coordination Committee, as well as the
appointed Project Integrity Advisor. The BBA will maintain a register of financial interest statements. If
during the procurement process BBA personnel on a TEC is found by the Project Coordination
Committee or by the Bank to have falsified the listing of his/her relatives, his/her own financial interests,
or his/her spouse's financial interests, that individual shall be immediately replaced on the TEC. The
GoB is aware that if such information is revealed following the conclusion of the procurement process the
Bank will consider appropriate remedies.

291.     Bidding documents including the Request for Proposal, instructions to bidders/consultants, and
model contracts would includes measures to mitigate misconduct. For instance, bidders would be required
to: disclose in full any agents used by the bidders during the procurement process, along with the terms on
which those agents were hired (both scope of work and remuneration); and certify any conflict of interest
most notably relationships with government officials, whether direct or indirect (e.g., via direct
relationships with the officials related to the subject tender, or via companies and/or relatives of officials).
These documents would also define the scope of the Bank's audit rights.

292.    Transparency of the procurement process will be enhanced through a package of measures. The
designated information officer will develop and implement a detailed plan of suo motto disclosure by the
project. This will include disclosure of all relevant documentation and plans related to the procurement
process with the goal of providing access to information to the wider community beyond interested
bidders and supporting design, management, and construction consultants. Part of this plan will include a

9
    TEC members who are not personnel of BBA shall not be required to submit a statement of financial interests.

                                                          87
website in Bengali and English dedicated to the PMBP prominently identified on the BBA's website with
a dedicated page for summaries of procurement actions, the procurement plan and any updates, and all
documentation related to the procurements themselves (outside of the proposals themselves). These
documents will be placed on the website within one week of their issuance to the public domain
(including after a Bank no objection, in cases where this is required). This documentation will include:

        ·    Pre-qualification documents for ICB contracts more than US$10 million;
        ·    All Invitations to Bid;
        ·    Bidding documents and drawings;
        ·    Clarification of bids;
        ·    Bid opening minutes;
        ·    Information on contract award;
        ·    Information about short-lists including a narrative statement regarding the reasons for
             inclusion or exclusion of the bidders in the shortlist.

293.     The BBA will implement a broader communications strategy that will include information about
procurement. Procurement information will be summarized in a quarterly newsletter in Bengali and
English produced by BBA and distributed widely to civil society organizations in the project region and
in Dhaka, as well as local government officials in the region who will be instructed to make the
newsletters available in their communities. The BBA will promote the availability of all procurement
information except information protected by confidentiality requirements of the procurement process on
its website and in its newsletters as part of a program of periodic updates on the progress of the project via
SMS messaging with major cell phone operators. This information will also note that the BBA will make
available to any member of the public promptly upon request hard copies of such documents related to the
project, subject to payment of a reasonable fee to cover the cost of printing and delivery.

294.    Public scrutiny of procurement will be facilitated. Representatives of civil society and the media
will be invited to attend public bid openings as observers and encouraged to provide feedback on the
openings.

295.     An enhanced complaints receipt and response unit will be established in BBA to operate
throughout the life of the PMBP, including during the procurement stage. The BBA's website and
newsletters will state clearly how to file complaints through the following text to be displayed
prominently. The BBA will maintain a log of complaints which will track the status of response or
follow-up. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the unit will assign the review of complaints to
internal auditors or third party auditors, or may transfer the investigation of complaints to other
appropriate investigative bodies such as the police or the Anti-Corruption Commission. All complaints
received shall be responded to within five days of receipt, with a copy to the PSC and the World Bank.
Recording and appropriate referral of all incoming complaints will be undertaken by the BBA, with each
case generating an automatic, standard format report including the full text of the original complaint to
the Bank. In addition a monthly report tracking the status of complaints and measures taken will be
provided to the Project Steering Committee, the Project Coordination Committee, and the Bank. The
Project Coordination Committee will designate one of its members with specific responsibility to ensure
that the complaints receipt and response unit is functioning properly as well as report to the Committee
on the substance of the complaints which are received. Reports summarizing complaint cases which have
been resolved will be published on the website. At all times and in all documents the anonymity of the
complainant will be maintained.




                                                     88
296.     The Project Integrity Advisor would be provide the log of complaints and his office would review
the follow up by the PMU, BBA and PCC, and investigate as necessary the complaints depending upon
their nature and severity outcome of the follow by BBA and the PCC.

297.    The BBA's website and newsletters will state clearly how to file complaints through the
following text to be displayed prominently:
"The contact point for complaints related to the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is:

298.     Contract execution and project management risks. The transparency and enhanced
complaints mechanisms put in place for procurement will also apply post-procurement during contract
execution. The website would contain monthly updated information about project activities including,
inter alia, the current estimate of the progress of implementation (e.g., gross estimate of completion as a
percentage of works to be carried out, other project related activities such as workshops, and data
concerning complaints and remedial actions. In addition regular accountability meetings organized by the
implementing NGOs in conjunction with BBA will be held quarterly with CSOs in the region and in the
capital will be held to share information. These meetings will be attended by PMU, CSC, and CMC staff
as well as third party entities involved in monitoring execution.

299.     Numerous separate entities will be involved with execution of contracts and therefore will
also provide a check against misrepresentation. In the execution of the civil works contracts, the Project
Director's will serve as the Employer's representative, while the CSCs supervising consultant will serve
as the Engineer for construction supervision. At the site, Resident Engineers, appointed by the CSCs, with
a team of specialists and inspectors will supervise the Contractor. The Management Support Consultants
(MSCs) would provide management support in carrying out the role of the employer. The MSC would
also carry out M&E for the project activities and implementation.



                                                    89
300.    Third-party monitoring of the technical aspects involved with the civil works would be carried
out by the IPOE. Each of these will provide a report to the PCC, the Project Integrity Advisor, and the
Bank on a quarterly basis on its assessment of progress of the project, quality of works and other
construction and design issues. Technical audit can be initiated when found necessary to assess through
appropriate mechanisms.

301.     The contracts would have robust audit clauses that permit access to company documents related
to both the procurement and contract implementation, and to any documents generated by the company
during those processes (not just financial records). The latest Guidelines for audit clause language,
which extend to companies that bid for contracts but did not win them, also apply to procurements under
this project.

302.    Risks in delivery of benefits under the SAP/RAP. The proactive information disclosure
measures involving the website, newsletter, SMS-messaging services and the enhanced complaints
mechanism will be utilized for the implementation of the SAP/RAP as well. In addition, as noted in
Annex 3, implementation will be through external NGOs with experience and skills to carry out the
benefits program. MSC would conduct monitoring to include a survey on the effectiveness of the
SAP/RAP among the population in the targeted areas. MSC will recruit a group of NGOs to conduct its
monitoring efforts. The NGOs responsible for SAP/RAP delivery will hold public hearings at least once
a quarter on the implementation of the plans. Accountability meetings will be held with the public and
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in the region and in the capital (given the national interest in the
project and the presence of strong, interested NGOs and academic institutions in Dhaka) to explain the
SAP/RAP.

303.     Management of payments will be based on written documents and contracts properly agreed and
registered in the presence of resettlement NGOs. Such records would be maintained for audit and post
review by the co-financiers and selected representative of the NGOs. Payments for purchase of properties
and other compensation made by the Deputy Commissioners over US$40,000 equivalent and by BBA
above US$100,000 equivalent for each beneficiary would be subject to prior review by IDA and other
payments would be subject to post review. The prior review threshold level would be reviewed after one
year and adjusted appropriately.

Remedies and Sanctions

304.    The BBA independently, or at the direction of the Bangladeshi oversight entities in the form of
the Project Coordination Committee and the Project Integrity Advisor, will undertake disciplinary action
up to dismissal of staff deemed to have violated financial management or other procedures. Any of the
three entities will, if it is determined that there is credible evidence to launch an inquiry into possible
criminal actions (including for corruption), refer such cases for investigation to the Anti-Corruption
Commission or police.

305.     The Bank will apply sanctions as per its guidelines if it determines incidences of fraud,
corruption, collusion, coercive, and obstructive practices. Information on the Bank's sanction process can
be found at the website www.worldbank.org/sanctions. In addition, the Bank will coordinate with its
project co-financiers in the event of misconduct issues.

306.    The Bank will apply sanctions as per its guidelines if it determines incidences of fraud,
corruption, collusion and coercive practices. These sanctions may include fines, blacklisting, suspension
of disbursements, or ultimately cancellation with respect to that contract. The Bank will seek first to
remedy cases of corruption through cooperation with the implementing agency and its oversight entities.


                                                    90
Any entity that is found to have misused funds may be excluded from subsequent funding. Information
regarding such cases, where lessons are learned and funds are retrieved, will be widely disseminated.

GAAP Monitoring Arrangements

307.    The PMU with support from MSC will be responsible for monitoring and reporting on this GAAP
on a quarterly basis. Monitoring shall include both quantitative measures of implementation of actions
(e.g. numbers of complaints received, followed up and resolved, numbers of persons at accountability
meetings), recording of benchmarks (e.g. training of designated Information Officer, establishment of
third party monitoring), as well as qualitative reporting on the efficacy of measures and instances where
problems were corrected through these mechanisms. Its reports shall be submitted to the Project
Coordination Committee, the Project Steering Committee, and the World Bank simultaneously. Upon
clearance by the Project Steering Committee, summaries of the reports indicating complaints,
investigations, and their outcome, without specific personalized information regarding shortcomings
resolved internally, will also be disclosed to Development Partners and the public through placement on
the project website. The Project Integrity Advisor will issue special reports on concerning his/her
independent reviews of significant cases and their outcomes as is necessary.

Bank Supervision and Surveillance

308.     Supervision arrangements for this project, particularly for procurement and financial
management, are extensive. Prior review thresholds would apply to almost all contracts in this case as the
contacts are large. The first contract in all categories (goods, consultancy, works, etc.) will be subject to
prior review regardless of its value in order to start good-practice procurement and contract management.
Post procurement reviews will be carried out by qualified Bank staff in procurement and contract
management, and will be done quarterly for the first 18 months. Bank supervision missions will be more
frequent at the start of the project and would involve qualified staff in all disciplines, including
procurement, contract management, and financial management. The Bank will also conduct regular
monitoring between supervision missions, including an in-country consultant who would visit the project
site on a regular basis in the first two years of the project, when construction will be taking place, to keep
the Bank and the Project Coordination Committee informed of issues arising in project implementation.
The Bank will conduct a mid-term review of the project after two years. Detailed plans for supervision
by the Bank are given in Annex 5.

309.    In addition, the Project Management Unit, the Construction Supervisory Consultants, and the
Management Support Consultants would carry out extensive oversight of the implementation of contracts.
An independent team of M&E consultants would review overall progress in implementation and report on
contract implementation issues to the Project Coordination Committee, the Project Steering Committee,

310.     In terms of monitoring progress on the GAAP, the Bank will conduct six-month reviews for the
first 18 months and then successive annual reviews of GAAP implementation. The review will assess
progress, gauge the efficacy of measures, agree among all parties on areas for improvement, and make
adjustments as appropriate. The Bank will update its assessment of GAC risks on an ongoing basis, and
anticipates that adjustments to the GAAP will be likely to reflect what will be most effective in the
context of the project.

                 BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

Background

311.     Preparation of Padma Bridge Project has been going on for the past decade. A pre-feasibility
study 10 was carried out in 1999, followed by a feasibility study (FS) 11 in 2005. The FS recommended
construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (the Project) at Mawa point (on the north bank),
about 35km southwest of Dhaka, to Janjira (on the South bank). In 2006, based on the FS, the
Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) ­ the executing agency (EA) of the Project ­ prepared a Land
Acquisition Plan (LAP) 12 and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) 13. The RAP was later updated into a
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP) 14 under ADB Project Preparation Technical Assistance.
In 2009, ADB provided the GoB with a TA Loan to carry out the detailed design. During 2009-2010, on
the advice from the development partners (DPs), the Detailed Design Consultants (Consultants) updated
early surveys and undertook further field surveys on impact inventory, gender and public health as well as
broad local consultations to prepare the project for DPs' financing.. A project Social Action Plan was
developed to include the updated LARP and additional action plans.
Project Area

312.     The project area is located 35 km southwest of Dhaka. The bridge will be constructed between a
site near Mawa ferry ghat, lying north of the Padma River and Janjira on the south side. Components of
the project such as approach roads and bridge end facilities will affect an area of 6 km inland on the
Mawa side and 4 km inland on the Janjira side; bridge and river training works may even affect a corridor
15 km upstream and 7 km downstream in the river. The 250 km2 project area comprises areas located in 3
separate administrative districts: Munshiganj district on the Mawa side (north bank) and Shariatpur and
Madaripur districts on the south side. Louhajang and Srinagar upazila (sub-district) lie on the north bank
and Janjira and Shibchar upazila lie along the south bank.

313.    The project districts are predominantly rural. Its urban population was about 11% according to
the last census in 2001, with sharp increases in the past few years. Project socioeconomic survey
indicates that about 30% of the households in the project areas are below the poverty line, with a higher
poverty ratio on the Janjira side. The Janjira side to the south of the river has a strong agricultural
character and most people earn their living by farming and horticultural. Farms are generally small and
cropping intensity is high. Mawa area to the north of the river has a high percentage of retail trade,
services and transportation. Both sides are subject to severe annual flooding and erosion.
Project Impact Identification

314.     The Project covers three administrative districts ­ Munshiganj (Mawa/North bank) and Shariatpur
and Madaripur (Janjira/South bank). It will have significant social impacts in the project areas, the
immediate neighbouring areas and the entire Southwest region of Bangladesh. For the project areas, the
local communities will benefit greatly from the improved transport conditions that will provide them with
faster and more efficient access to employment opportunities in Dhaka, as well as the embankment works

that will control erosion that has been devouring their land and houses along the river. The resettlement
and rehabilitation program itself is designed not only to restore, but also improve livelihoods for those
affected. It is worth noting that about one third of the displaced households are actually erosion-displaced
households who are renting or "squatting" on private and public lands along the river. Most of them are
moving to the resettlement sites where living conditions will be much better.

315.     The project will also incur significant adverse social impacts. They are expected to occur in
several zones, including the bridge construction area, embankment areas for river training works, the
access road area, areas for construction operations, the charland areas, four resettlement sites and river
activities. The following categories of impacts have been identified:
      (i)       Land and structure acquisition and household relocation
      (ii)      Business and job losses
      (iii)     Possible charland impacts
      (iv)      Impacts on physical cultural resources, such as mosques
      (v)       Public health impacts
     (vi)       Possible impact on fishery
     (vii)      Gender impacts

316.     Major impact under the project is land acquisition and household relocation. The total area of
land to be acquired is expected to be 1039 ha of largely agricultural areas. The project will affect a total
of 76,211 people in about 13,578 households. The population affected through agricultural land
acquisition is 46,637 in 8,526 households. The project would also require relocation of 20,972 people in
3,886 households, including 60 households who will lose their family business along with their
residences. There are about 960 households of 5,179 people whose business will be affected, and about
2,882 whose jobs as wage earners are likely to be affected due to the construction of the project. It should
be noted that, among the affected population, the landless and squatting population (including affected
households displaced by river erosion in past years), is over 30% of the total affected households.
Detailed breakdown of land acquisition by project components and impacts of land acquisition are
presented in Tables 1 & 2.

317.    The project is expected to have other impacts as well. The project is expecting an influx of
construction workers over the project implementation period by about 5,000 during the peak period. It is
expected that large numbers of service providers will be attracted to the project areas as well. The influx
of population will increase public health risks, HIV and STD diseases in particular, to both the

health impacts during the relocation process.

318.     Based on the Jamuna Project experience, much consideration and analysis was given in the
project design over possible impacts over charlands near the bridge. The initial assessment indicates that
the current project design is not expected to induce impacts on the charlands. This assessment indicates
that there would be no fishery impacts under the project, except some disturbances to migrating fishes
during the construction period. Construction activities could interfere in fishing activities for local
communities. There is a gender dimension in all the impacts identified. Women, particularly poor and
female-headed households, would be more vulnerable under these project impacts. These have been
identified and assessed through the consultative planning process.
Project Safeguard Policies

319.    The project has conducted an analysis of the policy gaps between GoB legal framework and the
DPs' policies on involuntary resettlement. On the basis of this analysis, BBA has tried to introduce
provisions to bridge the policy gaps and develop a project-specific resettlement policy to address the
project safeguard impacts in compliance with both GoB and DPs' resettlement policies. The basic
principles adopted are as follows,
        (i)      Avoid or minimize impact as much as possible through alternative design options;
        (ii)     Consult affected people and communities adequately;
        (iii)    Make resettlement plans and other related documents available at the project sites; full
                 disclosure will be ensured through distribution of a summary RP in Bangladesh to the
                 affected households and other stakeholders;
        (iv)     Determine replacement cost of assets acquired and compensate at full replacement costs
                 determined by property valuation committee;
        (v)      Resettlement assistance will be provided to all APs irrespective of titles to land;


                                                   99
        (vi)       Establish grievances redress committees at the local level for speedy resolutions of
                   disputes;
        (vii)      Provide additional assistance to poor women and vulnerable groups
        (viii)     Provide income restoration assistance through alternative income sources and restoration
                   of livelihoods for assisting affected people to restore and/or improve upon their pre-
                   project levels or standards; and
        (ix)       Carryout internal monitoring by EA and third party monitoring independent external
                   experts/agency to assess resettlement operations and evaluate outcomes.

320.     All affected households and persons, as per the project policy, are eligible for compensation and
assistance to be provided by the Project. The Project Entitlement Matrix covers all types of direct,
indirect, customary rights of occupancy and titles, based on inventory of losses established during the
inventory survey as part of project preparation, with the exception of RAP III whose inventory of impacts
will be updated during implementation when the section of engineering designs finalizes the section of
alignment for embankment works. The full details of the entitlement matrix are available in the
Resettlement Policy Framework.
Project Social Action Plan

321.     The project preparation has witnessed a continuous process of planning as part of the project
design to address social impacts under the project. Planning activities include socioeconomic surveys,
impact census and inventory surveys, poverty and gender assessment, assessment of local public health
institutions and service delivery, etc. They were carried out at different times of the project preparation
and updated along the engineering design progress. The planning followed a participatory process
through information sharing and continuous consultation with local communities over impact
identification, compensation and resettlement policies, options for relocation and resettlement, approach
for livelihood development as well as their views and recommendations for the project. This program is
broadly endorsed and supported by local communities.

322.     The planning efforts have delivered the following action plans and frameworks that are packaged
into the Padma Project Social Action Plan (SAP). The SAP includes the following,

Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)

323.    Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement is the major impact under the Project. Three RAPs
have been prepared for three different packages of civil works following different arrangement for
engineering designs. The RAPs detail the socioeconomics in the Project areas, resettlement planning



                                                    100
activities, Project impacts, entitlement policies and packages, resettlement and rehabilitation approaches
and action plans, implementation arrangements, institutional, monitoring and grievance redress
mechanisms, cost and financing arrangements. Key elements and features are summarized below.
    ·   Policy framework. All three RAPs follow the same set of objectives and principles established
        under the Project Resettlement Policy Framework. This framework is developed in compliance
        with relevant GoB and DPs' safeguard policies. A detailed entitlement policy is contained in the
        framework, outlining entitlements for different impacts on different groups of affected
        population, including people whose properties, business and employment are affected under the
        project.
    ·   Resettlement approach and arrangements. The approach adopted combines group resettlement
        with self-resettlement options. This arrangement was tested as successful in the Jamuna Bridge
        Project and is endorsed broadly by the relocating households, following intense consultations and
        visits to the Jamuna Project resettlement sites. Both options would be open to any relocating
        households. The final decisions of the households are expected through consultations in the
        detailed planning during implementation. Four resettlement sites have been selected along the
        river. These sites are identified and confirmed through participation of the affected population
        and technical assessment. The sites will be fully developed with infrastructure services. The site
        development plan, household plot allocation and relocation arrangements are described in the
        three RAPs. For households who prefer to relocate to places of their own choice, either as
        individual households or smaller groups, the project office would assist in identifying, securing
        and preparing their identified sites.
    ·   Livelihood restoration approach and arrangements. A package of assistance has been
        developed to assist the affected households in their livelihood restoration and improvement. The
        packages consist of cash compensation upfront and long-term livelihood assistance planned to
        last for a period of 10 years. The cash compensation package has two parts. The first part is
        Cash Compensation under the Law (CCL), which will be determined and delivered through the
        government revenue system. The second part will be the bridging amount between CCL package
        and replacement cost as determined through the Property Evaluation Committee already
        established under the Project. The committee composition, responsibilities and working
        methodology are detailed in the RAPs. This part of the compensation payment will be delivered
        to the affected households by BBA. The livelihood assistance program will focus on household
        income-generation. The SAP provides a general outline of the program based on expert
        experiences and consultations held so far with the communities. The livelihood program will be
        developed at the household level, together with the individual households, on the basis of their
        needs, capabilities, preferences as well as opportunities to be created under the project and
        available in local areas. This will be carried out during project implementation in a highly
        participatory approach. An experienced implementing NGO is being recruited to facilitate this
        participatory planning and implementation process. The livelihood program will aim to assist the
        affected households in using their land compensation money more productively. At the same
        time, a Social Development Fund has been established and included in the SAP budget to
        facilitate and contribute to the livelihood planning and restoration process.
    ·   Institutional and monitoring arrangements. BBA will be responsible for the implementation
        of the SAP and it has established an institutional setup for the implementation of the SAP. It
        consists of a Social Environment Unit within BBA at both headquarter and in the field, an
        implementation advisory TA team, a national gender advisor, district administrations and five
        implementing NGOs for different component activities under the SAP. BBA has already
        recruited five consultant environmental and social experts for its Social Environment Unit. Two
        BBA field offices have also been established with staff assignment. The district administrations
        will play a major role in the SAP implementation process. They have established a team of
        district officers from different departments to work along BBA field offices. The project will


                                                  101
        continue the traditional practice in Bangladesh engaging NGOs for rural development operations.
        They will play a major role in community mobilization, detailed programming and actual
        implementation. One NGO has already been engaged to facilitate RAP 1 implementation. It has
        established three field offices with over 60 staff members recruited and working at community
        level. The recruitment process has started for the other five NGOs. A separate health team will
        be mobilized from a reputed NGO to implement the Public Health Program. An independent
        monitor will be recruited for the implementation of the SAP. (Please see below for details).
    ·   Implementation approach. The DPs have reviewed and cleared the SAP for compliance with
        their safeguard policies. The three RAPs are following different schedules. Considering that
        development of the resettlement sites is in the "critical path" of the project, RAP I
        implementation has started. . Payments of compensation funds to the affected households have
        been completed and site development is in progress, construction of public infrastructure, and
        civic facilities. RAP II has also completed the detailed planning and is ready for implementation.
        Compensation fund payment has started.. Given the continuous flood erosion and timeframe for
        implementation, the detailed design for RTW will be carried out on a section-by-section basis
        during implementation. Consequently, the alignment for the entire embankment can only be
        determined when all section designs are all completed. The engineering design is in progress and
        the impact inventory is being updated with the latest section designs. RAP III will be updated
        with the latest impact data and costing for implementation. .

Gender Action Plan (GAP)

324.    The GAP is developed on the basis of a gender analysis. It aims to translate the gender concerns
and social vulnerabilities identified into actions, with the following focus and key interventions.

     · Increasing participation of women. The project will encourage women participation in all
       community meetings and continue to consult them in separate focus group discussions over their
       preferences, experiences and needs. Women will be fully informed about entitlements, timetable
       of compensation delivery and relocation activities. The monitoring NGO will engage local
       women members to engage in community-led monitoring. Focus group discussions will be held
       with women each quarter in each resettlement area, including female construction workers and
       women living on the char.
     · Maximizing women's access to project benefits. Local women will be encouraged to take up
       construction employment. This will be done through raising awareness about the types of jobs
       available, timeframes and pay rates, how to apply for work, and issue of ID cards to give them
       preference for project work. BBA and NGOs will assist contractors to form female work groups
       to take on discrete construction tasks. Occupation training will be tailored for local women in
       construction jobs and R&R programs. NGOs providing livelihood development services will
       target women for skills training for employment opportunities under the Project.
     · Increase women's skills, incomes and participation in decision-making. Women's corners
       will be constructed in each resettlement site. They will serve as physical spaces where women can
       network, learn, support each other, and undertake group and individual income earning activities.
       Implementation NGOs will assist in the training and support for small income earning activities.
       Exposure trips to successful women's businesses will be facilitated. Linkages with micro-credit
       providers and more empowering finance modalities should also be explored. Under RAP I,
       Female Local Contractor Societies have been established already to facilitate employment of
       women in the resettlement site development activities.
     · Reducing women's social vulnerability. Social vulnerabilities in the context of this project may
       include domestic violence against women, public sexual harassment, vulnerability to sexually
       transmitted infections (STI) including HIV/AIDS, human trafficking. Information campaign will


                                                  102
        be conducted to disseminate materials on STI and HIV/AIDS, raising awareness about public
        health services in the area and against human trafficking. Women's corner operators will receive
        training from NGOs in gender issues and women's protection. Contractors will be asked to
        implement a zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment.

325.    The GAP will be implemented by the project implementing NGOs. A national gender adviser
will be engaged to guide and supervise its implementation. The GAP measures and budget are
mainstreamed into each action plan for implementation. The GAP contains monitoring indicators and
monitoring protocol.
Public Heath Action Plans (PHAP)

326.    The PHAP is prepared on the basis of an evaluation of project public health impacts and current
services in the project area as well as the additional requirements of health services during the project
construction. The overall objective of the plan is to minimize and mitigate the risks on public health due
to the construction activities and contribute to public health services in the Project areas. The plan is
scheduled for a period of five years, with a total budget of 8.67 million USD. The main target groups
include: (i) the relocating households; (ii) the general public in the project areas; and (iii) the construction
workforce estimated at around 5000 people at peak time.
       · Activities for safeguarding health of PAPs and host communities. During the pre-
         construction phase public health activities will mainly focus on safeguarding the health
         conditions of the relocating families. Health facilities and services will be set up at the sites,
         focusing on information, education and communication over household and personal hygiene,
         vaccinations and detection of childhood illnesses and prevention of malaria and
         STI/HIV/AIDS.
       · Activities to safeguard general public health in the area. During the pre-construction phase
         a baseline study will be carried out to determine key criteria and characteristics of the target
         group. The findings will help with the design of an information, education and communication
         program for those who will interact with the influx of workers during construction. During the
         construction phase activities will be expanded to minimize adverse effects on the health of
         people migrating to or resident in the project surroundings. Activities will focus on
         reproductive health and prevention of STI and HIV/AIDS.
       · Activities to safeguard the health of the construction workforce. The activities in the plan
         will be focused on keeping the construction workforce safe from occupational hazards and
         health risks from living together in compounds. Health facilities will be established in the
         service areas. Other measures include introduction and implementation of occupational health
         safety measures, education campaigns on HIV/AIDS and STI and regular check-ups.

327.    A BBA health team staffed with qualified medical professionals will be responsible, in
consultation with the Ministry of Public Health And Family Welfare, for the implementation of the
PHAP. This team will be strengthened with a program implementation NGO. The total cost of PHAP is
estimated around US$8.67 million.
Charland Monitoring and Management Framework (CMMF)

328.     In view of experiences in the Jamuna Project, the BBA has given extra attention to possible
erosion or flooding impacts on the charlands due to the construction of the project. A hydrological
assessment framework indicates that, with the current design, the project would not have erosion impacts
on the charlands. However, given the apprehension from the charland people, BBA has planned to
establish a monitoring system over possible impacts on the charlands during the project construction, as
well as an approach to address any such impacts once they are identified.



                                                     103
329.     This framework (CMMF) has been prepared to guide the impact monitoring and any required
mitigation efforts. A multidisciplinary team will be formed including representatives of the social
safeguard team, the district administration, the land survey and technical specialists from the Ministry of
Water Resources and the Bureau of Disaster Management. The project will monitor the river behaviour to
assess the impacts on the charlands situated within the defined project boundary (15-km upstream and 7-
km downstream from the bridge). In case of any impacts such as induced floods or bank erosion due to
the construction of the bridge, the impacts will be assessed and mitigation measures will be undertaken to
address the losses. The team will develop a guideline for detailed assessment, screening and eligibility
for assistance in the case of induced impact.
Institutional Setup and Implementation Arrangements

330.    BBA under the Bridge Division of the Ministry of Communications (MOC) as the Executing
Agency for the SAP implementation. BBA has established a Project Management Unit (PMU) for
execution of the PMBP. A Resettlement Unit has been established to implement the SAP. The roles and
responsibilities of various institutions involved are elaborated in RAPs (I, II, & III). BBA is in the
process of staff recruitment. It has already opened field offices in the Project areas.

331.    The PMU will be assisted by the following agencies in the implementation of various programs
under the SAP.
    ·   District administrations will assign dedicated staff members to collaborate with the PMO over the
        SAP implementation. Local government institutions, such as Upazila Parishad and Union
        Parishad, will work with PMU;
    ·   Five specialized NGOs will be employed for implementation of different programs under the
        SAP, such as health program, gender strategy, and livelihood program. One NGO-Christian
        Commission Development Bangladesh has already been engaged for a five-year period for
        implementation of RAPs in the project.
    ·   The Ministry of Health And Family Welfare and its local agencies will advise and support the
        implementation of the Public Health Program;
    ·   The Detail Design Consultant (DDC) and Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC) Team will
        hire resettlement specialists to assist and advise the PMU in the SAP implementation.
    ·   Independent monitoring agency/consultants will be recruited to monitor and evaluate the SAP
        implementation.
    ·   A communication team to be recruited will manage public communications for the Project.

332.     BBA recognizes the need for capacity building within the institutional setup for SAP
implementation. It plans to recruit a specialist to undertake the training needs assessment of the various
offices and institutions involved in the SAP implementation. An annual training plan will be developed
and implemented to improve its capacity for SAP implementation.
Information, Consultation, Participation and Communication

333.     The project preparation process has followed a vigorous consultation process. Project design
information has been shared with local communities at different stage of the project preparation. This
was done mainly through community meetings and workshops. The development of the resettlement
entitlement policy, finalization of the resettlement sites and formulation of the livelihood restoration
approach has all been achieved through consultations with local communities. The SAP details, including
final inventory data, the survey approach for RAP III, entitlement policies, information and planning of
the resettlement sites, have all been shared with the local population. This consultation process will
continue through detailed planning and implementation of the SAP.




                                                   104
334.     BBA will establish three Public Information Centres (PICs) in the project area. The centres will
be managed by an NGO whose staff will interact with local communities. A summary of these
documents has already been translated into Bangla and distributed in the project areas. An information
booklet has been designed for distribution among the affected persons as the primary tool for disclosure.
For illiterate people, other suitable communication methods will be used. These materials will also be
available in the union parishad, upazilas and district offices in the project area. Additionally, project
information disclosure will be continued through newspapers, radio, television, posters, community
workshops, information brochures and village level meetings. The affected persons will be represented in
the Grievances Redress Committees to review and resolve disputes or claims over resettlement
entitlements and benefits. An identification card will be issued to every affected household. A household
entitlement summary, covering impacts, compensation payments and various allowances will be
distributed to every affected household.

335.    BBA has engaged a professional team to develop a communication strategy for the project. The
strategy will be completed end 2010, along with recommendations to organize and carry out
communication work for BBA. It aims to systematically and regularly disseminate project progress
information to the public and seek timely public feedback to improve project implementation. A
communication expert team will be recruited to implement the communication strategy.
Grievance Redress Mechanism

336.     A two-tier grievance redress mechanism has been designed for Padma Bridge Project. A
Grievances Redress Committee (GRC) is established at local community level, with representations from
BBA, implementation NGOs, local elected officials, representatives of affected people and women in the
project area to allow voices of the affected communities to be heard and ensure a participatory decision-
making process. GRC decisions will be on a majority basis and will be publicized among the local
communities. The second-tier is an independent body consisting of a local retired judge, a representative
from civil society and a member from the BBA. The SAP describes in detail the GRC composition,
complaint filing procedures, GRC operation principles and procedures, and timetable for grievance
redress. Where the complaining parties are not satisfied with the GRC decisions, they can always file
their cases in court.

337.    The project implementing NGOs operating at the community level will assist any members of
local communities who have grievances to document, submit and follow up on the grievances. A register
will be maintained at each of the PICs to register queries, suggestions and grievances of the project
communities and PAPs. All queries, suggestions and grievances recorded at the PICs will be forwarded
by the INGO to the Resettlement Unit (RU).
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

338.     BBA has designed an M&E system for SAP implementation. The M&E system consists of
internal and external monitoring. The internal M&E system is part of BBA management setup, consisting
of regular progress reporting and monitoring. BBA has started to develop a Management Information
System, covering all components of the SAP. A master MIS data system will be maintained at BBA in
Dhaka with access to field offices. A GIS-based system has been developed to record and maintain all
plot-wise and household-wise information on land and structure impacts as well as compensation
payments. The implementing NGO already engaged and in operation, Christian Commission for
Development in Bangladesh, has developed a compensation payment information system. This system
records all impacts, entitlements and compensation payments at household level. This enables a
transparent and updated record of all entitlements and compensation payments for every affected
household. This system is already in operation for RAP I. These systems will be merged into a project



                                                  105
MIS system. These will help monitor and control fraudulent claims and prevent possible corrupt practices
in the compensation payment process.

339.    The external M&E will be conducted by an independent monitoring team/agency (EMA) to be
recruited through a competitive process. The EMA will carry out quarterly, annual, mid-term and final
evaluation of SAP implementation. The M&E will cover all aspects of SAP implementation, including
detailed planning, physical progress, public consultation and participation, grievance mechanism and
assessment of SAP performance. Its scope of work, methodology and M&E arrangements are detailed in
the SAP and also in the terms of reference of the MSC. The EMA recruitment is ongoing and the EMA is
expected to mobilize early 2011.
Cost and Financing

340.    The total cost of the SAP is estimated at BDT 19,133.53 million, equivalent to US$273.2 million
USD. The key cost categories include compensation for lost household properties, various household
allowances, resettlement site development, livelihood restoration support, common resources lost, public
health interventions and NGO engagements for SAP implementation, monitoring and management cost.
The household compensation rates to be adopted will be replacement costs recommended by the property
valuation committee (PVAC). The resettlement site development cost is estimated on the basis of the
engineering feasibility study. Various allowances are per the project resettlement policy and are also
included in the SAP cost estimates. Given the dynamic nature of resettlement planning, particularly the
inventory and cost to be updated for RAP III, the SAP cost is expected to increase. The total cost
includes a contingency of 10%. Financing of the SAP/RAP costs would be according to the project
financing plan given in Section III B2.

       Annex 8: Summary of Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan
                 BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

Introduction

341.     The project is classified as an Environmental Category `A' project, due to the extent of the
project and complexity of environmental issues associated with construction of the main bridge, river
training works and resettlement sites development. Four Bank safeguard policies are triggered: (a) OP/BP
4.01 Environmental Assessment; (b) OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats; (c) OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural
Resources; and (d) OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement.

342.    A pre-feasibility study for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project was carried out in 2000. It
investigated a number of potential alignments for the proposed bridge. On the basis of the outcome of that
study, a feasibility study (FS) carried out in 2002-2004 by Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) concluded that the most feasible bridge site is at Mawa-Janjira point. The selection of this site was
subsequently approved by GoB. The FS included, among others, a preliminary technical design,
economic and financial evaluation, Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), and an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA). The Government carried out another study to update the previous EIA and to
prepare an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and a Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) in 2006. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also conducted a FS including an EIA
in 2007. These studies formed the basis for the decision of GoB to proceed with the current effort, which
includes the detailed engineering design and implementation of the Project. The Project will have
considerable environmental impacts, which are summarized in this annex.

Project Area

343.     The bridge site is located 35 km southwest of Dhaka, near the village of Mawa, lying north of the
Padma River and Janjira on the south side. Components of the Project such as approach roads and bridge
end facilities will affect an area of 6 km inland on the Mawa side and 4 km inland on the Janjira side;
bridge and river training works may even affect a corridor 15 km upstream and 7 km downstream in the
river. The 250 km2 project area comprises areas located in 3 separate administrative districts:
Munshigansj district on the Mawa side (north bank) and Shariatpur and Madaripur districts on the south
side. Lauhaujong and Sreenagar upazilla (sub-district) lie on the north bank and Janjira and Shibchar
upazilla lie along the south bank.

Project Components

344.    Detailed description of the project components is given in Annex 2.

Environmental Policies/Rules

Government of Bangladesh

345.    The Environmental Conservation Rules (1997) of the Government stipulate that the construction
of a bridge of over 100 m length falls under the Red Category of projects requiring the implementation
and approval of a full-scale EIA in order to obtain environmental clearance from Department of
Environment (DOE), the technical arm of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) and the
regulatory body and enforcement agency of all environmental related activities. DOE has approved the
TOR of this study and provided a number of additional conditions and suggestions to be incorporated in
it.



                                                   107
World Bank Safeguard policies

346.    OP 4.01 ­ Environmental Assessment: The World Bank requires an Environmental Assessment
(EA) for all projects proposed for Bank financing to ensure that these projects are environmentally sound
and sustainable. The PMBP was classified Category A, because of the scope of the expected impacts from
construction and operation, the impacts of land acquisition, the resettlement, and the expected impacts on
the natural environment.

347.    OP 4.04 ­ Natural Habitats: There are no designated conservation areas or nature reserves in the
project area. However OP 4.04 does apply since part of the area consists of semi-natural charlands in the
active Ganges/Brahmaputra floodplain, with typical floodplain habitats and breeding grounds that might
be affected by the project.

348.   OP 4.11 ­ Physical and Cultural Resources: This policy is triggered for any project that requires
an EA. The project involves large-scale earth moving along both embankments and dredging activities in
the Padma River. The policy requires a proper management plan for unexpected chance finds during
implementation of the project.

349.     OP/BP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement: Some 26,000 people will have to be resettled. Separate
social studies have been carried out and resettlement action plans (RAP) prepared. These aim to minimize
resettlement while offering adequate compensation or settlement alternatives in conformity with World
Bank policies and Bangladesh law.

350.    Project Safeguard Policies: In view of the different requirements of GoB and the potential co-
financiers of the PMBP, a harmonized environmental safeguard framework was developed to conduct the
EIA. This framework was used to prepare the TOR for the EIA, which has been reviewed and approved
by the BBA, DOE and the potential co-financiers of the project.

Analysis of Alternatives

351.     Without project scenario: The without project scenario is not acceptable since this will continue
to limit the potential for socio-economic development in the entire Southwest region, where about one
quarter of the Bangladesh population lives. Current risky and unreliable ferry services will remain in
service, often resulting in long waiting times for trucks (10 hours and more) and cars (2 hours). Noise, oil
pollution and hindrance of commercial navigation caused by the fleet of ferries, launches and speedboats
crossing the river on daily basis will continue.

352.    Bridge location: The 2005 feasibility study reviewed and compared four different locations for
the bridge. Out of two preferred options the Mawa-Janjira site was finally selected as the best option,
mainly on the basis of factors such as travel time/distance to Mongla seaport and the cost of associated
works. The evaluation also considered environmental and social impacts (more or less comparable in the
two options) into account.

353.     Alternative bridge designs: In the detailed design phase four possible bridge design options were
studied, including three options with a bridge superstructure consisting of two levels (road on upper deck
and railway below), including a two-level steel truss bridge. After comparison with the proposed option
the one-level concrete bridge from the feasibility study it was concluded that concrete bridges are
generally more expensive as compared to a steel truss bridge. Another major advantage of the last is that
the construction of a steel truss is relatively easy and does not need a long time to construct. Thus, finally
a detailed evaluation was made between the single level concrete extra-dosed bridge and the double level
steel truss bridge on basis of the following factors: technical robustness, constructability, maintenance,


                                                    108
cost, social aspects, environmental impacts and proven previous use. In October 2009 a decision was
taken to go ahead with the design of the steel truss bridge, mainly on the basis of the factor of
construction time, which is only three years, while the concrete bridge would take double this time.
Environmental impacts on river hydrology and aquatic life in the selected option are also lower in view of
the restricted construction time and lower number of piers required. The present bridge design is based on
a bridge length of 6.15 km, since considerable bank erosion has recently taken place on the unprotected
original landing site on the Southern side, near Janjira. Various options for the electricity line with the
Bridge structure were also explored. It was concluded that the costs of the solid insulated cable supported
within the bridge structure would be excessively more than 3 times the suspension tower cost. The option
of constructing the 6 platforms 1-2 km downstream has been chosen.

354.    Alternative transition structures: To minimize the length of the viaduct structures two options
were studied to separate road and rail alignments at the end of the approach road. In the first option the
four-lane road from the bridge is divided into two carriage ways of which one passes under the railway
viaduct. In the second option the whole road passes over the railway viaduct. The first option has been
selected in view of lower cost, better aesthetics and technical advantages. The preferred option requires
about 7 ha more land.

355.     Alternative river training works designs: Since the feasibility study an area of 500 m land
inwards has been eroded on the Janjira side; this process can be seen on satellite observations. The
optimal type of river training works has been the subject of detailed hydrological and model studies, and
consultations between experts. Also physical and numerical hydraulic model studies were applied to
determine the effect of various options of bank protection. Two major alternative designs for river
training works (RTW) were identified:

356.     Alternative 1 consisted of a 12 km continuous revetment bund along the south bank and the bank
of the channel to protect all project components on this side of the river. A 6 km section of this revetment
bund near the bridge will be raised above flood level to prevent overtopping or outflanking from
floodplain flows; the remainder will be constructed slightly above bank level. Alternative 1 will both
adequately protect major project components from erosion and have fewer environmental impacts on
river ecology and charlands. It involves less dredging but it needs 190 ha of land on the floodplain. The
south channel will remain open (requested by the char people) and the charlands will not be affected.
Alternative 2 consisted of a guide bund to protect the landing site of the bridge and two hard points on the
bank of the south side channel to protect the approach road, which is only situated a few kilometres inland
and runs parallel to the bank of the south channel. This alternative was later modified by shifting the two
hard points across the channel on the charland. This Alternative 2-modified was believed to give better
hydraulic performance and would not require the purchase of too much land on the populated channel
bank, where there are also two ferry ghats. A detailed comparison of both alternatives revealed that
Alternative 2-modified requires less agricultural and residential area but a considerable charland area
(200 ha) will disappear. Moreover, the south channel will be closed in this alternative. A detailed
comparison of the two alternatives concluded that Alternative 1 is preferred.

Description of Environment

Physical environment

357.   Climate: The climate in the project area is a typical monsoon climate with three main seasons:
summer (March to May), monsoon (June to October) and winter (November to February). The summer is
warm and humid with average monthly temperature of 28 0C with occasional moderate to heavy rainfall.
The monsoon period is generally humid with 80 % of total annual rainfall. Total annual rainfall varies
between 1750 and 2500 mm, with most rain from May to October with a usual peak in July (300- 700


                                                   109
mm). The winters are dry and relatively cool with few rains and an average monthly temperature of 180C.
Wind mainly comes from two directions: a northerly light wind mainly blows in the winter season, while
winds from the south and south-east dominate in summer and monsoon seasons.

358.     Geomorphology and landscape: The north bank is part of the Lower Ganges/Brahmaputra River
floodplain, which is characterized by a relatively stable and elevated river levee (elevation +7.5 to 8m)
with medium textured soils, which have been silted up to a level that is slightly above annual flood level.
The area is densely populated; most occupation and trees are on the high river levee while rice cultivation
is in the lower lying areas.

359.    The south bank near Janjira is located on a north-south oriented meander belt complex, consisting
of parallel sandy ridges and lower lying medium textured depressions often with some form of natural
drainage towards the main channel. Homestead development and trees are found on the higher ridges and
on the embankment of the channel a wide variety of crops is grown in winter and in summer, including
rice. There is also livestock holding and a few fishponds in the area.

360.     The third unit consists of Char Janajat, which is a complex of aggregated chars. Char Janajat was
formed in the last 20 years by the braiding and meandering Padma River. The area consists mainly of
vegetated and often cultivated charlands, which are slightly raised above the average river level
(elevation + 2.5 to 4m).

361.     Soils: Soils in the area are of alluvial origin. Soils usually have good physical and chemical
properties and have a pH of 7.5 ­ 8.0. They are moderately fertile and suitable for a broad range of crops.
At some distance from the river finer textured grey colored clayey material has been deposited in the
lower basins and depressions. These soils can be characterized as gley soils. These soils are very suitable
for rice cultivation. The soils of the charlands consist mainly of very fine sand or silt loam.

362.    Land use: Both banks of the Padma River can be characterized as rural areas with agriculture
being the predominant land use. However, there is more urban and commercial influence on the northern
Mawa side. The presence of the capital is reflected in the lower share of agricultural land as compared to
the other side of the river. On the northern side of the river only 65 % of the land is occupied by farms,
whereas 86 % of the land is farmland on the south side. Residential development on the north bank is
considerably higher (31 %) than on the south bank (12 %). Land use on the chars is completely different.
Most people are fishermen and about 34 % of the charlands is used for agriculture. A considerable area
(43 %) is classified as fallow land (bare, semi-natural grassland, or wetlands covered with sedges and
reeds) and partly used for grazing cattle. Only 3 % of charland is occupied by housing and settlement.

363.     Padma River: The width of the Padma at the project site has varied from 2 to 6 km in the period
1976 to present. The behavior of the river at Mawa is fairly unpredictable and varies between braiding,
straight and meandering in cycles of about 20 years. Historically the main channel can be located
anywhere. At present it runs near the north bank, but it is expected to move towards the south channel.
Maximum discharge of the Padma River at Mawa measured during the 1998 flood was 115,000 m3/sec.
The average water level slope of the Padma is about 5 cm/km.

364.     Other surface water bodies: The Arial Khan is a distributary from the Padma River that takes off
about 15 km upstream from Janjira. The South channel is another relatively short river channel near
Janjira, separating the southern bank of Padma River and Char Janajat. Other surface waters in the area
include khals (natural drainage canals), beels (natural depressions), baors (oxbow lakes) and a number of
fishponds.




                                                   110
365.     Bank erosion: The embankment near Janjira is rather low and has been subject to heavy erosion
during the past few years. This is also why the bridge will be longer (6.15 km) than anticipated in the
2005 feasibility study (5.6 km). Structural measures through river training works are necessary to
reinforce and protect the embankment. The north bank is fairly stable and there is hardly any erosion from
the river.

Natural environment

366.     Ecosystems: The deltaic plain where the project is situated consists of a number of ecological
zones, each with their associated flora and fauna. The variability is mainly determined by the hydrological
conditions (seasonal variations in water levels and seasonal connections between river and floodplain)
and the composition of soils. Typical ecosystems are partly natural and partly manmade. The natural
systems are: (i) Padma River and its tributaries, and (ii) the charlands within the river. The manmade
ecosystems are located in the older parts of the floodplain and comprise: (iii) homesteads and settlements,
(iv) agricultural fields, (v) tree ecosystems, and (vi) permanent and seasonal wetlands.

367.     River ecosystem: The river's ecosystem is significant as habitat for numerous species of
vertebrates and invertebrates. Most are also found elsewhere in the delta, but for some species the project
area is of special importance, namely the highly threatened Gangetic Dolphin and two other species. This
part of the Padma River is known for their regular presence and breeding. The project area is also of
special importance for a few reptiles and amphibians as well as three endangered turtle species. Also the
presence of the nearly extinct Gangetic Gharial has been confirmed in the area. There are 158 species of
channel migratory fish species known in Padma River including major carps and floodplain resident
species. Some species of fish are confined to the river water, some migrate from the floodplain to the river
mostly for breeding, and others migrate to the upper reaches during the monsoon season. The major
migratory fish of the Padma is Hilsa. Hilsa migrates from the Bay of Bengal via the Padma River to
spawn in the upper reaches of the river. They pass the project construction site during March­May,
together with catfishes and major carps that migrate in the same period. Janjira is considered one of the
main fish breeding grounds, but a number of smaller spawning and nursing grounds are found to the SE
(Naria) and NW of the project site.

368.     Charland ecosystem: Charlands are newly accreted lands from river deposits. In the direct
surrounding of the project site there are three significant complexes of charlands: (i) Char Janajat,
upstream (NW) of the proposed bridge, (ii) a young complex of Char Tarapasa and Majhir Char situated
directly under and near the bridge alignment, (iii) a charland complex downstream (E) Char Teotia
consisting of Chandra Bari Char, Char Lauhajong and the more developed Char Korhati. The ecological
significance of the charlands is considerable. They provide the typical biotope for the endangered Fishing
Cat and the critically endangered Indian Crested Porcupine. Large numbers of footprints of the first
species were actually seen in the project area. The submerged areas of the chars are favorable
microhabitats for fishes and since fish is the main food for dolphins, the chars and sandbanks in the
middle of the river are important biotopes for the dolphins. Majhir Char (under the bridge) is considered a
major staging ground for migratory birds in winter. Thirteen amphibian species were observed in the
project area of which two are endangered and three vulnerable; six different turtle species, including some
endangered and very rare species and two different Monitors both categorized as endangered in the IUCN
Red List. Ten species of snakes were found of which three are on the Red List.

369.     Terrestrial ecosystem: These include homesteads and settlements, agricultural fields and semi-
forested areas. These ecosystems provide living opportunities to the rural population, but also support
floral and faunal biodiversity, albeit that most species are common and found all over the country. The
significance is the ecological corridor function and the availability of trees supporting a fauna that



                                                   111
otherwise would not be available in the area. About 92 terrestrial bird species were observed including
one listed in the IUCN Red Data Book: the Brown Fish Owl.

370.    Wetland ecosystem: Temporary wetlands are agricultural lands flooded during the monsoon
period. Their ecological significance is major and could be compared to that of the submerged areas
around the chars. They are important breeding and especially nursing biotopes for fish and crustacean
species, including Hilsa, major carps and catfishes. Permanent wetlands are the manmade ponds, the
oxbow lakes, depressions (beels) and channels. They are important for aquaculture. About 65 aquatic bird
species were observed in these areas including some Red-listed species.

371.     Physical and cultural resources: There are no designated historical, archaeological or cultural
resources within the project area. However, Lauhajang on the north bank has a rich cultural and historical
heritage with some beautiful mosques and tall minarets. Idrakpur Fort, the earliest Muslim architecture, is
a popular tourist place. These monuments will not be affected by the project. Some locally important
cultural or community assets may be impacted and these are handled in line with local needs.

Existing Pollution levels

372.     Air quality: The major sources of air pollution in the project area are ferry traffic, vehicular
traffic and dust and emissions from brick fields. At the three ferry ghats there are heavy traffic
congestions of waiting trucks, buses and cars resulting in extensive exhaust emissions. Also emissions
from the numerous, often poorly maintained ferries, launches and speedboats crossing the river contribute
to air pollution.

373.    Noise: The major sources of noise in the project area are the ferry ghats and the traffic on road
and river. Vibration also occurs at ferry ghats during uploading and offloading of heavy vehicles. Highest
noise levels of 77 dBA were recorded at the Mawa during the day and 73 dBA during the night., which is
above the standard set by the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules of 1997 (60 dBA for
commercial and mixed areas).

374.    Surface water quality: Surface water quality of the Padma River, the Naodoba Channel and other
surface streams and ponds was measured during the monsoon and dry period. Compared to irrigation
water standards the water quality is satisfactory, with the exception of the high amounts of total and faecal
coliforms. Without boiling this water is definitely unsafe for use as drinking water.

375.     Groundwater quality: Groundwater at the Mawa side is not always safe, especially from the
more shallow tubewells. In some shallow tubewells (<90 m) on the Mawa side, high values of arsenic
have been recorded and these tubewells should not be used for potable water. Arsenic values in deep
tubewells (>90 m) are below the national standards and they can be considered safe. Iron and manganese
content in some tubewells is slightly higher than the national standards for drinking water. This may
result in a bad taste and problems of clogging and flocculation of iron and manganese oxides in pipes.

376.     Riverbed sediment quality: Analyses of riverbed sediments of the Padma River show that there
are no major concentrations of heavy metals in the silty material from the riverbed. Mercury (Hg) was
slightly higher than standards in two samples of a series, which was analysed in Dhaka. This was not
confirmed by other samples, which were analyzed for heavy metals and toxic organics in Singapore. The
results of these tests indicate that there are no harmful concentrations in any of the samples. More
monitoring is required, especially of the deeper sediment layers, which will be exposed by dredging.

Significant Impacts and Their Mitigation

Overall impacts of the PMBP

377.      The most important impact of the Padma Bridge will be the establishment of an easy, safe and
reliable communication link between the banks of Padma River. Road and railway connections with the
Southwest will improve considerably and this will both have an accelerating effect on local as well as
regional socio-economic development. A river crossing utility infrastructure will facilitate connection of
the Southwest to the gas, electricity and telecommunication networks in the rest of the country and avoids
expensive alternative constructions. In the project area new employment and business opportunities will
be created and the improved connectivity will enhance access to healthcare, educational and recreational
facilities. Air and noise pollution will be reduced and traffic congestion and long waiting times for ferries
will disappear.

Impacts during pre-construction stage

378.     Development of resettlement sites: The development of four resettlement sites, two on each bank
of the river, will require the acquisition of 68 ha of land at an early stage of project preparation. The
relocation of the basic and religious services has been discussed with the communities and it has been
widely accepted that relocation of most facilities (as far as possible) within the resettlement area would be
preferred. The detailed plans and budgets for these facilities have been included in RAP I. A separate EIA
has been prepared for the development of the resettlement sites.

379.     Impact of land clearing: Land clearing and removal of trees and other vegetation will have a
major impact on landscape and wildlife. All vegetation and trees in the road and railway alignments right-
of way and on other project sites will be removed, before infertile fine sandy dredge material is used to
raise the level of these areas with an average 5 meters to elevations above maximum flood level. The
terrestrial ecosystem of these areas will be changed permanently. It has been estimated that more than
200,000 trees on the project land will be cut during site clearance. Owners of trees will receive
compensation under the RAPs and are also allowed to sell their own trees and take the wood free of cost
to be used for timber or firewood. To compensate most of the negative impacts a tree plantation and green
belt development plan has been drafted, which includes the planting of more than 400,000 trees. Trees
will be planted in strips along road and railway alignments to mitigate noise, to form green belts around
construction yards and resettlement sites, and alongside slopes and behind guide bunds of river training
works (about 100 ha). In addition, total quantities of affected banana and bamboo have been estimated at
around 360,000. Around 720,000 bamboo and banana saplings will be distributed to the people of the host
villages at the ratio of bamboo and banana 60:40.

380.     Loss of agricultural land: An estimated 640 ha of agricultural land will be lost in the project
area. This loss will impact 8,525 farmer families, who will receive compensation in cash. It is not
considered realistic to expect that the loss of production can be covered by boosting the production in the
remaining neighboring areas of the project. Those affected by the project will receive cash compensation
for land and other assets at full replacement cost as per market price at the time of dispossession. Besides
this, the households are eligible for additional support in the Income and Livelihood Restoration Plan
which includes also an Agricultural Development Program. Under the program, a number of agricultural
extension workers will assist and train farmers in close cooperation with the Department of Agricultural
Extension.

381.    Loss of fishponds: An estimated 12 ha of fish ponds will be lost due to project activities. With a
common production level of 2,000 kg/ha, some 24,000 kg of fish will be lost yearly. In addition, food fish
production from 724 ha of floodplain (at least 150,000 kg) will be lost. The following compensation


                                                    113
measures are identified: (i) Provision of an equal pond area in the resettlement areas. (ii) Establishment of
fish (reproduction) sanctuaries in the Padma River.

382.    Construction of yards on charlands with high biodiversity: Especially reed lands on Char
Janajat and Char Chandra Bari (Teotia) are important wildlife areas, which should not be subject of any
project building activity. Construction of yards should be restricted to old lands and developed charlands.
Use of Janajat and Char Chandra Bari for vegetation clearance and construction yards is ecologically
unacceptable. Barring these two main charlands for yard construction also excludes their use for
transportation activities and for replacement of ferry ghats.

Impacts during construction stage

383.     Construction related impacts: In a project of this magnitude and complexity there are many
impacts and risks, which potentially could affect air, soil, and water quality, and which, could cause
hindrance (noise, dust, traffic) or pose safety hazards (health and safety). Most of these impacts are less
significant and could be avoided, prevented or mitigated by adopting good operational practices and
environmental management guidelines and by permanent monitoring and inspection. Most impacts could
be prevented or mitigated by including generic Environmental Code of Practices and Environmental
Management Guidelines in contract documents. The less significant impacts are not included in this
annex.

384.      Transport of materials over land and river: Large quantities of concrete, steel and rock, and
other building materials will be transported both on water and by road during mobilization and
construction will cause traffic congestions and hindrance on roads and during navigation in the river.
There are also associated safety hazards to be considered. Especially local roads are not designed for
carrying heavy traffic and this may result in considerable damage to local roads. Prevention and
mitigation can be achieved by constructing temporary bypass roads in order to maintain uninterrupted
traffic flows to ferries and urban centres. Damaged roads should be repaired. Movement of vessels, barges
and dredgers will be constricted to designated areas to reduce risks of collisions and accidents.

385.     Impacts of dredging: Dredging will be carried out during the dry season when currents are not
strong; increased turbidity may cause increased turbidity in the water for longer periods. Dredging also
destroys the benthic communities, which are especially abundant in the shallower parts of the river and
form the nursing and feeding grounds for fish. There are no toxic substances to be expected in view of the
good quality of riverbed sediments (fine silty sand). The following significant adverse impacts are
expected from dredging:

    -   Water quality deterioration during dredging (high turbidity) will affect aquatic fauna and to some
        extent also the use of river water (bathing/washing) by the population;
    -   Dredging of charlands and submerged embankments will result in loss of wildlife habitat and
        aquatic fauna will be forced out of their preferred habitat. It is estimated that about 500 ha of
        vegetated char and about 500 ha of submerged embankments will be permanently lost;
    -   Deep dredging in main gully during March ­ May will stop Hilsa migration;
    -   Disposal of dredge material on charlands will severely impact flora and fauna on the chars,
        whereas disposal of dredge material in the river in the dry season will create negative impacts on
        aquatic life.

386.    Mitigation of adverse impacts of dredging. A dredging material management plan is to be
prepared in order to reduce permanent damage to breeding and nursing biotopes for numerous fish,
crustacean species, and feeding grounds for dolphins.



                                                    114
387.    This plan should be based on the following principles:
    -       use of anti-turbidity technology during dredging
    -       constant monitoring of cutter head turbidity, especially TSS and TDS values
    -       dredging operations in upstream direction to prevent concentration of silt and other
            suspended materials (clay, waste)
    -       avoid dredging of vegetated charlands
    -       suspension of dredging during the main Hilsa migration period (March to May) in the main
            channel on the North side of the river. In the other parts of the river dredging may continue.

388.     The loss of wildlife habitat in the submerged embankments and the charlands should be
compensated by the establishment of around 1,200 ha protected wetland area (600 ha char and 600 ha
river) or sanctuary for charland wildlife.

389.     Impacts of piling: Piling takes place during the construction of the bridge substructure for an
estimated period of 2.5 years. Impacts will therefore mainly have a temporary character, but effects are
significant and lasting. Impacts are twofold:

390.     Vibrations disturb fish migration routes: For most commercially important species (Hilsa, carps,
catfish) migration is indispensable to reach the breeding areas close to or upstream of the project site.
Hilsa fish migrate upstream for feeding and breeding during March-May. Vibrations caused by piling will
chase fish away from the wider area, resulting in loss of recruitment. Although these disturbances will
only take place during two years, the effect on especially Hilsa will be long-lasting: interruption of its
migration from the sea to the upstream breeding areas will result in the absence of two year-classes born
upstream of the project site, and those year-classes will subsequently not use the same migration route
when they are adults. This will virtually eliminate the breeding opportunities for this important food fish
in the traditional Padma breeding areas upstream of the project site.

391.     Noise pollution disturbs behavior of aquatic fauna. Dolphins as well as fish have very sensitive
acoustic organs, and thus are sensitive to noise and vibration. Gangetic River Dolphins are present within
the project site; they are likely to avoid the area during the construction period and especially during the
calving period (mainly March-May). Both dolphins and fish use sounds for communication; strong
vibrations might well disturb their common behavior patterns, potentially resulting in loss of reproduction
capacity. The combination of these effects with the loss of breeding and nursing biotopes for fish and
feeding ground for dolphins will have a major project impact. There might also be impacts on the
endangered aquatic turtles using the charlands near the project site as their nesting site. It is expected that
bird species will avoid the area close to the project site during construction activities, but that they can
return to the charlands immediately thereafter.

392.    Mitigation of impacts of piling
        -       In order to safeguard fish (Hilsa) migration, piling in water should be discontinued during
                March-May in areas deeper than 7 meters. Piling on land and in water shallower than 7m
                could continue during March-May, provided that vibration measurements and Hilsa
                observations indicate uninterrupted migration; if monitoring results point at severe
                interruption of Hilsa migration the acceptable piling depth should be reduced.
        -       The piling system with lowest sound generation should be selected in order to reduce
                disturbances;
        -       In order to prevent impacts on reproduction of the Gangetic Dolphin, noise should be
                kept as low as possible during the main calving period, which is March to May. Since this
                is also the Hilsa migration period, for which piling should be discontinued, additional
                mitigating measures are not required.



                                                     115
393.     River Training Works: Impacts of RTW on floodplain and river ecology are in principle long
lasting or permanent. Both impacts are highly significant in view of the large footprint of the RTW, which
is estimated at 328 ha on land and 292 ha in the river.

394.     Impacts on the floodplain: The main impact in the floodplain will be a decline of seasonal
wetlands, which are the agricultural lands flooded during the monsoon periods. Their ecological
significance is more or less comparable to that of the submerged areas around the chars; decrease of these
temporary wetlands will result in a loss of feeding and nursing biotope of all fish and crustacean species.

395.      Impacts on river ecology: The impact on the river ecology is the destruction of important feeding
and breeding biotopes for virtually all aquatic fauna in the submerged parts of the embankment that will
be replaced by a smooth sloping revetment bund consisting of dredge spoil material covered with
artificial material, which will be used as protection for the riverbank. Protected stable riverbanks with
underwater slope coverage have the positive impact of providing more shelter to fish and other aquatic
life compared with present embankments, but shelter is substantially less important than other habitat
functions. There is no direct mitigation of impacts possible, but the impacts highlight the need for the
compensation in the form of a wildlife reserve or sanctuary in the riverine zone.

396.     Impacts on charlands: Given the limited availability of uninhabited lands in Bangladesh and
their high natural biodiversity, it is essential to keep as many as possible charlands untouched. The
selected alternative has the advantage that it is expected to adequately protect approach road and landing
sites of the bridge from erosion. It also leaves the charlands largely untouched. Despite this, dredging,
filling and reshaping 14.5 km of embankments will result in considerable loss of wildlife habitat. It is
estimated that about 44 million m3 of dredge materials will be generated over two seasons due to the
construction of RTW alone. River dredging will force aquatic fauna away from their preferred habitat.

397.     Impacts on Hilsa migration: The longitudinal character of dredging for river training works will
have an additional impact on Hilsa migration, especially along the northern embankment. Dredging for
river training works should be suspended during the main Hilsa migration period (March-May), especially
along the northern shore. Dredging along the south-western side stream may continue.

398.     Impacts on natural drainage system: The RTW and the raised alignments of the approach road
will obstruct the natural drainage flow in the area. This may lead to water logging problems and
stagnation of floodwaters after floods retreat. For mitigation and prevention of these problems it is
important to keep the existing natural drainage system functioning and to improve the system where the
natural flow is blocked, hampered or changed in direction. A number of bridges and culverts have been
designed to overcome these problems, but water logging may still create local problems in residential and
agriculture areas. It is important to monitor the natural flow system during the monsoon and flood period
for a number of years. It is expected that improvements to the drainage systems might be required at a
number of localized places. Special attention should be given to the outflow of the natural drains, streams
and gullies collecting flood/rainwater from the areas behind the RTW.

Environmental Impacts during operation and maintenance stage

399.    Impacts of increased traffic: A considerable increase in traffic passing the bridge is expected
from 4,000 vehicles per day in 2014 to 45,000 in 2044. Without measures such as proper settlement
planning, traffic management and noise reduction the quality of living will decline considerably and
safety hazards and accidents will increase.

400.    Contribution to Green House Gas emissions: It is expected that a significant number of vehicles
will cross Padma River daily in the year 2036 contributing GHG emissions of 334,203 ton CO 2


                                                   116
equivalents/year. Total project GHG emission contribution as compared to the national total and world
emission is insignificant. With the introduction of new techniques and new sources of fuel this figure is
likely to decrease. Also the suspension of regular ferry services will contribute to a reduction of GHG
emissions.

401.    Increased accident risks: The most common emergency event will be road traffic accidents.
However, there are several other emergencies that could have impacts on the operation of the bridge.
These include flooding of land areas near the bridge, railway accidents, spill or leakage of hazardous
materials (oil, chemicals) on land and in the river, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks, gas leaks and
explosions. An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared, which covers all aspects of emergency
management including prevention, preparation, response and follow-up of emergencies. An Emergency
Response Team and an Emergency Response Centre with trained staff and equipment will be established
to deal with such events.

Other Relevant Issues

402.    Climate change and its impact on bridge design: Climate change may result in the rise of
future sea levels, higher temperatures, and wind speeds and increased cyclone intensities and rainfall,
which are all factors that may affect the design of the Padma Bridge. A study was carried out as part of
the EIA into the potential effects of climate change. Based on the results of the climate change studies the
following extreme situations were taken into consideration in the design of the Padma Bridge:

        -      Extra water-level increases at the bridge site of 0.4 m, which is the combined impact of
               sea level rise (extreme scenario) and increased rainfall in the catchment area leading to a
               maximum water level of 7.8m PWD for 100 year flood and 8.2 for check flood of 500
               year;
         -     A maximum temperature of 46.6 ºC and a minimum temperature of 9.3 ºC;
        -      A maximum rainfall of 372 mm in 1-day period and 514 mm in a 2-day period;
        -      A predicted maximum peak discharge of 151,100 m3/sec and a lowest flow of 7,345
               m3/sec;
        -      Maximum wind speed of 126 km/h.

403.     Natural bank erosion: Erosion of river banks and of charlands is a common phenomenon in the
active Padma River system. During the last two years, Char Janajat has been exposed to increased erosion
and it is expected that the charlands upstream of the Arial Khan off take also may experience some
massive erosion, especially on Char Badrashan. The affected area lies more than 15-20 km upstream of
the bridge and studies with numerical and physical models concluded that the expected backwater effect
from the bridge would not be more than 2 km upstream. It is not very likely that the bridge will have
much influence on this erosion process. Further protection of the charlands at the present time would fall
beyond the scope of the present project.

404.    Possible impacts on charlands: Though the project is not anticipated to create any impacts on
the charlands, the char dwellers could attribute the natural erosion to the construction of the bridge and
raise compensation claims against BBA. For this reason a Charland Impact Management Framework
(CIMP) has been prepared which gives guidelines for identifying potential impacts and risks for the
charland communities given the uncertainty of erosion and accretion processes in the recent floodplain of
the Padma River.

Environmental Management Plan

405.     Measures in design and contract documents: Most of the construction related impacts and some
of the operation related impacts can be prevented, minimized, mitigated or compensated by following
environmentally friendly design options and by including special conditions in the respective construction
bid documents. The EIA process was instrumental in improving some of the earlier design options (in
river training works, resettlement sites, approach roads etc). The engineering consultant has incorporated
general and specific environmental protection measures into the contract documents. During construction
the supervising consultant responsible for supervision of EMP and RAP will supervise civil works
contractors and verify that they implement the works in accordance with the measures mentioned in the
construction bid documents. They will also raise environmental sensitivity and awareness of the personnel
of contractors and sub-contractors working on the project.

406.    Dredging Material Management Plan: Dredging works will be carried out during the entire
construction period. These operations generate an enormous quantity of dredge spoil part of which will be
needed at a later stage of the project. Large quantities of spoil are needed for earth filling activities of the
various project sites to levels above maximum flood level, although at different moments during
construction, requiring stockpiling of dredge spoil for some time in temporary basins. A Dredging
Material Management Plan has been prepared in order to optimize operations and meanwhile minimize
damage to charlands and wildlife habitats. This plan describes the method of dredging operations and
type of equipment to be used, the designated dredging areas and method and conditions, and methods for
temporary or permanent disposal.

407.     Preservation of topsoil: The topsoil of the areas to be filled with dredge spoil should be
preserved, since this material represents the most fertile part of the soils in the project area containing
humus and clay. Therefore it is important that a layer of 0.25- 0.50 m of topsoil (depending on later land
use) is stripped off and put aside and stored for later application as covering layer on top of the sandy
dredge spoil.

408.     Tree replanting plan: More than 400,000 trees will be planted to compensate for the loss of trees
on the 100 ha to be acquired by the project. The trees will be planted in strips along the approach roads
and railway line, along internal roads and in green belts around resettlement sites, construction sites,
public places and behind river training guide bunds. Species selected include 50% trees for timber, 30%
fruit trees, 10% medicinal tree species and 10% trees suitable as fuel wood. Settlers will receive a number
of saplings to be planted around their houses. In addition, around 432,000 bamboo and 288,000 banana
samplings will be distributed to the host villages to compensate the banana and bamboo trees lost.

409.     Community Environmental Management Plan: A community environmental management
committee is established for each resettlement site to assist the project authorities in providing
infrastructural facilities such as water supply, sanitation, schools, mosques, health centres and other
services. The committee will assist in implementing mitigating measures for each site as described in the
Community Environmental Management Plan. The activities will also include environmental monitoring
and organizing awareness campaigns.

410.     Protected area and charlands visitor centre: A protected area or reserve for charland wildlife
will be established on part of Char Janajat or elsewhere. The protected area on the char must acquire
official status and will contain a core area and a buffer zone. Rangers will have to be trained to monitor
and protect the area. A Charland Visitors Centre will be established to improve local and national
knowledge about charlands and their biodiversity. A suitable location would be in Mawa, from where
tourists and day trippers from Dhaka can travel by electric boat to the reserve to make a guided walk
along an eco-trail in the nature reserve and watch the reed lands and its flora and fauna.

411.     Emergency Response Plan: An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared for unexpected
events and accidents such as extreme flooding, traffic accidents (road and rail), leakage or spill of
hazardous materials, civil disturbance/riot, terrorist attacks/threats and gas leaks or explosions. The plan
aims at applying effective prevention techniques to avert an emergency event from ever taking place. It
further includes measures for a rapid and effective emergency response; the provision of assistance to
emergency and security services; the implementation of an evacuation plan if required, and the
establishment of good communications with persons/institutions involved in transport and emergency
services.

412.    Monitoring Plan: The monitoring program has a dual purpose. It is designed (i) to monitor the
contractor's work during project implementation in order to check contractual compliance with specified
mitigation measures, and subsequently (ii) to assess the actual environmental impacts of the project over
the years following completion of the various project components. The first type of monitoring will be
implemented by the contractor and supervised by the M&E consultants of CSC. The second type of
monitoring will be commissioned and carried out by local organizations/consultants with sufficient
experience in hydrological and ecological monitoring. Monitoring will be continued for a period of five
years. Result of monitoring of impacts will have to be reviewed and evaluated from time to time by the
M&E consultants. Findings might be used to revise the operational rules of the project.

413.    Environmental Enhancement Fund: This fund will be created in order to finance sustained
environmental development and protection of the project area during the O&M stage and to address any
outstanding social and environmental issues during operation of the Project. The level of this fund will be
US$10 million equivalent.

414.    Cost of EMP: Much of the EMP activities would be implemented through other components
and construction contracts. The stand alone activities that are not included in such components and
contract are costed separately and provided under the component C2. These are summarized below:

Implementation Arrangements

415.     Project Implementation Unit: A Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by a project director
has been established by BBA to implement the PMBP. The PMU consists of separate units responsible
for: (i) Bridge; ii) Bridge End facilities and Roads, (iii) River Training Works, and (iv) Safeguard
(Environment and Resettlement). The PMU will have the responsibility of overall project coordination
and management of the project. At present a program of institutional strengthening is being developed
and new staff is being recruited. A Panel of Experts, appointed by BBA with national and international
experts to provide guidance and periodic review of procedures and the work of the DCs is also in place.
An Environment Management Committee has also been constituted to help PIU on environmental aspects
during preparation and implementation of the project. The environmental unit is currently being
strengthened to be fully operational during the construction of the PMBP. The unit will consist of 3 senior
resettlement specialists and 3 senior environmental specialists. In order to build capacity of this unit,
twinning arrangements have been agreed with academic and practitioner institutes like, BUET, CEGIS,
etc. BBA has established a Safeguard Division with separate environmental and resettlement staff for the
period after construction of the Padma Bridge. This division will eventually be charged with the
management of environmental and resettlement aspects of all present and future projects implemented by
BBA.

416.    Construction Supervision Consultant: PMU will employ a construction supervision consultant
(CSC) for supervision of civil works, including supervision of implementation of portions of the EMP to
be implemented by the Contractor responsible for the bridge and RTW. The CSC team will have an
environmental unit­ including Occupational Health and Safety expert. Environmental specialists of CSC,
in coordination with EU staff, will ensure the implementation of environmental management practices at
each stage of the project activities. The CSC will also be responsible for updating the EMP, if required.

417.    Implementation of key non-construction EMP: BBA will engage specialized NGOs and
agencies to implement the safeguard plans developed under the SAP and EMP. Also the establishment of
a nature conservation reserve and the establishment and management of a Charland Visitors Centre could
best be carried out by a national or international NGO like IUCN. Certain elements of the EMP could be
implemented by the contractor(s) under supervision of the environmental unit and M&E consultants.

418.    Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation: Independent M&E consultants will be engaged to
undertake monitoring of RAP and non- RAP components and of the EMP implemented through
contractors, as well as specialist NGOs.

Public Consultation and Disclosure

419.    During project preparation and design: The process of public consultation and participation has
been an integral part of all project preparations since 2003. During the pre-feasibility and feasibility
study, a series of consultations were organized and these were stepped up during detailed design. These


                                                      120
consultations were held as proposed in the Public Consultation and Participation Plan with formal and
informal meetings, village level workshops and disclosures of project impacts to the affected households
and communities. The views, needs and aspirations of the affected people as expressed during these
consultations have been incorporated in the project design and the proposed mitigating measures with the
objective to maximize benefits and minimize adverse social and environmental effects.

420.    Focus group discussions: There were different types of consultations. A very important role was
played by the Focus group discussions, where discussions were held with affected groups of persons
focusing on specific subjects. At the beginning of such meetings the anticipated impacts were disclosed
and followed by discussions on possible solutions to prevent or mitigate such impacts. Major issues
discussed in such meetings typically included: (i) land acquisition and possible alternatives; (ii)
hydrology, drainage and river erosion; (iii) fisheries and wildlife; (iv) health hazards, (v) tree cutting and
impacts on local ecosystems; (vi) community severance; (vii) employment/job opportunities and
occupational changes; (viii) traffic congestion; (ix) cultural resources and infrastructure; (x) impacts on
char lands; and (xi) relocation and resettlement. Participants actively joined in discussions and contributed
very useful suggestions and ideas, which were recorded for follow up.

421.    Public consultation meetings: Formal public consultations meetings were held at three locations
involving about 350 participants representing affected persons, union and upazilla leaders, NGOs, and
national and local government representatives. The recommendations from the public consultations have
been incorporated in the engineering design and the resettlement and compensation plan for the affected
communities.

422.    Expert consultations: Consultations with various groups of experts were held during the detailed
design. The objective was to share information on the project and to obtain feedback on important social
and environmental issues to be considered in the Social Assessment and Environmental Impact
Assessment. Guidance and expert advice on the social and environmental studies was also received from
the Panel of Experts appointed by BBA consisting of 10 national and international experts charged with
periodic review of procedures and progress of the PMBP.

423.     Disclosure: Five consultation meetings to disclose the results of the environmental and social
assessment and the EMP and SAP were held in the project area March 16 ­ 19, 2010. A national
workshop was held on October 23, 2010. The EA/EMP was approved by Department of Environment on
September 6, 2010. The Summary Report was submitted to Bank's Info Shop on September 8, 2010.
These reports have also been placed on the websites of ADB and JICA. After completion of the English
version of the Environmental Impact and Social Assessment a summary in Bangla is prepared and
distributed to local authorities and relevant stakeholders. The draft Summary and the EIA and EMP are
published on the website of BBA. The hard copies of these documents are available at the BBA office,
project site offices and deputy commissioner offices for general public access and they have been
distributed widely.

                 BANGLADESH: PADMA MULTIPURPOSE BRIDGE PROJECT

424.     The Padma Multipurpose Bridge will provide a vital missing link in the national road network of
Bangladesh particularly for the Southwest Region (SWR) of the country. A fixed crossing is essential to
link SWR with the rest of the country. Continuing with transportation through ferries and boats is not an
option for the country, particularly for the SWR because without effective connectivity of the bridge, the
region would continue to lag behind the rest of the economy and suffer from high concentrations of
poverty.

425.    The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is an important large-scale infrastructure
project of transformational nature with broad impact that would provide substantial benefits to all sectors
of the economy. The analysis shows that the benefits of the Project would be equivalent to annual
increase of at least 1.7 percent of SWR GDP in value and of the 0.56 percent of annual increase of
national GDP. The poverty reduction rate would increase by 1.0 percentage points in the SWR and by 0.8
the percentage points at the national level. The impacts are quite similar to the Jamuna Bridge
(connecting Northwest Region to the country), which were estimated about five years after the opening of
the bridge.
426.     The Padma Bridge is expected to: (i) provide significant travel time savings to drivers,
particularly between the Dhaka Division to the south-west of Bangladesh and possibly onto India (saving
travel time by about 2 hours for cars to more than 10 hours for trucks); (ii) result in change in transport
costs that will result in significant economic structural change of the SWR (changing the relative prices of
factors of production, goods and services and resulting in relocation of economic activities, generation of
new activities or changes in the way that current economic activities are performed); and (iii) result in
increased economic activity and consumption expenditure leading to poverty alleviation in Khulna and
Barisal Divisions of the SWR.

Estimation of Project Benefits.
427.     The expected benefits of the Project can be divided into: (i) road users' benefits or transportation
benefits directly realized by the operators of the vehicles, which were estimated using the traffic models;
(ii) other direct benefits such as land development, protection against river bank erosion and flooding
around the bridge area and avoided cost of separately providing for utility crossings such as gas pipeline,
electric telecommunication lines and railway bridge, which were estimated by assessing value of the land
developed and alternative cost of construction; and (iii) wider economic benefits (WEB) with increased
economic activity that would develop with reduced cost of transportation and generating surplus for other
economic activities. The WEB effects of the bridge were estimated using Social Accounting Matrix
(SAM) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. These are described in more detail in Annex
9.1.

Transportation or Road Users Benefits.
428.     The Design Consultants (Maunsell/AECOM) carried out detailed traffic studies and developed
traffic models to prepare the estimates of the direct transport benefits (report July 2009 and August 31,
2010). The direct transport benefits are estimated by the transport modeling, which required the
following steps:

    ·   Building base and future year networks;
    ·   Determining base year crossing demand from an origin-destination survey undertaken in May
        2009 and calibrating it to current conditions of road traffic;



                                                    123
    ·   Determining future demand on the basis of (a) growth in car ownership and (b) changes in socio-
        demographics, including population and employment;
    ·   Based on the relative costs of each mode, calculating how mode choice would change for future
        year demand;
    ·   Assessing freight movements; and
    ·   Assigning the motorized traffic to specified points in the road network.

Traffic Estimates and Forecast.

429.    Based on detailed information on the socio-economic situation and travel patterns, The Design
Consultant used a transport model to forecast traffic volumes on and revenues from the Padma Bridge.
The model takes into account four primary socioeconomic influences on the traffic demand: (i)
population; (ii) number of households and average household size (iii) employment by main sector of
the economy; (iv) GDP by main sectors of the economy and GDP per capita and (v) vehicle ownership.
Each of these influence traffic demand and further assumptions about parameters were made and these are
noted below.

430.      Population and households. The projection of total urban and rural population were made
based on BBS data and it was assumed that certain areas directly served by the bridge would get a boost
in population growth primarily through migration. Similarly the size of households was projected on the
basis of past trend and observed status in other countries. For the purpose of traffic demand projection,
the total number of households was then derived by dividing the population forecasts by average number
of people per households.

431.    GDP growth assumptions were based on IMF series. The key assumptions in the traffic model
about GDP and per capita GDP are noted in Table 1. Regression analysis was used to forecast sectoral
composition of GDP.
                      Table 1: Adopted Forecasts of real GDP and GDPPC
                                          Real GDP                    Real GDPPC
       2009-2014                            5.9%                         4.0%
       2015-2024                            5.5%                         4.2%
       2025-2034                            5.3%                         4.2%
       2035-2044                            4.8%                         4.1%

432.    Vehicle Ownership. Car ownership is low in Bangladesh--estimated to be 0.64 per 1000
population and motorcycle ownership is 2.58 per 1000 population. Car ownership is concentrated in
Dhaka area, but motorcycle ownership is, more evenly distributed. In forecasting vehicle ownership levels
for Bangladesh initial figures were used from BBS source and projection of ownership was made using a
standard model (GOMPERTZ). Vehicle ownership for cars and motorcycles was calculated separately for
the Dhaka Zila, SWR and the remainder of Bangladesh. Given the change in GDP forecasts due to the
effect on the economy of Padma Bridge, the rate of vehicle ownership is also expected to increase. The
model generated a 10% per annum, long-term growth rate of vehicle ownership.

433.    Other assumptions were made and estimates used with regard to trips in base year and future
years, and about parameters of the traffic model.

434.    Base Year Trips and Traffic Forecast. Base year demand in the model was based on all
potential trips that could possibly use the Padma Bridge. This was derived from origin-destination surveys
covering all vehicular and person traffic crossing, three ferry crossings (Mawa, Paturia, Shariatpur) and
two existing bridges (Jamuna and Paksey). In addition, a live origin-destination survey of current traffic



                                                  124
was conducted in the first half of May 2009 at nine points (four river crossing, Dhaka port, and four road
junctions) netting altogether more than 18,000 survey respondents and counts in excess of 325,000
passengers and 22,000 vehicles. This substantial body of O-D traffic count in formation was joined with
socio-economic data at the Zila level (disaggregated for Dhaka to the Upazila level), a network mapping
of rail, water, and road routes (incorporating IRI measures of road condition and locally validated
operating costs and volume/ capacity relationships), all of which were entered into the standard Cube
Voyager transport model suit. The model was then used to calculate trip generation, origin-destination
distributions, mode split (including passenger cars versus buses as competing modes), and, ultimately,
route assignments, including the predicted volume for four vehicle classes (trucks, buses, cars,
motorcycles) at the Mawa crossing/Padma Bridge site for both `with' and `without' Padma Bridge cases.

435.     Historic Traffic Pattern over Padma. Table 2 and 3 show past traffic crossing on over Padma
River at key crossing points ferries (Mawa, Paturia and Chandpur) and Jamuna Bridge from where the
traffic for Padma Bridge crossing would come. The annual growth rate for traffic at Mawa is higher than
Paturia crossing with overall growth rate of about 10 percent.

Traffic Forecast.
436.    Future demand was estimated separately for passengers and trucks. A separate person trip model
was developed to estimate demand in future years. This procedure involving Trip Generation, Trip
Distribution and Mode Choice produced matrices of future year demand of personal travel. The
proportional change in these matrices was then applied to the base year matrix derived from the OD
surveys calibrated to current conditions, in order to determine future year demand.

437.     The impact of additional and new trips was applied by adjusting the Trip Generation model, using
the following process: (i) the difference in travel costs between "with" and "without" Padma Bridge cases
was calculated; and (ii) an elasticity of induced passenger traffic of 1.0 was applied. This means that
assumption is made that a 10% decrease in the cost of travel will result in a 10% increase in passenger
traffic.

438.     As for freight traffic, the determination of the elasticity of demand for freight transport in general
is an empirical issue, on which the evidence is inconclusive. In the absence of a specific empirical study
of freight demand in Bangladesh, an alternative approach involving two steps was made to measure. First,
the impact of improved transport infrastructure and accessibility on regional economic output (GDP) was
estimated 15. Second, the impact of a change in regional economic output (GDP) on truck travel was
estimated 16.

439.      Traffic Forecast by Design Consultants. Table 4 summarizes the traffic forecasts made by the
Design Consultants using the above mentioned assumptions and estimates. The forecast of opening year
traffic (2014) to be 7,835 AADT, growing to 20,491 in 2020, 40,845 in 2030 and 76,153 in 2048 and the
same then on. Initially, trucks and buses make up around 79% of vehicles (trucks 43% and buses 36%)
on Padma Bridge, although light vehicles (cars and motorcycles) make up an increasing proportion of
traffic as vehicle ownership in Bangladesh increases. In 2050 cars/light vehicles would be 39% of the
total traffic and buses and truck would be 18%, and 43%.

   The Feasibility Study Consultant developed an econometric model from which it was possible to derive an elasticity of district
(Zila) GDP with respect to district travel time to/from Dhaka. The derived elasticity value is 0.55, i.e. a 10% reduction in travel
time to/from Dhaka will lead to a 5.5% increase in district GDP.
16
   The elasticity of induced truck travel (VKT) with respect to the generalized costs of truck means has been assumed to be: 0.55.
In other words, a 10% reduction in the generalized costs of truck traffic would lead to an increase of 5.5% in truck traffic due to
regional economic development.


                                                               126
Valuation of Traffic Benefits
440.    Besides assumptions and estimates made to forecast traffic, certain assumptions and estimates
were made to generate estimates of traffic benefits. Travel time and cost saved were converted into
common value in taka. Table 5 records the values used in the model. It is also assumed that value of time
will grow with time. The DCs assume that value of time would grow at 50% of the rate of real income
growth.

441.    The quantified benefits of the bridge investment are measured as the difference between the
`without project' and `with project' cases. In estimating benefits for each of the items, certain
assumptions were made and some available estimates were used. Vehicle operating cost (VOC) is used to
provide economic value in distance savings covering various factors such as fuel, tiers and maintenance
etc. This is a major part of total benefits. For the economic evaluation, unit VOC was derived from the
"Road User Cost Report, 2004-05",RHD.Total VOC was disaggregated into fuel and non-fuel
components, which were then escalated to 2009 values by the increase in Average Petroleum Spot Price
(IMF, 2009b) and the Consumer Price Index (BBS, 2009a).O

442.     A measure of Value of Time (VOT) is used to convert travel time savings into a monetary value.
Savings in travel time costs account for 23% of total benefits estimated by Design Consultant. Unit travel
time costs for passengers and crew were sourced from RHD (2005) and for freight in transit from STUP
(2007). These were then escalated to 2009 prices by estimated increase in General Wage Rate Index from
BBS (2008) and ADB (2009). The above VOT for the different vehicle classes was then weighted using
the vehicle proportions observed during Traffic Survey (May 2009) to determine VOT for truck, bus and
light vehicles.

443.     Additionally it was also assumed that VOT would increase with uncertainty and delay, Wait
Time in the economic evaluation was valued 1.5 times in-vehicle time. Research shows that valuation of
wait time can be between 1.5 to 3.5 times of in-vehicle time.

444.    Travel Time Savings. Table 6 presents the travel time savings likely to be experienced by users
of the Padma Bridge for a selection of typical trips from Dhaka in 2014. These travel time savings
include wait time at ferry ghats weighted by vehicle class, which add further 2 to 10+ hours to travel
times. Due to long ferry wait, it is expected that large number of traffic will be diverted from ferry to
bridge.

Revised Traffic Estimates Used

445.     The World Bank, ADB and JICA Teams undertook two missions (May 2010 and August 2010) to
the project area to assess the traffic and assumptions made for the terrific forecast and in valuation of the
traffic benefits. Based on this review several adjustments were made to the traffic model developed by
the consultants. The major difference is in the traffic forecast for the Padma Bridge. The Project Teams'
(WB, ADB and JICA) estimate of traffic used in this economic and financial evaluation is more
conservative. These are provided in the Table 7. In particular, the Project Teams considered the
assumption about strong induced traffic generation and diverted truck and bus traffic away from ferry
services at Paturia and other locations to the bridge and ultimate traffic (of over 70,000) by the DCs too
optimistic.

446.     The Project Team assumed an opening traffic of 4,300 AADT, growing to 12,831by the year
2020, 36,597 by 2030 and ultimate traffic of about 45,000 in 2040. In making the revised estimate of
traffic growth, a growth rate of 9% prior to bridge opening was taken into account. Also it was assumed
that about 70% of the traffic crossing Paturia would be diverted in four years after opening of the bridge.
During this time currently planned improvements in road network on western side of Dhaka would be
completed. Construction on four lane expressway on the west side of Dhaka (Western bypass) should be
highest priority complementary investment (of about US$50 million) to direct the traffic from the north
and south of Dhaka going to the SWR towards the proposed bridge with added advantage of reducing
traffic congestion in Dhaka city.

447.     A growth rate of 14% for about eleven years after opening the bridge starting from 2015 to 2025
was assumed. The growth rate of about 8% was assumed for the period from 2026-2030 and 2% and 1%
respectively for 2030-2040 and 2040-2050 and capping the traffic to 45,000 AADT. The composition of
the traffic is taken similar i.e. initially light cars are small proportion and their proportion grows over
time.

Project Benefits
448.     The benefits of the bridge investment are measured incremental to the `without bridge' case i.e.
they are measured as the difference between the `without project' and `with project case'. The benefits
are (i) road users benefits; (ii) other direct benefits; and (iii) wider economy benefits (WEB) and indirect
benefits

449.     Road Users benefits. Road users benefits, estimated based on the saving on vehicle operation
costs (VOC) and savings in travel time cost (TTC). These constitute a major part of the quantified
benefits. The revised traffic forecast described above was used and VOC and TTC benefits estimated
were adjusted for this traffic forecast;

450.    Land Development. There would essentially be two kinds of land related benefits from the
bridge ­ land developed in the vicinity of the bridge and protection to land from erosion and flood in the
area. The estimated capitalized value of land is taken into account. This covers:

    ·   240ha of land will be created from reclamation and protection by the river training works (60 ha
        on the north side of the river, 180 ha on the south side)
    ·   112 ha of service area land will be available for commercial development (85ha at Janjira and
        27ha at Mawa);
    ·   About 147 ha of land would be developed for construction yards on both sides of the river, Mawa
        and Janjira side.
    ·   Value of land for commercial use is based on acquisition cost of land and ratio of developed land
        value to undeveloped land value of 4:1;
    ·   Annual rental return (which is applied to land value) is the same as the economic opportunity cost
        of capital (12%).

451.     River Bank and Flood Protection. Land is very is valuable in Bangladesh. The bridge will also
provide protection to land from riverbank erosion and flooding. Annually more than 9,000 ha of land are
eroded by rivers, primarily by the Jamuna/Padma River. The GoB has a large investment program for
stabilization of the Jamuna/Padma River based on the Flood Action Program 1 (FAP 1) studies. For


                                                   129
example, the cost of two hard points constructed at Sirjganj and Mathrupara (for the Brahmaputra Right
Bank Embankment) about ten years ago was more than US$120 million. For Jamuna/Brahmapura river
stabilization the GoB has an investment plan of about US$400 million to construct hard points to stabilize
the river over the next five years. The value of land protected against erosion and flooding is estimated
around US$ 2,263 per hectare and value of peri-urban land is about US$ 32,587 per ha.

452.     The river training works (an investment of about US$800 million) to be constructed under the
Project would provide a very strong hard point. This would help in managing the river bankline, and
consistent with overall program of GoB for riverbank protection along the Padma River and perhaps it is
justified solely on its own, based on the benefits from protection against riverbank erosion and flood
protection. The river training works and approach roads would provide protection to large tracts of land
on both sides of the river. In particular on the Janjiara where more than 0.5 km of bank has been eroded
over the last five years since completion of the feasibilities studies for the Project. The approach of about
13 km of land on the Janjira side and the land behind it would be protected against the 100-year flood.
The rough estimate is that more than 9,000 ha of land would be protected against river erosion and
flooding. The value of land saved would be at last US$156 million. These benefits are not included as
the project benefits.

453.     Utility Crossings. The savings in construction of a gas pipeline crossing of over the Padma
River would be prohibitively expensive. The crossing has to be below scour depth of the Padma River
i.e. more than 55 meters below the bed level. Also construction of the foundation for an independent
crossing of power transmission without the bridge is estimated to cost more the US$63 million
equivalent. The combined savings in utility crossings for electrical line, fiber optic cables and gas pipeline
is taken as US$271 million.

454.    Railway Bridge. The Padma Bridge is a rail-ready bridge on which railway tracks could be built
to connect with the railway network when constructed in the region. The construction cost of a separate
bridge would be about US$900 million and perhaps it would be constructed in the year 2022 and 2023.
The avoided cost of the railway bridge is considered a project benefit. However, in the base case for this
evaluation these savings are not included.

455.     Savings in Ferry Operating Costs. The Government subsidizes operation of ferries by about
50%. The estimates of cost savings mentioned above are based on the actual tariff charged to the vehicles
users. With closure and/or reduction in operation of ferries there would be additional savings that would
be realized to the economy. The DCs have estimated these savings (the NPV at 12%) of which is about
US$400 million equivalent. However, the Project Team has not taken these as project benefits (in base
case scenarios);

456.     Wider Economy Wide Benefits. As explained in detail in the Annex 9.1, the literature as well
as an expost analysis of the Jamuna bridge show that major infrastructure like the Padma Bridge would
bring a structural change and the impacts are generally more pronounced than what is anticipated at the
appraisal time by a travel model only. In short, the conventional approach always undermines the increase
in traffic that would occur from opening a major link like the Padma Bridge. For this purpose Social
Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models were developed and used
to prepare an estimate of wider economic benefits (WEB). These benefits build slowly and start about
two three years after the completion of the bridge as the cost and time savings are realized and used to
induce additional economic activities. The benefits plateau around the year 2030. This analysis is
discussed in more detailed in the attached Annex 9.1.




                                                    130
Economic Costs

457.    The economic capital cost of the project is estimated by taking out the price contingencies, taxes
and duties and using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9. The economic costs come to about
US$1,884 million. The estimated cost of O&M of the infrastructure is also included in the estimates.

Estimation of Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
458.     The ERR for base case is about 19%. The benefit cost ratio is over 2.0. The base case reflects a
very conservative estimate and the ERR realized is likely to be higher than this. The base case includes,
benefits for the road users' based on very conservative estimates of traffic forecast, value of the land
developed (also a very conservative estimate as riverbank and flood protection benefits are not included),
utility crossings (quite conservative in the case of the gas pipeline crossing) and wider economy wide
benefits. The ERR would be 20%, if savings in ferry closings or avoided cost of railway bridge are
excluded and 21% if both are included. The NPV of the net benefits stream at the discount rate of 12% is
US$1.2 billion and NPV of the cost and benefit is US$1.3 and US$2.6 billion respectively. The ERR
analysis is given in Table 8 below.

459.    Table 9 shows the results of the ERR estimates and sensitivity analysis. The Project ERR is
robust and not very sensitive to variations in the project costs or benefits. Switching values have been
computed to determine the effects of increase in costs and decrease in benefits. With increase in capital
cost by 20% or reduction in benefits by 20% the ERR is 17% and it is 15% with a combination of two.
The ERR would remain above 12% considered as opportunity cost of capital with 90% increase in cost or
40% reduction in benefits. The delay in completion of the project by two years would have no impact on
ERR. The sensitivity based on various risks that the project may face shows that it is highly unlikely that
unfavorable developments would reduce the project ERR below the OCC.

460.     The reasons that the ERR is so robust is that river crossing through ferry services only fulfils
partial requirements of connectivity, passengers and goods perhaps to a limited scale, and even that at a
very high cost as indicated by the reduction in travel times to various destinations in the SWR. Crossing
of utilities such as gas and electricity and telecommunication are prohibitively expensive without a
bridge. The scour depth of Padma River is over 60 meters. So for crossing a gas pipeline, for example,
either gas line is to be supported by a foundation piers similar to Padma Bridge (over 130 meter deep) or

pipeline is to be crossed under the river say at over 60 meters depth and both are extremely costly.
Similar is the case for electrical and other utility crossings. The Project also develops a lot of land during
construction which would be used for other economic activities. The land is Bangladesh raised above the
flood level is extremely valuable that also adds to the robustness of ERR estimated. The details are
provided in Annex 9.

Financial Analysis

461.    The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority (JMBA), the precursor to Bangladesh Bridge
Authority (BBA), was created in 1985, its ordinance envisaged it to be an Authority that would enjoy
financial and organizational autonomy to be able to build the large ($1.0 billion) Jamuna Bridge Project.
JMBA is now called Bangladesh Bridge Authority..

462.      Financial Objectives of BBA are to: (i) levy tolls at minimum levels so as not to discourage
traffic from using the bridges and (ii) to raise enough funds from road users and other uses (such as power
interconnectors) to meet all operation and maintenance costs (including toll collection charges) and to
meet debt servicing obligations.

463.    The agreements under the IDA Credit for the Jamuna Bridge Project included JMBA to levy tolls
and other user charges (such as the rent on land controlled by JMBA, and charges for carrying the power
inter-connector) at a level sufficient to meet all maintenance and operation costs (including toll collection
charges) and to meet debt servicing obligations. Indicative tolls were agreed at appraisal subject to
confirmation in a toll study to be carried out by JMBA by June 30, 1997 of the level and structure of tolls.
This study provided the basis for the tolls that were implemented at the time of the opening of the Jamuna
Bridge.

464.     Political Economy of Toll Increases. Not only was the Jamuna Bridge the first mega scale
investment in Bangladesh but it also carried a high level of uncertainty and anxiety about the
unpredictable behavior of the river, that could have been detrimental to the project. Thus, the
Government was taking extraordinary measures to ensure that the project would be completed and it
could be maintained properly after its completion. All three credits for Jamuna Bridge (IDA, ADB, and
by Japan) also required a buildup of a cash reserve for ensuring funds in case of any emergencies which
may happen during and after the construction. The JMBA was headed by strong management and it was
given full autonomy without any political pressures to make decisions about the toll structure for the
Jamuna Bridge. Using the 1997 study as a basis, and a careful approach, JMBA decided the toll level
which was considered very high at that time (the car toll was set at US$10 which was more than the
estimates in the staff appraisal report). With a long grace period for loan repayments, O&M requirement
being very low (as both bridge and the river training works performed extremely well), growth in traffic
resulting in a revenue surplus, and accumulated cash reserves, there was no immediate necessity to
increase the toll. Therefore, BBA (the successor of JMBA) and the government were not compelled to
take politically difficult decisions of upward adjustments of the toll.

465.     With change in exchange rate over time and the debt servicing burden increasing, the value of the
toll is decreasing in real terms and with the imposition of VAT and other taxes by the Government on
BBA, it is only recently that BBA is expected to see negative cash flows. The mandate of BBA allows it
to make toll adjustments without any approval from the Government. However, because of political
implications such increases may have, in practice BBA is not able to make changes in the toll without
prior approval of the Government. Two aspects would help in rationalizing the decision making in this
regard. These are possibly: (a) using a formula-based approach of linking the toll levels to an appropriate
indicator such as inflation; and (b) institutional changes which would allow BBA to have the level of



                                                    133
autonomy, in reality, as envisaged in its mandate. Details of these aspects would be developed during the
study proposed to be completed prior to opening of the bridge as described below

BBA Past Finances.

466.     Since the opening of the Jamuna Bridge (JB) in 1998, BBA has been in compliance with these
financial objectives and had ostensibly generated by June 30, 2010 a cumulative surplus of Tk 8000
million (US$114 million), despite not having revised the tolls over the last 12 years. This is because all
loans were on concessionary terms (IDA, ADB, and JICA) had a grace period of 10 years thus debt
servicing was not a major burden on BBA in the initial years of operation of the Jamuna Bridge and a
good traffic growth rate occurred over this period. However, even this surplus is subject to some further
qualifications. In the past, BBA has not been making an adequate provision for operations and
maintenance of the Jamuna Bridge, a deficiency that now needs to be rectified by allocating an estimated
$100-150 million for major maintenance over the next 4 to 5 years. This would more than absorb all the
cumulative surplus to-date.

467.   BBA's financial statements also show that a deficit starting from 2007-08 (Taka 195 million,
Taka 137 million and Taka 1,125 million in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 respectively). This deficit
would further grow in future due to increase in debt service burden in local currency terms, and
repayment of IDA and ADB loans doubling starting from June 2014 BBA's net annual cash flow is
expected to be negative. Therefore, increase in Jamuna Toll rates immediately is unavoidable.

BBA Future Finances

468.     BBA is embarking on construction of the Padma Bridge (PB) and many of the funds required for
construction of the bridge would be provided by the Development Partners of Bangladesh as loans and
credits and the Government of Bangladesh as a grant to BBA (about US$560 million equivalent). BBA
also owns another bridge constructed by the Chinese Government namely the Muktapur Bridge. BBA is
reported not having any debt obligation for the Muktapur Bridge. The toll collection from the Muktapur
Bridge is very nominal. Thus for financial projections and BBA financial position the two bridges,
Jamuna Bridge which is in operation and the Padma Bridge which is likely to start its operation in 2014-
15 are of significance.

469.     The future revenues of BBA depend on two main factors: the growth in traffic for both Jamuna
Bridge and Padma Bridge, and the level of tolls. Other revenue from bridge usage fees from utilities, and
rent from land used during construction that reverts back to BBA after the completion of the bridge, are
relatively insignificant. The main cost elements are the bridge O&M costs and BBA's administrative
costs. A model was constructed to project BBA's future finances under different assumptions of traffic
and toll charges. Other assumptions used in the model are as follows:

    Revenue
    Elasticity of traffic with toll increase         -0.10
    Service area revenue per annum                   Tk 38 million per annum for JB and Tk441
                                                     million for PB
    Utility Charges                                  Tk 12 million per annum
    Expenses
    Annual routine O&M cost of the bridge            0.33% of capital cost
    Major O&M for bridge                             1.2% in year 25
    O&M cost of RTW                                  2.0% of RTW construction cost
    BBA administrative cost                          Extrapolated from 1999-2010



                                                  134
       Domestic inflation applied to costs             5% per annum
       VAT on toll revenue                             15%

470.      The toll rates at Jamuna bridge since 1998 are as follows:

       Vehicle Type                                           Economic Rate of Return (%)
       Small Truck                                                       750
       Medium Truck                                                     1,000
       Large Truck                                                      1,250
       Large Bus                                                         800
       Small Bus                                                         550
       Car and light vehicles                                            400
       Motor Cycle                                                        30

471.     As mentioned above, despite these tolls not having been revised since 1998, BBA has still
managed to generate a small cumulative surplus. There are two reasons for this: (i) all of the financing
for the JB has been on concessional terms from the donors, and (ii) traffic at JB has been growing around
11% per year. However, financial projections at the current toll levels indicate that the JB will have a
deficit of about Tk 10,000 million in the 2010-2020, before once again turning into surplus in 2021 as the
debt service obligations would end. These points to the need for an immediate adjustment in the tolls for
JB.

472.     Padma Bridge Finances. The construction of the PB will add a much larger additional financial
burden of BBA because of its high cost (over $2.9 billion) and significantly harder financing terms ($755
million from ADB and IsDB on non-concessional terms). GoB has already committed to finance the
counterpart funding requirements (about $657 million) of the project from its budget since it considers the
project to be of the highest national priority, and the expectation that this funding would be offset by the
additional taxes from the bridge contractors. Projections show that at the current toll level, PB would
generate deficits of Tk 22 billion in 2015-2020, Tk 45 billion in 2021-2025 and Tk 51 billion in 2026-
2030. This level of burden is well beyond the capacity of GoB to fund.

473.     In order for PB to generate sufficient revenues to meet its debt service needs, toll rates will have
to be raised by 350% over the current tolls at JB. Such a large increase would not be tenable either from
the economic or social point of view. Yet, given the already constrained fiscal situation of GoB, it would
not be prudent to require subsidy subventions to meet the deficits.

474.    Jamuna and Padma Bridge Combined Finances. The only possible way to have BBA meet
the financial obligations arising from PB construction is to consider toll levels for both JB and PB as a
package. This would allow for the possibility of a cross-subsidy from the "mature" JB with a lower (and
declining after 2020) debt service needs to cross-subsidize the deficits from PB. Such a policy would also
allow the tolls for the two bridges to be kept proportionate to their size and cost, something that would be
understandable to the users.

475.    The financial model was run with a variety of toll scenarios that would both wipe out the
anticipated deficit at JB in 2011-2020 period, and generate sufficient cross subsidy for PB. All of the
scenarios show a need for a significant immediate increase in toll rates for JB and a further increase at PB
at opening in 2015. The various options are summarized below.




                                                     135
476.     Option 1: 75% increase now in JB Toll and PB Toll set at 125% of JB at opening. While there are
many possible combinations of tolls that can be considered, the optimal case would be to increase tolls at
JB by 75% now and set the opening year toll rates for PB at 125% of the current toll rates. Although still
leaving an overall deficit of about Tk 5,100 million in 2011-2025, overall it would allow BBA to meet all
its debt service obligations from internally generated resources as summarized in Table 10 below, and the
resultant average toll rates are given in Table 11.

477.    The differences in toll levels at JB and PB would roughly be in proportion to the length of the
bridges (about 25%) and thus justifiable from the point of view of users.

478.    Option 2: 40% increase now in JB toll and annual adjustments with inflation and the set PB toll
25% higher than JB. It is generally preferable for tariff to be adjusted regularly in small increments rather
than having to make a major adjustment at any one time. Had the JB tolls been adjusted to keep pace
with inflation every year, there would have not only been adequate tariffs to meet future debt service
needs but also to make a contribution to the construction of PB. An alternative policy that would also
largely meet BBA's financial viability requirements would be to increase JB tolls now by 40% now and
allow annual automatic adjustments linked with inflation, and tolls for PB set at 25% higher than PB. See
Table 1 and 2 for internally generated resources and toll rates.

479.     Option 3: 40% increase in JB toll now and another 45% before opening of PB. A third option
would be to have a smaller increase (40%) in the JB toll rates now and another 45% (or 103% above the
current level) before opening of PB applicable to both JB and PB. While meeting overall financing needs
of BBA, this would still leave a Tk 5,000 million deficit in 2011-2015 period that will have to be financed
by BBA (see below).

480.     Keeping with the financial objectives of BBA, i.e. minimum level of tolls to encourage the use of
bridge and raise sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations, the most optimal scenario seems to be
to: (i) increase the Jamuna toll now by 40 percent which would be adequate to meet the financial
obligations over the next few years till the opening of the Padma Bridge; and (b) before opening of the
Padma Bridge increase the toll of Jamuna Bridge by another 45 percent and set the tolls for Padma Bridge
at the same level i.e. 103% of the current level. This would leave about Taka 5 billion deficit during
2011-2015 (less than the cash reserves of BBA) but overall BBA would be able to meet all its obligations
for the two bridges. This is perhaps the most pragmatic option from the implementation point of view,
particularly, if a differential toll is not considered desirable for the two bridges. While recent Jamuna data
is available and very reliable, this assessment for Padma Bridge is based on the data and traffic surveys
carried out during feasibility studies (before 2005) with updated information in 2009. Therefore, as
explained further below a study has to be undertaken not more than one year prior to the opening of the
Padma Bridge to determine more accurately the desired toll levels in future and in particular at the
opening of the Padma Bridge.

481.    Need for a Toll Study Prior to Opening of the Padma Bridge. The revenue collected from the
bridge(s) depends upon the volume of traffic and the toll rates. The traffic in Bangladesh has been
increasing about 8 percent however the growth rate is higher in the recent years, about 10-11%.
Forecasting future traffic and in particular estimating opening traffic for the Padma Bridge is quite
challenging task due to several factors. For the purpose of economic analysis quite a conservative
estimate was used.

482.     The opening traffic for the Padma Bridge would depends upon: (a) current and growth in traffic
over all the river crossings till the opening of the Padma Bridge. A lot of passenger movement across the
river is over the speed boats and small launches which is difficult to capture in traffic surveys. Often
buses operate on both sides of the river. The buses drop the passengers on one side and they cross the
river through several way, ferry, boats, launches etc, and get the busses on the other side; (b) with start of


                                                        137
construction of the bridge (bridge is in planning for decades thus some doubt that it would be realized)
there would be population moving into the zone of bridge influence with greater economic impact thus
resulting in generated traffic which is very difficult to predict; and (c) diversion of traffic from other river
crossings. Expected diversion from other crossings is more difficult to estimate as it depends on the
savings in travel time, cost of the trips and speed of development of infrastructure and road network
leading to the bridge. All these factors would influence the size of traffic and the forecast will vary
according to assumptions made about the likely nature and roles of the factors. For the purpose of
economic analysis, a conservative estimate of traffic at opening was assumed.

483.    Affordability of Tolls. The economic benefits of use of the bridge are much higher than the toll
rates. The proposed toll rates are affordable and willingness to pay can be observed from considerable
savings and that the current toll rate paid at ferry crossing is higher than the Jamuna Bridge toll rates (toll
for medium truck at Paturia Ferry crossing is Taka 1600). Nevertheless, the public always resists toll
increases, particularly when they are increased in large increments. There will be a need for an extensive
public outreach to explain the rationale for the tolls to the people.

                          Annex 9.1: Estimation of Wider Economic Benefits
           Using Social Accounting Matrix and Computable General Equilibrium Models

Background and Rationale

484.     The Padma Bridge is expected to: (i) provide significant travel time savings to drivers in the
corridor, particularly between the Dhaka Division to the south-west of Bangladesh and possibly onto
India; (ii) result in change in transport costs that will result in significant economic structural change of
the Southwest region. Changes in the relative prices of factors of production, goods and services will
result in relocation of economic activities, generation of new activities or changes in the way that current
economic activities are performed; and (iii) result in increased economic activity and consumption
expenditure leading to poverty alleviation in Khulna and Barisal Divisions of south-west region.

485.     Economic Impact of Large Infrastructure Projects. The economic evaluation of a large
infrastructure project like the Padma Bridge shows broadly two types of benefits--road (and bridge) user
benefits and non-road user benefits. Users benefit from the bulk of the projected benefits and consist of
two items: (i) vehicle operating cost savings and (ii) travel time cost savings. These savings are at the core
of traditional benefit analysis of road and bridge projects, but several methodological papers, some of
them published recently, show that this traditional analysis invariably underestimate benefits in
developing country contexts. A study by Ahmed and Hossain (1990) in the Bangladesh context argued
that the conventional approach to estimation of benefits of infrastructure projects would not give the
complete picture in a situation, where resources are not fully employed. A major infrastructure project
like the Padma Bridge would bring a structural change and the impacts are generally more pronounced
than what is anticipated at the appraisal time by a travel model only. In short, the conventional approach
always undermines the increase in traffic and its impact on the economy that would occur from opening a
major link like the Padma Bridge.

486.    Ex-Post Evaluation of the Jamuna Bridge Project. The findings of ex-post analysis of Jamuna
Bridge confirm that improved connectivity did create economic opportunities for economic growth and
poverty reduction in the north-west region, the effects of which were much more significant than the
benefits estimated by the conventional approach of time and cost savings from the bridge. This happened
through reduction of transportation costs as well as costs in consumption and production of goods and
services. With easier access because of the bridge, farm and non-farm production had a boost as a result
of increased availability of inputs and lower input costs. The bridge provided connectivity that would
yielded multi-sectoral productivity gains through structural change in the economy.

487.     The report on Padma Bridge prepared by Design Consultants notes that its traffic model could not
model changes in land use patterns (population and employment) and the level of economic activity from
the improved accessibility to wide range of markets provided by the bridge. Here also the findings of the
ex-post impact analysis of Jamuna Bridge are applicable to Padma Bridge. The 2007 impact study of
Jamuna Bridge carried out a careful study of project villages (which were most affected by outcomes of
the bridge) and control villages (not benefiting by the bridge) concluded that per capita income of project
villages rose by 3 percent per annum; in contrast, the income in control villages increased at less than one
percent per annum during the same period. Project villages experienced greater decline both in head count
and extreme poverty compared to control villages. The decline in extreme poverty in project villages was
2.5 more than that of control villages. The study found clear evidence (as expected) that in post-Jamuna
periods, areas under perishable but high value products like vegetables, onion, spices and oilseeds,
increased in project areas by about 10 percent while the same declined in control villages by about 18
percent. The study had similar findings for cash crops in these two types of villages. Again, as expected,
average prices for in project villages rose faster than in control villages.

488.    The results of the 2007 impact study clearly establishes that Jamuna bridge had far reaching
impacts on the north-west region even much more pronounced than what was estimated through cost and
time saving analysis at the time of appraisal of the bridge. Similarly the economic opportunities, which
the Padma Bridge will particularly open up for the Southwest region, will be enormous and far-reaching
and will not be fully reflected in the benefits estimated for the bridge by the consultants using the
conventional approach of the traffic model.

489.    Given this serious limitation of the conventional approach, Computable General Equilibrium
(CGE) models were used, in addition to the traffic model. The use of these models made it possible to
estimate wider benefits of the bridge including its secondary benefits. The Padma Bridge has the added
advantage that these models were used both as ex-ante and ex-post methods of estimating wide benefits of
Jamuna Bridge. Use of these models for Jamuna Bridge gives us a useful benchmark as well as a tested
approach for estimating full benefits of the Padma Bridge.

Approach and Methodology

490.    The economic benefit of the bridge is estimated by taking into account both the direct benefits in
terms of cost and time savings of travel time and the indirect benefits in the form of structural impact on
the economy in the south-west and the rest of the economy from improved connectivity of the Southwest
Region with the central and eastern parts of the country. To estimate the direct travel benefits, a traffic
model was used. And to estimate indirect and secondary benefits of the bridge two economy wide macro
models were used.

491.    The traffic benefits are noted in another annex; so this annex only incorporates the secondary or
economy wide benefits of Padma Bridge generated by CGE models--benefits accruing from a structural
transformation of the economy and creating benefits beyond just cost and time saving in travel. The two
macro-economic models used were Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) and Computable General
Equilibrium (CGE) models.

492.     Social Accounting Matrix (SAM). The use of the SAM model was to assess the direct and
indirect income effects of a particular exogenous impact (such as the opening of the Padma Bridge) that
leads to different expenditure patterns. A SAM model is a square matrix with columns for expenditure
and rows covering income accounts. It combines input-output data with national accounts data to reflect
the circular flow of income at a particular point in time. In this context, its key use is to assess the direct
and indirect income effects of a particular exogenous impact (such as the opening of the Padma Bridge)
that leads to different expenditure patterns. For the national SAM exercise, the impact of the Padma
Bridge is represented in two alternative ways: :(i) injection of $2.1billion into the economy (taking
into account that part of the total cost of the bridge that will be injected into the economy) via
construction sector ($1.4 billion) and via services, utility, trade, transportation and food sectors ($0.7
billion) and (ii) an increase in the demand for high-value crops, electricity, and transport services. The
magnitudes of the initial increases are derived from the results of the micro-level sector and factor
impacts.

493.     The findings of the national SAM exercise would show that all the socio-economic groups benefit
from the bridge-initiated initial changes estimated for use in the simulation. One of the limitations of the
SAM model discussed above is that it assumes fixed prices and excess capacity to meet increases in
demand generated by the lower transport costs due to the Padma Bridge. However, in an increasingly
efficient market-oriented economy, the variations in prices may also be important sources of reallocation
of resources among competing activities. This then may alter the factor­level income distribution and
hence personal income distribution. Changes in personal income distribution of household groups and



                                                     140
consumer price indices may have different implications for the welfare and poverty situations of the
household groups.

494.     Computable General Equilibrium (CGE). CGE analysis also allowed for the assessment of the
impacts of exogenous shocks but within a constrained optimization framework (i.e. changes in quantity
are restricted as supplies of primary factors are fixed ­ labor, capital and land). The SAM approach does
not have capacity constraints, meaning that matching outputs are always supplied, resulting in higher
factor incomes and household consumption expenditure. The CGE approach, working with constraints,
does not generate extra income by employing additional factors of production--additional income would
come from increased productivity in use of given factor of production and diversion of factors to more
productive possibilities arising from a fall in transport costs because of the bridge. At the core of the
model is a set of equations describing the behavior of various economic agents (such as industries and
households) when faced with changes in relative prices.

495.    The elimination of a major transport barrier and the significant improvement in accessibility to
factor and product markets between Dhaka and the Southwest Region, where resources are not fully
employed, means that the SAM approach (without any capacity constraints) can be considered suitable
for modeling to quantify the income effects of the Padma Bridge. These income effects would be
additional to the value of travel time savings for passenger and freight vehicles and would come about by
the bridge providing the link between consumers and producers in a wide range of markets.

496.     Although in most cases, new infrastructure would not immediately bring a major boost in
economic activities, in the medium to longer run, reductions in the generalized costs of transport will: (i)
increase the profitability of local firms which will lead to higher retained profits, encouraging investment
in capacity expansion and increased output - economic activity in the region; (ii) result in local firms
having reduced costs and lead to a lowering of prices and an increase in output; (iii) encourage financial
institutions to expand lending to firms in the Southwest Region, as the costs of doing business for the
institutions would be lowered from the improved communications; (iv) induce the establishment of new
firms in the region through the improved competitiveness of the region as a business location, and the
need to service the increased movement of passenger buses to/from Dhaka and of trucks carrying goods
to/from India; (v) firms may also relocate to the region in response to the reduction in transport costs to
avoid the negative agglomeration effects (congestion, pollution) of locating in a place like Dhaka.

497.    It is asserted sometimes that after opening of Jamuna Bridge, the assumption of unconstrained
supply may not be as strongly applicable for Padma Bridge, as it was for Jamuna. So, in addition to SAM
model, a CGE model was used to estimate the economy wide benefits of the bridge estimated under a
constrained maximization framework. In estimating secondary (or total) benefits, the results of both
models are presented.

498.    The macro-economic models thus captured the flow of economic effects that are beyond the
reduction in travel costs. Firms respond to the costs reduction in a variety of ways, such as increasing
production, shifting to higher value-added production and expanding marketing areas. The lower transport
costs and increased accessibility to a wider range of markets and services also affect household income
and expenditure.

Simulation Design

499.    Two different simulations were conducted under these two different approaches. The results of
the simulations are different under these two approaches. In the SAM approach, the impact of the Padma
Bridge was explored either through injection of initial investment of injection of US$2.1billion into the
economy via mainly construction sector and also via services, utility, trade, transportation and food


                                                   141
sectors or through an increase in the demand for high-value crops, electricity, and transport services as
evident in Jamuna ex-post analysis. Since there are no capacity constraints, matching outputs are always
supplied (as a result of demand interventions), which resulted in higher factorial incomes and household
consumption expenditure. Both simulations using national SAM produced similar benefit streams. The
simulation set-ups for the National and the Regional SAM models through increase in demand are
provided in Table 1 below.

500.    Under the CGE framework, the simulation was performed by reducing the transport margin for
the sectors in the model. As a result of the reduction in transport margins, the incentive structure in the
economy changed which changed the relative price situation in the economy. This led to the reallocation
of resources to various producing activities. The gains are obtained by reducing existing distortions and
hence they are small. Since supplies of primary factors were fixed there is no scope of generating extra
income by employing additional factors (as was the case in the SAM approach). Furthermore, the results
of the model simulations were fed into a poverty module to estimate the impact of the bridge investment
on national as well as regional poverty levels.

Result of Macro-economic Models

501.   Wider Economic Benefits (WEB). Non-road users' benefits are derived from the simulated
outcome of national SAM model exercise. The result of this model indicates that total increase in national
GDP would be estimated at US$6,000 million considering a 31-year period (i.e. between 2015 and 2045)
with an NPV at 12% of about US$900 million. The annualized non-user or wider economic benefits
would build up slowly and would peak at an annual return of about US$300 million a year by 2032.

502.     To obtain more realistic results a constraint maximization framework, a CGE model was used to
trace the impact of the bridge on national and regional GDP. The results of the use of CGE model suggest
that in general, resources would move out of some manufacturing leading to the positive value added
growth in agriculture and manufacturing. It also appears that all households would experience a decrease
in poverty indices.

503.    Impact on Gross Output. SAM simulation shows that gross output would increase by more
than 10% compared to the base case. Among 5 major activities [agriculture, manufacturing, construction,
transport and services], largest increase of 29 percent is found for construction sector output followed by
agriculture (9.5%). Increase in other 3 categories of activities will be around 8%. Compared to national
impact, impact on the gross output of south west region would be more pronounced. For example, gross
output in agriculture in south-west would increase more than 50 percent over 31 years projected in the
regional SAM model. Table 2 presents the expected annual increase in agriculture output in south-west.

504.     Poverty Impact. Both exercises, SAM and CGE models, show a reduction in poverty in
Bangladesh after the opening of the Padma Bridge. However, the results suggest a higher magnitude of
poverty reduction under the SAM approach than the CGE approach. The reasons for obtaining different
magnitudes of poverty reduction under the two approaches lie in the fact that the impact of the Padma
Bridge intervention is explained differently by the two approaches. The SAM approach simulates impacts
entirely through changes in quantities, while the CGE, as it stands now, does the same based strictly on
changes in price. Since the ability to increase supply to Bangladeshi markets could be restricted by some
capacity constraints, the actual poverty impact of the bridge will most likely be smaller than that projected
by the SAM exercise, which assumes no capacity constraints. Conversely, the result of the CGE exercise
most likely substantially under-represent the indirect and induced effects of the Padma Bridge.
Particularly, the CGE model assumes that the Bangladeshi economy is currently functioning at full
capacity, which most likely is not the case. As such, the results of the CGE model do not take into
account that certain segments of the national economy have most likely become more productive as a
result of the Padma Bridge. The overall rate of yearly CGE are as follows:

               Table 3: Additional Reduction in Poverty because of Padma Bridge
                                  (% change from base value)
                                           National Level             Regional Level
         SAM based approach                      -0.8                      -1.0
         CGE based approach                     -0.08           No Regional CGE was used

505.     The result in Table 3 indicates that SAM based approach yields the outcome of Padma Bridge at
the national level would be to reach 1.9% per year reduction in poverty instead of 1.1%, as the present
long term trend shows. At the regional level (for the Southwest Region) the expected reduction rate would
be 2.0% per year instead of 1.0%, which is the long-term trend of reduction of poverty, according to
results of SAM.

506.    The corresponding figures from the CGE model, which accounts only for the price effect of
exogenous change, show lower impact on poverty reduction rates. The impact of the CGE model seems to
underestimate the actual impact because of underlying assumption of the CGE model about full
employment of all factors in the economy. As illustrated in ex-post impact analysis of Jamuna Bridge, the
actual impact of the bridge was closer to SAM model results. The poverty impact on different groups,
based on national SAM model, would be different and outlined in Table 4.

507.    Impact on Labor and Employment. The experience after Jamuna Bridge was that the labor
mobility across the river went down indicating increased economic activities within the local economy of
the Southwest Region. Increased farm activities--especially the increase in vegetable production--would
produce that effect. This is also expected to happen in the areas opened up by the Padma Bridge. One
simulated effect of the bridge derived by use of the national SAM was 10.2% increase in total
employment over the base level. This result was consistent with what was found as likely impact of the
bridge on national gross output.
