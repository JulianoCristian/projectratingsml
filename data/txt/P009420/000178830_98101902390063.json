extension agencies within\n            MAF; (b) intensifying extension work in 15 of the 21\n            agricultural districts in Bangladesh by providing about\n            2,270 additional EA, upgrading about 200 EA as extension\n            officers, and by hiring an additional 60 extension officers;\n            (c) providing specialized training to extension and research\n            officers; (d) improving extension and research staff\n            mobility by providing bicycles, motorcycles, and other\n            vehicles; (e) improving extension offices through new\n            construction and by rehabilitating 750 abandoned seed stores\n            as two unit housing-cum-offices for 1,500 EA; (f) improving\n            research facilities by expanding a BARI coconut research\n            station into a regional station and by minor upgrading of\n            eight other stations; (g) improving adaptive research by\n            reorganizing BARI regional research and by providing\n            research grants through BARC; and (h) providing 21 man-years\n            of technical assistance for training in the training and\n            visit system, improving research and extension coordination,\n            assisting with reorganization, and monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
