The reconstruction activities consist of\n            rehabilitation and repair of infrastructure damaged by the\n            floods and accompanying landslides, while the preventative\n            activities are designed to minimize damage otherwise likely\n            to occur during any future major rains.  The project\n            consists of the following components:  (a) repair of roads\n            and bridges; (b) repairs and dredging of drainage systems;\n            and (c) terracing, buttressing, retaining walls, and other\n            structural stabilization of steep hillsides.  It also\n            includes (d) repairs of sewerage systems, and essential\n            extension of sewerage networks; (e) improved collection and\n            disposal of solid wastes; (f) reforestation of steep\n            hillsides most likely to slide; and (g) provision of\n            minimally serviced sites for families whose homes were\n            destroyed during the floods or landslides and for families\n            needing to be resettled. Finally, the project involves (h)\n            repairs and rehabilitation of public buildings; (i) purchase\n            of imported rescue and salvage equipment; (j)\n            consultants' services and technical assistance; and\n            project administration."}, "docdt": "1988-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
