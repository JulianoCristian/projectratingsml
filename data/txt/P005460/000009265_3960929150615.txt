MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A RURAL BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Kingdom of Morocco for US$145 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed investment loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years
maturity and would help finance the Government's Rural Basic Education
Development Project. The project would be cofinanced by the African Development
Bank in the amount of US$45 million equivalent.
2.       Background Morocco's outward-oriented growth prospects and its efforts
to reduce poverty remain handicapped by widespread and, regrettably, rising
illiteracy (now about 55% for men and 78% for women). Basic education enrollment,
the main engine of emancipation, expanded very rapidly between 1960 and 1980.
Since 1980, however, the school-age population has increased by an average of
2.4% a year, but school attendance growth has slowed down to 2%. Enrollment rates
have therefore decreased: they now stand at only 50% at the end of the primary
cycle, well below lower-middle- income country comparators. Within this disturbing
general trend, there are alarming gender and regional disparities: the primary
completion rate in rural areas (1989/90) is 25% overall, as against 87% in urban
areas, and only 13% of rural girls of the relevant ages, as against 85% of their
urban counterparts, were still in primary school.
3.       Resource allocation issues,   In an effort to stabilize its economy,
Morocco embarked on an austerity program in the 80s, which resulted in
substantial real per capita budget reductions, including in the education sector.
The budget share allocated to that sector, however, did not diminish, and
education continued to receive about 30% of the Government's recurrent budget.
Only a tiny fraction of this, however, goes on critical non-salary items for
basic education, such as boarding and canteen scholarships which encourage
attendance by disadvantaged students, atnd educational materials or fuel for
school inspectors' vehicles which contribute to quality improvement. Until
recently, families bore the full cost of most basic textbook and supplies
purchases. Within the basic education budget, real teacher salaries remained
roughly constant throughout the 80s but the wage bill grew by over 4% p.a. (twice
as fast as enrollments) as rural expansion implied somewhat lower pupil:teacher
ratios. Meanwhile, the real boarding scholarship allocation fell by more than
half, resulting in reduced access for rural students. The internal distribution
of the education investment budget is an added concern. Strong social pressure
for urban secondary and higher education compressed the share of basic education
in the MOE investment budget from 85% to 75% during the 80s.
4.       The special problems of rural education.  In the 80s, universal basic
education was rapidly becoming a reality in the cities, marked by very little
gender disparity. Major additional improvements in school attendance nation-
wide had to come from previously underserved rural populations with quite
different characteristics.   The education system, with hindsight, failed to
recognize to what extent this new client group required specific measures to
generate effective demand and tailor services accordingly. Efforts concentrated
mainly on building schools closer to rural settlements, undoubtedly a strong
contributing factor to initial enrollments, albeit at rising unit costs. These



- 2 -
efforts, however, were not complemented by programs specifically designed to
increase participation: awareness campaigns to promote the direct and indirect
benefits of education, particularly for girls, were only started in 1989;
availability of affordable educational materials and textbooks remained sporadic;
selection criteria for student teachers gave no weight to readiness to serve in
rural areas, and the lack of career or housing incentives for such assignments
resulted in excessive teacher turnover; only a small proportion of rural schools
had canteens providing a free meal, and even fewer had safe water, sanitation
or electricity; and the higher opportunity cost of child labor at home or in the
fields was not adequately factored into school schedules and curricula.
5.       Middle schools: the missing bridge.  Half the population Is rural, yet
only 7% of middle school (basic education grades 6 to 9) places are in rural
areas. This means that a rural fifth-grader, especially the o..e girl in eight
to get that far, and her family, must overcome enormous barriers - logistical,
financial, psychological - if she is to capitalize on this early learning and
aim to complete the basic cycle, let alone reach for other opportunities
contingent on completion. The immediate hurdle involves uprooting the student
30 miles or more, usually without the option of public transport.   This is
sustainable only for the few who have close relatives or access to supervised
public boarding places in the city. The labor market payoff to these clear-
cut costs and risks is distant and uncertain, whilst the daughter's contrib-
ution to the household is tangible, immediate, and coming close to its peak.
In the home vicinity, meanwhile, there are few if any integrated role-models of
successful school graduates beyond the primary level, especially female school
teachers, to help balance these disincentives. In sum, when the whole education
and career system, beyond the village school, is seen as a loaded lottery, it
is hardly surprising that rural parents' perception of the returns to basic
education diverge from the longer-term returns to society, and therefore that
primary attendance can lag behind available places.
6.       Government Strategy.  The underlying problems at the primary cycle are
being addressed under the FY89 Rt:ral Primary Education Project, which focuses
on increasing access and participation in rural areas through a joint program
of school construction and targeted measures to promote demand, including text-
book programs, awareness campaigns targeted on female education, housing and
recruitment incentives, and improvements in school food, water and sanitation
conditions. The Government has also commissioned a major operations research
study, supported by the 1990/91 LSMS (Living Standard Measurement Survey) and
a complementary Bank-executed Japanese technical assistance grant, designed to
quantify school and home-environment constraints to basic school attendance,
especially for rural girls, and identify, prioritize and test additional policy
measures.
7.       Moreover, in preparation for a likely second Structural Adjustment
operation, Government has agreed in principle inter alia to very substantial
real increases in non-salary operating budgets for basic education and to review
the structure of the civil service, numerically dominated by primary and
secondary teachers.   This sharply reverses the negative trend described in
para. 3 above.   Government is also committed to restructure public higher
education and encourage private post-secondary education institutions, thereby
diversifying funding sources for growth of this sub-sector and taking budgetary



- 3 -
pressure off basic education. The remaining major building block of the strategy
is a comprehensive middle school development program, targeted on rural areas,
supported through the proposed project.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Universal basic education is the
centerpiece of the fight against poverty through productivity, hence the Bank's
key long-term country operational goal. This implies sustained Bank involve-
ment spanning several phases of support over at least two decades, given the
enormity of the challenge and the complexity of the technical and social
constraints to be overcome. The proposed operation flows directly from experi-
ence with the FY86 Education Sector Reform Program, which set the policy
framework for basic education, and the above-mentioned Rural Primary Education
Project, which covers investment needs at that level through 1994 and will
sharply increase the numbers of qualified candidates for middle school. Con-
versely, without an accessible rural middle school option, the credibility of
the entire basic education cycle would suffer. The Bank's sustained presence
was instrumental in triggering a renewed medium-term public expenditure program
for middle schools by Government (para. 12), strongly focussed on the needs of
rural populations, and girls in particular. It also helped underpin a second
phase of African Development Bank (ADB) cofinancing for this sub-sector.
Finally, the proposed operation complements the social expenditure goals of the
proposed Second Structural Adjustment Loan and a follow-up project aimed at
reorganizing higher education finances, under active preparation (para. 7).
9.       Prolect Objectives.  The objectives of the project are: a) to promote
equality of educational opportunity at the middle school level by improving
access and participation, particularly to deprived sectors of the population
such as those in rural areas and especially females; and b) to enhance the
teaching-learning environment by contributing to the improvement of basic
education quality, nationwide.
10.      Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the proposed project
would finance: (i) the construction, equipping and furnishing of about 250 middle
schools in rural areas, each accommodating some 360 students in a cluster of 9
classrooms, close to targeted communities chosen on the basis of primary school
graduate demand projections and availability of supporting services (roads,
water, electricity).   Design standards for construction and equipment were
reviewed in detail to minimize costs, yet provide adequate flexibility to school
districts who need to adapt to local climate and terrain. All schools would have
teacher housing as well as canteen facilities accommodating one in three
students, and about one out of eight schools would have boarding facilities; (ii)
the rehabilitation and partial reequipment of about 100 dilapidated middle
schools; (iii) canteen and boarding scholarships, which would be provided on an
equal basis (based on actual demand) for boys and girls;  (iv) educational
materials and textbooks for all participating schools, to be provided free or
at nominal user fees to students; (v) vehicles for inspectors and a program to
strengthen curriculum development; (vi) the introduction of a national
educational achievement assessment program; (vii) a two-phase study to measure
the impact of factors affecting middle school participation in rural areas; and
(viii) a comprehensive in-service teacher training program.

1U.      Costs and Financint.   The total project cost of US$238.0 million
fquivalent net of taxes would be financed as follows: (a) the proposed Bank loan
of US$145.0 million would finance 611 of project costs; (b) the proposed ADB loan
would finance an additional US$45.0 million equivalent or 19X of total project
costs; and (c) the Government would finance US$48.0 million equivalent or 20X
of project costs.  The Government would also finance about US$45 million in
direct and indirect taxes. The proposed IBRD and ADB loans would finance 100%
of the foreign exchange component (US$101.6 million) and the IBRD loan would also
finance 65% of local costs (US$88.4 million) excluding taxes. Net incremental
recurrent costs for the last year of the Project (1996) are estimated at US$25
million (in 1990 terms), which represents about 41 of the 1990 MOE recurrent
budget for secondary education and less than 1X of the 1990 Government recurrent
budget. A breakdown of costs and financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement are included in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank operations in Morocco
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Further details are included in
the Staff Appraisal Report No. 8936-MOR of January 28, 1991, being distributed
separately.
12.      Asreed Action. Before negotiations, the Government confirmed, through
a latter of intent, its commitment to carrying out a national program to develop
upper basic education in both rural and urban areas and to allocate sufficient
budgetary and manpower resources to this program.   It also designated MOE's
Planning Directorate as project coordinating unit.  During negotiations, the
Government agreed that: (i) before loan effectiveness, it would satisfy the
conditions of effectiveness of the ADB Loan Agreement (other than effectiveness
of the Bank Loan Agreement); (ii) no later than December 31, 1991, they would
provide, for Bank review and approval, a detailed plan for the provision of
textbooks; (iii) a two-phased study would be carried out to assess the impact
of measures to reduce gender and geographic disparities in access to middle
schools. The first phase would be completed no later than December 31, 1992 and
the second phase would be completed no later than December 31, 1995; (iv) no
later than August 31st of each year, the Borrower would review with the Bank
progress achieved in the upper basic education program and data on performance
indicators; and (v) a technical unit would be established in each region, staffed
with at least one architect or technical agent, one engineer and support
personnel, prior to launching bids for the construction of middle schools in
that region. As part of its reporting requirements, the Borrower would also
furnish by August 31st of each year the proposed investment and recurrent budgets
of the Ministry of Education for the next year.
13.      Benefits.  Increasing opportunities to complete nine years of basic
education of better quality would enable more of the country's youth to meet
the prerequisites for acquisition of higher level skills and entry into the
modern work place. Concentrating on increasing enrollments in upper basic edu-
cation in rural areas, particularly for girls, would render the provision of
education more equitable. Expanding and improving education of girls would con-
tribute positively to important social indicators, especially the reduction of
adult female illiteracy and the higher fertility and infant mortality rates
associated with it. In quantitative terms, the benefits would include an in-
crease of about 120,000 at full capacity in the number of students enrolled in
upper basic education in rural areas. This increase is very significant when



- 5 -
compared to the 1989-90 total enrollments in rural areas of less than 52,000
students: the expectation is that almost one-third of rural primary school
leavers, four times today's proportion, will find p.laces near their homes.
Additional benefits include enhancement of educational quality student learning
as a result of in-service teacher training programs, better instructional
materials, improved supervision, and introduction of achievement assessment
activities.
14.      Risks.  The main risk lies in tight public finance constraints which
will exert constant downward pressure on low-visibility rural basic education
spending, in spite of solemn commitments to the contrary.  To guard against
this, external financing will concentrate heavily on project components aimed
at increasing access (construction and equipping of new schools, rehabilitation
of existing schools, provision of textbooks, educational materials and boarding
and canteen scholarships). Government's project contribution will concentrate
on incremental teacher salaries and in-service teacher training: the Government
will be the sole financier of its urban middle schools development program.
Moreover, the proposed FY93 Higher Education Funding Reform Project, by promoting
cost-recovery mechanisms and the expansion of private education, should lessen
the risk of insufficient funding for basic education by creating an outlet for
excess demand for higher levels.
15.      Some residual uncertainty inevitably remains as to the strength of
demand for basic education on the part of targeted groups - disadvantaged rural
populations and, more specifically, girls - for whom the schooling decision is
still imperfectly understood,  in Morocco as elsewhere.   This uncertainty,
however, only affects part of the expected growth in rural enrollments, since
the rest reflects retention in their environment of rural students who would
otherwise try to enrol in urban schools (but thereafter often drop out). Also,
the project includes a number of measures directly aimed at encouraging
participation: closer schools, boarding and canteen scholarships and provision
of textbooks free of charge or at nominal fee. Finally, lower-than-projected
demand would be identified through performance indicators monitored in the
context of annual reviews and school construction programs for subsequent years
would be adjusted to maximize utilization of existing schools.
16.      Environmental Impact.   The Project was reviewed under the Bank's
Environmental Assessment procedures and determined to be in Category C, for
operations which do not result in a significant environmental impact.
17.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
