Dear Mr. Sariev,  
 
Re: 
Restructuring of KYRGYZ-Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Project 
(Grant Number H203 KG) 
 
We refer to the Financing Agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic (the 
“Recipient”) 
and the International Development Association (“World Bank”), for the Avian Influenza 
Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (“the Project”), dated April 
27, 2006.  Further reference is made to the letter of the Deputy Minister of Finance for the 
Recipient, dated February 16, 2009, requesting a restructuring of the Project.  
 
We are pleased to inform you that the World Bank has agreed to the following 
changes: 
 
1. 
The Project Development Objective in the first paragraph of Schedule 1 to the 
said Financing Agreement is amended to read as follows: 
“The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in minimizing the threat in 
the Kyrgyz Republic posed by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) 
infection as well as other poultry and livestock diseases and to prepare for the 
control and response to an influenza pandemic and other zoonotic or infectious 
disease emergencies in humans.” 
2. 
Please be advised that it is not possible to consolidate the expenditures into three 
Categories as requested in your letter.  Since disbursements have already taken place 
under some of the categories, the amounts disbursed should remain as already 
disbursed.  As a result thereof, the table appearing in paragraph A.2 of Section IV of 
Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is amended to read as follows:
