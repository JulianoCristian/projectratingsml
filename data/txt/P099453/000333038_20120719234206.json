Project for the\n            Kyrgyz Republic Latvia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a global template and coordination with\n            specialized agencies can enable rapid, good project design.\n            The GPAI (Global Program for Avian Influenza and Human\n            Pandemic Preparedness and Response) was in place and was\n            used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The\n            existence of a sound, global plan ensures that an effective\n            project can be formulated rapidly. WHO (World Health\n            Organization) and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and\n            Prevention) gave technical assurance for project\n            implementation by working together with the World\n            Bank's implementing partners and agencies. This lesson\n            will be applicable to a wide range of projects, not just\n            those in the health sector. In the context of weak\n            governance and institutions, where the capacity building may\n            take a longer and concerted effort, it is important to have\n            step-by-step approach, to ensure higher effectiveness and\n            chances of sustainability of achievements. The project\n            started off by building the legal framework and\n            institutional capacity for addressing possible Avian\n            Influenza emergencies. However, minor subsequent adjustments\n            then allowed the project to easily initiate work on other\n            priority zoo-noses, which allowed for a complex approach to\n            addressing major animal and human health threats. Further\n            work, building on the achievements of this project, is\n            implemented by Agricultural Investment and Services Project\n            (AISP), with animal vaccinations and other more practical\n            applications of the Avian Influenza (AI) project results. In\n            addition to the long-term investments supported by the\n            project, it is necessary to ensure financing for additional\n            operating costs in the future (for laboratory consumables,\n            vaccines, drugs, etc.) to guarantee operation of the\n            equipment and systems. In absence of an operational budget\n            the sustainability of the financed equipment is\n            significantly diminished. It is necessary to agree on a\n            budget allocation from the government for these purposes, or\n            find an alternative source of financing. A large number of\n            indicators were an issue with many AI projects given the\n            complexity of issues these projects were covering and the\n            speed with which these projects were prepared. This project\n            had original 31 indicators, which were then combined and/or\n            dropped to streamline the monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system. However, this lead to a lot of confusion\n            on the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) side, as well as\n            deficiencies in the M&E system and poor monitoring of\n            results on the Bank's side. Therefore, it is suggested\n            to design a sound M&E system, to avoid the need for\n            (sometimes several) revisions of the indicators, causing\n            possible confusion."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
