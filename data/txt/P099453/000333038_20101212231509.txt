                                           RESTRUCTURING PAPER


1.          The closing date for Kyrgyz Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
            Response Project (IDA Grant Number H203 KG) (P099453) will be extended from December
            30, 2010 until December 31, 2011.
2.          Project objectives, revised earlier in 2010 to expand Project scope,i continue to be attainable,
            with noteworthy results and positive outcomes already achieved. Project implementation is
            progressing well, reflected in a consistently satisfactory rating for implementation progress
            over the Project life. $3.19 million or 73% of total IDA grant funds have disbursed.
            Financial management performance is satisfactory with good internal controls and there are
            no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied with.
3.          The proposed extensionii is necessary to allow additional time for remaining project activities
            to be completed. Implementation was delayed by a protracted process to complete the earlier
            Project restructuring compounded by some disruption of Project activities due to civil unrest
            in 2010. The Government has revised the Project Action Plan to reflect an updated
            implementation schedule to complete Project activities by December 31, 2011. The project
            team fully supports the request as the proposed extension would provide the time needed to
            fully achieve Project objectives.
4.          This will be the first extension of the project.
