was satisfactory; bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned include:\n            (i) One-tranche operations are best to address concrete,\n            up-front policy decisions in an environment where the track\n            record of reform is still limited or where the information\n            base on the country is rudimentary. (ii) In an environment\n            characterized by government's weak institutional and\n            implementation capacity and an unstable political situation,\n            it is important to keep the reform program design simple,\n            and the objectives and the timetable for their\n            implementation realistic. (iii) The design of a reform\n            program under conditions of political uncertainty and\n            instability requiring a high degree of consensus building\n            should include provisions for a meaningful and sustained\n            communication effort."}, "docdt": "1998-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
