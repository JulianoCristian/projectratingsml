effort.  The\n            program aims at quickly restoring macroeconomic balance and\n            confidence in the economy, improving the management of\n            public resources, and strengthening the policy framework for\n            efficient private sector growth, both through measures that\n            could be quickly implemented and by starting a medium term\n            process of public sector reform.  The specific components of\n            Niger's adjustment program supported by the project\n            include:  (1) measures simplifying the tax system,\n            strengthening tax administration, and widening the tax base;\n            (2) reducing the share of the wage bill, and subsidies and\n            transfers in current expenditures favoring the priority\n            areas of primary education, basic health care and road\n            maintenance; and (3) implementing the public enterprises\n            privatization program."}, "docdt": "1997-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
