Development Project (SFD III) is to\n            help Yemen respond to the global food crisis which is having\n            a significant impact on the Yemeni population. Yemen needs\n            the Bank's support to cope with the crisis because of\n            the limited potential for supply response, the impact of\n            food prices on poverty, and the increasing risk of food\n            riots. Yemen's limited endowment of water and\n            cultivable land diminishes agricultural supply response to\n            higher food grain prices. In this context, the Government\n            has requested Bank support in a letter dated May 18, 2008.\n            In response to the Government's request, additional\n            financing will support a workfare program implemented by SFD\n            that will channel cash into the hands of the poor to help\n            them cope with the food price emergency. In parallel, a\n            small component of the additional financing will support the\n            improvement of a sustainable cash-based safety net that\n            would further mitigate risks, including the adverse impacts\n            of high and more volatile food prices on poverty. The\n            financing from the Global Food Crisis Response Program\n            (GFCRP) Trust Fund facility will provide immediate support\n            to two sets of complementary activities to be undertaken as\n            additional financing to the current Third Social Fund for\n            Development Project: (i) community-based labor intensive\n            works through a well-tested mechanism, the highly-successful\n            SFD, which will finance activities in some of the poorest\n            parts of the country; and (ii) support to the Social Welfare\n            Fund (SWF) to carry out a national survey to identify the\n            poorest Yemenis suffering from high food and fuel prices in\n            order to improve targeting and expand the program, and to\n            complete a revised targeting system that will increase the\n            share of cash transfers received by the poorest\n            beneficiaries, improving the ability of the program to\n            reduce poverty immediately. The support to SWF will\n            complement the technical assistance being provided by the\n            European commission. The project will build on the success\n            of the ongoing third phase of the SFD operation, and will\n            continue to support the SFD's delivery of social\n            services using participatory approaches. Overall, SFD\n            project progress is satisfactory, and provides an excellent\n            opportunity to successfully implement the additional funds."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
