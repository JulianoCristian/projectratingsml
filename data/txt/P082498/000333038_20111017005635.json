Social Fund for\n            Development Project in the Republic of Yemen,TFS53450-YEMEN SOCIAL FUND FOR\n            DEVELOPMENT (SFD) III", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Social Fund for\n            Development Project for Yemen were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: building\n            working relationships based on trust and confidence of local\n            authorities at governorate and district levels is essential\n            to the decentralization process and to SFD's (Social\n            Fund for Development Agency) efforts to promote effective\n            civic participation in local development. Clear\n            communication of the distinct roles and functions of local\n            government and civil society and the way in which they are\n            brought together in a participatory process is essential to\n            bring about recognition and legitimacy of the bottom-up\n            approach of development process. Contributions, however,\n            should not impose a heavy burden on communities, especially\n            low-income households. During the last year of\n            implementation of the third phase, SDF adopted a unified\n            approach which limits community contribution to 5 percent\n            and exempts poor people who are not able to pay. This new\n            approach is expected to be fully implemented during the\n            fourth phase. Building the capacity of government apparatus\n            and of communities to play a responsible role and demand\n            accountability from government are key elements to building\n            governance structures at decentralized and community levels.\n            SFD's capacity building interventions and proven\n            instruments that provide for a demand-driven approach,\n            pro-poor allocation of resources, use of verified data for\n            decision-making, participatory approaches, and transparency\n            at all levels, help promote solid systems of governance that\n            underscore State Building. Implementation of innovative\n            pilots can help refine methodologies, provide incentives for\n            stakeholders to become active partners in the pilot, and\n            provide lessons for scaling up activities. SFD pilots to\n            promote rural girls' education, inclusive education for\n            groups with special needs, and integrated intervention\n            programs all contribute to broader education sector goals\n            and priorities for improving equitable access to education.\n            Similarly, SFD's pilot of the public workfare program\n            has helped to provide a safety net to mitigate the effects\n            of food price increases on poor households, while at the\n            same time enabling the creation of physical infrastructure\n            investments that become community assets."}, "docdt": "2010-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
