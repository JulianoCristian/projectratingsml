IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA: FIFTH (BOMBAY AND MADRAS) POPULATION PROJECT
(CR 1931 -IN)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fifth India Population Project,
for which Credit No. 1931-IN in the amount US$57 million was approved on June 21, 1988. The
credit was closed on March 31, 1996, after a three-month extension of the closing date. US$51.17
million, or 90 percent of the credit, was disbursed. The undisbursed balance was cancelled
effective August 26, 1996.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's implementation completion review mission
from November 27 to December 4, 1995. It is based on material in the project files, field visits, and
interviews with beneficiaries, project staff, Government officials and Bank staff. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's
preparation and execution. Comments were received from the Borrower on drafts of the report and
taken into account in the final version.
The cooperation and assistance of the Government of India, the Governments of
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, and the Municipal Corporations of Madras, Mumbai and Navi
Mumbai are gratefully acknowledged.
This report was prepared by Anthony R. Measham (Task Manager) and Lessel H. David
(Consultant), with technical assistance from R. Sethuraman, Ann Hammond, and Mark Schlagel.
Nira Singh and Mark Schlagel provided office technology assistance. The report was reviewed by
Richard Skolnik, Division Chief, SA2PH, and Kazuko Uchimura, Project Adviser.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA: FIFTH (BOMBAY AND MADRAS) POPULATION PROJECT
(CR 193 1 -IN)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    IDA has been involved in India's family welfare program since the early 1970s through a series
of India Population Projects (IPPs). Of the nine IPPs, five supported the program in backward and rural
districts of eight Indian states; two, including the Fifth India Population Project (IPP V), supported
urban programs, and two strengthened training in eight states. IDA is also supporting the Child
Survival and Safe Motherhood Project across the country.
Project Objectives
2.     The original objectives of IPP V were to: (a) expand family welfare services with emphasis on
maternal and child health, birth spacing, and increased use of temporary contraceptive methods; (b)
improve the quality of family welfare services; (c) strengthen the capacity of Greater Bombay, Madras
city and the Chingleput district in Tamil Nadu to plan, manage and implement family welfare programs
in urban areas; and (d) increase the participation of Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and
private medical practitioners (PMPs) in urban family welfare programs. To meet these objectives, the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) identified four components: (a) constructing, furnishing, equipping and
staffing Health Posts (HPs) and back-up units; (b) staff training; (c) reorganization of Health and
Family Welfare Bureaus, including additional manpower; and (d) assisting PVOs to operate HPs and
training PMPs in health and family welfare.
3.    Initially, IPP V was limited to operate in the areas under the Greater Bombay Municipal
Corporation (GBMC) and the Madras Municipal Corporation (MMC) and its four adjoining
municipalities. By late 1988, however, Bank and project authorities realized that significant cost
savings would accrue to the project, largely as a result of the depreciation of the Rupee against the
SDR which had been occurring since 1986. These savings could be used to broaden the project's
scope (including added service delivery activities) and geographic coverage. In response, the project
was restructured in 1990.1   Subsequently, upon official GOI and IDA approval of expansion
proposals (1992-93), the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) adjacent to Greater Bombay
and all urban areas in Tamil Nadu with a population greater than 100,000 were added to the project,
increasing the geographic scope substantially and increasing the population coverage of the project by
approximately 25 percent.
The Credit and Project Agreements were amended to increase coverage to all of the district of Chingleput and other
municipalities or urban areas of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Schedule 2 of the DCA was also revised to include Social
Marketing of Contraceptives, Compensation to Acceptors, and the construction of Family Welfare Centers.

4.     The main goal throughout the project was to improve the service delivery and outreach systems
of family welfare services in urban slum areas. While the establishment of HPs manned by suitably
qualified staff improved service delivery, the project also successfully improved the outreach system
through the use of Female Voluntary Health Workers (FVHWs) in the slum areas.
5.     The project objectives were mutually supportive and, prima facie, within the Borrower's
capacity. In a significant departure from previous IDA-financed India population projects, the project's
objectives were not expressed in terms of fertility reduction but in health services rendered to women
and children. This change appears to have contributed importantly to the success of the project.
6.     The project's financial objectives were largely fulfilled. US$51.17 million, or 90 percent of the
credit, was disbursed. The undisbursed balance was cancelled effective August 26, 1996.
Implementation Experience and Results
7.    Implementation worked well with respect to three of the project's four objectives. Service
units were established, equipped, and staffed, and services provided were of improved quality. In areas
where the project was operating from its inception, the service delivery results were closer to SAR
expectations than in those that were added later -- as expected. The expansion of the service delivery
network is likely to continue, as are the measures to increase their outreach through inter-personal
contact. Measures taken to strengthen program management, such as the reorganization of
implementing agencies and revised monitoring systems, were also successful and are likely to be
sustained. The involvement of PVOs and PMPs fell short of expectations.
8.    Three major factors contributed to the project's success. First, both states -- Maharashtra and
Tamil Nadu -- had a demonstrated capacity to manage successfully donor-assisted projects, including
those in the social sectors. Second, there was continuity of skilled program management; as the project
was in urban areas, personnel tumover was low. Third, IPP V's objectives were client-focused:
individual clients saw services as being of direct and immediate benefit to them, resulting in their active
involvement and a strong sense of satisfaction among service providers.
9.     While there was a year's delay in initiating project implementation, this was more than
compensated for by intelligent and enthusiastic commitment thereafter. The Bank provided competent
and flexible support.
10.   Service statistics indicate that the project has contributed significantly to lowered infant and
child mortality and reduced higher-order births. Definitive results will be available upon completion of
the end-line surveys.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
11.    The project's main objectives of establishing service outlets and initiating outreach activities
were well met.  The project's secondary objectives of involving PVOs, training PMPs, and
commissioning special studies in time to fine-tune implementation, were less well met. Had all the
project-related studies been completed in a timely manner and made more immediate use of, the project
and its lessons would have been considerably enriched.



- iv -
12.   The basic paradigm of service delivery, which builds on the Urban Revamping Scheme (URS),
is likely to be sustained. While the sustainability of the partnerships with PVOs and PMPs is
questionable, this is unlikely to affect the overall sustainability of the project. GOI has taken a number
of steps with IDA support to enhance the sustainability of the Family Welfare Program. The ongoing
Sixth and Seventh Population Projects are strengthening training capacity in seven states and in the
overall program; the Eighth Population Project has expanded the IPP V approach to four more major
cities; and the Ninth Population Project is enhancing the MCH strategy in the states of Assam,
Karnataka, and Rajasthan. On a national scale, the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Project, which
ended on September 30, 1996, has provided further IDA support for the broader approach to MCH and
family planning. And the proposed Reproductive and Child Health Project, scheduled for appraisal in
early 1997, will further expand the service paradigm pioneered in IPP V. Finally, the GOI-Bank
collaboration on sector work, culminating in the June 1995 report (India's Family Welfare Program:
Toward a Reproductive and Child Health Approach - Report No. 14644-IN), describes the paradigm
shift in the program's strategy.
13.    The first lesson learned is that quality Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and family planning
services can be provided to urban slum populations in India, and the choice of implementing agency is
an important determinant of success. The density of service outlets and outreach worker per unit of
population followed by URS and implemented in IPP V appears optimal. The second lesson learned is
that a client-focused MCH project approach can work well in India. The emphasis on delivering
services seen as of direct and immediate benefit both involved beneficiaries and gave providers
immense satisfaction. The third lesson learned is that allotting a largely subordinate role to the private
sector can lead to disappointing results. Ways to bring about a more equitable partnership between
official and non-official agencies need to be further explored.
Assessment of Outcome
14.   Project outcome is rated "satisfactory", based on the successful achievement of key objectives.
The project clearly made a strategic contribution toward the gradual shift of the Family Welfare
Program from a top-down, demographically-driven approach to a broader, reproductive and child
health care approach.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA: FIFTH (BOMBAY AND MADRAS) POPULATION PROJECT
(CR 1931-IN)
PART I: Project Implementation Assessment
1.    IDA has assisted India's family planning (later, family welfare) program since the early 1970s
through a series of India Population Projects (IPPs). The first four IPPs supported the Government of
India's (GOI) Model Plan: a paradigm of service outlets and field workers to strengthen health and
family welfare services in rural and backward districts.
2.    The Fifth India Population Project (IPP V) was directed to two major cities and supported the
Urban Revamping Scheme (URS), launched in 1984 to strengthen urban health and family welfare
services. While the cities were comparatively well-endowed with health facilities, these facilities were
located at random and neglected the slums that absorb most of the increasing number of rural migrants.
URS sought to correct this imbalance and to provide outreach through field staff, a new activity for
urban service programs in India.
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
3.    IPP V's operations were directed to India's second and fourth largest urban agglomerates:
Bombay (Maharashtra) and Madras (Tamil Nadu). Each of these urban agglomerates comprises a
major municipality coterminous with a metropolitan district and is ringed by smaller municipalities in
adjoining districts. The project initially covered only the Greater Bombay Municipal Corporation
(GBMC) and the Madras Municipal Corporation (MMC) and four smaller municipalities in the
adjoining Chingleput district. The amendment to the Credit Agreement carried out in 1990 enhanced
service delivery activities and added to the project's geographic coverage all of the district of
Chingleput and other municipalities or urban areas of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  Expansion
activity in new areas did not, however, become visible until mid-1993, soon after expansion proposals
had been approved by GOI and IDA (1992-93). The approved expansion areas included, in Bombay,
the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation and, in Tamil Nadu, four additional municipal corporations
and 19 municipalities (Table 1). The final expansion increased the population coverage of the project
by about 25 percent.
4.    Thus, in Maharashtra, two autonomous corporations in Bombay were supported, whereas, in
Tamil Nadu, 24 municipalities across the state, including in Madras, were included, most of which
were administered directly by the state government. While the two municipal corporations were the
major players in the Bombay region, in Madras/Tamil Nadu, the state government had the dominant
role. This difference, as discussed below (paras. 24, 26), had implications for project implementation
and sustainability.

5.      Specific objectives: Within the overall framework of URS, four components were identified
for IPP V support:
(a)    Service delivery expansion, by constructing, equipping, and staffing health posts (HPs) and
back-up maternal and child care facilities;
(b)    Quality improvement, by establishing training cells to plan and coordinate training;
(c)    Management improvement, by restructuring the administrative line organization, strengthening
administration by adding posts, instituting management information and evaluation systems
(MIES), establishing information, education and communications (IEC) cells, and
commissioning special studies; and
(d)    Increased private sector involvement, by grants to Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) for
operating selected health posts and collaborating in the design of IEC materials, and by
enlisting the cooperation of private medical practitioners (PMPs), including training programs
for them.
6.     The expected outcomes were expressed in terms of: (a) facilities to be created; and (b) services
to be delivered, as measured by increases in contraceptive prevalence, with emphasis on the use of
reversible methods, maternal care and immunization coverage. In the case of (a) and (b) the
expected levels of performance were specified and met substantially. The SAR did not specify any
measures of quality.
7.     Three types of service facilities were specified in the SAR: health posts (HPs), post-partum
centers (PPCs) and pediatric units (PUs) for children and neonates. In Madras, 25 zonal offices were
also to be created; though originally intended as administrative units, when operation theaters and
wards were added, they functioned as referral service centers. The number of facilities to be established
increased as new areas were added following approval of expansion proposals (Table 2).

B. Achievement of Objectives
8.     The project met fully its objectives of establishing facilities and providing services. Service
delivery and demographic targets were met to a substantial degree, and service quality improved. The
training and management improvement components were carried out as planned. The monitoring and
evaluation. special studies, and IEC components were carried out largely as planned, with varying
degrees of effectiveness. The component concerning private sector and NGO involvement fell short of
expectations in both cities.
9.     Physical Objectives. The project achieved the physical objectives of service facilities
established, with some modifications reflecting actual needs. In Bombay, against SAR estimates of 195
HPs, 176 are functioning (56 pre-existing and 120 added). The GBMC scaled down the number of HPs
as it felt that the projected population by the year 2000 would be 12, not 13, million. Similarly, due to
"need-based reorganization", the SAR estimate of 152 HPs for Madras and suburbs was scaled down to
140, which included the construction of 95 new health posts and the conversion to health posts of 45
existing, poorly functioning Urban Family Welfare Centers. In both Bombay and Madras, secondary-
level facilities exceeded SAR estimates since clients preferred better-equipped facilities.
10.    Service outlets were staffed with clinical personnel without delay. For outreach workers, there
was a delay of two years in Bombay as female multi-purpose health workers (FMPWs) were not
available and had to be recruited and undergo the mandatory two-year auxiliary nurse-midwife (ANM)
training. At first, project authorities were unenthusiastic about using female voluntary health workers
(FVHWS), as advocated by the Bank and included in the project. As such, no FVHWS were initially
introduced, either in Bombay or in Tamil Nadu. When, and largely at the Bank's further insistence,
they were introduced in Bombay and their utility became evident, not only were they institutionalized



- 4 -
in Bombay, they were also extended to Madras. In Bombay they were paid Rs. 200 per month, later
raised to Rs. 500. In Madras, FVHWs are indeed voluntary and receive no payment for their services.
11.    Project service delivery was met to a substantial degree; the notable exception was in growth
monitoring. For Madras, the reported performance on this parameter is half that of SAR expectations;
GBMC did not collect these data. Program administrators explained that the Integrated Child
Development Services (ICDS) program met this need in both cities but ICDS could not provide
detailed data. The one demographic target, for birth order, was also met to a substantial degree.
12.    The service delivery targets for Madras and Bombay were largely achieved, especially in the
case of Madras, as shown in Table 3. Performance of the geographical areas that were added to the
project naturally lagged behind the performance of those areas included originally. However, available
data suggest that their rate of progress was faster than in the original areas -- evidence, perhaps, of
learning from the earlier experience.

13.    Quality Improvement. In the absence of any formal, independent evaluation, it is not possible
to judge definitively if the quality of services improved over the project period. It would be facile to
assess quality solely from service delivery performance, nor do field visits provide a sufficient basis.
Nevertheless, project officials, clients, and Bank staff are unanimous that service quality increased
substantially.
14.    Training. The training component was carried out as planned and appeared to contribute
importantly to the achievement of project objectives. The SAR considered training as the key



intervention to improve quality, and training cells were established in GBMC, MMC, and the IPP V
directorate in Tamil Nadu. A substantial amount of training involved basic studies for ANMs,
supplemented by three months of urban-based field training. The training cells helped to focus on in-
service training, which otherwise would have been neglected. They also did well to draw in training
associated with national programs, such as immunization, child survival and safe motherhood, which
usually reach rural but not urban areas. Analysis of training reports shows that in-service training was
spread evenly across the trainee universe, and analysis of training content shows that it was sufficiently
hands-on for clinical skill development.
15.   No definitive judgment is possible on the effectiveness of the training. Though program
administrators paid considerable attention to training and were pleased with the results, an impartial
assessment is lacking. Furthermore, a project of this size and duration, especially as it was breaking
new ground (urban areas) would have profited from an initial and rigorous training needs assessment
(TNA) and a longer-term strategy for in-service training. While the SAR did specify training areas, a
TNA would have validated these from the trainees' perspective and helped in designing specific
programs. In Madras, a TNA was done almost half-way through the project and limited to the areas
added then. While a TNA for Bombay was done earlier on, its quality and relevance are doubtful. The
supervision mission of April 1993 asked that it be repeated; it never was.
16.   Management Improvement. The project implementation organization in each city was
restructured as agreed during negotiations. A unified command structure was introduced, spans of
control reduced, and staff and line functions separated. In Bombay, the span of control of the executive
health officer was made much more manageable. In Madras, MMC's Child Welfare Unit was merged
with that of family welfare giving the latter, inter alia, a more client-friendly identity.
17.   The additional posts recommended in the SAR were created and filled, albeit with about a
year's delay in GBMC. In Bombay, these were filled by medical officers of GBMC, whereas in Madras
the state Directorate of Health and Family Welfare's (DHFW) larger pool was tapped for management
information and evaluation systems (MIES), infornation, education and communications (IEC), and
training, giving it an edge over Bombay in terms of specialized manpower.
18.   Monitoring and evaluation cells were created as planned in the Public Health Department of
GBMC and in the IPP V directorate in Tamil Nadu. In Bombay, a consultant was appointed and an
MIES designed and introduced. There was some difficulty in filling the posts of computer operators. In
Madras, posts were filled without delay by deputations from the DHFW. In both regions, extensive
training had been done, and the system functioned smoothly as far as the flow of instruments and their
analysis were concerned. Although the data were used at the apex level for reordering priorities, there is
little evidence that they served the needs of middle-level management and field operatives for their
own micro-planning. To this extent, the MIES tended to centralize planning and control at the cost of
localized outreach approaches.
19.   Special Studies. All of the planned studies were completed, as shown in Part II, Table 6.
Baseline and community needs assessment studies were done. However, with the exception of NMMC,
they were delayed to the point that they could not serve their intended purpose. None of these studies
was repeated for the areas added in Tamil Nadu. Mid-term evaluations were more timely. Apart from
these and other mandatory studies, such as assessing training and IEC needs, only two other studies
were undertaken. With few exceptions, the studies tended to be more descriptive than analytical. It is



- 6 -
for this reason, as well as the fact that they were delayed, that evidence of the influence of studies on
implementation strategies is difficult to find.
20.   Information, education and communications (IEC) activities were well supported by the IEC
cells and commendable for the volume of materials produced, the quality of their production, and the
energy with which they were disseminated. Several innovations were introduced to disseminate IEC
materials. In Madras, barber shops were used to reach males. In Bombay, the use of street plays, a
newsletter to medical practitioners, and information counters at all offices of GBMC were introduced.
However, as a senior administrator pointed out, most of the IEC content was based on the provider's
rather than the client's perception of needs. As such, the messages were more exhortative than
educational and thus less likely to lead to sustained attitudinal and behavioral change. Furthermore,
there was no systematic media planning.
21.    Private Sector and PVO Involvement. This component fell short of expectations in both cities.
The operation of some HPs was handed over to PVOs but discussions with program administrators and
PVOs suggest that the involvement was more pro forma than out of conviction that PVOs would
contribute much. No special accommodation was made to meet PVOs' needs. Efforts to involve PMPs
did not yield significant results. Their training needs were not assessed, nor was there much evidence of
involving local action groups. On the other hand, the collaboration with one private industry in Bombay
to promote health and family welfare among its employees and to support IEC efforts was successful.
22.   Financial Objectives.  In 1995, GOI increased the rupee amounts sanctioned for Bombay,
Madras and other Tamil Nadu cities, with Bank approval, in order to take advantage of exchange rate
savings. GOI increased the sanction for Bombay from Rs.48 crores to Rs.71 crores, and for Madras
and other Tamil Nadu cities from Rs.69 crores to Rs.89 crores. The project's financial objectives were
ultimately largely fulfilled: US$51.17 million, or 90 percent of the credit, was disbursed. The
undisbursed balance was cancelled effective August 26, 1996.
23.   Disbursement Profile. In October 1989, GOI requested that the third, fourth and fifth
population projects be restructured to include additional family welfare activities in the scope of the
projects. The Development Credit Agreements (DCAs) for all three projects were amended accordingly
on February 9, 1990. Subsequently, GOI submitted expenditure claims totaling US$29.6 million under
IPP V. This amount was disbursed. However, in view of Bank concerns regarding the eligibility for
disbursement of some of this amount, a special audit was requested and carried out in 1992. As a result,
US$15.3 million of the US$29.6 million was disallowed and refunded by GOI to the Bank in April
1994. These expenditure claims and the subsequent refund account for the unusual disbursement profile
are seen in Part II Table 4.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
24.   The location of the project. i.e., the states chosen and being confined to urban areas, was a
major advantage. IPP V operated in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, two states notable for their good
record in implementing projects, including those in the social sectors. Both states are socially well
developed compared to others in India, ranking among the first four in female literacy, low fertility, and
reach of health services. Furthermore, in these two states, the rural total fertility rate is only ten per cent
higher than urban; in most others, it is 30 percent higher. As the overwhelming majority of rural in-
migrants were from within the state, even in Bombay, where the beneficiary needs assessment showed



that 68.9 percent of the migrants were from Maharashtra, the convergence of rural and urban fertility
was to IPP V's advantage. Furthermore, IPP V being confined to cities, and largely the state capitals,
helped in two other ways: (a) the sheer logistics of civil works, performance monitoring, and
communications were less formidable than they would have been in rural areas and backward districts;
and (b) staff turnover was low, as those deployed in cities are less inclined to seek relocation than those
in rural areas.
25.   The choice of project objectives for IPP V also contributed to its successful implementation:
they were contextually realistic and mutually supportive. But even more importantly, they were mainly
oriented to service provision rather than demographic impact. This boosted the morale of peripheral
service providers, who now felt that they were catering to client-determined priorities such as mother
and child care. It is significant that there was no "target" for the single demographic objective --
reduction of higher-order births. It was a welcome change from decades of "time-bound and target-
oriented" reduction of fertility.
26.   Continuity of middle-level management and field staff was a third major advantage. Those
involved with the project at its design stages largely stayed with it for most of its duration. Thus,
lessons learned could be applied for mid-course corrections. This is also part of the explanation for why
progress in those areas that came into the project's fold midway was faster than in earlier areas (para. 12
above). Without detracting from the quality of administrative leadership or the Bank's accommodating
flexibility, the continuity in management also contributed to the learning ethos of the project. For
example, the location of HPs was not strictly according to URS norms (population-based) but based on
distance and travel time of both clients and field staff. This reduced the number of HPs without
adversely affecting accessibility.
D. Project Sustainability
27.   Issues of sustainability of the project fall into two categories: normative and financial. The
normative perspective includes not only the administrative changes introduced formally, but also those
of perception and ethos that came about and were as responsible as anything else for the project's
achievements.
28.   Normative Aspects. First, cessation of implementation unit activities raises no concerns. Since
there is not likely to be much new construction or initiation of major activities, the need for the
implementation unit will diminish. In Bombay, inasmuch as MIES, IEC, and training have been
institutionalized within GBMC, these activities will continue, albeit at maintenance level. To a lesser
extent, this will also apply to the changes in MMC. In Tamil Nadu, most of the staff will revert to the
state government, carrying with them their IPP V experiences to the benefit of health and family
planning services across the state.
29.    Second, the emphasis on MCH services, which represented a strategic move towards a more
client-focused approach emphasizing quality and meeting individual needs, is likely to be sustained.
This large-scale project provided GOI with an important demonstration of this approach, which
undoubtedly contributed to the recent decisions to adopt a similar strategy nation-wide and to drop
method-specific contraceptive targets effective April 1996.



- 8 -
30.   Third, the use of female voluntary health workers (FVHWs), generally considered to be a key
factor in extending outreach, is likely to continue in Madras and possibly be introduced in other
municipalities since they impose no fiscal burden. It is not possible to be equally sanguine about their
continuance in Bombay. At Rs. 500 per month for each FVHW, an amount likely to increase, the
burden is substantial. If the fate of community health volunteers in rural areas is any guide, in the event
of a resource crunch it is likely that FVHWs will be the first either to be retrenched or lost to attrition
and not replaced. If this were to occur, it would weaken the program in Bombay.
31.   Fourth, the involvement of PVOs, already under strain in both Bombay and Madras, is not
likely to be sustained in the long run. In MMC, support to PVOs has been extended up to June 1997.
In GBMC, no plans for continuing support to PVOs have yet been formulated. The lack of unequivocal
support to PVOs is not primarily due to financial reasons; GOI has sufficient money to support them.
Moreover, the expenditure on HPs operated by PVOs is not additional since the government would
have to spend this amount if it operated the HPs. The more intractable problem is one of mutual
distrust. However, this is a complicated matter since in both cities and states there are programs that
work extensively and successfully with PMPs and PVOs, and throughout India there are movements in
these directions. Finally, if PVO involvement in the activities were not to be sustained, this in itself
would not undermine the overall sustainability of the project.
32.   Fifth, GOI has taken a number of steps with IDA support to enhance the sustainability of the
Family Welfare Program. The ongoing Sixth and Seventh Population Projects are strengthening
training capacity in seven states and in the overall program; the Eight Population Project has expanded
the IPP V approach to four more major cities; and the Ninth Population Project is enhancing the MCH
strategy in the states of Assam, Kamataka, and Rajasthan. On a national scale, the Child Survival and
Safe Motherhood Project, which ended on September 30, 1996, has provided further IDA support for
the broader approach to MCH and family planning. And the proposed Reproductive and Child Health
Project, scheduled for appraisal in early 1997, will further expand the service paradigm pioneered in
IPP V. Finally, the GOI-Bank collaboration on sector work, culminating in the June 1995 report
(India's Family Welfare Program: Toward a Reproductive and Child Health Approach - Report No.
14644-IN), describes the paradigm shift in the program's strategy.
33.   Financial Aspects. Ongoing activities are likely to be sustained financially. The SAR estimated
recurrent cost implications on the order of Rs. 221 million per year, about equally divided between
Bombay and Madras/Tamil Nadu. At the end of the project, this estimate appears to hold. Compared to
the total expenditure on health and family welfare, the amount is not formidable. GBMC and NMMC
are confident that they can finance activities introduced under IPP V from their own revenues while
Madras/Tamil Nadu is seeking GOI support under URS. Both approaches appear promising, though in
the event of GOI funding, the additional posts created outside the URS pattern are not likely to
continue. Such an eventuality would not, however, have a major impact on the program now that it is
well established. And although there remains some doubt about the future source of funding, especially
in Tamil Nadu, financial sustainability does not appear to be at risk.
E. Bank Performance
34.   Bank staff assisted the project areas in developing an innovative strategy in relatively uncharted
territory: providing MCH and family planning services to urban slum populations. The SAR was a
comprehensive and practical document, fully subscribed to by the Borrower. Supervision missions



-9-
were frequent enough and of appropriate composition. The decline in the frequency of supervision
during the middle stages of the project, as seen in Part II, Table 10, did not adversely affect the project.
Rapport between the Bank and Borrower was good.
F. Borrower Performance
35.   Bombay, Madras and the Government of India deserve great credit for pioneering a broad
approach to reproductive and child health, which was subsequently endorsed by the 1994 Cairo
Conference on Population and Development and has now been adopted nation-wide.
36.   The project start was delayed by a year, and progress initially was slow. Although the GOI and
IDA signed the credit agreement in September 1988, it did not become effective until nearly a year
later, as GBMC, MMC, and the Tamil Nadu Government delayed signing it due to bureaucratic delays.
However, the pace of implementation picked up and more than compensated for earlier delays. Once
the project was operational, the implementing authorities were unusually enthusiastic, particularly
about expanding the service delivery network, and disbursements picked up correspondingly.
37.   Delays in commissioning and completing special studies were a problem; at the time of ICR
preparation, the end-line surveys have yet to be commissioned. If studies had been done as scheduled
and their findings considered, the project would have been considerably enriched and its lessons
clearer.
G. Assessment of Outcome
38.   Based on the success of the project in achieving its key objectives (paras. 8-23), project
outcome is rated "satisfactory." Currently available data on fertility and infant mortality in the project
areas are based on service statistics rather than surveys, and to that extent of limited utility in judging
overall impact. However, the service statistics show encouraging reductions in fertility and mortality; a
reliable estimate of impact will have to await the end-line surveys.
39.   A rating of "satisfactory" is also warranted if the project's outcome is assessed in terms of its
impact on India's health and family welfare program. Assuming that a shift from a predominantly
demographic orientation to one concerned with health, particularly of women and children, is desirable,
the question is: did IPP V contribute? It would be presumptuous to overplay IPP V's contribution, but
the demonstration value of a project that underplayed fertility reduction per se and gave priority to
broader health issues, not only in its design but consistently and successfully through its seven-year life,
cannot be minimized. This view of the project's contribution gained ground over the life of the project,
and is now the predominant view in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the states. If it is on
this canvas that IPP V's impact is to be assessed, then it is indeed seminal, particularly as an exemplar
for projects that might choose to interpret family welfare more broadly to include reproductive and
child health.
H. Future Operation
40.   The future operation of the services supported by the project seems assured in both major cities
and the other municipalities. These services have been absorbed into the URS or other programs of the
state governments concerned and are likely to be sustained in the long terrn.



- 10-
I. Key Lessons Learned
41.   Not all the reasons for IPP V's unusually high levels of achievement are replicable but three
appear to show promise. One pertains to urban projects in India and two have relevance to a wider
range of social sector projects in India and comparable settings.
42.   Implementing Agency. The choice of implementing agency is an important determinant of
success. IPP V was implemented through municipal corporations in the Bombay region while in
Madras it was largely through the state government. In both cases, it appears that the project was
implemented by the most appropriate entity. In the Bombay region, municipal corporations,
particularly those of Greater Bombay, are autonomous and self-financing and have their own elected
bodies. In Madras, they are creatures of the state govemment and, to a large extent, financially
dependent on it.
43.    Relevance of project objectives. Successful project objectives should ensure high staff morale
and active beneficiary participation.  The statement of IPP V objectives and its ensuing design
unequivocally took the needs of both staff and beneficiaries into account. In evidence is the project's
nearly exclusive concern for services: only service targets were quantified and measured. Almost all
project administrators and field personnel not only agreed with IPP V's approach but felt that
implementing it gave them considerable personal satisfaction. It took more courage to ignore fertility
reduction per se in 1987 than it does now.
44.    PVO and Private Sector Involvement. Allotting a subordinate role to the private and voluntary
sector can lead to disappointing results. The promotion of PVO and private sector involvement in the
project was the single comparatively unmet objective of IPP V. The fact that it did not have much
negative impact on project performance is of little comfort. There is increasing evidence that official
social sector projects succeed to the extent that they collaborate with non-official agencies and groups.
In hindsight, it appears that IPP V saw the involvement of the private sector as an objective rather than
a means. Furthermore, some middle-level managers saw PVOs as competitors. They failed to see that
the private and PVO sectors could be an extra resource to meet the project's objectives. This
perspective needs to be pursued more aggressively in future projects. If the private sector is to be a
partner, it must also have a greater say in making decisions and have mechanisms to do so incorporated
at the design stage.

FIFTH (BOMBAY AND MADRAS) POPULATION PROJECT (IPP V)
CREDIT NO. 1931-IN
WORLD BANK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION:
NOVEMBERJDECEMBER 1995
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank implementation completion mission visited Madras from November 25-28,
1995 and Bombay from December 4-6, 1995. The mission consisted of Dr. Anthony Measham
(PHN Adviser and mission leader), Mr. R. Sethuraman (Finance Specialist), and Dr. Lessel David
(Consultant Public Health Specialist). This aide-memoire sets forth the main findings of the
mission.
2.    The mission expresses its appreciation to the State of Tamil Nadu, and the Municipal
Corporations of Madras, Bombay, and New Bombay, for their full co-operation and excellent
hospitality. The mission undertook field trips in Madras, Bombay, and New Bombay. Wrap-up
meetings were chaired in Madras by the Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, and in
Bombay, by the Municipal Commissioner, Bombay Municipal Corporation.
Mission Objectives and Overall Progress
3.    The objectives of the mission were as follows to undertake a final review of progress
before the project closing date of December 31, 1995:
(a)    provide advice and support to the Borrower in the preparation of its contribution to
the Implementation Completion Report (ICR); and
(b)   to record the views of the Borrower and the Bank on project implementation.
Overall progress in implementation of the project since the May/June 1995 review mission was
judged to be very good in both Madras and Bombay. In Madras, excellent further progress has been
made towards completion of the civil works prior to the project closing date. In both Madras and
Bombay, the project will be fully implemented, performance against the key indicators appears to
be very good, and the prospect for project sustainability is promising. The final (end-line) survey
should provide additional information regarding project impact.
4.    Attachments 1 and 2 provide the mission's findings on financial progress in the project.
Bombay has already expended the full amount of Rs.48.3 crores sanctioned for the project, while
Madras has expended Rs.62 crores out of the Rs.69.13 crores sanctioned. It is anticipated that the
total sanctioned amount will be fully disbursed.

Project Issues
5.    Project Extension. The Government of India (GOI) requested on October 18 and again
on December 4, 1995 that the project be extended for three months beyond the closing date of
December 31, 1995. The Bank responded to the first request by informing GOI that it was not
possible to extend the project, which was expected to be fully implemented, for the purpose of
using exchange rate savings, but that it would be possible to use those savings during the life of the
project. After the May/June 1995 review mission, GOI began to prepare a submission to the
Expenditure and Finance (EFC) Committee, requesting that an additional Rs.43.43 crores be
sanctioned against the project. At the time of writing this aide-memoire, EFC approval had not
been received.
6.    In anticipation of EFC sanction of the additional amount, Madras and Bombay have gone
ahead with procurement of additional civil works and equipment If EFC clearance is provided
before the end of the project period, it will be possible for the Bank to disburse against
expenditures committed before the closing date, and claimed up to April 30, 1996.
Implementation Completion Review
7.    The mission reviewed and commented on draft contributions to the ICR from the Madras
and Bombay project authorities. The mission's main comment was that the drafts provided a good
description of the achievements of the project but had not offered a critical analysis regarding the
likely reasons for project success in various areas, or lack of same. The mission requested that this
latter element be introduced into revised drafts, and that the contributions be not more than ten
pages in each case.
8.    The mission engaged in extensive discussions with project staff and other experts regarding
the outcome of the project, and the factors responsible for success or lack of it. In addition, Dr.
Lessel David stayed for several days after the main mission's departure, in order to undertake field
trips and more extensive discussions. Dr. David will be responsible for drafting the Bank's
contribution to the ICR, with the assistance of the other members of the mission. A draft of the
Bank's contribution will be sent in January 1996 to the Government of India, the Madras and
Bombay project authorities, and the concerned State Governments for review and comment, and
will be submitted to Bank headquarters by February 28, 1996.
9.    Key Factors affecting Project Implementation and Impact.   There was substantial
agreement between the mission and the project authorities in both cities regarding the key factors
responsible for the outcome of the project. In many cases, factors were common to both urban
areas. The following is a brief summary of the main factors agreed upon. The ICR itself will
provide a more detailed exposition of these factors, and will note differences between the two
cities, and in the views of the Bank and the implementing agencies, where they occur.
10.   It was agreed that the project had achieved its main objectives in both Madras and Bombay.
These were to:



Appendix A
Page 3 of 16
(a)   expand family welfare services with the emphasis on maternal and child health
(MCH), birth spacing, and increased use of temporary contraceptive methods in
Greater Bombay, Madras City and Chingleput district in Tamil Nadu;
(b)   improve the quality of family welfare services delivered in Bombay, Madras, and
Chingleput;
(c)   strengthen the capacity of Tamil Nadu, Bombay, and Madras to plan, manage, and
implement family welfare programs in urban areas; and
(d)   increase the participation of private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and private
medical practitioners (PMPs) in the family welfare program in urban areas.
While it was agreed that the achievement of the first three of the above four objectives was key to
project impact, as measured by the performance indicators, this seemed less so in the case of the
involvement of PVOs and PMPs. Involvement of PVOs and PMPs did increase, but the
performance was mixed, especially in the case of the PMPs. In retrospect, it seems likely that the
project would have succeeded in the absence of this objective, although the increased involvement
of PVOs and PMPs was a positive factor in both cities.
11.   The mission noted that, thanks to the vision of the project authorities in both cities, the
project actually accomplished much more than had been originally envisaged in the project design.
In the case of Tamil Nadu, it was possible to extend the project to all cities of 100,000 population
in the state. In the case of Bombay, funds were made available to the New Bombay Municipal
Corporation, which enabled it to provide family welfare services to over 400,000 inhabitants of that
new and rapidly growing municipality. Several factors appear to explain how this expansion was
possible. First, with the benefit of hindsight, the project seems to have been over-budgeted.
Second, and importantly, the project authorities in both cities made savings where possible, for
example, by not adding facilities and staff when this was advisable, by achieving efficiencies in
project operation, and by being careful to limit the recurrent cost implications of the project
wherever possible. Third, both project authorities demonstrated the commitment and flexibility to
take these actions.
12.   Overall, it appears that four factors were key to project success:
*  flexibility of project management;
* broadening the family welfare services to give more emphasis to maternal and child
health (MCH), to spacing, and to temporary contraceptive methods;
*  increasing demand by use of community workers and innovative information,
education, and communication (IEC) techniques; and
*  the high level of commitment of the authorities in Tamil Nadu, Madras, Bombay, and
New Bombay.



Appendix A
Page 4 of 16
13.   Examples of the flexible approach to project management have been cited above, in the
expansion of project activities and the careful use of project funds. These approaches may be
generalized by saying that the project authorities were flexible, opportunistic, and demonstrated the
attributes of "learning" organizations, which are important factors for project success in any
setting.
14.   This project was in the vanguard of a more general shift in GOI strategy towards a
broadened MCH approach to family welfare, and this shift was partly reflected in the Urban
Revamping Scheme financed by GOI, and of which this project formed a part. The project
therefore represented a demonstration of what could be accomplished through this strategy, and, by
adopting a broad set of key indicators, allowed a good test of the approach. The project showed
that demand for services increased when the broader approach was taken, and also demonstrated
that the approach resulted in an equal, if not greater impact, on fertility and child mortality, than
the more demographically-oriented strategy that had been pursued hitherto. The draft ICR will
provide details of the demographic trends in the project areas over the life of the project, while
Annex 4 gives the targets and achievements of the project.
15.   A strong consensus suggests that the use of community workers - link workers in Madras
and community health workers in Bombay - plus innovative IEC techniques, such as street plays,
increased the demand for services and their quality. These accomplishments are well documented
in the publication Reaching Out, just published in Bombay. The workers in Madras are unpaid
volunteers, while those in Bombay (but not New Bombay) are paid (originally Rs.200/month and
now Rs.500/month). Both approaches appear to have been successful.
16.   Finally, the strong commitment to the project in both cities, and the track record in
implementation of other projects, clearly was a key factor in the success of this project. The
performance of the implementing agencies is rated as highly satisfactory.
17.   Comments on the performance of the Bank will await the draft ICR. It can be said,
however, that the project authorities considered Bank performance satisfactory, especially with
regard to the progress review missions. However, the Bank was thought to have performed better in
the management and finance than in technical areas, in the latter stages of the project.
18.   Finally, this project clearly influenced policy in the two cities, in the state of Tamil Nadu,
and in the GOI. This influence mainly occurred as a result of the performance in meeting the key
indicators, within a broad set of MCH objectives. This, in turn, influenced the Government of
Tamil Nadu to adopt this approach on a state-wide basis. The experience also informed the family
welfare sector review (Report No. 14644-IN: India's Family Welfare Program: Toward a
Reproductive and Child Health Approach), recently completed by GOI and the Bank. The sector
report recommendations, in turn, may have had a bearing on GOI's decision to drop method-
specific contraceptive targets in at least one district in each state (and in all districts of Tamil Nadu
and Kerala). Some of the recommendations of the report are likely to be implemented in the
Reproductive and Child Health project being prepared for possible Bank financing.

Next Steps
19.   The project authorities in each city are requested to proceed expeditiously with the final

Fifth Population Project (IPP V) - MADRAS
(November 25 - 28, 1995)
IPP V Madras project has an approved project outlay of Rs.69.13 crores with a life span of
seven years closing on December 31, 1995. The scope of the project was originally designed to cover
the urban slums of Madras city and the neighboring urban agglomeration of Chengalpattu district.
The project was extended under Phase I expansion program from September 1992 to the
corporation areas of Madurai, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirapalli and the municipal areas of
Nagercoil, Tuticorin, Erode and Tiruppur with an outlay of Rs 8.78 crores; and under Phase 11
expansion program from April 1993 to 15 new municipal areas. To cover the entire Chengalpattu
District, three left over municipal areas of the district were included during Phase III expansion with
an outlay of Rs. 40.22 lakhs. Furthermore, under Phase IV expansion program, upgrading of
maternity, neonatal and paediatric facilities has been agreed to in all the district and taluk hospitals in
the State at an outlay of Rs.7.00 crores.
Service Delivery Expansion
Under the project, 140 Urban Health Posts (one for 50,000 population) in Madras city and
suburban areas, 15 in Zonal centers were set up. Under Phases I and II, additional Urban Health Posts,
Urban Family Welfare Centers, and PPCs were included. Repairs and renovations for Maternity
Homes in the Phase I and II areas and the ICDS centers have also been completed under the project.
Almost all the civil works have been completed and only finishing works are in progress, and
expected to be completed and handed over to the respective municipalities/corporations before end-
December 1995.
To improve the quality of service delivery, additional equipment will be procured to
strengthen Maternal and Child Health Care Services in 134 Taluk Hospitals and 8 district hospitals. In
this process Taluk hospitals and district hospitals perform the functions of First Referral Units
(FRUs).
Financial Status
Out of the total approved outlay of Rs.69.13 crores, the project has reportedly posted an
expenditure of Rs.62.03 crores as on October 31, 1995 leaving an unspent balance of Rs.7.1 crores.
In view of the commitments already made, this balance amount is expected to be fully utilized before
December 31, 1995, the project closing date. However, the project outlay is not sufficient to meet the
additional commitments made for strengthening the district and taluk hospitals. The additional
commitments are estimated to cost Rs. 20 crores. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has,
based on the recommendations made by the state government, initiated steps to obtain the approval of
Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) for allocation of additional amount of Rs.20 crores to be
committed before the project closing date. A statement showing componentwise details of estimated



Appendix A
Page 7 of 16
expenditure up to December 31, 1995 and the additional funds proposed for EFC approval is at
Attachment I.
The additional amount of Rs. 20 crores proposed to be spent after approval by GOI includes
the following components:
1. Civil works                   4.09
2. Equipment                     8.28
3. Additional staff salaries     0.88
4. Equipment to taluk            6.00
hospitals
The project authorities have cleared the bidding documents with the Bank and have also reportedly
received bids in response to the tenders quoted under LCB and referred to Bank for prior clearance. It
would be possible to process and place formal supply order(s) on the identified supplier/manufacturer
firm(s) only after the EFC approval is obtained. Even if EFC approval is secured before mid
December 1995, as expected, it is unclear whether it would at all be feasible for the suppliers to
supply the entire quantum indented for before December 31, 1995 All equipment proposed to be
procured under the project should be delivered to the project authorities on or before the project
closing date so that the expenditure incurred would be eligible for reimbursement.
Sustainability of Project Activities
The additional recurring expenditure annually after the project closes is estimated to be as
follows:
Rs in crores
Commitments                             1.40
to Urban Family Welfare
Centers/Urban Health Posts
Commitments made                        7.30
under IPP V Project in Madras,
suburbs and Phase I
Phase II commitment                     2.16
Total                                  10.86
The annual recurring cost to sustain the project activities after the project would be of the order of
Rs. 10.86 crores. The Govemment of Tamil Nadu has taken the stand that all recurrent costs to be
incurred under the Family Welfare program should be met by GOI. The state govemment is awaiting
the response of the MOHFW whom they have requested to fund the recurrent cost under the centrally
sponsored Urban Revamping Scheme.

Summing Up
Under this project there is a substantial increase in the level of civil works program
covering both expansion and renovation over and above the provision made in the
original project. Another striking feature is that the civil works expansion program
covers 23 towns/municipalities spread throughout the state. The civil works
expansion program which was taken up only two years ago has been completed in
record time.
This project has also improved quality of service delivery by strengthening MCH
services in 134 Taluq Hospitals and 8 District Hospitals. This project has thus
assisted the establishment of First Referral Units in almost all the districts at taluq
level. These facilities, which had not been provided for under the project, have
resulted from timely utilization of exchange rate savings.
At the time of closure of this project the annual recurring cost for sustaining the
project activities is estimated to be nearly Rs. 11.00 crores. The Government of
Tamil Nadu has not made any commitment to meet this cost from the state budget.
The state government has formally approached the MOHFW with a request to meet
the recurring cost of the project under the centrally sponsored Urban Revamping
Scheme.
Approximately 20 Health Posts are run by Private Voluntary Organizations. It is
necessary that the state government provide for their continued support from the state
budgetary resources after the expiry of the project period.
The state government has succeeded in optimizing the utilization of the project funds
and extended the overall project to cover almost the entire state at taluq level.

Fifth Population Project (IPP-V) BOMBAY
(December 4 - 5, 1995)
A.    Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (BMC)
IPP V Bombay project has a GOI approved outlay of Rs. 48.30 crores with a life span of
seven years, closing on December 31, 1995. The project has reported an expenditure of Rs. 53.40
crores for the period ending 30th November, 1995. The expenditure projected for December 1995 is
Rs. 5.10 crores. Details of actual and projected expenditure are given in Annex I.
The project was originally approved to cover the slum population in Greater Bombay.
Subsequently the State Government, in association with BMC, agreed to extend the project activities
to New Bombay. The MOHFW issued two financial sanctions diverting a sum of Rs. 11.04 crores -
one for Rs. 6.78 crores on July 19, 1993 and the other for Rs. 4.26 crores on July 26, 1993 for setting
up a 100-bedded FRU - out of the approved project outlay for expansion of IPP V activities to New
Bombay Municipal area. Bombay and New Bombay Corporations were allocated Rs.37.26 crores and
Rs.1 1.04 crores respectively.
Out of Rs.5. 10 crores to be incurred during December 1995 the following three components
accounting for major share of the projected expenditure:
Rs. in crores
Civil Works                1.20
Equipments                 1.26
Salaries                   1.04
Expenditure for staff salary is a committed and will be utilized. In the wrap up meeting, it
was assured that orders for supply of equipment would be placed within a week. However, in the case
of import of Ultrasound equipment costing Rs.0.85 crores delivery would take place only after the
project closing date. The Municipal Commissioner urged that expenditure incurred for all the
equipment for which supply orders are placed before the project closing date be treated as committed
expenditure eligible for disbursement irrespective of the date of receipt of goods by the project
authorities. The Municipal Commissioner agreed that a formal request would be made by the BMC to
the Bank on this account. In civil works, it was reported that construction of all nine Post Partum
Centers and 47 Health Posts had been completed. Four Mobile Vans would be procured before end-
December 1995 for commissioning mobile health posts.



Appendix A
Page 11 of 16
B.    Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC)
Under this project all ten Urban Health Posts have been established in the Panchayat
buildings by making additions and alterations. Five new MCH centers have been constructed and they
are operational. One FRU Hospital (150 bedded) has already started functioning in the ESIC building.
NMMC has reported an expenditure of Rs. 1 0.88 crores for the period ending November 1995.
NMMC have sought allocation of additional sum of Rs.1.93 crores over and above the originally
sanctioned amount (Rs. 11.04 crores), to complete the project activities. This forms part of the
additional allocation of funds awaiting EFC approval. The total estimated expenditure by NMMC
during the project period would be of the order of Rs. 12.82 crores subject to approval by the EFC. A
statement giving the break up of expenditure from June 1993 to December 1995 is at Table 2.
Bombay and New Bombay
BMC and NMMC require Rs.58.50 Crores and Rs.12.82 crores, respectively, for completing
all the project activities before the closing of the project. Therefore, EFC approval is being sought for
a total revised project outlay of Rs. 71.32 crores. The annual recurring cost for BMC to sustain the
project activities after the project is over is estimated to be Rs. 12 crores. The Municipal
Commissioner of BMC has assured that this would be met out of their own budgetary resources.
Likewise, Municipal Commissioner, NMMC has also certified that it would be possible to sustain the
project activities out of their own budgetary resources.
Summing Up
Bombay Municipal Corporation
(1)   IPP V project has brought about establishment of 176 Urban Health Posts in slum areas of
Greater Bombay. The project has set up 30 Post Partum Centers, each serving as First
Referral Unit linked with 5-6 Urban Health Posts. These MCH centers provide high quality
MCH services free of cost to poor people living in Bombay slums.
(2)    This project has promoted participation of Private Voluntary Organisations in the Family
Welfare and MCH Programs.
(3)    The project has also extended its activities to New Bombay which had no basic health
infrastructural facilities
(4)    This project has promoted the functioning of Voluntary Women Health Workers amongst the
slum population of Bombay.
New Mumbai Municipal Corporation
Extension of IPP V project to New Bombay has brought about establishment of basic
facilities in the form of 10 Urban Health Posts, 5 MCH Centers and one FRU Hospital with 150 beds.



Appendix A
Page 12 of 16
Almost all the equipment and medicines required for operationalising these centers have been
procured. A high quality health delivery system has been developed.
The only area in which the NMMC is experiencing difficulty is in the recruitment of trained
medical and paramedical personnel. Efforts are continuing to fill up all these vacant posts.

INDIA POPULATION PROJECT V - MADRAS
Borrower's Contribution
Reasons for the Success of the IPP V Project
1.    Madras City is the Capital of Tamil Nadu State and the fourth largest Metropolitan City in the
Country in terms of population. It had a population of 14.16 lakhs in 1951 and it increased to 32.7 lakhs
in 1981 and 38.41 lakhs in 1991. The slums in Madras City which were 1413 in December '86, increased
to 1847 by June '89 (i.e.) an increase of 30.71 percent. The reorganized National Family Welfare
Programme (FWP) was being implemented by the Corporation of Madras with one City Family Welfare
Bureau, 44 Urban Family Welfare Centres, 41 Child Welfare Centres rendering Family Welfare,
Maternal and Child Health (FW & MCH) services for the City population apart from the teaching
medical institutions, postpartum centres, private nursing homes and clinics functioning in the city.
2.    The emphasis on the need to provide the FW&MCH services through the outreach programme
for the slum and congested population was recommended by the Krishnan Committee and accordingly
29 Urban Health Posts were functioning under the Urban Revamping Scheme (URS) with 100% GOI
financial assistance. Under these circumstances the World Bank assisted IPP V was proposed for Madras
City with an outlay of 60.71 Crores and the DCA (Credit No. 1931) between India and IDA was signed
in September 1988 with a revised Project outlay of 69.13 Crores.
3.    As per the agreement, the entire Madras City and also the eight Municipal areas of Chengalpattu
MGR District adjoining Madras City were included for the coverage of Project activities. The objective
of the Project was to provide the slum population with basic health facilities with a special emphasis on
MCH care and FW services. The cost of the project is shared by GOI and government of Tamil Nadu in
the ratio of 90% and 10% respectively.
4.    The nodal Department at the state level is the Health and Family Welfare Department of
Government of Tamil Nadu. A separate Cell was established at the Secretariat to process the proposals
relating to IPP V and get approval of the Government. A separate Project Directorate was formed at the
State level to monitor the implementation of Project activities. Actual implementation at the field level
was entrusted to the Corporation and municipal authorities with necessary supporting staff.
5.    A Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary to Government was
constituted to coordinate, monitor and clear the IPP V proposals and activities. An Empowered
Committee was also formed to process and approve the proposals put forth by Project Director for
implementation. A Tender Committee was also formed under the Chairmanship of Health Secretary to
clear the tender proposals with reference to Civil Works. This administrative set up helped to clear
proposals fast. It also avoided a lot of bureaucratic delay redtape.
6.    As a first step, the integration of Maternity Centres and the Health Posts was done so as to ensure
comprehensive health delivery both in the institution and through outreach. The entire Madras City area
was reorganized into 'D' Type Health Post pattern of the URS of GOI with due allocation of 50000
population to each Post Partum Centre area and 30000 population to each Health Post area. Needbased



Appendix B
Page 2 of 13
reallocation was done without leaving any of the areas uncovered while this integration and
reorganization was done. Those pucca buildings where the centres already existed were taken over as it is
and repairs needed were carried out whereas while taking up new constructions for the proposed new
Health Posts, the location was identified in a central place and as far as possible in the midst of the slums
to ensure easy accessibility of the MCH&FW services to mothers and children.
7.    In order to identify suitable locations for construction and also to assess the fitness of sites,
consultants were utilized. The construction works in the Corporation area were entrusted to the Building
Division of the Corporation of Madras and in respect of the Municipal areas the work was entrusted to
the Public Works Department. Periodical reviews were undertaken both by Project Director and by the
Health Secretary to assess the progress and also to speed up the works and remove the bottlenecks if any
brought to the notice.
8.     The Project Directorate played a crucial role in close monitoring of the implementation of field
level activities in the Corporation and Municipal areas, conducting periodical review meetings with all
the implementing officials and communicating regular feed back to each area on the progress made and
also on the action to be taken for improvement etc. The leadership under an IAS Officer as Project
Director helped in coordinating the implementation of activities with other Directorates of Health and
Family Welfare Department. Wherever shortfalls were noticed, those officers and field staff were given a
feed back so that no area lagged behind the expected level of achievements at any given point of time.
9.     The main factor for the success is the service rendered through outreach at the doorsteps of the
slum dwellers and the Multipurpose Health Worker (F) (MPHW) plays an important role in this aspect.
The initial step taken by the Project Directorate was to identify and select the field workers from among
the slum dwellers and send them for full fledged 18 months' training course to qualify, as MPHW(F).
Recognized government and Private Voluntary Organization (PVO) training institutions were involved
for this purpose and all the trained MPWs were posted for field work in their respective areas which
enabled quick rapport and recognition for them in the community to undertake the challenging task on
MCH&FW activities expected under the project.
10.   To ensure proper documentation of the field activities carried out by the MPHWs, the
streamlined system  of record maintenance and reporting was introduced under MIES.  The
comprehensive records introduced enabled the workers to concentrate more on outreach activities and
the time spent in writing work was reduced to the minimum. Periodical field verifications were
undertaken to ensure accuracy of records and reports by officials of the Project Directorate and the
Corporation of Madras.
11.   The baseline survey which was undertaken before the initiation of the Project helped in
identifying the priority issues and the findings of the survey were utilized during implementation to
ensure improvement. In addition, certain need based surveys, Training Needs Assessments, IEC impact
assessments, etc., were also undertaken from time to time to fulfill the project objectives. The mid-term
impact analysis undertaken by the Project Directorate and also the external mid-term assessment
suggested by World Bank mutually undertaken both by Madras and Bombay IPP V areas helped in the
course corrections during implementation.
12.   Quality of services of the field functionaries improved through periodical short term training
programmes undertaken by the training team of the Project Directorate. The training needs for various



Appendix B
Page 3 of 13
levels of functionaries assessed by the TNA study were utilized for developing a curriculum for various
levels of officials and field workers.  Induction training, in-service training, refresher training,
supervisory skill development training, records maintenance training, IEC training, sonar training,
management development training, training on resuscitation of new born, trainers' training, anesthesia
training, theatre training, health education and other need based technical training programmes were the
activities carried out by the training team of the Project Directorate in coordination with the training
wing of the corporation of Madras and other training institutions like Health and Family Welfare
Training Centres, Egmore, Salem and Gandhigram and Institute of Public Health, Poonamallee. The
programmes were participant oriented with practical suggestions. In addition, seminars and workshops
were also organized for the supervisory officers to promote participation for achievement of project
goals. Knowledge, skill and ability were the focus in the training programmes.
13.    The district level hospitals as well as the taluk and non-taluk hospitals in the state were
strengthened with supply of equipments and furniture for improved service delivery under MCH. The
First Referral Units (FRUs) were strengthened to ensure the availability of specialized services in easy
reach. Ultrasound scanners were supplied to the FRUs an the Medical Officers from FRUs were given
15 days training in handling the equipment.
14.   Innovative types of IEC activities were undertaken to educate and motivate the community and
to increase the levels of awareness of the FW&MCH Programmes. Women link leaders were selected
among the slum dwellers at the rate of one worker for every 20 families to act as a liaison between the
health workers and the community for an effective health delivery system. Their involvement in this task
as voluntary workers without any remuneration for their services created a great impact. Timely referral
of complicated cases if any to the nearest FRU for medical attention was ensured through this network.
15.    Though the GOI had been implementing the URS, the health posts did not have any provision for
drugs. This was a major drawback of the URS. IPP V ensured availability of drugs in all the areas under
the Project which led to a better utilization of the health services by the public. Systematic supply of
drugs was ensured so that there was no Health Post without drugs at any given point of time. The
Government of Tamil Nadu subsequently established a Medical Services Corporation which streamlined
the procedure for drug supply and distribution This uniform procedure has further helped all medical
institutions in the State including the Health Posts to have a regular supply of drugs.
16.    The involvement of the PVOs was one of the project objectives and accordingly as many PVOs
as possible, including those already in existence, were involved. Most of the PVOs evinced keen interest
and commitment. However, there were instances where there was no improvement in the performance in
a few PVOs despite efforts to remedy the situation. Such of those PVOs who were chronic defaulters in
rendering service had to be removed from the programme and those areas were re-allotted to other
Health Post areas of the Corporation for coverage of health delivery services.
17.   In the year 1992-93, it was estimated by the Project Directorate that all the proposed activities
could be completed with a smaller rupee allocation of about Rs. 45 crores by the end of the project
period and hence the balance funds from project outlay of Rs. 69.13 crores could be utilized for
expanding the project activities to other urban areas of Tamil Nadu. The credit agreement was therefore
amended to include other urban areas also.

18.    With the concurrence of World Bank and Government of India, the Phase-I expansion was
undertaken with effect from September 1992 to include two more corporations and six Municipal areas
whose population was 2 lakhs and above. The outlay was Rs. 8.78 crores. Subsequently this issue was
discussed with the World Bank Review Missions and concurrence for a Phase II expansion with effect
from April 1993 with an outlay of Rs. 14.85 crores was again obtained from World Bank and GOI. This
expansion covered 15 municipal areas having a population of one to two lakhs. The Municipal
Commissioners and municipal Health Officers were the implementing officials of the project activities
and the Deputy Director of Health Services of the districts were the technical supervisory officials in
these areas. Reviews, monitoring and feedback were all carried out in similar lines as undertaken for
original project area and the Project Directorate monitored the progress of service delivery at the State
level.
19.   Repairs and renovation works to the Maternity Homes in the expansion areas were undertaken
utilizing the engineering staff of the respective Corporations and Municipalities. The maintenance of the
ICDS Centres which function as units for service delivery under MCH and nutrition was felt to be
essential and hence funds were provided to these areas for repairs and maintenance which helped in
improving the delivery of MCH service.
20.   In order to ensure complete coverage of Chengalpattu MGR District which was the original
Project area, three left out areas were included for coverage under Phase III expansion and civil works
for 10 bedded maternity ward were undertaken in these areas. Minor civil works were undertaken in all
the FRU areas as Phase IV expansion in addition to supply of equipments so that the aims of the Project
were fulfilled in all the urban areas in delivering effective MCH services.
21.   The World Bank supervisory mission were flexible and encouraged the Directorate to expand its
activities.
22.    The IEC strategy focused on Project objectives and messages on social issues like age of
marriage, literacy and education of women and the quality of life that could be achieved by a small
family were all covered by different media. The IEC programmes reached the targeted slum community
through the judicious combination of media mix and interpersonal and group strategies. Emphasis was
given on interpersonal and group contacts by the grass root level workers. This was supported by mass
communication programmes through film shows, video shows, TV, AIR and Press. Vehicles with
paintings on MCH&FW messages were supplied to all the Corporations/Municipalities under the project
area which were utilized for field publicity. IEC printed materials and manuals were supplied to all the
workers. Competitions, auto stickers for propogating health and family welfare messages, etc. helped in
increasing the awareness among the community.
23.   A separate project directorate, continuity in tenure of project directors, availability of resources
and manpower, focused objectives and a flexible administrative set contributed in large measure to the
success of the project.

INDIA POPULATION PROJECT V
MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF GREATER MUMBAI
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT
Borrower's Contribution
Project Objectives and Activities
1.    India Population Project V has been implemented by the Public Health Department with the
financial assistance of Rs. 48.30 crores from the World Bank/Govt. of India since October 1988. Out of
this amount an amount of Rs.37.26 crores was allocated to Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the
amount of Rs. 11.04 crores was diverted to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation for development of
infrastructure. The project was to get over by 31 st March 1995 initially but its period was extended up to
31st December 1995 and again up to 31st March 1996. The Municipal Corporation Mumbai had
incurred an expenditure of Rs.43.49 up to 31.3.95 on the project. The additional grant of Rs. 15.01
crores over and above Rs.43.49 crores was sanctioned by the World Bank/Government of India for the
project making the total outlay of Rs.58.50 crores. The project period is over on 31st March 1996.
2.    The Project in nutshell is the strengthening and expansion of preventive and promotive health
care services with special emphasis on Family Welfare and Maternal and Child Health with effective Out
Reach Services to the door steps of Urban Slums and shanties through scientific organizational systems.
The Project aims at (i) bringing down the mortality rates amongst children and mothers; (ii) promotion of
Family Welfare Services to accelerate decline in fertility and restricting population and growth rate.
3.    The goal is revamping the organization, service delivery and out reach systems for Family
Welfare in Urban slums and congested areas and the objectives are:
* Expansion of Family Welfare Services with emphasis on Maternal and Child Health through
various methods
* Improving the quality of services
* Strengthening the capacity to plan, manage and implement Family Welfare Programme in
Urban areas
* Increasing the participation of Private Voluntary Organizations and Private Medical
Practitioners in the programme
4.    This was to be achieved by establishing in all 180 Health Posts and 30 Post Partum Centres to
cater to the entire population of Greater Bombay. Each of these health posts caters a specific area
covering about 65000 population in slums and 1,00,000 population in non-slum areas. Until now, the
people had to come to our health centres, dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals. Under this
project, the health post staff goes to the doorsteps of our citizens to assess their needs and provides health
care either preventive, promotive or curative. We have established 176 Health Posts out of which 8
Health Posts are run in collaboration with Private Voluntary Organizations. We have also introduced



Appendix B
Page 7 of 13
Innovative Scheme with help of Private Voluntary Organizations known as Mobile Creches which render
health care services to migrant construction workers and their children. 30 Post Partum Centres have
been established under the Project.
5.     Out of 176 Health Posts, 50 Health Posts are in new constructions out of which 7 new
construction have been done and health posts have been established therein. Besides this, there were 9
new constructions for Post Partum Centres which have been completed and the Post Partum Centres have
been started therein.  We have also procured 21 ambulances for Post Partum  Centres.  Some
sophisticated items and equipments viz. Semi Auto Analyzers, Colposcopes and Ultra Sonography
Machines have been procured for rendering specialized services in our Post Partum Centres. At every
ward office and in every Municipal Hospital or Maternity Home a service-cum-information counter has
been put up. This counter is attended by para medical staff of the centre by rotation. The counter is
utilized to carry out I.E.C. activities. The application forms for birth certificates are given at this counter
so that community comes into contact with this counter. This approach has improved the use of
contraceptive devices. The condoms and oral pills are distributed free of charge at this counter. the
community is given all the information about how to use it etc. I.E.C. material of different diseases like
Gastro, T.B., Malaria, AIDS is distributed from this counter. These counters are found very useful in
building up good rapport with the community.
6.     The novel features of the project are establishment and development of (a) Management,
Information and Evaluation Systems Cell; (b) Information, Education and Communication Cell; (c)
Training Cell and increased participation of Private Voluntary Organizations and Private Medical
Practitioners.
7.     The Information, Education and Communication Cell is the mouthpiece of the project. It deals
with the following:
*  It creates awareness of the facilities and services, their benefits etc. among the slum dwellers
through different Mass Media facilities, establish inter personal communications and provide
Mass Education in communication, behavioral and social sciences through group/community
meetings. The cell is equipped with modern media machinery and equipments.
*  The training is an important feature of the project. The pre-placement, inservice, technical,
managerial and up-grading training programme is arranged from top level officers to lower
workers (macro level to micro level) and periodic assessment of the trainees and training of
trainers is undertaken by this Cell with specific responsibility of collaborating with local
training institutions. The Cell also prepares training manuals, schedules and materials for
the service delivery and various health programmes. The Private Voluntary Organizations
and Private Medical practitioners are also involved in the implementation of the project. the
Private Voluntary Organizations are involved in developing Health Posts under revised
grant-in-aid procedure with appropriate compliment of staff.  The Private Medical
Practitioners are also involved by undertaking their training in various methods of Family
Welfare to upgrade their skills, providing them with supplies of planning devices etc. so as
to achieve maximum motivation and results.
8.     The Management, Information and Evaluation System Cell is the monitor of the project in the
sense that it is responsible to develop and implement monitoring and evaluation programmes. This is

achieved through installation of computers to analyze the feedback from the health posts and provide
management tools to improve performance. This cell has developed a system to provide various
statistical data of information bases and performance factors. This cell also provides orientation and
traininig for staff about new procedures and technology for implementation of the Management,
Information and Evaluation System Plan. The main functions of this cell are Monitoring, Evaluation and
Research.
9.     The expenditure incurred on implementation of the project till 31.3.1996 is Rs.59.89 crores as
per details given in the accompanying table.
Constraints
10.    Procedural delay in purchase of equipments and instruments. Delay in purchase of ambulances,
vehicles for Mobile Health Posts for transport department. Shortage of staff. There are number of
vacancies in the category of Auxiliary Nurse Midwives but because of reservation for backward class,
we are not getting suitable candidates despite advertising the posts. Besides there is no facility of hostel
for ANMs which also results in not getting candidates.
Sustainability of the Project
I I.   The project period is over on 31st March, 1996. Under the project a big infrastructure has been
developed and the entire area of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai is covered and many other
programmes such as T.B. Control, Malaria Eradication, AIDS Control, PID Project, etc. are undertaken
in this project. The activities of the project are to be continued. The infrastructure also provides a good
system to integrate all the health care services to the periphery. The ultimate idea is to provide
Voluntary Women Health Workers to every slum family living in Mumbai and therefore this project has
to be sustained after 31st March 1996, for which sufficient budget provision for the year 1996-97 has
been made by the Corporation.
Conclusions
12.   India Population Project-V has made an impact on total health delivery system giving new
insights to both project authorities and the beneficiaries. The project although tackled one of the most
complicated area of social development has shown increasing results and has become a model in the field
of Family Welfare and Mother Child Health especially in respect of Training, I.E.C. and M.I.S., health
care service delivery and referral systems and collaboration with PVO's.
