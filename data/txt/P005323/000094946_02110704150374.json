The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. The project's successes in housing\n            finance are owed to a very large extent to good financial\n            and judicial fundamentals, and extreme care taken in\n            designing the Jordan Mortgage Refinance Company (JMRC) and\n            its lending and borrowing mechanisms to avoid both\n            uncertainties in financial contracts and distortions in the\n            sector. The legal basis for loans pledged as collateral to\n            JMRC had been researched, and framework agreements with\n            participating banks made clear. As a result, there was not a\n            single instance of a conflict arising between JMRC and a\n            bank regarding mortgage-loan collateral. The only main point\n            of contention between JMRC and banks has been the pricing of\n            JMRC's loans, with banks invariably wanting loans at\n            rates too low to support JMRC's costs of funding and\n            operations. That problem resulted from a distortion in the\n            financial sector that had not been made clear during\n            preparation. This leads to a key lesson regarding the\n            housing finance component: Deepening financial markets,\n            including creating secondary markets for loans and\n            increasing institutional investment opportunities, depends\n            not only on creating frameworks for new financing\n            mechanisms, but also most importantly on the underlying\n            market for primary lending and general economic activity."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
