medium and large scale enterprises from mid 1980 to end\n            1982. The free limit for a subproject would be raised from\n            US$600,000 to US$800,000 (similar, in real terms,for the\n            previous loans) and the aggregate free limit to US$7.0\n            million. Disbursements from the Bank's loan would be\n            made against 100% of the foreign cost of direct imports, 65%\n            of the invoice price of goods previously imported into Kenya\n            and 40% of the cost of civil works. IDB would be charging an\n            interest rate of no less than 12% on foreign funds (from\n            11%), and 13% on local funds (from 12%). Sub-borrowers will\n            continue to bear the foreign exchange risk on foreign funds.\n            The loan would carry an interest rate of 8.25% per annum and\n            the amortization schedule would conform substantially to the\n            aggregate of the amortization schedules of subloans and\n            equity investments made by IDB, with a maximum maturity of\n            15 years, including a grace period of three years."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
