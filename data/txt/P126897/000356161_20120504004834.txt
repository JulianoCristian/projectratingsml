﻿THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FIFTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE CREDIT (ERGC-5)
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Recipient:         Republic of Togo.
Implementing       The Ministry   of Economy    and Finance (MEF) coordinates the
Agency:            implementation in association with several line ministries.
Financing Data:    IDA  Credit Amount: SDR 9.1 million (US$14 million equivalent);
standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period; single
tranche.
Operation Type:    Development Policy Lending.
Main Policy        The proposed credit focuses on two main policy areas: (i) improved
Areas:             transparency and oversight in public financial management; and (ii)
advancing efficiency enhancing reforms and competitiveness in key
sectors of the economy (cotton, energy, telecommunications and banking).
Key Results        By January 2013: (i) budget information is easily accessible through the
Indicator:         togoreforme.com  website; (ii) the procurement process has been
simplified; (iii) cotton farmers are paid a predetermined share of the world
market price; (iv) the cost of mobile telephony in Togo has been reduced;
(v) at least three state owned banks have been privatized; and (vi)
management of the electricity company has been strengthened.
Program            The proposed credit supports Government-owned reforms to improve
Development        public financial management as well as structural reforms in cotton,
Objective(s) and   energy, telecommunications and banking.
Contribution to
Interim Strategy   The operation directly supports two pillars of the new ISN for FY12-13
Note (ISN):        and provides financing for the 2012 budget. The reforms supported by the
operation improve Government's ability to use public resources efficiently
and effectively and strengthen the foundation necessary for accelerated and
inclusive growth. The credit is coordinated with other IDA lending
operations, as well as the AfDB, the EU, UNDP and French bilateral aid.
Risks and risk     The main risks associated with the ERGC-5 are:
Mitigation:
Political risk. The March 2010 presidential elections were perceived by
the international community as fair and inclusive. Incumbent president
Faure Gnassingb6 was reelected with 61 percent of the votes and the main
opposition party (Union des Forces du Changement) was included in the
vi


﻿Government. This broadened the basis to implement critical reforms, but it
also led to a deep split in the opposition. The inter-party dialogue initiated
by the government within the "Cadre Permanent pour le Dialogue et la
Concertation - CPDC" to discuss constitutional and institutional reforms
has intensified in view of the parliamentary and local elections, scheduled
for the third quarter of 2012. The first phase of the CPDC discussions
ended in February 2012 with the submission to the government of a list of
key recommendations.
Government has also initiated a separate dialogue with the two
parliamentary opposition parties, i.e. the Comit6 d'Action pour le
Renouveau (CAR) and the Alliance Nationale pour le Changement (ANC).
Both parties have objections to participating in the CPDC, but in a key step
towards building a broad-based political consensus in the run-up to the
2012 elections, they have agreed in February 2012, to enter into trilateral
negotiations with the ruling party, the RPT (Rassemblement du peuple
togolais). These talks have now stalled because no agreement can be
reached. But the recent dissolution in April 2012 of the ruling party RPT,
which has been in power for over 40 years, and the creation of a new party
led by the President (Union pour le R6publique - UNIR), which is said to
be open to all Togolese people and to all skills that will help in Togo's
reconstruction process, may cause a reconfiguration of the country's
political landscape.
On the other hand, the National Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
Commission completed its work and delivered its report and
recommendations to the President who committed to implement them.
Future instability can never be ruled out completely but the expectation is
that the 2012 parliamentary and local elections, planned for October, will
be peaceful even though in the run-up to these elections strikes and
popular protests may intensify.
The World Bank will continue to monitor the situation very closely, in
collaboration with our partners. The Bank will also exert great care in its
communication strategy to avoid misinterpretation by the media of its
substantive and technical messages.
Vested interests risk. In reaching the HIPC completion point in December
2010, a major incentive for reform disappeared, increasing the space for
vested interests to delay the reform program. At the same time, greater
transparency, more accountable practices adopted by the Government in
combination with citizens who expect to benefit from the new-found
stability provide an incentive to maintain momentum in implementing the
reform agenda. Reform is furthermore facilitated by the fact that previous
reforms are starting to pay off, for instance through higher rates of
economic growth.
vii


﻿Through the proposed prior actions, the Government continues to
demonstrate its commitment to reform. Close coordination with the IMF,
AfDB, EU, and bilateral donors will help ensure that the Government
continues to give priority to structural reforms.
Macroeconomic risks stem from the vulnerability of the Togolese
economy to exogenous (commodity and climatic) shocks, the potential for
a further deterioration of the Euro crisis and a sluggish economic recovery
of the United States. Sustainable fiscal policies will provide a buffer
against the impact of these shocks but require discipline, particularly in the
run-up to a new election. There is also the risk that the open-ended fuel
subsidies will continue; and that the expenditure increases in the 2012
budget which are financed by one-off income sources will result in a
sustained long-term fiscal strain in the budget. Moreover, as an exporter of
primary commodities, Togo remains exposed to adverse shocks to
commodity demand and negative shocks to its terms of trade, particularly
as prices of some of its major exports (phosphates, cotton) have been
favorable in the recent past and may start to revert to their long term trend.
Given Togo's role as a hub for regional trade, shocks in neighboring
countries could also hurt Togo's economic prospects. While these negative
risks are real, there are also potential mitigating factors as growth rates
may be revised upward, following the successful implementation of
various structural reforms, and as the proceeds from the privatization of
banks may be more than what has been (prudently) budgeted.
To mitigate negative macroeconomic risks, the IMF and IDA will continue
to closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic performance, will carry out in-
depth policy dialogue about the budget and its composition and will
continue to support the real sector reform program with a view of
enhancing efficiency, competitiveness and levels of production. The
potential adverse commodity price shocks are mitigated by declining
production by other major phosphate producers, and restocking by cotton
consumers. This has helped sustain prices at the world market. Meanwhile,
rising levels of production are offsetting downward pressure on prices and
mitigate declines in turnover of Togo's main exports. The PFM and
banking reform supported by this operation, finally, not only help to
improve the efficiency of public investment, it also increases the resilience
of the financial sector in Togo.
Fiduciary risk. Despite recent reforms, fiduciary risk remains from
possible misuse of funds. Despite improvements through measures taken
under the Government's PFM reform program (supported through
previous ERGGs), further improving fiduciary standards remains an
important objective of the proposed operation. The prior actions of the
present operation are expected to help mitigate the fiduciary risk, and their
effective implementation will be closely monitored.
viii


﻿Implementation capacity risk arises from the lack of sufficient
professional staff and weak institutional capacity in the wake of Togo's
history of socio-political instability. Capacity to take budget planning and
execution to a higher level remains scarce and in need of reinforcement.
The capacity risk is mitigated through the provision of technical assistance
by IDA (such as the Financial Sector and Governance TA Project
supporting financial sector reform) and others (IMF, AFRITAC, AfDB,
EC and France).
Coordination risk arises from the existence of multiple public officials
involved in reforms without a clear demarcation of roles and
responsibilities. This occurs within the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(in charge of PFM reforms), between the Ministry of Finance and line
ministries (e.g. telecom reform) and between ministries and public entities
(cotton sector reform). The planned restructuring of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance will help address coordination and communication
issues within the Ministry, especially between the General Secretary and
the Permanent Secretary in charge of reform.

﻿REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FIFTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GOVERNANCE CREDIT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   This program document proposes a Fifth Economic Recovery and Governance
Credit (ERGC-5) to the Republic of Togo in the amount of SDR 9.1 million (US$14 million
equivalent). This stand-alone, one-tranche development policy credit supports the Government's
reforms. ERGC-5 aims to support the authorities' efforts to improve macro-economic
performance by strengthening transparency and oversight within public financial management,
and through measures to improve efficiency and competitiveness in cotton, energy,
telecommunications and banking. The operation follows ERGG-1, ERGG-2, ERGG-3 and
ERGG-4, operations approved by the Board in May 2008, April 2009, May 2010 and April 2011
respectively.
1.2   Reforms supported by this operation are closely aligned to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) for the period 2009-2011, which was adopted in July 2009 and
extended until 2012. The preparation of Togo's first PRSP involved the participation of all
development actors (private sector, religious groups, non-Governmental organizations,
Parliament and the technical and financial partners) and regions. This ensured that the PRSP is
broadly owned. The overarching objective of the PRSP is to achieve a sustainable improvement
of the welfare of those living in Togo by addressing the principal causes of poverty. The PRSP
aims to consolidate Togo's recovery from a prolonged socio-political crisis and to lay the basis
for structural reforms. Togo has already made significant progress in this regard. The country
reached the HIPC Completion point in December 2010, qualified for additional debt relief under
the MDRI and has benefited from the cancellation of other bilateral debt. The proposed operation
is aligned with the World Bank's Interim Strategy Note for Togo for the period FY12-13 and
complements budget support provided by the AfDB, the EU and France. The ERGC-5 is
expected to represent around 1.5 percent of the 2012 budget (total revenues and grants) and
around 33 percent of all budget support provided by development partners in 2012.
1.3   The proposed ERGC-5 supports the Government's reforms and helps lay the
foundation for sustained and inclusive growth. Togo's institutions of economic and financial
management remain fragile and require further efforts to be strengthened. The ERGC-5 builds on
reforms supported by ERGG-4 and its predecessors which supported reforms in fiscal
governance, public enterprises (energy, phosphate and cotton) and financial sector. The first
ERGGs focused on basics such as settling of arrears with the World Bank and domestic
stakeholders, restructuring the cotton sector, enhancing the availability of electricity and
supporting (the creation of) procedures and institutions to budget planning and execution
(separation of accounting, revenue and payment functions by the treasury; creation of IGF and
Cour de Comptes). Subsequent operations focused on improving the efficiency and transparency
of PFM process, strengthening of budget process with policy actions related to budget planning
and execution (publication of public procurements; publication of budget execution reports)
while also strengthening transparency in the natural resources sector (EITI membership) and the
efficiency of the electricity and cotton and phosphate companies.
1


﻿1.4   The proposed ERGC-5 deepens the implementation of PFM      reforms and shifts
attention towards structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. PFM reforms focus on
priority areas identified as weak by recent analytical work. As more development partners
become active in PFM, the ERGC shifts attention towards areas in which the World Bank has a
comparative advantage: structural reforms. The proposed ERGC-5 will strengthen the cotton
sector through measures that improve insight in the cost structure of the cotton company (NSCT)
and that lay the foundation for attracting private investors; will improve the management of the
electricity company; will provide a clear path towards a competitive telecommunications sector;
and will support the privatization of four state owned banks thereby generating revenue for the
government and putting the banking sector on a more solid footing.
1.5   The proposed operation is a stand-alone; future operations are expected to be part
of a series. The current PRSP expires in 2012 and the authorities in Togo are preparing a new
PRSP which is expected to be finalized mid-2012. Once the next PRSP is ready, a Country
Assistance Strategy will be prepared. In the meantime IDA's assistance program is guided by an
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed by the Board in January 2012. It was deemed prudent for
this operation to be stand alone because the proposed operation is prepared while a CAS nor
PRSP II can provide longer term guidance. Future Development Policy Operations will have the
benefit of the new PRSP, and are therefore expected to be prepared as series.
1.6   The proposed operation seeks to provide financial support to the Government to meet its
financing needs and to facilitate the execution of the ongoing reform program. Full delivery of
HIPC and MDRI debt relief, and additional multilateral and bilateral debt relief reduced Togo's
external debt burden significantly, and already created fiscal space to improve public spending
which helped to progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
proposed amount of this operation is SDR 9.1 million (US$14 million equivalent) and is
provided on IDA credit terms (and not as a grant unlike previous budget support operations).
This is because in FY12 Togo has been assessed as facing a moderate risk of debt distress, as a
result of which the country received 55 percent of its FY12 IDA allocation as credits and 45
percent as grants. The terms of IDA financing for FY13 and FY14 will be confirmed based on
the latest DSAs available at the time when the allocations exercise for these years is performed.
2. TOGO'S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS
A. BACKGROUND
2.1    Togo is one of the smaller countries in Africa, whose economic potential lies in
agriculture, mining, transit trade and services. Togo has a history of political instability and
weak economic and financial management. This negatively affected the country's economic
development, which was aggravated by the withdrawal of donor support in the 1990s. This led to
more than a decade of isolation, mounting arrears, a dire financial situation of state-owned
enterprises operating in cotton and phosphate, an excessive share of nonperforming loans in the
banking sector, and declining per capita incomes. The nadir was reached in August 2006, when
the Global Political Accord was signed between the main political parties. This laid the basis for
parliamentary elections in 2007 and reengagement by the donors. The re-election of President
Faure Gnassingb6 in March 2010 in elections that were deemed free and transparent marked the

lhe authorities have also increased spending on agriculture and the share of agriculture spending
in the 2010 budget was 10 percent. Resources allocated to social safety nets for the most
vulnerable groups remain limited, however, to about 0. 5 percent of GDP during 2008 - 20 10.

3Thanks to the school fee abolition reform, Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) continues to increase at all levels.
However, the corresponding MDG will not be met by 2015 but is likely to be met in 2020 (as planned in the
National Education Sector Plan). The primary completion rate (PCR) is 76% in 20 10/11. Although Togo is still in
the top-half of Sub-Saharan countries, reaching 100% completion rate remains a challenge. Thanks to the school
fees abolition which started in 2008/09, there is universal access to primary first grade (Gross Intake Rate=145%)
but the education system still faces a high level of drop-outs. Only 66% of grade 1 new entrants complete the
primary cycle (compared to 7 1% on average in SSA). The problem of drop-outs is due to both a lack of classrooms
(11% of Togolese schools have not enough facilities for providing education to all the six grades of primary) and to
the fragility of demand for schooling.
4 The goals which are unlikely to be met aim to (1) eradicate extreme poverty, (2) promote gender equality, (3)
primary education for all, (4) reduce child mortality, (5) improve maternal health, and (6) ensure environmental
sustainability.

﻿directives stipulating that by 2017 all WAEMU countries should have adopted program
budgeting and MTEF frameworks. Reforms encompass budget preparation, execution, controls
and public procurement and are reflected in the 2010 public financial management strategy and
its action plan for 2011-2013. Recent reforms include the preparation of legal acts to transpose
the WAEMU directives into national law, the publication of quarterly budget execution reports,
the utilization of an automated system to produce annual budget execution accounts (SIGFIP),
setting up of oversight bodies such as the Court of Accounts and the IGF (Inspection G6n6rale
des Finances) and the creation of a procurement website and the publication of a procurement
news letter. However, challenges remain regarding the quality of budget preparation, the
efficiency of budget execution, cash management and the effectiveness of the internal and
external controls.
2.5   The structure of Togo's exports has changed considerably over the past 10 years.
Around the year 2000, cotton, phosphates and cement were Togo's main export commodities,
constituting respectively 33 percent, 25 percent and 23 percent of exports.5 Ten years later,
cotton and cement are no longer the top three export commodities, and have been replaced by
clinker (23 percent of Togo's exports) and metals (20 percent of exports). Phosphates (19 percent
of exports) remain in the top three. With the development of new export industries in clinker and
metals and with an almost five-fold increase of exports in the 'other' category, Togo's economy
has demonstrated its ability to innovate. And with good growth prospects in the cotton and
phosphate sectors, Togo's exports are well placed to continue to grow rapidly in the near future.
2.6   To recover from a period of poor economic management, structural reforms are
being pursued. Reforms in the cotton sector were initiated with a strategic audit of the sector,
two financial audits of the former state-owned cotton company, the establishment of a new
cotton company,6 the clearance of the cotton company's arrears to farmers, the introduction of
internal controls, the adoption of a cotton price mechanism linking farm gate prices to world
market prices and training of farmer leaders towards a better participation within the NSCT
board. In the phosphate sector, a strategic audit was conducted, followed by the preparation of a
three-year-business plan, the adoption of a phosphate sector strategy in 2010, and the approval of
Togo's EITI candidacy status in October 2010. In telecommunications, a new sector policy was
adopted in May 2011 while a new telecommunications law, transposing WAEMU directives into
national law, was discussed by the national assembly in January 2012. In the electricity sector,
generating capacity was expanded with a 100MW power generation plant operated by Contour
Global, a Board of Directors was established for the electricity utility company, CEET, new
statutes harmonized with WAEMU corporate law were adopted, a five-year contract between
CEET and the government was signed, and a utility tariff adjustment mechanism was adopted in
2010. The Government made much progress clearing up arrears to the private sector and in the
financial sector three ailing state-owned banks were recapitalized by an exchange of provisioned
bad debt for Government securities (CFAF 88.1 billion). These three banks, plus one other state
owned bank have subsequently been put up for privatization.
The group 'other' is excluded here.

producers association has 40 percent.

﻿Box 2.1: Togo's Economy in Short
Together with other countries from the West African Economic Monetary Union (WAEMU) Togo maintains a fixed
exchange rate regime (a hard peg to the Euro, with own legal tender (the CFA Franc). The country's real exchange
rate has followed a slightly appreciating trend ever since 1994. In that year, the nominal exchange rate depreciated
100% against the euro, a factor that significantly affected prices (62% of consumer inflation between the end of
1993 and 1995) and increased poverty. Terms of trade have been volatile, linked to international prices of the
country's main export commodities, and those of imported food and energy (the country imports 100% of its
petroleum needs). Terms of trade have slightly deteriorated in the first half of the last decade, but improved starting
in 2007. The country sustains current account deficits that are financed by inflows through the capital and financial
account, in particular project grants and concessional loans. Togo's current account deficits are in line with the norm
for a low income African country that receives aid inflows. Nonetheless, the country's ability to sustain the
projected current deficits (6-7 percent of GDP) over the medium-term depends on the expected increase in aid
inflows (consistent with donor pledges) or other, non-debt-creating inflows such as FDI.
Monetary policy is determined by the regional central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO, by
its French name), which prioritizes the control of inflation and the maintenance of the peg to the euro, which is
guaranteed by the French Treasury. Monetary policy is therefore influenced by that of the European Central Bank
(ECB). The BCEAO's discount rate broadly reflects movements in the ECB's key interbank rate, although BCEAO
rates are typically higher than ECB rates and take account of the prevailing circumstances of member states, such as
inflation and bank liquidity.
The country's fiscal stance has improved in recent years, especially since the introduction of an IMF Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) from October 2006 to June 2007 and a subsequent three-year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF), which was completed satisfactorily in 2011. Donor funding (especially from EU and IDA) has increased
after full IMF reengagements in the country, following free and fair parliamentary elections in 2007. In fact, Togo
began clearing external debt arrears under the SMP, paving the way for fresh funding, and reached the completion
point under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) debt initiative at the end of 2010.
Togo is essentially a rural, agricultural economy: Half of the output, two thirds of workers and over 80% of exports
are linked to the primary sector. Most food crops are produced by subsistence farmers who operate on small family
farms and produce items such as manioc, sorghum, yams and maize. Leading cash crops are cotton, coffee and
cocoa, followed by palm kernels, copra and peanuts. Over 40% of land in the country is arable. There exists a state-
owned company for cotton, the Nouvelle Soci6t6 Cotonnire du Togo that according to the Government's strategy
will be put up for privatization soon.
The services sector employs about 1/5th of the workforce, with key subsectors including commerce, public services
and transport and communications. The port of the capital, Lom6, is a key asset and plays an important part in
regional trade, especially after conflict in neighboring countries caused a shift of international trade through Togo.
The banking sector suffered from the dismal economic performance in the 1980s and 1990s, as they had heavily lent
to para-statal enterprises. The sector is being revitalized and four state-owned bank have been put up for
privatization.
Together with agriculture, trade and transport, secondary sector activities in phosphate mining, agro-processing,
cement and clinker constitute the main economic activities in Togo. In 2007, The government returned the mines to
full state control with the formation of the Soci6t6 Nouvelle des Phosphates de Togo (SNPT). SNPT capital has
largely been depleted and an investment plan is being implemented. Phosphate production is expected to increase
significantly starting the second quarter of 2012. Meanwhile, the government is seeking interested parties to develop
Togo's carbonated phospate reserves, something that is expected to require upwards of US$1 billion in investments.
The 1989 Free Zone (FZ) law gave companies the advantages of a tax holiday, duty-free imports of materials for
production, a less restrictive labor code, and the ability to hold foreign-currency accounts. By 2005 there were about
60 firms operating in the FZ, employing 9,000 workers. Changes in FZ's fiscal regime were introduced in 2009 that
attempt to improve tax collection and a new FZ law is being finalized.

﻿2.7    Reforms are paying off. Togo's growth rates keep being revised upward. For instance,
where the IMF's Fifth Review of its ECF arrangement published in January 2011 projected a
growth rate of 3.7 percent for 2011 (up from 3.5 percent in the previous review), the Article Four
Consultation released in August 2011 projected the growth rate to be 3.9 percent. By the end of
2011, growth was put at 4.1 percent and during the latest revision in April 2012 growth was
finally put at 4.5 percent. Growth is broad based, and fastest in the secondary sector. Cotton and
phosphate production are increasing, credit to the private sector is increasing steadily and Togo
has started to attract interest from

remain. Simulations demonstrate
Source: World Bank, Financial satistics data base      that higher rates of growth are
needed to achieve rapid reductions
in poverty7 and to achieve middle
income status. Growth prospects remain constrained by Togo's underdeveloped infrastructure,
weak institutional capacity and vulnerability to trade and weather shocks. The World Bank's
2010 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment marks Togo as a "weak performer" (2.9) and
the business environment remains poor: in the latest Doing Business ranking, Togo even dropped
four places to achieve rank 162. According to certain indicators, corruption increased, further
straining the business environment.8 Telecommunication services are of low quality and costly,
as evidenced by Togo's ranking on the ITU's cost of telecom index (161st out of 165 countries,
2011). Meanwhile, Togo's dependence on rain fed agriculture and cotton and phosphate exports
expose the country's growth record to terms of trade and weather shocks.
B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.9    Economic growth accelerated slightly in 2011. GDP growth is projected to have
attained 4.5 percent in 2011, compared to 4.0 percent in 2010. Growth rates started to increase in
2009 after two years in which growth was depressed due to flood damage and surges in
international oil and domestic food prices. Economic growth appears to benefit from earlier
reforms and has been driven by agricultural production, manufacturing (including extractive

new poverty estimates are expected to become available towards the end of 2012.

﻿industries)9 and public works. Growth in 2011 is expected to be highest in the manufacturing
sector fuelled by an increase of phosphate and clinker production (4.8 percent, y-o-y). In the
primary sector, growth (4 percent, y-o-y) has mainly been driven by a rebound in cotton
production and, to a lesser degree, by cocoa production.

significantly.  Initially,  the  Source: World Bank Commodities Group and DGSCN
authorities kept prices at the
pump unchanged and only in June were international price increases passed through to the
consumer. The pass through was partial, however, and was stopped altogether in August. As a
consequence, a hole was left in the budget equivalent to 2 percent of GDP. At the same time, the
impact on inflation remained limited. According to the ITMF, inflation was projected not to
exceed 3.6 percent in 2011, higher than the 1.4 percent recorded in 20 10 but still moderate. The
government has increased public investments significantly. The 2011 budget had a clear pro-
growth fiscal stance allocating 33 percent of the approved budget to public investment. Years of
underinvestment in public infrastructure during the years of political turmoil, aggravated by
major floods in 2008 which did great damage to bridges and highways, justify an emphasis on
public works. And even though the ambition expressed in the budget was not fully realized,
public investments increased significantly. In 2007 they were 2 percent of GDP, this increased to
5.5 percent in 2009 and by 2011 public investments were 8. 1 percent of GDP.
2.11   The government continues to pursue a moderate fiscal policy stance. The overall
fiscal deficit (on payment order basis) is projected to increase to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2011
from an estimated 1.6 percent in 2010. The domestic primary balance is projected to turn
negative in 2011 (-1.0 percent of GDP), following a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2010 as a
result of Togo's expansionist public investment program. The fiscal deficit is considered to be
congruent with the TAVI's latest ECF-supported program as the increased level of public
investments is temporary and as the cumulative fiscal balances for 2008 - 2011 have been
consistent with the target of a domestic primary balance close to zero. The latter has been quite

﻿an achievement, because the period was characterized by major weather shocks requiring
emergency interventions and destroying critical public infrastructure.
2.12    Revenue collection exceeded expectations in 2011 and attained 18.5 percent of GDP.
This is the second year in a row that revenue collection exceeds expectations. In 2010, total
revenues represented 18.8 percent of GDP, comfortably above the WAEMU guideline of 17
percent. The increase in revenue was driven by VAT and import-based tax collection which
benefitted from the economic recovery and improved efficiency in tax administration. Non-tax
revenues fell short of expectations as the foreseen sale of a third mobile telephone license
(equivalent of 1.2 percent of GDP) did not materialize in 2011.

﻿2.13   Total expenditures increased by 2.4 percent in 2011 due to costly fuel price subsidies
(2.0 percent of GDP),'o accompanying social expenditures and an increase in the wage bill.
Total expenditures attained 24.7 percent in 2011 compared to an estimated 22.4 percent in 2010.
This increase is mainly driven by costly fuel price subsidies introduced in December 2010.
Concerned about the high cost of these subsidies, the authorities and the IMF agreed to gradually
abolish them starting in June 2011. The authorities did so between June-August 2011, but
stopped after raising fuel prices by approximately 10 percent in response to public protests and
opposition from the unions. Temporary social expenditures to the tune of 0.2 percent of GDP to
cushion the social impact of the fuel price increases continue to be paid. These include the
suspension of direct taxes on transporters, so as to reduce their costs, and the granting of
transportation allowances for university students, as well as government employees, pensioners,
and salaried workers in the private sector earning less than CFAF 35,000, or the equivalent of
US$76, a month. The wage bill increased to 5.9 percent of GDP compared to 5.2 percent in 2010
representing 33.5 percent of tax revenues and below the WAEMU guideline of 35 percent.
2.14   Despite a pro-growth stance, there are fiscal risks that warrant monitoring. The
outlays for fuel price subsidies along with spending on compensatory social measures have
required cuts in the budget to maintain a prudent fiscal stance. In consultation with IMF staff
certain investment expenditures were deferred to the 2012 budget, and it remains to be seen
whether in 2012 again, fuel price subsidies may crowd out public investments especially as the
subsidies are expected to amount to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2012 (based on current WEO
projections). On the other hand, despite the fuel price subsidy crowding out some public
investment in 2011, these investments increased by 12% compared to the previous year.
Expressed in CFAF, public investments increased from CFAF 82 billion in 2009, to CFAF 124
billion in 2010 to CFAF 138 billion in    Figure 2.4: Approved budget versus executed budget
2011. Other elements deserving to be

this increase was due to increases in
the investment budget which went up
from  CFAF 100 billion to CFAF 230 billion in 2011 (a 130 percent increase). Current
expenditures on the other hand increased from CFAF 211 billion in 2009 to CFAF 256 in 2011

﻿(21 percent increase). But whereas recurrent spending remained in line with what was budgeted,
the execution rate on public investment dropped significantly from 82 percent to 60 percent
despite the actual spending increasing from CFAF 82 billion in 2009 to CFAF 138 billion in
2011 (a 68 percent increase). These developments put the robustness of the budget process as a
planning tool at risk. A Public Expenditure Review (PER) planned for FY 2012 is expected to
delve deeper into the reasons behind the under-expenditure in public investment.

﻿2.16  The current account deficit is projected to increase to 6.2 percent in 2011 from 5.9
percent in 2010 as imports are growing faster than exports, due to higher global oil prices
and capital goods imports. Export performance is projected to improve slightly in 2011, led by
brisk transit trade and exports of cement/clinker, phosphates and cotton. Phosphate exports
benefitted from strong international prices and improved production. Cotton exports increased
significantly as world cotton prices remained high and production increased. Overall exports are
projected to increase slightly in 2011 to 40.7 percent of GDP compared to 39.9 percent in 2010
and 36.7 percent in 2009. Driven by public works, imports are projected to increase in 2011 to
58.4 percent of GDP from 55.0 percent in 2010 and 52.3 percent in 2009. Remittances,
representing almost 8 percent of GDP, are projected to increase by around 0.4 percent in 2011
compared to 2010. FDI is projected to increase by more than 60 percent in 2011 compared to
2010. While this increase is significant, in absolute terms FDI remain low: around 1 percent of
GDP. Gross international reserves are projected to cover 6.1 months of prospective imports by
end 2011, compared to 6.5 months in 2010.
2.17 Monetary developments have been favorable in 2011 and 2010. A rebound in
economic confidence stimulated a pick up in the lending activities of the banking system. Credit
to the private sector is estimated to have expanded by 17.5 percent in 2011, following an
expansion by 10.3 percent in 2010. The rate of growth of broad money is projected to slow a
little to 13 percent relative to an estimated 16.3 percent in 2010. The increase in money supply
has not led to significant inflationary pressures.
2.18  The government completed the ECF-supported program in July 2011 in a generally
satisfactory manner. The IMF considers that the program has largely achieved its objectives
(formulated in 2008) of: (i) bringing public debt to sustainable level through fiscal adjustment
and HIPC/MDRI debt relief; (ii) facilitating the resumption of external assistance; (iii) increasing
resources for infrastructure, health, and education; (iv) strengthening fiscal governance; (v)
restructuring fragile banks; and (vi) reforming the business environment and state-owned
enterprises. The first four objectives have been fully achieved, bank privatization is ongoing
while phosphate production has not yet fully recovered. As a consequence of the reforms, per
capita incomes have started to rise modestly. A new ECF arrangement is expected to be agreed
between the IMF and the authorities in 2012; preparations have started following the successful
completion of the national forum (of late March 2012) which evaluated the first ECF program
and discussed priorities for the next PRSP.
C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
2.19  Growth is expected to remain high and possibly to increase further over the next
three years. GDP growth is projected to be 5.2 percent in 2012, 4.8 percent in 2013 and 4.8 in
2014, driven by an expected improvement in phosphate production, sustained clinker/cement
production, and anticipated increases in cotton production. Transit trade and port activities are
also expected to contribute to growth driven by the expansion of the container terminal. Over the
medium-term, private investment in sectors that are currently undergoing structural reforms
(bank privatization, opening up of the telecom sector, increased private sector participation in the
phosphate and cotton sectors) coupled with improved financial intermediation and upgrades to
public infrastructure are expected to contribute to higher growth. The crises in Europe and the
United States are not expected to have a significant impact on the economy in the short-term but
11


﻿remain major sources of uncertainty. Prices for some key export commodities (phosphate,
cotton) are expected to decline a bit,1 but the impact on the terms of trade is likely to be
compensated by higher levels of production and lower oil prices which are also expected to ease.
The main risks to the country's growth outlook remain related to weather shocks and large and
unexpected swings in the prices of Togo's main exports and imports.
2.20   Inflation is projected to remain below 2.5 percent. The WAEMU currency union and
continued fiscal moderation are expected to anchor inflation and ensure price stability. Inflation
is projected to attain 2.4 percent (average) during 2012-2014 but could prove to be erratic in the
event of unfavorable weather or volatility in food and international oil prices.
2.21   The budget for 2012, while largely balanced, raises some concerns. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for October 2012, and the draft 2012 budget shows some signs of this.
The overall budget deficit is expected to increase to 6.2 percent of GDP following significant
increases in the wage bill (18.5 percent) and transfers (19.5 percent). Attention needs to be paid
to the fact that these spending increases will be financed from non-permanent and uncertain
sources, in particular proceeds from attracting a strategic investor in Togo Telecom and the four
bank privatizations. Meanwhile, fuel subsidies are likely to continue to burden the 2012 budget
particularly if international oil prices continue to remain high. On the positive side, the proceeds
from the sale of the four state owned banks have been budgeted in a cautious manner, and may
very well turn out to be higher than expected. The primary balance will decrease as well (to -2.6
percent of GDP). Yet as the authorities remain committed to fiscal discipline as agreed under the
latest IMF's ECF-supported program the primary balance is expected to improve by 2013 to 1.5
percent of GDP.12 The budget deficit is expected to be financed primarily from external sources,
mainly from IDA, European Union, African Development Bank, the IMF and France.

2.22   The sale of the third mobile telephone license is not reflected in the 2012 budget.
Initially, the sale of a third mobile license was foreseen for 2011 and when this did not
materialize it was initially expected to take place in 2012. But after due consideration, the
1 The envisaged declines in the prices of Togo's main exports is limited as clinker is exported within the region, as
the global production of phosphate has been reduced and as consumers of cotton are rebuilding their stocks after the
stocks were drawn down following the exceptionally high prices of last season.
12 The IMF mission during October 20 - 27 acknowledged the need to increase some current spending, but it
cautioned the authorities against committing to irreversible current expenditure. It also drew the authorities'
attention regarding the risks associated with across-the-board increases and the need to focus on the implementation
of consistent wage reforms. The wage reform consists of implementing the UNDP-sponsored wage grid that would
allow average salaries to catch up with the government wages in neighboring countries.
12


﻿authorities have decided to delay the sale of the third license until the competitiveness of the
incumbent has been strengthened.
2.23   The medium    term  outlook reflects the government's efforts to improve public
infrastructure. For 2013 and 2014, the domestic primary balance is expected to remain negative
(-1.5 percent of GDP) before turning to zero from 2015 onward. The main reason for this is that
in an effort to improve infrastructure, levels of public investment are expected to rise from 10.6
percent of GDP in 2012 to 12.4 and 12.9 percent of GDP in respectively 2013 and 2014, before
returning to 9.6 percent of GDP by 2015. Total revenue (including grants) is expected to stay
between 22 and 23 percent of GDP. Public expenditure is expected to remain relatively high in
2013 and 2014 at 28.2 and 28.7 percent of GDP before easing to 25.5 percent of GDP in 2015
primarily because of reductions in public investments. Oil subsidies are expected to have been
phased out by 2013.
2.24   Togo's external position is projected to remain largely unchanged in the medium
term. The current account deficit for 2012-2013 is projected to be at about 8 percent. The
balance of payments will remain vulnerable to terms of trade shocks (in particular from oil prices
and changes in the prices of cotton and phosphate) and exchange rate volatility of the Euro (to
which Togo's currency is fixed) vis-d-vis the US dollar. FDI, private capital inflows and foreign
aid are expected to increase over the medium-term, as structural reforms unfold, economic
confidence is regained and overall governance improves.
2.25   Togo successfully reached the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative
in December 2010 and also qualified for additional debt relief under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI). The HIPC assistance in present value terms was estimated at
completion point to be US$282 million:13 US$155 million was delivered by multilateral creditors
and US$127 million by bilateral and commercial creditors.14 As a result, the nominal debt stock
fell from US$1.7 billion at end 2009 to US$0.5 billion at end 2010. The authorities continue to
make efforts to reach agreements with the non-Paris club bilateral creditors as well as with other
official and commercial creditors on the provision of debt relief on terms comparable to the relief
accorded in the context of the HIPC initiative.
2.26   The update of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (August 2011) indicates that Togo is
at moderate risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, Togo is estimated to grow at
around 4 percent per annum, public investment is projected to accelerate starting in 2012,
reaching 12.6 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 and then reverting back to levels close to the
ones observed in 2011. Inflation over the long-term is projected to remain stable at around 2
percent and external financing is initially mostly on grant and highly concessional terms, with
less concessional financing gradually picking up, leading to a decrease in the grant element of
new financing (see annex 6 for more details). Under this baseline scenario, the present value of
Togo's public and publicly guaranteed debt is around 16 percent of GDP in 2011 and will remain
below the 30 percent threshold until the end of 2031.15 On average, the present value of debt-to-
 Togo did not qualify for topping-up under the enhanced HIPC Initiative based on end-2009 debt data.
14 Switzerland, Italy and Germany cancelled Togo's bilateral debt and the cancellation of debt to the African
Development Bank is underway.
1 In the baseline scenario the assumption is that concessional lending will go down substantially; the
concessionality of new loans decreases from 35 percent to close to 5 percent over the DSA period --2011 till 2031.
13


﻿GDP ratio is 23.2 percent over the whole period. The present value of external debt to revenues
and exports will stay below the 200 percent and 100 percent thresholds, respectively until the end
of the same period. Nevertheless, the three ratios will increase substantially over the projected
period due to a declining share of concessional loans in new financing.16 Stress tests suggest that
the debt outlook is vulnerable to less favorable terms on new financing and highly sensitive to
lower rates of growth.
2.27    Togo meets most WAEMU convergence criteria. The regional Convergence, Stability,
Growth and Solidarity Pact, adopted by the Conference of Heads of State of WAEMU in
December 1999 as an additional act to the WAEMU Treaty, is a formal agreement among the
member countries of the WAEMU aimed at (i) strengthening convergence of the economies of
the member countries; (ii) reinforcing macroeconomic stability; (iii) accelerating economic
growth; and (iv) enhancing solidarity among the member countries. One notes that in the
medium term, Togo is expected to meet all primary convergence criteria, with the exception of
the criteria on the primary balance which is related to Togo's public investment drive. Of the
secondary criteria Togo is expected to meet half; the ones on wages and salaries and external
account deficit are likely to be missed due to the recent increases in wages and again, as a result
of the foreseen increases in public investment.

2.28    The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed
operation. The Government has a promising track record in maintaining prudent
macroeconomic policies and the framework put in place with the support of the IMF ECF
program remains largely intact. In the short run, due to high levels of public investment the
primary budget is expected to become negative, but by 2015 the primary budget is expected to be
balanced again. The WAEMU convergence criteria will largely be met, though monitoring
remains required in particular regarding the wage bill and the financing of the fiscal deficit. In
addition, one will need to remain vigilant to the occurrence of terms of trade and weather shocks.
16 This is envisaged decline in concessionality of new loans is from a 35 percent at present to 5 percent by 2031.

﻿3. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
3.1   Togo adopted its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) in July 2009. The
PRSP-I lays down the country's strategy for growth and poverty reduction for the period 2009-
2011. PRSP-I was prepared in a participatory manner, including all major actors involved in
Togo's development process (including development partners) and involved participants from all
of Togo's regions. Consultations were held at all three key stages of the process: (i) the adoption
of a road map outlining the PRSP process; (ii) the diagnostic phase; and (iii) the preparation and
adoption of the final document. As the PRSP-I expired at the end of June 2011 and the
preparations of the PRSP-II were launched in October 2011, the Government extended the
PRSP-I for another year until the new PRSP is completed by mid-2012. The PRSP-I was
accompanied by a Plan of Priority Actions (PAP). The overarching objective of the PRSP is to
achieve effective and sustainable improvement of people's living conditions by addressing the
principal causes of poverty.
3.2   The PRSP-I guides the preparation of the ERGC-5 through its four broad strategic
orientations which are: (i) strengthening of governance, with a focus on political, institutional
and economic governance; (ii) consolidation of the bases for strong and sustained growth with
measures to reform state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, improve the business
environment, strengthen regional integration and trade, revive agricultural production,
rehabilitate infrastructure, and improve management of natural resources and the environment;
(iii) development of human capital with a focus on improving access to and the quality of basic
education and health services; and (iv) reduction of regional imbalances and promotion of
community development. The PRSP also integrates cross-cutting themes on environment,
HIV/AIDS, gender and human rights.
3.3   The ERGC-5 supports the Government's reform program as outlined in the PRSP-I
with a focus on structural reforms. ERGC-5 supports the implementation of reforms under the
first and the second pillar of the PRSP-I and engages the World Bank in policy and technical
dialogue on enhancing transparency and oversight in public financial management and
advancing efficiency and growth enhancing reforms in cotton, energy, telecommunications and
banking. The financial support provided through ERGC-5 will help the Government meet its
financing needs and complement resources available from domestic revenues and other donor
support. The next sections highlight the key issues which characterize the reform areas, the
Government's policy focus and specific measures supported by the proposed credit. The
Government's policy matrix is presented in Annex 2.
4. BANK GROUP'S SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A. LINK TO THE INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE AND THE AFRICA STRATEGY
4.1   A new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was presented to the Board in January 2012. The
ISN updates the 2008 ISN and is based on the Government's first (and extended) PRSP.
Informed by the new PRSP, the Bank intends to prepare a regular Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) at the end of the ISN period, at which time a consultative group will also be organized.
15


﻿4.2   Consistent with the PRSP I, the new ISN supports the following objectives:
(i)  deepen economic recovery and promote sustainable development, through a focus on
improving the business and investment climate, increased agriculture productivity and
crop output, and improved access to productive infrastructure;
(ii) improve economic governance through improved management and restructuring of key
public enterprises and banks, improved and transparent public financial management, and
enhanced procurement system and external budget controls; and
(iii) address urgent poverty reduction and social needs through improved access of
communities to basic social and local development services, improved quality of and
access to basic education and health services, improved access to social protection
services, and improved management of environmental and natural disasters.
4.3   The proposed ERGC-5 is an integral part of the ISN. The proposed operation is
closely aligned with the ISN's strategic objectives. It directly supports the first two ISN pillars,
by focusing on strengthening public financial management and stepping up structural reforms in
cotton, energy, telecommunications and banking. The choice of sectors reflects the third pillar of
the ISN as reforms in cotton and telecommunications are believed to be particularly important
for poverty reduction. The reforms supported by ERGC-5 are important to the Government's
ability to use public resources efficiently and effectively and to accelerate economic and social
development while the financial support will assist the Government meet its financing needs.
4.4   The areas of focus of ERGC-5 are closely aligned with the Africa Strategy. The
Africa strategy has three themes: competitiveness and employment, vulnerability and resilience
and governance and public sector capacity. With its focus on enhancing competitiveness through
real sector reforms, the proposed operation is closely aligned with the first pillar of the Africa
Strategy. And by strengthening public financial management and the public availability of
budget documents, and by collaborating closely with the authorities in developing BOOST (a
database for budget analysis), this operation is closely aligned with the strategy's foundation of
Governance and Public Sector Capacity, with its focus on improving public sector capacity to
manage accounts but also enhanced access to information by citizens.
B. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANK GROUP ACTIVITIES
4.5   The proposed ERGC complements several ongoing IDA operations and advisory
services. ERGC's focus on enhancing competitiveness is completed by work on Doing Business,
and the Private Sector Development Operation (FY11, US$13 million) which supports
investment climate reforms, the development of a new Free Zone, and which provides business
training to targeted micro and small enterprises. ERGC-5's work on the banking sector is
complemented by the Financial Sector Reform and Governance Project (FY09). ERGC-5's
activities in cotton benefit from support offered by the multi-donor Agriculture Sector Support
Project (PASA, FY11, US$37 million) to strengthen the cotton producer organization and to
support the privatization study of the NSCT. ERGC-5's dialogue on telecommunications is
complemented by the West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (FY13,
US$30 million) which deals with ensuring Togo's access to international communications
infrastructure. Work on energy, finally, is complemented by the Emergency Infrastructure
16


﻿Rehabilitation and Energy Project (FY09, US$41.82 million). This project is helping to
rehabilitate critical infrastructure in and around Lom6 including roads, drainage and water
supply. Under the GEF component of the project, electricity transformer stations have been
rehabilitated and the electricity network to Lom6 is being extended. An additional financing ($14
million) is under preparation (early FY13).
4.6   Other projects on transport, community development, education and health services
also inform ERGC-5. The ERGC-5 team benefits from dialogue carried out under the Bank-
financed Abidjan-Lagos Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (FY10, US$33 million) in
particular with respect to discussions about the establishment of a road fund. Furthermore, the
ERGC-5 team consults with the ongoing Community Development Project (FY08, $25.9
million) for which a second phase was approved (FY12, US$14 million). Likewise, the team
regularly consults with the mining team (particularly on phosphates and EITI) and the education
team providing technical assistance in support of the 2010-2020 Education Sector Plan and
implementing the $45 million Education for All grant.
4.7   Non-lending instruments complement ERGC-5 support. A       Country Economic
Memorandum / Diagnostic Trade Integration Study were completed in FY10 along with an
Investment Climate Assessment. In 2011 and in partnership with NEPAD, IDA prepared a public
expenditure review of the agricultural sector which helped identify future areas for reform. A
Public Expenditure Review of the Agricultural Sector (FY12) was completed in December 2011.
It informs the dialogue on cotton and has helped to identifying future areas for reform
(particularly related to fertilizer and the national food security). An ESW on poverty and gender
is under preparation. The team is involved in an application by DGSCN for a TFSCB to
strengthen statistics.
4.8   Dialogue with the authorities on cotton, telecommunications and banking as part of
recent missions have helped lay the basis for the proposed credit. In 2011, the Bank
undertook two missions to review the telecommunication sector in the context of the upcoming
WARCIP-2. The Bank has reviewed the producer price mechanism used in the cotton sector. In
the banking sector, IDA contributed to the preparation of the financial sector development
strategy which review all financial subsectors (banks, micro finance insurance, social security).
An environmental analysis was carried out in 2010, including among others the agricultural
(cotton) and electricity sectors. The country's macroeconomic performance and planned policies
have been assessed during joint IMF-Bank missions, the most recent being in May 2011 for the
completion of the ECF-supported program.
C. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNER PROGRAMS
4.9   IDA and other development partners continue to identify jointly complementary
areas of support. This creates synergies and leverages IDA's comparative advantage. The
European Union, the AfDB and France also support the Government's reforms through their
respective budget support operations. IDA collaborates closely with these partners to avoid
duplication of effort and to ensure complementarity. Joint missions and analytical work further
facilitate a joint dialogue with the authorities,
17


﻿4.10  IMF and IDA staffs coordinate closely their advice and technical assistance.
Although the latest IMF ECF-supported program ended in July 2011, IDA and the IMF continue
to collaborate closely on key areas of reforms. Analytical work is shared and technical assistance
to the country coordinated. Follow up on the implementation of PFM reforms is also done in
close collaboration with the IMF. The World Bank and the IMF also work together on bank
restructuring and other structural reforms (such as ensuring a favorable environment for the
private sector). A good illustration of the close working relations with the IMF are the reforms in
the financial sector which were first supported by the ERGG-1 and the ERGG-2, then, based on
the principle of avoiding cross-conditionality, dropped from ERGG-3 and the ERGG-4 as they
were supported by the IMF ECF program, and currently reintroduced into ERGC-5 as the IMF
program has been completed.
4.11  The AfDB, EU, IMF and IDA coordinate their interventions on PFM reforms. The
European Union will focus its efforts on the provision of technical assistance to improve public
financial management with a focus on enhancing transparency and public oversight thereby
complementing assistance provided by France (treasury management) and the AfDB (notably
public procurement and capacity building for control institutions). In addition, the IMF focuses
its technical assistance in helping the authorities monitor budget execution, implementing a
functional budget classification, and strengthening tax administration and tax policy. IDA in turn
focuses on strengthening public procurement and budget analysis (with the development of
BOOST) and leads in the development of an approach which will help the authorities sequence
their PFM reforms.
4.12  Furthermore, the World Bank participates in sectoral activities aimed at enhancing
donor coordination. In November 2011, the government initiated a framework to better
coordinate development actions and donors' activities. To this end, a decree was adopted to
create eleven sectoral committees which focus on: (i) political and administrative governance;
(ii) justice, human rights, and security; (iii) defense; (iv) economic governance and institutional
capacities; (v) agriculture and food security; (vi) private sector and competitiveness; (vii)
infrastructure; (viii) water, sanitation, and environment; (ix) education; (x) health and
HIV/AIDS; and (xi) social protection and employment. These committees are responsible for
ensuring coherence between sector policies and the poverty reduction strategy, and to coordinate
donors' actions in each of the sectors. The World Bank is member of most of these committees
and leads discussion in four of them: (a) economic governance and institutional capacities; (b)
agriculture and food security; (c) private sector and competitiveness; and (d) infrastructure.
D. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
4.13  Recent analytical work in PFM underpins the preparation of the ERGC-5. In the
public financial management area, recent analytical work includes a PEFA (2008), a PEMFAR
(2009) conducted in close cooperation with the Government and other development partners
including the EU and AfDB, French Cooperation and the UNDP and a review of the PFM reform
strategy (2011) prepared by the IMF, UNDP and AFRITAC. The latter (as well as the PEMFAR)
provides a diagnostic analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the country's public financial
management system and practices as well as a time-bound and sequenced action plan to prepare
the country for meeting WAEMU's budget directives by 2017. The action plans guide the PFM
actions in this DPO.
18


﻿4.14 The ERGC-5 benefits from the 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). This
study, which comprises amongst others a growth diagnostics element provides in-depth analysis
of the sources of economic growth. The study was validated at a workshop in July 2010 and
finds that while Togo faces numerous constraints, human capital, geography and macro-
economic stability are probably not amongst the binding constraints. Infrastructure on the other
hand, and access to credit have been flagged as potential binding constraints along with
governance issues, particularly related to the business environment. The agricultural sector,
finally, has been identified as one of the key sectors for the economy. Not only is it the sector
with the largest contribution to GDP and employment, it is also a sector with much potential to
increase output and productivity.
4.15  An Investment Climate Assessment completed in FY10 provides another crucial
diagnostic of the business environment. This study reinforced the notion that aspects of
governance related to the business environment are in need of improvement. Barriers and costs
of doing business are high, especially when starting a business, and compare poorly to countries
at the same development level. Even though the study stresses the need to improve the business
environment across the board, it set some priorities too. For instance, it notes how tax
administration is an area requiring continued attention while labor market regulations seem to be
less of a problem. Trading across borders is a relative strength compared to other countries and
other constraints; to leverage this strength, additional improvements into a role as a regional hub
remain to be seen. The new investments in the container terminal are a good start, but more is
needed to improve logistics, communication and infrastructure. Security of property rights does
not seem to be a binding constraint but building trust in this area will be crucial for future
growth. Hence, decreasing doing business costs as well as taking measures to ensure that key
reforms are trusted by investors emerge as a priority when addressing binding constraints to
growth in Togo.
4.16  These studies suggest that if international competitiveness and continued growth are
the goals for Togo, it is important to ramp up efforts to streamline the costly and
cumbersome business procedures that impede firms. Togo will also need to prove to potential
investors that political stability is permanent and that corruption, poor budget execution and
mismanagement of state owned enterprises belong to the past. At the same time, for Togo to take
advantage of its geographical location as a regional hub, infrastructure and connectivity services
will need to improve. The proposed DPO contributes to this objective through measures that
strengthen the PFM area (informed by a PEMFAR report completed mid 2009), through its
dialogue on public investment (including on the execution of the investment budget, the road
fund and investments in the phosphate sector) and through policy measures that contribute to
more competitive financial and telecommunications sectors, more reliable energy services and
that strengthen the cotton sector.
19


﻿4.17   With respect to the dialogue on poverty, gender and the quality of statistics, ERGC-
5, benefits from the programmatic ESW on poverty and gender that is under preparation.
New poverty statistics are expected to be released late February 2012 and will then be used to
update the poverty profile
based on the 2011 household         Figure 4.2: Enrollment in primary and secondary school by age
welfare   and    consumption
survey, and generate a poverty    100
map. Meanwhile, data from the
2010 MISC survey have been         80
used   to    explore   gender     70
dynamics. Important findings       60 -
include that when children are    50         Male secondary
young,     there    is     no      40 -      Male primary
differentiation  by   gender.      30-------Female secondary
20
Young girls are as likely to be    10   -  - Female primary
vaccinated,   receive   equal       0

toys and books as young boys.          6   7   8   9  10  11 12 13 14    15 16   17 18
In many areas (infant and child  Source: MISC 2010
mortality,  nutrition,  social
development) girls do slightly better than boys. For instance, the infant mortality rate for girls
stands at 117 per 1,000 as opposed to 131 for boys and 14.5 percent of girls under five are
underweight as opposed to 18.5 percent of boys (MICS 2010). But when girls get older gender
differences become pronounced, as evidenced by information on school enrollment. The
suggestion from this analysis is that gender differences are less the result of discrimination and
more of socialization. School dropout by older siblings, for instance, is explained by the presence
of an   under five   child in the
household, but only for girls,                Figure 4.1: Cost of standard ICT basket
not for boys. The DPO team               80% -                                   72%

4.18   In addition, a number         Source: ITU 2011
of policy notes will be
prepared, of which those on the links between growth, inequality, income generation and on
cotton, telecommunications and fuel subsidies are of particular relevance to the ERGC. For
instance, the note on telecommunications will help make the case for reform by demonstrating
the benefits of a vibrant telecommunications market from the perspective of reduced transaction
20


﻿costs, improved access to information, innovation (particularly banking services) and enhanced
government revenue. In the education sector, the Government and the Bank team have recently
started the preparation of a concept note for a report on skills development and post-basic
education that will dig out the ways to shape training policies and skills development for jobs
and economic growth.
4.19  The team benefits from the development of the BOOST database. This data base is
being developed in collaboration with the authorities. It is the first BOOST in the WAEMU
region. Already information included in the BOOST facilitated budget analysis (as presented in
section 2). More is expected once the data base contains more years, includes execution data and
is widely disseminated.
E. LESSONS LEARNED
4.20  Factors that contribute to achieving development outcomes through the ERGGs
(and currently ERGC) include reform ownership by the government and selectivity and the
availability of analytical work. More specifically, lessons learned include:
*  The availability of analytical work is of paramount importance to provide the
underpinnings of any operation. This has been the case for previous ERGGs and also
holds for this operation which has benefited from the CPAR, the PEMFAR, the FSA, and
particularly the recently completed Country Economic Memorandum. To inform the
preparation of this operation, team members actively engaged in the programmatic work
on poverty and gender and produced amongst others a policy note on fuel price subsidies.
Notes on gender, telecommunication, the business environment and the cotton sector are
under preparation.
*  Reforms require ownership to take effect, particularly when they affect vested interests.
The current program takes account of this lesson by aligning the prior actions closely
with the Government's own reform agenda as articulated in the PRSP-I, the Plan of
Priority Actions (PAP) and the public financial management strategy and its 2011-2013
action plan.
*  Selectivity of policy reforms and operations that are well prioritized are more effective,
particularly when the capacity within the public sector is limited. As with previous
operations, the design of the ERGC-5 reflects this lesson by focusing on a small set of
actions to deepen reforms in public financial management and in selected sectors. The
choice of sectors was informed by the Bank's growth diagnostic work.
*  The ICR for ERGG-3 has noted the importance of carefully choosing prior actions which
are likely to open the door for other important policy and institutional reforms. This
operation has taken this lesson into account by strategically selecting prior actions and by
building consensus about the need for strategic reforms. For example, the adoption of an
action plan to enhance competition in the telecommunication sector will facilitate
strategic decisions in the future, such as state divestiture of the state-owned incumbent
and the entry of a third mobile phone operator. Likewise, by creating transparency about
the cost structure of NSCT, trust between NSCT and producers is enhanced and the basis
is laid to attract private capital needed to expand the production capacity of the NSCT.
21


﻿Emphasis put in this operation is expected to translate into support for enhanced demand
side accountability in future operations.
*  Complementarities with other Bank-financed operations improve effectiveness of the
development policy operations. The design of this proposed operation reflects this lesson
in the choice of prior actions, which are closely coordinated with TTLs from ongoing
projects as well as with colleagues from bilateral and multilateral donor agencies.
*  Earlier ERGG operations and ICRs have pointed out that at times capacity constraints
become binding in continuing the reform process. In these areas, the Bank team has made
additional efforts to assure that technical assistance could be offered. Hence, to
operationalize the implementation of the WAEMU directives the team is offering
technical assistance in conjunction with the UNDP, EU and IMF. Likewise, to strengthen
the capacity in Government to analyze the budget, the team is offering technical
assistance to develop the BOOST data base.
5. THE PROPOSED FIFTH ECONOMIC RECOVERY
AND GOVERNANCE CREDIT
A. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION
5.1   The Government's economic recovery program outlined in Section 3 constitutes the
reference for the proposed policy matrix (Annex 2). The Government has requested IDA to
continue supporting its reform program. The Government's reform program is broad and
includes reforms in the public administration but also in cotton, infrastructure, phosphate mining,
the port, electricity generation, telecommunications etc. This ambitious and encompassing
reform agenda is a reflection of the need for the country to catch-up with the world after almost
15 years of instability and isolation. The proposed operation responds to the Government's
request with an operation that like the Government's reform program is broad: it addresses PFM
reforms but also reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness in various sectors of the economy.
5.2   The main objective of ERGC-5 is to enhance transparency and oversight within the
PFM reform agenda, and to advance reforms in cotton, energy, telecom and banking.
ERGC-5 builds on reforms supported by ERGG-4 and its predecessors but with increased focus
on transparency and oversight. ERGC-5 also puts more emphasis on real sector reforms with the
objective of rapid poverty reduction through improved competitiveness and enhanced growth.
Two new areas key to strengthening the business environment are included in the ERGC-5,
namely telecommunications and banking.
5.3   Dialogue in the context of ERGC-5 extends to public works and mining and
successor operations may want to formulate policy actions in these areas. The dialogue in
the mining sector revolves around the publication of the first EITI report (scheduled for April
2012), the revision of the Mining Code and the implementation of the first phase of the 2010
phosphate sector strategy. The dialogue in the transport sector revolves around the new transport
sector strategy (adopted in December 2011) and the establishment of a second generation road
fund (SAFER).
22


﻿5.4    Policy actions on attracting private investors to the cotton and telecommunications
sectors have been deferred to future operations. In cotton a privatization strategy study and an
assessment of the value of NSCT's assets (financed by the Agriculture Sector Support Project)
will be carried out in 2012, and are needed to inform a decision about privatization. Likewise, in
telecommunications, a decision on privatization is awaiting a study to guide the process. This
study will be financed out of the Project Preparation Advance for the WARCIP-2 program.
B. POLICY AREAS
Public Financial Management
5.5   The Government is committed to improve public financial management through the
implementation of its PFM strategy. The Government's strategy aims at addressing challenges
highlighted in the 2009 Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR). These include: (i) improving budget programming; (ii) observing the budget
schedule; (iii) the publication of budget-related information; (iv) aligning expenditures on line
items initially approved with the priorities identified in Togo's poverty reduction strategy; (v)
increasing the share of expenditures on the priority sectors; (vi) applying and expanding the use
of SIGFIP; (vii) strengthening the Court of Accounts; and (viii) the internal audit and inspection
units: the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF), and the General State Inspectorate (IGE).
PEMFAR also highlighted a number of weaknesses with respect to procurement practices, in
particular: (i) the inadequacy of public information on procurement outcomes; (ii) the existence
of a legal and regulatory framework which encouraged the noncompetitive and sole-source
procurement methods; and (iii) the presence of a national tender board combining regulatory and
control functions.
5.6   To address shortcomings identified in the PEMFAR report, the authorities adopted
an updated Action Plan (2011-2013) which aims to modernize the PFM system. The Action
Plan identifies nine areas of action starting with the alignment of the legal framework through
the transposition of the new WAEMU PFM directives into national law. As the WAEMU
directives specify the objective of achieving program budgeting by 2017, the other areas of
reform are aligned to achieving this objective. They include: (i) improvement of domestic
revenue collection and external resources mobilization; (ii) strengthening budget planning and
execution through the preparation of sector MTEFs using ceilings determined by a global MTEF
that reflect PRSP priorities; (iii) strengthening internal and external controls; (iv) further
development of various financial information systems (SIGFIP, SYDONIA and SYGAD) to
improve coordination between line ministries and the Treasury; (iv) improving public
procurement processes; (v) de-concentration and decentralization of the financial administration;
(vi) improvement of public accounting and budget execution statistics, notably the annual
financial statements; and (vii) strengthening institutional capacities.
5.7   To address shortcomings with respect to procurement, the government aims to
improve transparency and efficiency in line with the WAEMU procurement guidelines.
Specific actions include: (i) elaboration of procurement audits; (ii) publication, in the
procurement journal and on the website, of the outcomes of all public tenders including those of
state enterprises and concessions; (iii) preparation of standardized bidding documents; and (iv)
implementation of the public procurement information management system (SIGMAP).
23


﻿5.8    In 2011 and early 2012, the authorities continued to implement the PFM    reform
agenda with a focus on the legal framework, budget execution and public procurement.
Reforms undertaken included inter alia: (i) the approval by Cabinet of the six draft texts
regarding the WAEMU directives pertaining to the (1) state budget, (2) budget classification, (3)
public accounting, (4) chart of accounts, (5) government financial statistics (TOFE) and (6)
transparency in public financial management and their submission to parliament for adoption
(with the exception of the law on transparency); (ii) operationalization of the cash management
planning system through the preparation of a treasury management plan including monthly tables
which present estimated and realized revenues and expenditures; 17 (iii) development of the
SIGFIP through the incorporation of the accounting module,18 which now can be used to
generate the general cash balance, and implementation of the system at central level and in five
regional Treasury offices; and (iv) adoption of a decree establishing the thresholds for public
procurement,19 operationalization of a public procurement website20 with a publication of a
procurement journal (for sole source contracts and public concessions), starting of activities of
the Procurement Regulatory Authority and the National Directorate for the Audit of Public
Procurement (January 2011), a dissemination workshop on corruption in public procurement,
and adoption of annual public procurement plans by 16 ministries and state-owned enterprises.
With regard to cash management and the creation of a single treasury account, the number of
bank accounts held by public administration entities has been reduced. As of September 2011,
1,054 accounts (out of 1,215) or around 87 percent have been closed. Domestic arrears clearance
also has advanced (-0.8 percent of GDP in 2011 compared to -2.3 percent in 2010), but many
eligible creditors have still not made claims. With regard to budget preparation, the authorities
prepared, for the first time, medium term expenditure plans for the main sectors: education,
health, agriculture, and water and sanitation. The budget was submitted to Parliament on 15
November 2011, about one month after the date required according to the budget calendar (mid-
October) but well before the start of the next fiscal year. The authorities strive to submit next
year's budget in accordance with the deadline specified in the budget calendar.
5.9    Progress was made in strengthening internal and external controls but more needs
to be done. With regard to the internal control of public financial management, the IGE
performed inspection missions in 2010-2011 and submitted its mission reports to the President of
the Republic and the Court of Accounts. Their impact has been limited because a mechanism to
ensure follow up IGE recommendations is not in place. The IGF also undertook control missions
in 2011 - a total of 35 missions, including controls at the customs and the Port of Lom6. IGF did
also carry out follow up missions to ensure compliance with its previous recommendations and
participated, amongst others, in training sessions on the control of customs revenues in 2011.
The effectiveness of both institutions is affected by a lack of prioritization and a lack of
coordination. With regard to the external control of public resource management, the Court of
Accounts continues to face serious physical and human capacity constraints. Also, the legal
timeframe for the submission of financial accounts of 2010 (June 30, 2011) to the Court of

﻿Accounts is not strictly observed by all administrative bodies, which may generate delays in
finalizing the report on the 2010 budget execution.
5.10  While much is being done, the authorities recognize the need to better prioritize and
sequence PFM reforms. The 3-year Action Plan includes a long list of reform measures, not all
of which are of equal importance. According to the Government's mid-term review (November
2011), only around 5 measures out of the 53 envisaged for 2011 were fully realized, the
remainder being at various stages of implementation. The effective implementation of the
WAEMU directives after their adoption remains the main challenge of PFM reform, not only in
Togo but also in WAEMU countries over the next 5 years. To better rationalize and sequence the
reform agenda, the authorities are considering to better sequence the reform process, focusing
initially on putting a place a solid foundation (e.g. budgeting for inputs) before more complex
objectives (e.g. program budgeting, MTEFs) are being sought. It is expected that this
prioritization will enhance the ownership of the reform agenda and improve Government's
ability to coordinate donors (who no longer can pursue a pick and choose from the list of
reforms).
5.11  The authorities recognize the need to closer scrutinize budget allocations, budget
performance and the link between releases and policy outcomes. While the budget process is
gradually improving, there remains a need to closely track how the budget evolves over time,
how different spending units perform and to relate spending to outcomes. The introduction of
MTEFs for the main sectors, and SIGFIP is already an improvement, but it remains difficult to
scrutinize the budget and for example assess how spending in the social sectors evolved over
time, what the consequences are of using a different definition for social spending or to assess
the relative efficiency of spending. To enhance its ability to analyze the budget and to increase
transparency, the authorities have agreed to collaborate with IDA in developing BOOST, a data
base containing all information on budget allocation and spending classified along economic,
functional, programmatic and geographic lines.
Prior Actions under the Proposed ERGC-5
The proposed ERGC-5 supports policy actions which enhance incentives to implement the
budget reform program as identified in the Government's medium term Action Plan. The
actions focus on measures that enhance budget transparency and increase internal and
external controls. In particular, the prior actions focus on: (i) improving budget transparency by
publishing the approved budgets on the togoreforme.com website; (ii) building technical
expertise on identifying budget processes which are prone to public resource mismanagement;
(iii) strengthen external auditing of public institutions and public enterprises; and (iv) strengthen
procurement conformity controls.
5.12  The prior actions for this operation are the following:
(i) The Recipient has published on its website, the Budgets for the Fiscal Years 2009,
2010, 2011 and 2012, and has furnished, on the same website, an email address
through which an excel version of any of said Budgets can be requested by the public;
25


﻿This prior action aims to enhance budget transparency by making budget information publicly
available. In combination with the BOOST tool, it will make it much easier to analyze the
budget, and to hold the budget authorities to account. The results indicators (the publication of
the budgets in pdf format, and their availability in excel) reflect this.
(ii)  Each of the State Finance Inspectorate and the General Finance Inspectorate has
adopted an appropriate risk-based approach to the selection of public entities to be
inspected by it;
The IGF was created in July 2008 and IGF and IGE have undertaken control missions since
2009/10. In 2011, for instance, IGF undertook 35 control missions and various follow up
missions to assess whether its recommendations have been implemented. This prior action will
enhance the effectiveness of IGF and IGE by adopting an approach to select projects where a
maximum impact can be expected and where the risk is assessed as substantial. The inclusion of
this prior action underlines the importance attached to well functioning internal control
mechanisms as integral element of the budget cycle. IGE and IGF staff are being trained in risk
based approaches to audits and based on this, IGE and IGF management will implement a
methodology that assures that starting the second trimester of 2012, audit projects are conducted
based on a risk based selection. The results indicator (at least 75% of the controls have been
selected using the risk-based approach) is a reflection of the adoption of the risk-based
methodology.
(iii) The Court of Accounts has furnished to the Recipient's parliament its report on the
execution of the Budget for the Fiscal Year 2007;
The Court of Accounts was created by decree in April 2009, while the law that defines the status
of the court of accounts was adopted in June 2009. The Court of Accounts effectively became
operational in 2010. As a new institution it was deemed important that the institution, those
controlled by it and those receiving its report familiarize themselves with its procedures and the
substance of its work. By preparing a report on the execution of the 2007 accounts, this objective
is being achieved. Following the submission of the 2007 execution report, the Court of Accounts
has started reviewing the 2010 accounts; its report is expected to be submitted to parliament by
mid-November 2012.
(iv) The Procurement Regulatory Authority has prepared standardized bidding documents
acceptable to the Association for the procurement of supplies, works and consultants;
The General Procurement Department was established as recently as 2009. As a new
Department, it is still in the process of establishing procedures to enhance its effectiveness and
efficiency. Over the past year, the Department started to publish the announcements and final
outcome of procurements through a journal and a designated website (www.marchespublics-
togo.com). One of the ways to do so is through the standardization of procurement documents
and it is expected that with the preparation of these documents and their publication on the
website of the Procurement Regulatory Authority (results indicator) the number of errors in
bidding processes will be substantially reduced. In addition, the procurement process will be
simplified as the number of steps for procurement will be reduced from 7 to 4 as a result (results
indicator).
26


﻿(v)  The Procurement Regulatory Authority has, to assess their conformity with the
Recipient's procurement laws, undertaken audits of procurement contracts issued
during the respective fiscal year 2010 by: (a) the Recipient's ministries responsible for
(i) health, (ii) agriculture, (iii) education, (iv) public works, and (v) water and
sanitation; (b) seven state-owned companies, namely Togotelecom, NSCT, LONATO,
CEET, TdE, SALT and PAL; and (c) the city of Lome.
This prior action will help the procurement authority establish whether procurement contracts are
issued in accordance with prevailing laws. It will help identify problem institutions requiring
closer scrutiny and create a precedent to be continued in the future. The results indicator (annual
procurement audits are carried out) reflects this.
5.13   Future operations are expected to focus on the adoption of all WAEMU directives
and their operationalization. Various donors are active in the PFM area and it is important that
areas of complementarity are identified. The EU intends to emphasize in it future budget support
operations, the quality of internal controls, controls by the Court of Accounts and the preparation
of procurement plans, while the IMF is expected to focus on treasury management and budget
formulation. The Bank's natural areas of focus would then be to get the country comply with it
regional commitments regarding the adoption of the WAEMU directives. This will lay the
ground for the implementation of a new PFM framework. The transcription and implementation
of these reforms will help translate good performance of the central PFM system into better
service delivery outcomes in sectors. The Bank intends to help the country derive these benefits,
by emphasizing the need for line ministries to take ownership of the reforms contained in the
directives (devolution of budget authority to line ministries, program budgeting, risk based
oversight, performance audits etc....). The directives will also improve transparency and
accountability, with a move to accrual accounting and a greater role for Parliament in the budget
process. These reforms are about getting better results and value for money from public
spending.
Cotton Sector
5.14   Cotton production increased during the 2010/2011 season thanks to better sector
management, favorable world market prices and the timely supply of inputs. Cotton is the
main cash crop in Togo, providing a living to a large share of farmers in the northern and central
parts of the country. It is estimated that in the early 2000s around 250,000 households produced
cotton. As most cotton farmers live in northern and central Togo, where poverty incidence is
highest (according to the 2006 QUIBB, poverty incidence was 90 percent in the Savannah region
and 75 percent in the Central Plateau) cotton is not only an important cash crop, a vibrant cotton
sector has the potential to significantly contribute to poverty alleviation, also because cotton
production has been shown to have a strong and positive impact on food crop production as food
crops cultivated in association with or in rotation with cotton benefit from residual fertilizer used
for cotton. Cotton production during the 2010/2011 season increased to 46,000 tons compared to
27,900 tons the previous year and is projected to attain between 75,000 and 80,000 tons during
the 2011/2012 season. As a result, the value of cotton production in total agricultural production
is increasing from 1% in 2009, to 2% in 2010 to a projected 4% in 2011: cotton export proceeds
increased from around 1.5 percent of total exports in 2010 (estimated) to 2.5 percent in 2011
(projected).

﻿5.15  The Government's medium-term cotton sector reform program aims at increasing
cotton production, after a period           Figure 5.1: Number of cotton farmers

Government    commissioned   a      250,000

company (SOTOCO) as well as a

debts, including arrears to cotton
farmers. Based on this diagnostic,  Souce: IMF NSCT 2011
the medium-term cotton sector
reform program was formulated.
As a first step, the governent
liquidated the former cotton company and set up the NSCT with a capital of CFAF 2 billion, 60
percent of which being held by the government and 40 percent by the producers association
(FNGPC). The new company uses the assets of the former SOTOCO and has taken over its
activities. A regulatory framework for the cotton sector that specifies the roles, responsibilities,
and obligations of sector stakeholders was developed. To strengthen the participation of cotton
producers' participation in the decision-making process of the NSCT and prevent accumulation
of arrears to farmers, farmer leaders were trained toward a better participation within the NSCT
board. Other reforms included the development of an accounting system that could provide a
detailed breakdown of the NSCT variable and fixed cost by season and institutional
strengthening of the FNGPC.
5.16  To enhance transparency, a price formula linking world market prices to prices
paid to farmers was adopted. This cotton price mechanism was adopted in 2009. According to
the mechanism, farmers can expect to be paid a proportion (61 - 63 percent, depending on the
volume of production) of the world cotton price. The systematic application of the price formula
is believed to ensure transparency in the cotton sector and to guarantee the farmers a fair price
for their crop. To date, the formula has not yet been fully applied. During the 2009/2010 season,
farmers were paid CFAF 175 per kg of fiber, as opposed to CFAF 189 as prescribed by the
formula. Exceptionally high international cotton fiber prices 21in 2010/2011 highlighted a
weakness of the formula which made it impossible to apply the formula. Instead, it was agreed
that the price would be determined on the basis of the actual sales realized and the cost incurred
by the NCST. The final payment to famers was finally agreed late December 2011. Meanwhile,
the NSCT and FNGPC have also initiated work to revise the price formula and to adapt it such
2An increase from 90 cents/kg at the beginning of the 2010/2011 campaign to 215 cents/kg at the end of the
campaign.
28


﻿that also during exceptional seasons like the 2010/2011 it can be utilized. The new price formula
is expected to be endorsed during the second half of 2012.22
5.17  Despite considerable investments in an analytical accounting system by NSCT, the
cost structure per season remains unclear. As NSCT took over a larger contingent of
permanent employees from SOTOCO than was strictly necessary based on production levels,
NSCT faces fixed costs which are higher than in most West African cotton companies. It is
therefore critical for the company to have clear records of fixed and variable costs by season.
Also for the producers, represented through their farmer association FNGPC, detailed knowledge
of the company's price structure is necessary to assess whether fair prices are being offered for
their produce. To date, costs per season cannot yet be automatically generated, the main reason
being difficulties with the ambitious IT system which was selected. However, a manual
reconciliation of cost records based on the general accounting systems was prepared by the
NSCT. It is this reconciliation that was used to inform the decision about the final price to be
paid to farmers for cotton produced during the 2010/11 season.
5.18  To facilitate the expansion of the cotton sector, the Government seeks the entry of
private capital in NSCT. Investment by private capital into NSCT is seen as critical as it will
recapitalize the company and bring additional technical and managerial skills. Already in a
meeting held October 1st, 2008, the decision was taken to seek private capital investments in
NSCT and to reduce the role of the state to that of a minority share holder. The Government's
strategy to date has been to first bring NSCT to financial health before privatizing the company.
Now that this objective has been largely achieved, and as cotton production is expanding very
rapidly, the time has come to privatize. But before launching the actual privatization, additional
preparatory work needs to be undertaken
in 2012, in the form of an assessment of     Fgr    21ri1espai   on
the value of assets of NSCT and a study

5.19  The proposed ERGC-5 supports a       C
policy action judged critical to increasing   0
transparency in the cotton sector, namely                    C  \:
that the NSCT has furnished to FNGPC a
table for the 2010/2011 Production Season,
presenting an accurate breakdown of its    Source: Goverment of Togo, 2012
cost ofproducing cotton, in conformity with
its financial statements. This policy action
was developed in close consultation with NSCT management and the leadership of FNGPC. It
provides NSCT's management insight in the cost per ton produced per season (which runs from
around April of one calendar year to March of the next calendar year), as opposed to per fiscal
year (January 1 - December 3 1). This cost can be compared with similar costs produced for
other countries to assess the company's performance and will be of valuable input during the

29


﻿privatization of the company. The production of a cost table for the 2010/2011 season allows the
producer representatives in the FNGPC to assess the acceptability of the final price offered by
NSCT for cotton produced during the exceptional 2010/2011 season. The production of the cost
table for the 2010/2011 season in December 2011 has also allowed producers (represented in the
FNGPC) and NSCT management to agree on a final price to be paid for cotton produced during
the exceptional 2010/2011 season. This price was finally set at CFAF 322 per kg, less than the
CFAF 399 that have been paid according to the price formula (a revised formula will be used for
the 2011/12 season) but 50 percent to 90 percent more than what is paid in neighboring
countries. Of this final price, 230 CFAF will be paid to farmers; the remainder will be used to
support activities critical to the functioning of the cotton supply chain including the creation of a
price stabilization fund (under the auspices of FNGPC).
5.20   The results indicators related to this policy action reflect how the availability of a cost
table and the subsequent agreement on the final price for cotton has enhanced trust between
NSCT and FNGPC. The relatively high price for cotton that has resulted and the improved
cooperation between producers and NSCT are expected to contribute to increases in cotton
production. Because the amount of production is dependent on factors beyond the control of
NSCT (the weather), the results indicator uses the purchase and distribution of fertilizer;
fertilizer is an essential input in cotton production and its distribution is within the span of
control of NSCT. The other results indicator (farmers are paid the price according to the relevant
price formula) reflects that FNGPC and NSCT will collaborate in the adoption of a revised price
formula and are committed to applying it in subsequent seasons.
5.21   Future operations are expected to focus on the privatization of NSCT. Following a
profitable season in 2010/11, rapidly increasing cotton production, and clarity on the pricing
mechanism, the time has come to realize the privatization of the cotton company. Future
operations will facilitate this process which as an initial step will require an in-depth study into
the various modalities of the privatization and an assessment of the value of the assets that
should pertain to this private company but which are currently held by the state (and usufructed
by the NSCT).
Energy Sector
5.22   Access to electricity in Togo remains low. Access to electricity is limited to 21 percent
of Togo's households (or 175,000 households) (2009), with a 42 percent coverage in urban areas
and a 4 percent coverage in rural areas. This is lower than the Sub-Saharan African average of 25
percent and considerably below the coverage in neighboring Ghana (approximately 60 percent).
Although some power generation sites are located in rural areas, transmission lines generally
bypass nearby communities in favor of transmitting power directly to urban centers. During
consultations held with rural and peri-urban communities in July 2010 in the context of the
World Bank's new energy strategy, it became clear that gaining access to electricity ranks among
the top priorities for Togo's population.
5.23   Most electricity used in Togo is imported. Traditionally, 65-70 percent of the electricity
demand in Togo is satisfied by imports from Ghana, C6te d'Ivoire and Nigeria. In Togo the
CEET (Compagnie d'Energie Electrique de Togo) is in charge of retail distribution and sale of
electricity, while imported electricity is provided by the Communaute Electrique du Benin
30


﻿(CEB). The CEET is a state-owned company since its foundation; CEB is jointly owned by Togo
and Benin. Power shortages in Togo are often associated with insufficient electricity imports
following low hydrology at the Ghana's hydropower Akosombo dam, obsolete production
equipment of the exporting electricity companies in the neighboring countries, and delays in
building new electricity generating projects (regional electricity generation projects, hydropower
project of Adjarala, and connection to the West African gas pipeline).
5.24  Faced with acute power shortages in the recent past, the authorities purchased
emergency diesel generators to be operated by CEET and signed a power purchasing
agreement with an independent power producer (IPP), Contour Global (CG), for a 100
MW heavy fuel oil /gas fired turbine. As gas supply has not yet been secured on site, Contour
Global is operating with heavy fuel with a production cost in the range of CFAF 70-80/Kwh.
This cost exceeds the cost of energy (CFAF 55/Kwh) supplied by CEB and is therefore not
attractive. Once natural gas is secured, production costs will drop to CFAF 35 - 45/Kwh. Under
the agreement with Contour Global, CEET is bound to pay a capacity charge, irrespective of the
amount of electricity procured. The cost to CEET of relying on electricity from Contour Global
is expected to drop as an agreement has been reached under which Contour Global also will
deliver electricity to the CEB. This is expected to reduce the capacity charges charged to CEET
by around 30 percent.
5.25  The recent adjustment in the electricity tariff has enhanced CEET's financial
situation. In June 2009, CEB increased its electricity tariffs by 10 percent through a bi-statal
decision of both Benin and Togo. Initially CEET was not permitted to pass through this increase
except to industrial customers but as of January 2011, the tariff adjustment has been
implemented. As a result CEET is expected to generate a surplus of CFAF 0.5 billion in 2011
compared to a loss of CFAF 3.8 billion at the end of 2010.
5.26  Inadequate bill recovery continues to affect the sector's financial sustainability.
CEET's financial situation was further strengthened by the clearance of arrears by the public
sector, but despite arrears clearance in 2009, the CEET is accumulating new arrears as the budget
allocations for the electricity consumption of public administration (including hospitals,
universities and state-owned enterprises) continue to remain below the actual billed amounts. In
2010, the budget allocation was around CFAF 5 billion, but the electricity bills amounted to
around CFAF 6.4 billion, although the CEET provided electricity consumption estimates as
inputs for budget preparation. In addition, the very old age of some of the equipment (dating to
the 1950s and 1960s) renders the electricity system inefficient and unreliable, encouraging
electricity leakages.
5.27  CEET is taking steps to improve its overall management capacity. A five-year
performance contract has been signed between CEET and the government. The CEET has been
under public management, except during 2000 and 2006, when the company was operated under
a private concession by the consortium, Elyo/Hydro Quebec. This concession ended in 2006 as a
result of lack of financing for investments and institutional inconsistencies in the sector which
did not incorporate long-term planning considerations. In March 2008, new permanent structures
were established, a Board of Directors and General Manager were appointed, and regulations for
CEET were adopted consistent with those of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business
Law in Africa (OHADA). However, since February 2009, following a negative assessment by
31


﻿the Supervisory Board of the progress made in implementing the Action Plan and reducing
energy losses, the position of General Manager has been vacant. The Deputy General Manager
fills the position in the interim, but this situation is not encouraging strategic decision-making.
To overhaul the CEET management an organizational audit was commissioned, but the audit
report has not yet been finalized. In the absence of the audit recommendations, the CEET Board
decided to open a competitive process for the recruitment of a General Manager.
5.28  To secure more sustainable access to electricity in Togo, the Government aims to
increase supply and to improve efficiency. Short-term measures include: (i) the preparation of
a new energy sector policy and (ii) as a member of the West African Power Pool (WAPP),2 co-
sponsoring the ongoing development of a 330kV transmission backbone to enhance power trade
across countries in the sub-region. Over the medium term, the government plans to implement
actions to (i) strengthen private participation in the development of energy generation capacity;
(ii) intensify regional cooperation in the production, purchase, sale, and transport of energy; (iii)
create a rural electrification fund; (iv) establish a financing mechanism for the sector, including
participation of external donors and the domestic financial system; (v) undertake an awareness-
raising campaign for the efficient use of all forms of energy; and (vi) develop domestic power
resources to enhance energy sector resilience. This includes the construction of a 149 MW
hydropower plant at Adjarala in 2017.
5.29  The proposed ERGC-5 supports one policy action judged critical to improving
governance of the energy distribution utility. The board of directors of CEET has appointed a
general manager of the said company based on an open competitive selection process and has
signed a performance management contract with said manager.
5.30  The proposed operation supports the CEET Board of Directors to replace the current
interim manager and to appoint a General Manager under a performance management contract
based on an open competitive selection process. This measure is expected to strengthen the
technical and financial performance management of the CEET. As a consequence, it is expected
that CEET will improve its performance across the board and will be able to serve more clients
and to reduce distribution losses. The results indicators reflect this.
5.31  Looking forward, there may be less need for future prior actions related to the
electricity sector, though vigilance is needed. In 2011, CEET was profitable, arrears with the
state have largely been cleared, capacity problems have largely been resolved with the arrival of
Contour Global and with a new General Manager in place it is expected that a number of
remaining issues, such as the risk of renewed arrears by the public sector, and the delays in
switching to the use of gas instead of heavy oil will be addressed expediently, while at the same
time it is expected that access to electricity will improve and distribution losses will go down.
Much of this will depend on the ability of the newly appointed General Manager to address these
issues leaving a need to closely monitor the performance of the electricity sector in the
foreseeable future.
23 The WAPP falls within the framework of the ECOWAS Energy Protocol, which establishes third-party access;
and the WAPP Master Plan, which defines regional priority projects.

﻿Telecommunications Sector
5.32  Togo's telecommunication sector is not living up to its potential. With a mobile phone
penetration in 2010 of 42%, significantly below the ECOWAS (excluding Cape Verde) average
of 54 percent and a growth rate of around 12 percent compared to an ECOWAS average of 26
percent, Togo's mobile telephony sector is not doing as well as it could. Such sluggish growth is
unsurprising in view of the high average cost per minute of mobile phone communication of
CFAF 115 per minute (around 25 US$ cents) in 2010. These high costs earned Togo rank 161
out of 165 countries ranked by the ITU (2011) for their cost of telephony.
5.33  Like mobile telephony, high speed internet is expensive and has a low penetration
rate. High internet costs are partly explained by the lack of direct access to the submarine cable
(West Africa Cable system - WACS). A connection to WACS is expected to be made during
2012. This could reduce internet access costs, but probably only if access is accompanied by a
pro-competition regulatory framework ensuring free and non-discriminatory access. To date
Togo Telecom has exclusive access to this submarine cable and has deployed a national
backbone up to the borders thereby enjoying a monopoly on international, regional and national
connectivity.
5.34  As long as telecommunication is characterized by a quasi-monopoly, the telecom
potential is likely to remain unexploited. As indicated above, Togo Telecom has exclusive
access to the submarine cable WACS and the national fiber-optic backbone, while mobile phone
market is characterized by a duopoly, where the state-owned Togo Cellulaire (a subsidiary of
Togo Telecom) has 87 percent of the volume (dialed-out minutes) and 79 percent of turnover.
5.35  The Government adopted a Sectoral Strategy on Promoting Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) 2011-2015 in May 2011. This strategy lays down an
ambitious vision for the sector focusing on free market forces and strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework. The strategy intends to develop the telecom infrastructure (which includes
investments in international and regional/national connectivity) and to stimulate reliance on ICT.
The stated objective is to increase by 2015 the fixed and mobile phone penetration rates to 60
percent and the internet penetration rate to 15 percent from less than 1 percent today. A draft law
on electronic communication transposing ECOWAS directives into the domestic legislation and
liberalizing the market was discussed by the National Assembly in January 2012.
5.36  In the short-term, the Government intends to restructure the national telecom
operator while making the sector more competitive. Togo Telecom and Togo Cellulaire are
highly profitable organizations, responsible for about 9% of total revenue. In this light,
discussions about opening up the telecom sector evolve around the dual objective of
safeguarding a profitable company and creating a competitive sector. The discussions evolve
around setting price caps which incentivize the incumbent company to protect its revenue stream
by expanding access and strict performance criteria during an interim period during which the
incumbent operator strengthens its operations, followed by opening up the sector to MVNOs
(operators who lease network capacity from others) and, finally, a third operator. Regarding the
expansion of high-speed internet services at competitive prices to a large share of the population,
the short-term strategy is to increase the number of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and to
ensure access for all operators to the sub-marine WACS cable through regulation. The regulatory
33


﻿authority (ARTP)24 will ensure the application of clear technical specifications and tariffs for
access to the sub-marine cable to create a level-playing field in the market. In the long-term, the
high-speed intemet market is expected to be characterized by free competition. The World Bank
supports the Government of Togo in both endeavors through the PPA of the upcoming
WARCIP-2 project.
Prior action under the proposed ERGC-5
5.37   The proposed ERGC-5 supports one policy action judged a critical step towards a
competitive mobile telephone sector, namely that the Recipient's Council of Ministers has
adopted an updated telecommunications strategy designed to develop a competitive information
and communications technology market.
This prior action operationalizes the Telecom Sector Strategy adopted in May 2011 and the
Telecommunications with a set of concrete actions that the authorities will implement in 2012 to
arrive at a more competitive telecom sector: these include limiting the price of mobile phone
calls to the WAEMU average, ensuring that more intemet service providers become operational
in Togo, inviting MVNOs to become active in Togo and creating a level playing field for agents
who would like to access the WACS cable. The selected results indicators (a reduction in the
price of mobile telephony and an increase in the number of ISPs) reflect the consequences of the
adoption and implementation of the updated strategy on the telecommunications market.
5.38   Future operations are expected to follow closely the implementation of the telecom
strategy. For Togo's ability to become a logistics and financial hub that takes full advantage of
its deep sea port, it is a sine qua non that the country can draw on competitive, low cost, high
quality telecom services. To this end the implementation of the revised telecom strategy, which
should result in the opening up of the state owned telecom company to private capital and,
eventually, the issuing of a third license, is critical. Future operations are expected to closely
follow this process.
Financial Sector
5.39   Togo's financial system remains fragile. The 2006 Financial Sector Review noted that
the banking sector and the social security system in Togo are fragile. The legal and regulatory
framework governing the financial system (and managed by the regional banking commission) is
adequate but not properly enforced. The financial sector is undergoing a major revamping to
restore business confidence and to reduce the risks of macroeconomic imbalances. This is paying
off. Since 2008 the position of Togo's commercial banks relative to prudential ratios has
improved as highlighted by the table below, but remains far from comforting.
24 The ARPT has a wide mandate regulating both telecommunications and postal sectors. Key regulatory functions
include price regulation, radio frequency allocation and spectrum management, numbering, quality of service.
Licensing authority is with the Ministry while universal service regulation is shared between the Ministry and
ARPT. The Authority has significant needs for monitoring equipment for frequency management and for quality of
service. ARPT is not entrusted with regulating market dominance as the current legal framework adopts a traditional
approach to regulation. A new telecom law reflecting latest regulatory trends was submitted to Parliament. The
new draft strengthens the ARPT and widens its mandate to regulate dominance. As all regulatory authorities
covering the Telecom sector, the ARPT needs to train its staff to keep up with the rapid changes in technologies and
in market conditions.

institutions will move to the
supervision authority of BCEAO
but smaller ones will continue to be supervised by the Ministry of Finance. The World Bank's
Financial Sector and Governance Project (FSGP) is providing technical assistance to the national
supervisory authority and to large microfinance institutions to improve the stability of the sector.
5.41   In 2008, the Government initiated a restructuring of three state-owned banks in
difficulty (BTCI, BIA-T and UTB). With support from the IMF and IDA, the three banks were
recapitalized by an exchange of bad debt for Government securities (CFAF 88.1 billion or
35
around US$176 million) in December 2008 .2  The securitization has helped the banks increase
their resource mobilization and lending. The 2009 enterprise survey highlights that 21.6 percent
of firms have a loan from a financial institution, compared to an average of 22.1 percent for Sub-
Saharan Africa. According to the BCEAO, outstanding deposits and loans have increased by
respectively 17.4 and 21.3 percent in 2009. Following the securitization, non performing loans

﻿(NPL) decreased by 70.3 percent. The gross NPL ratio stood at 13.5 percent at end 2008,
compared to 22.3 percent at end 2007.
5.42  Access to credit from the banking sector remains limited, in particular for micro
and small enterprises, but is improving. Evidence from the Doing Business survey, on which
Togo dropped four places in 2012, shows that access to credit is the only area in which progress
was made. In fact, Togo improved an impressive 26 places in the getting credit ranking.

5.43   The Government's medium-term financial sector reform program aims to finalize
the restructuring of all banks in difficulty and to disengage the state from direct
involvement in banking. This strategy has been developed with assistance from the IMF and
includes the following pillars: (i) ensure the liquidity of at least a portion of the bonds through
access to BCEAO refinancing and the development of a secondary market; (ii) launch without
delay the share cession process; and (iii) set up an efficient mechanism for loan recovery. The
strategy has been operationalised with the government's commitment to privatize four state
owned banks (BTCI, BIA-T, BTD, UTB) and creation of a (bad) loan recovery mechanism.
5.44   The privatization of the four state-owned banks is underway. After a delayed start
(the launch of the call for bids was already a structural benchmark in the IMF-supported program
in 2010 and in 2011) the recruitment of the privatization advisers for the four banks was
launched early 2010 and a Privatization Law was adopted in October 2010 following which a
Privatization Committee was set up in early 2011. This cleared the way for the privatization of
the four banks. A call for prequalification of strategic investors was launched in early July 2011,
bids were reviewed in September and October 2011 and the Council of Ministers finally
announced the privatization strategy on November 2011. On November 30, 2011 the first two
banks were put up on offer; early March 2012 the other two banks followed.
Prior action under the proposed ERGC-5
5.45   The proposed ERGC-5 supports one policy action judged to critically boost
financial intermediation and render the banking sector competitive namely that the
Privatization Commission has invited pre-qualified applicants to bid on the purchase of four
state-owned banks, namely BIA-T, BTC, BTD and UTB.
36


﻿With the completion of this prior action, a key component of the financial sector reform process
that started with the clearing up of arrears and bad loans, will move to its next phase and it is
expected that following the call for the bids the state owned banks will be successfully
privatized. This is reflected in the results indicator (number of state owned banks that have been
privatized). Important actions remain for the financial sector to be brought back to health. The
weak performance of the micro finance sector remains of concern, just like the fact that the Non-
Performing Loans Recovery Company will need to become operational. Future development
policy operations will closely follow developments in these areas and may even formulate prior
actions. Whether this will be considered necessary will largely depend on progress made under
the Financial Sector and Governance Project that is under implementation.
C. PRIOR ACTIONS FOR ERGC-5
5.46  The proposed credit supports selected reforms in the Government's program
described in the previous section Table 5.3 details these prior actions and their implementation
status. The majority of prior actions for ERGC-5 are derived from indicative policy measures
that were identified during preparation of the ERGG-4, but prior actions supporting budget
transparency and reforms in the telecommunications and financial sectors were added to reflect
the Government's reform agenda on these structural issues. Annex 2 presents the expected
results and result indicators.
5.47  During the preparations of the proposed credit, indicative potential policy actions
for a follow up program were identified. These actions follow the areas identified in ERGC-5,
but focus the PFM actions around the key elements identified to facilitate the implementation of
the WAEMU PFM directives in a well-sequenced manner. Regarding the real part of the
economy, indicative policy actions continue to be identified in cotton, telecommunications,
banking and energy sectors with additional actions in the phosphate sector and public works (see
annex 2). In future operations, a third pillar of activities may be formulated around Open
Government. Open Government captures ongoing initiatives around budget transparency and
EITI, but by identifying it as a separate pillar in a series, it would raise the level of ambition and
could extend to include Open Data and the demand side of public accountability.

﻿Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The ERGC-5 is aligned with the Government's reform program. This program of reforms is reflected in the 2009
PRSP, which was extended until 2012 and whose process of preparation involved the participation of all
development actors (private sector, religious groups, non-Governmental organizations, Parliament and the
technical and financial partners) and regions, thus ensuring that the PRSP articulates the country's own priorities to
reduce poverty and promote sustainable growth. The PRSP framework underlies the policy dialogue with the
Bank, the IMF, and the AfDB, which closely coordinate their programs of support to Togo. The unit responsible
for the ERGC-5 program within the Government is the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which has championed
these reforms over the past years during the four previous ERGGs. In order to reinforce ownership at the sectoral
level, the Ministry of Economy and Finance has coordinated the dialogue with working groups and task teams
including other Government agencies and relevant organizations (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Telecommunications, Privatization Commission, Ministry of Mines and Energy, BCEAO).
Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The Government's reform program supported by the ERGC-5 is summarized in the policy matrix in Annex 2. The
core of the program builds on the findings of the PEFA, PEMFAR, CPAR, as well as lessons learned during
previous ERGG operations, and on the analysis of preliminary results and weaknesses of ongoing reform efforts. It
was further strengthened during intensive policy dialogue with the authorities in 2011. The program has been
closely coordinated with and supported by other development partners and bilateral donors such as the IMF,
AfDB, the EU and France (especially in the areas on which these organizations have focused, notably public
financial management and cotton). The expected results of the program supported by the proposed credit are
detailed in Table 5.4.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
The program's focus remains on governance in the public and private sectors, through a series of actions aimed at
improving transparency and accountability of public financial management, and efficiency in critical sectors for
the economy (namely cotton, energy, telecommunications and banking) which are crucial to promote sustainable
growth and thus reduce poverty. The policy matrix was customized to the country circumstances to reflect the need
to step up reforms and focus on real sectors. To reflect short term as well as long term objectives of the
Government's reform program, the accountability framework contains indicators that are directly related to actions
support by the ERGC-5, but also higher order indicators.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The policy matrix uses a limited set of nine prior actions for Board presentation and disbursement of the proposed
ERGC-5. The chosen policy measures were identified jointly with the Government and in close consultation with
other development partners. Conditionality is focused only on key actions which are critical to strengthening
public financial management and reform in key sectors.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
In preparing and monitoring the previous four ERGGs, the Bank has worked in close coordination with the IMF,
AfDB, EC and bilateral donors in supporting the Government's reform program. Under this operation, the Bank
will continue to coordinate closely with these institutions to support and monitor program implementation to
contribute to predictable and performance based financial support in the future.
D. ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM
5.48    ERGC-5 supports Government's reforms program; specific results expected by the
credit closing date of December 31, 2012 are outlined in Table 5.4. The Table presents
outcome indicators which will be monitored by the Ministry of Economy and Finance whose
staff will prepare quarterly reports on progress in implementation.

﻿6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A. COUNTRY OWNERSHIP
6.1   The proposed operation is supported and owned by the authorities. The specific
reforms are critical elements of the Government's strategy to consolidate growth and enhance
governance and transparency in public resource management. These reforms were designed with
the contribution of the Government's relevant ministries and agencies under the championship of
the Minister of Economy and Finance. They are embedded in the country's PRSP (pillars I and
II) whose preparation process involved participation of all development actors and regions and
has provided an opportunity to foster national consensus across the Togolese society and among
Government representatives on this reform agenda.
B. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
6.2   Although the Government has made encouraging progress under previous ERGGs
in implementing measures to strengthen public financial management and transparency,
improving fiduciary standards remains a central objective of the proposed operation.
Reform measures already implemented include: (i) the full reinstatement and application of
normal budget preparation and execution procedures; (ii) organization of the Treasury in line
with WAEMU Directive; (iii) closing of over one thousand existing separate treasury accounts
with a view to creating a single treasury account; (iv) creation of internal audit and inspection
units at the Ministry of Finance; (v) adoption of a procurement law and code; establishment of a
General Procurement Department and a Procurement Regulatory Authority; establishment of ex
ante procurement control commissions in five ministries; (vi) establishment of the Court of
Accounts; and (vii) the publication of the budget execution outcomes on the Government's
website. The proposed operation will build on these earlier measures to deepen reforms and
improve the country's fiduciary management system.
6.3   Concerning the safeguards of the BCEAO, the latest assessment was completed on
March 2010 and found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the
operational level. The overall governance framework could nonetheless be strengthened by the
addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate
oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements.
These elements are being addressed through the Institutional Reform of the WAEMU and the
BCEAO.
6.4   Durable gains in transparency, effectiveness of the financial management systems,
and accountability will require sustained and coordinated engagement of Togo's
international partners in support of the Government's reform process. The IMF, through the
West Africa AFRITAC, is providing technical assistance in public financial management and tax
administration to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Other donors like the AfDB, the
European Union and French cooperation also support capacity building in PFM. From a recent
diagnostic mission conducted by AFRITAC, an action plan has been proposed to facilitate the
implementation of Program Budgeting introduced with the latest WAEMU PFM Directives. The
last PEMFAR (2009) has identified areas in particular need of remedial action, and a
42


﻿comprehensive Action Plan to address those has been prepared by the Government. A baseline of
current procurement practices using the OECD/DAC guidelines, established as part of the
PEMFAR, is also enabling evidence-based monitoring of improvements in the near future. As a
result of the PEMFAR, technical assistance to strengthen public financial management has been
identified as a priority for additional coordinated donor support. Continued donor assistance will
help the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are applied to provide
reasonable assurance that resources are used for the intended purposes.
C. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
6.5   Credit amount and tranching. The recipient is the Republic of Togo, represented by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The credit will be released in one tranche of SDR 9.1 million
(US$14 million equivalent) following its approval and notification by the Association of
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement.
6.6   Disbursement and accounting. The proposed operation will follow IDA's disbursement
procedures for development policy operations. Upon approval of the credit by the Board and
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, and provided the Association is satisfied with the
program being carried out by the Recipient and with the appropriateness of the Recipient's
macroeconomic policy framework, the proceeds of the credit would be disbursed by IDA into an
account at the central bank of Togo, the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de Ouest
(BCEAO), and forming part of the official foreign exchange reserves of Togo. The proceeds of
the credit would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. The
recipient shall ensure that upon deposit of the Credit into that account, an equivalent amount is
promptly credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA.
The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and
credited in local currency to the budget management system. Assuming that the withdrawal
request is in Euro, the equivalent amount in CFAF reported in the budgetary system will be
based on the market rate at the date of the transfer. The Recipient will promptly, within 30 days,
notify IDA that an amount equivalent to the proceeds have been credited to an account available
to finance budgeted expenditures, with an indication of the exchange rate applied.
6.7   Auditing. IDA reserves the right to request an audit of the foreign currency account, on
terms of reference acceptable to IDA. If, after being deposited in this account, the proceeds of
the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will
require the recipient to promptly refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to the
Association upon such request shall be cancelled.
6.8   Closing date: The expected closing date of the Credit is December 31, 2012.
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.9   The reforms supported by the proposed development policy credit are not expected
to have significant effects on the environment, forest or other natural resources. The prior
actions are focused on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's current
strategy and policy, not changing the policy directions or supporting any investments, and thus
43


﻿even at the sectoral level, the prior actions are not likely to have adverse impacts on the country's
environment and natural resources:
(i)  In the cotton sector, the prior action helps improve NSCT's management and
accountability by providing cost estimates per season (as opposed to per fiscal year).
The production of such a cost table for the 2010/2011 season allows the producer
representatives in the FNGPC to assess the acceptability of the final price offered by
NSCT for cotton produced during the exceptional 2010/2011 season. Thus the prior
action is not expected to have any impact on sector investments or land use.
(ii) In the energy sector, the appointment of the General Manager for the CEET is expected
to improve the company management, including the environmental aspects related to
electricity production and distribution such as reduced transmission losses. Hence the
prior action on improving management efficiency is not expected to have any adverse
impact on energy investment or any other environmental impacts. In fact, the improved
efficiency in better management may have some positive environmental impact on the
current systems.
(iii) In the telecommunications sector, the prior action focuses on having a concrete strategy
for a clear sequence of reforms to open the ICT market to competition, improve the
business environment, and facilitate improved private sector performance. Hence no
adverse effect on the environment is expected.
(iv) In the banking sector, the privatization of the four existing state-owned banks would
restore good governance; efficient management according to commercial principles and
would provide new capital and managerial expertise conducive to increased credit to
private sector. Thus no adverse effect on the environment is expected.
6.10   While no adverse impact on the environment is expected in this operation, the Bank
is working to assist the Government to continue improving its capacity in environment
management through other engagements. For example, the Bank has helped the government
to prepare a Country Environmental Analysis that identifies the key priorities for boosting the
capacity for environment management to enhance the positive environmental impact while
mitigating against the adverse impact of the activities in its Poverty Reduction Strategy. The
First Annual Progress Report of the PRSP26 has indicated significant progress in setting up the
administrative capacity and completing training of the relevant personnel. The Bank will
continue assisting the authorities in their efforts to improve their environmental management
capacity through its various engagements with Togo.
E. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
6.11   With a per capita income of US$440 Togo remains one of the world's poorest
countries. Based on the 2006 QUIBB survey,27 an estimated 62 percent of Togo's population
lives below the poverty line, with the rural areas showing the highest share of poor people (74
percent versus 37 percent in urban areas). These findings do not reflect the shocks that affected
26 See Government of Togo (2010) Annual Progress Report on Implementation of the Full PRSP for Reaching the
Completion Point under the HIPC Initiative.

﻿the country in 2008 and 2009, in particular the rise in food and oil prices, as well as the flooding
and the financial crisis and global economic slowdown. Furthermore, economic growth has not
been strong relative to population growth and, as a result, GDP per capita only grew sligthly.
6.12  In the absence of new data on poverty (new poverty estimates are expected late
February 2012), poverty projections out of the 2006 QUIBB can provide indications on the
trajectory poverty is likely to have followed since 2006. Two arguable plausible 'consumption
updating technologies' have been employed to update poverty estimates. The first updates
household consumption using GDP per capita growth. Implicitly it assumes that household
consumption and GDP growth move in tandem. The other assumes that changes in per capita
consumption are better reflected by changes in per capita non-government consumption. Figure
6.1 presents results for projections based on both assumptions. It shows that poverty declined to
60% in 2011 (from 62% in 2006) when consumption is projected forward using GDP per capita
growth. However, when consumption is projected forward using per capita non-government
consumption, poverty increased to 66%.
6.13  Based on these projections, it is fair to conclude that since 2006 Togo made limited
progress reducing poverty. Note that even under the optimistic scenario under which poverty
reduced from 62 percent to 60 percent, the absolute number of people living in poverty increased
from 3.0 million to 3.5 million. This should not come as a surprise. In the 5 years since the 2006
QUIBB was implemented, average annual GDP growth rate was 3.1 percent. With a rate of
population growth of 2.8 percent (according to preliminary estimates from the latest census) this
leaves 0.5 percent of growth per capita. If one adds that growth may not have been equally
shared across the population and that (public) investments increased significantly to recover from
the crisis years, it is plausible that levels of poverty did not change much over the recent past. It
is expected that the upcoming ESW (Technical Notes on Poverty and Gender) will provide more
accurate and up to date information on recent poverty developments, especially regarding
regional poverty and inequality.
6.14  The measures supported by the proposed ERGC-5 are expected to have positive
income and distributional effects. Specifically, expected benefits include:
(i)  contributing to overall economic growth and hence income generation;
(ii) strengthening of public expenditure management, which would enhance efficiency,
transparency and accountability in public resource use, including for social sectors;
(iii) strengthening governance in the cotton sector through measures that improve the
accounting system of NSCT and which provide essential information to cotton
producers to determine the fairness of the price offered;
(iv) providing a clear path towards a competitive telecommunications sector, thereby
improving the business environment and providing poor households with cheap mobile
communication tools as well as other products such as mobile savings accounts;
(v) privatizing four state owned banks thereby generating revenue for government while
putting the banking sector on a more sustainable footing and enhancing access to credit
by the private sector; and
45


﻿(vi) contributing to improved management at the CEET and helping to create a conducive
business environment.

6.15  While the ERGC-5 does not have a special focus on rural poverty, it supports
measures that will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor. In the cotton sector, improving
governance is expected to further increase confidence of farmers and thereby facilitate a rebound
in cotton production and improve the livelihood of a large segment of the population. Indeed,
about 300,000 people rely on this cash crop as a dominant source of earnings. Enhancing the
management of CEET will allow for the stepping up of electricity distribution with positive
impacts on the poor population's health and security (replaces use of kerosene lamps for lighting,
facilitates operations of health clinics including storage of medicines, and provides public
lighting in urban and semi-urban areas). Strengthening the financial sector, in conjunction with
reforms in the telecommunications sector, is expected to benefit small and medium enterprises
gaining access to means for savings as a stepping stone towards gaining access to credit while
increasing access to relevant market information and reducing transaction costs. Furthermore, as
a budget support operation, the ERGC-5 would help fund the provision of basic public services
with a beneficial impact on the poor.
Given the overall thrust of the ERGC-5, no negative impacts on vulnerable groups are
envisaged. On the contrary, all the measures considered should result in improved overall well-
being because of better governance, more efficient and equitable Government services and
enhanced economic growth.
F. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.16 The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall
implementation of the proposed ERGC-5. Day-to-day monitoring of the program will be the
responsibility of the Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform (Comite de Suivi des Programmes
46


﻿et Reformes), an existing high-level team within the Ministry, headed by the Permanent
Secretary. This arrangement is justified by the strength and continuity of this team during the
previous operations and their close involvement in the ongoing policy reform dialogue, including
with the IMF and other development partners. The main technical responsibility for
implementation of the public financial management reforms will stay with the Budget and
Treasury Departments, whose representatives are part of the Public Finance Steering Committee
(Comite de pilotage des finances publiques) created in 2005. The sector reforms will be
implemented by the respective technical departments in the sector ministries, under the oversight
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (cotton sector), the Ministry of Mines and Energy
(phosphates and energy), the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications with the overall
coordination provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
6.17  The MEF economic team will also be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the
results of the program. The Government will provide quarterly reports to IDA on
implementation progress measured against the established timetables and the agreed performance
indicators. The overall reform effort will be reviewed by the Government in close coordination
with regular Bank supervision to ensure continued implementation of the program within an
adequate macroeconomic policy framework.
G.    RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
6.18  The following risks and risk mitigation strategies have been identified.
(i)  Political risk. Political risk. The March 2010 presidential elections were perceived by
the international community as fair and inclusive. Incumbent president Faure
Gnassingb6 was reelected with 61 percent of the votes and the main opposition party
(Union des Forces du Changement) was included in the Government. This broadened
the basis to implement critical reforms, but it also led to a deep split in the opposition.
The inter-party dialogue initiated by the government within the "Cadre Permanent pour
le Dialogue et la Concertation - CPDC" to discuss constitutional and institutional
reforms has intensified in view of the parliamentary and local elections, scheduled for
the third quarter of 2012. The first phase of the CPDC discussions ended in February
2012 with the submission to the government of a list of key recommendations.
Government has also initiated a separate dialogue with the two parliamentary
opposition parties, i.e. the Comit6 d'Action pour le Renouveau (CAR) and the Alliance
Nationale pour le Changement (ANC). Both parties have objections to participating in
the CPDC, but in a key step towards building a broad-based political consensus in the
run-up to the 2012 elections, they have agreed in February 2012, to enter into trilateral
negotiations with the ruling party, the RPT (Rassemblement du peuple togolais). These
talks have now stalled because no agreement can be reached. But the recent dissolution
in April 2012 of the ruling party RPT, which has been in power for over 40 years, and
the creation of a new party led by the President (Union pour le R6publique - UNIR),
which is said to be open to all Togolese people and to all skills that will help in Togo's
reconstruction process, may cause a reconfiguration of the country's political
landscape.
47


﻿On the other hand, the National Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission
completed its work and delivered its report and recommendations to the President who
committed to implement them.
Future instability can never be ruled out completely but the expectation is that the 2012
parliamentary and local elections, planned for October, will be peaceful even though in
the run-up to these elections strikes and popular protests may intensify.
The World Bank will continue to monitor the situation very closely, in collaboration
with our partners. The Bank will also exert great care in its communication strategy to
avoid misinterpretation by the media of its substantive and technical messages.
(ii) Vested interests risk. In reaching the HIPC completion point in December 2010, a
major incentive for reform disappeared, increasing the space for vested interests to
delay the reform program. At the same time, greater transparency, more accountable
practices adopted by the Government in combination with citizens who expect to
benefit from the new-found stability provide an incentive to maintain momentum in
implementing the reform agenda. Reform is furthermore facilitated by the fact that
previous reforms are starting to pay off, for instance through higher rates of economic
growth.
Through the proposed prior actions the Government continues to demonstrate its
commitment to reform. Close coordination with the IMF, AfDB, EU, and bilateral
donors will help ensure that the Government continues to give priority to structural
reforms.
(iii) Macroeconomic risks stem   from  the vulnerability of the Togolese economy to
exogenous (commodity and climatic) shocks, the potential for a further deterioration of
the Euro crisis and a sluggish economic recovery of the United States. Sustainable
fiscal policies will provide a buffer against the impact of these shocks but require
discipline, particularly in the run-up to a new election. There is also the risk that the
open-ended fuel subsidies will continue; and that the expenditure increases in the 2012
budget which are financed by one-off income sources will result in a sustained long-
term fiscal strain in the budget. Moreover, as an exporter of primary commodities,
Togo remains exposed to adverse shocks to commodity demand and negative shocks to
its terms of trade, particularly as prices of some of its major exports (phosphates,
cotton) have been favorable in the recent past and may start to revert to their long term
trend. Given Togo's role as a hub for regional trade, shocks in neighboring countries
could also hurt Togo's economic prospects. While these negative risks are real, there
could also be mitigating factors as growth rates may be revised upward, following the
successful implementation of various structural reforms, and as the proceeds from the
privatization of banks may be more than what has been (prudently) budgeted.
To mitigate the negative macroeconomic risks, the IMF and IDA will continue to
closely monitor Togo's macroeconomic performance, will carry out in-depth policy
dialogue about the budget and its composition and will continue to support the real
sector reform program with a view of enhancing efficiency, competitiveness and levels
of production. The potential adverse commodity price shocks are mitigated by
declining production by other major phosphate producers, and restocking by cotton
consumers. This helps sustain prices at the world market at relatively high levels.
48


﻿Meanwhile, rising levels of production are offsetting downward pressure on prices and
mitigate declines in turnover of Togo's main exports. The PFM and banking reforms
supported by this operation, finally, not only help to improve the efficiency of public
investment, they also increase the resilience of the financial sector in Togo.
(iv) Fiduciary risk. Despite recent reforms, fiduciary risk remains from possible mis-use of
funds. Despite improvements through measures taken under the Government's PFM
reform program (supported through previous ERGGs), further improving fiduciary
standards remains an important objective of the proposed operation. The prior actions
of the present operation are expected to help mitigate the fiduciary risk, and their
effective implementation will be closely monitored.
(v)  Implementation capacity risk arises from the lack of sufficient professional staff and
weak institutional capacity in the wake of Togo's socio-political instability. Capacity to
take budget planning and execution to a higher level remains scarce and in need of
reinforcement. The capacity risk is mitigated through the provision of technical
assistance by IDA (such as the Financial Sector and Governance TA Project supporting
financial sector reform) and others (IMF, AFRITAC, AfDB, EC and France).
(vi) Coordination risk arises from the existence of multiple public officials involved in
reforms without a clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities. This occurs within the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (in charge of PFM reforms), between the Ministry of
Finance and line ministries (e.g. telecom reform) and between ministries and public
entities (cotton sector reform). The planned restructuring of the Ministry of Economy
and Finance will help address coordination and communication issues within the
Ministry, especially between the General Secretary and the reform coordinating unit.
6.19  In IDA's assessment, the potential benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA's assistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in a coordinated fashion with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize
the sustainability of the reform agenda.

﻿Annex 1: Letter of Development Policy
REPUBLIC OF TOGO
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE
PERMANENT SECRETARIAT FOR POLICY REFORM
AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM MONITORING
No. 1698/MEF/SP-PRPF                              Lomb, April 12, 2012
Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President of the World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
United States of America
Mr. President,
1.    This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) presents the progress made and outlines the
current socioeconomic situation and trends for the 2012-2014 period. It describes the
development policies and objectives identified by the authorities with the aim of continuing their
budget support program started in 2008, which seeks to strengthen economic growth and
improve the living conditions of the population. To achieve these objectives, the authorities are
once again seeking the assistance from the international community and in particular the World
Bank, through the Fifth Economic Recovery and Governance Credit (ERGC-5).
I.    Political and Socioeconomic Context
2.    The tranquil political climate facilitated the convening of peaceful legislative elections in
October 2007 and presidential elections in March 2010, the results of which were accepted by
the international community. To build on this progress, a political agreement was concluded
between the two main political parties. This facilitated the formation of a national unity
government shortly after the March 4, 2010 elections, a move that helped solidify the peaceful
political situation in Togo. The Government will continue this approach with respect to future
elections and in particular the legislative elections slated for October 2012.
3.    After the full restoration of cooperation with the technical and financial partners followed
by the establishment of major democratic and economic institutions, the Government turned its
attention to reviving the economy through the implementation of economic development and
poverty reduction programs, while continuing to focus on maintaining a peaceful political
climate.
50


﻿4.    Continuing efforts to maintain a peaceful climate, the Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation
Commission was established. Its mandate is to investigate the political violence that has plagued
the country since independence. Its work on the ground has been outstanding-it took roughly
20,000 depositions, which were reviewed and then followed either by public or closed-door
hearings. The Commission's report was duly submitted to the Head of State on April 3, 2012.
5.    The Government plans to continue political and social dialogue with the aim of
strengthening the progress achieved with the Comprehensive Political Agreement (CPA)
concluded in August 2006 through implementation of the recommendations of the Truth, Justice,
and Reconciliation Commission, as well as the restructured Permanent Framework for Dialogue
and Consultation [Cadre Permanent de Dialogue et de Concertation CPDC].
6.    In order to take the demands of all national political stakeholders into account, the
Government entered into talks with those parties that opted not to participate in CPDC
negotiations.
7.    The economic recovery and poverty reduction program     seeks to strengthen
macroeconomic stability, continue efforts to establish sound public finances, improve the public
procurement system, and strengthen public enterprise governance with a view to promoting
robust and sustainable economic growth and thus raise the standard of living of the population.
This program will be considered in the context of the second generation Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) under preparation, the strategic thrusts of which are centered on
accelerated growth, a driver of job creation.
8.    The three-year program (2008-2010), supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF),
was satisfactorily executed, despite the difficult global economic and financial situation.
Moreover, the financial situation has improved significantly, owing to sustained efforts to make
public finance management rigorous and transparent. Based on the 2011 Government Flow of
Funds Table [Tableau des op6rations financi&res de l'Etat TOFE], total revenue stood at CFAF
316.5 billion at end-December 2011, compared to CFAF 294.4 billion in 2010. The State has
adopted a plan to settle domestic arrears, implementation of which has been under way since
2009. Sector reform, particularly in the banking, cotton, energy, and phosphate sectors is
continuing.
9.    Although economic growth recorded following the Government's efforts has been
positive, it remains inadequate relative to the colossal needs in the area of poverty reduction. In
2011, based on preliminary information, growth is projected at 4.8 percent, a rate higher than the
2010 rate of 3.7 percent. Moreover, as of end-December 2011, inflation, which is often linked
to the inadequate supply of food products on the market, remained at acceptable levels, albeit
higher than the Community average of 3 percent-3.6 percent compared to 2.1 percent in 2010.
10.   The recent economic outlook has been affected by the crisis in the Euro Zone, anemic
recovery in the United States, and subdued growth in the emerging economies, particularly in
Asia. The global economic recovery outlook points to the need for cautious optimism.
51


﻿11.   Signs of economic recovery are becoming clearer in Togo and the projected growth rate
for 2012 stands at 5.6 percent. This growth is attributable to the different reforms implemented
by the Government in the sectors with growth potential.
II. The 2012-2013 Program
General Objectives
12.   During the 2012-2013 period, the Government expects to step up its economic recovery
program by continuing and strengthening the economic reforms started since 2006. These
reforms target maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework conducive to sustainable
economic growth, capable of improving the population's living conditions. The goals for 2012
are to (i) continue the economic reform program, which focuses on achieving greater
transparency by combating fraud and corruption; (ii) improve public finance management; (iii)
adhere closely to the financial orthodoxy in budget execution; (iv) honor the commitments made
to international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank, in
particular) and bilateral donors with a view to strengthening relations with these institutions; and
(v) further strengthen the audit system (the Audit Office [Cour des Comptes], the General State
Inspectorate [Inspection G6n6rale d'Etat IGE], and the General Finance Inspectorate [Inspection
G6n6rale des Finances IGF]).
13.   The measures planned to boost agricultural productivity, settle domestic debt, and
increase absorptive capacity as well as the level of public investment expenditure will pave the
way for achieving a real GDP growth rate of over 5.6 percent in 2012 and beyond. Special
emphasis will be placed on the economic sectors with growth potential, in particular the
agricultural and mining (phosphates) sectors and on improving the business climate. To this end,
the National Agricultural Investment and Food Security Program [Programme National
d'Investissement Agricole et la S6curit6 Alimentaire PNIA-SA] adopted by the Government, was
officially launched on February 16, 2012. Some projects linked to this program are being
finalized with technical and financial partners (among them, the World Bank, the West African
Development Bank, the Economic Community of West African States Bank for Investment, and
the International Fund for Agricultural Development), who are assisting the Government with
this program. All these activities will lend renewed impetus to the agricultural sector, thus
paving the way for its robust growth, reflected in a growth rate of at least six percent per year.
14.   Togo became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate country in
2010 and is committed to implementing the action plan in order to become a compliant country.
15.   Togo's full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for the 2009-2011 period, which
ended in 2011, sets forth the medium-term plans of the Government. The new generation
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is being prepared and will focus on building on the gains of
the full PRSP and will be oriented toward accelerated, sustainable, inclusive, and employment-
driven growth. A reform program is outlined in this Letter of Development Policy. These
reforms essentially target (i) strengthening public finance management; (ii) improving the
investment climate so as to foster private sector growth; (iii) expanding access to health,
education, and basic social services; (iv) continuing to build and rehabilitate road and energy
52


﻿sector infrastructure; and (v) continuing the financial sector restructuring process. The
Government will continue its work with the aim of achieving its objectives to be set forth in the
new generation PRSP.
16.   In the context of the business climate, a new and modernized investment code, prepared
with World Bank assistance, was approved by the National Assembly in January 2012.
Dissemination of the SME/SMI charter is continuing throughout Togo. The Government
organized the National Economic Forum, held from March 27-29, 2012 in Lom6, with the
assistance of the technical departments of the International Monetary Fund. Its overall objective
is to build a consensus with development actors (government, civil society, the private sector,
academicians, technical and financial partners, etc.) with respect to medium-term
macroeconomic, structural, and social policy thrusts, as well as programs supported by the
technical and financial partners. The outcomes of the forum should also serve to fine-tune the
second generation poverty reduction strategy, currently being drafted.
Governance and Structural Reforms
17.   The Government is firm in its resolve to continue to improve public finance management
in the context of economic and financial governance. To this end, implementation of the Reform
Strategy adopted by the Government in September 2010 by Presidential Decree, which
emphasizes public finance management reform in particular, will continue. The Government is
also committed to continuing efforts to combat corruption and fraud and to create an economic
and regulatory climate conducive to economic activity.
18.   The 2011 budget was executed in a rigorous, transparent, and efficient manner, with no
accumulation of domestic or foreign arrears or recourse to special public expenditure execution
procedures. Revenue and expenditure procedures reflect implementation of the reforms started
by the Government. The 2011 budget was executed using the Integrated System for Public
Finance Management [Systeme Integre de Gestion de Finances Publiques SIGFiP]. The 2012
budget was adopted by the Council of Ministers and approved by the National Assembly on
December 30, 2011. This budget, like the previous one, accords priority to expenditures on
education, health, infrastructure rehabilitation, agriculture, energy, water and sanitation, and the
settlement of domestic debt.
19.   In 2012, the Government will continue implementation of the reforms aimed at the
following, in particular: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) tracking public expenditure
on poverty reduction; (iii) submitting draft budget review laws to the Audit Office; (iv)
strengthening public finance management transparency; (v) continuing publication of data on
foreign and domestic debt; (vi) preserving the viability of public debt by giving priority to grants
or loans on concessional terms; (vii) strengthening implementation of the National Education
Sector Plan; (viii) adopting a plan of action to strengthen, in the short term, capacity for rapid
and efficient project execution; (ix) continuing reform of the public procurement system; and (x)
strengthening public enterprise reform.
20.    In addition to these reforms, the Government undertakes to (i) adopt the implementing
documents for the WAEMU public finance management Directives, once the National Assembly
approves the Transparency Code and Organic Law for the approved budget derived from these
53


﻿Directives submitted to it; (ii) continue publication of quarterly budget execution reports; (iii)
continue to submit the draft budget to the National Assembly along with the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework for a number of sectoral departments by the statutory deadlines; (iv)
establish an effective mechanism for following up on the recommendations of audit missions; (v)
approve the terms of reference, recruit the consultant, and begin the review of the feasibility of
allowing private shareholders to acquire shares in the New Cotton Company of Togo (NSCT);
(vi) conduct a feasibility study on an Integrated System for Public Procurement Management
(SIGMAP); (vii) prepare and update the mining code and submit it to the National Assembly;
(viii) computerize the storage and inventory system for spare parts for the New Phosphate
Company of Togo (SNPT); (ix) prepare a plan for the implementation of phases two and three of
the strategy for the recovery of the phosphate sector, and conduct a search for a strategic partner;
and (x) implement the recommendations of the accounting, financial, and organizational audit of
the Togo Electricity Company (CEET). The Government has adopted measures to strengthen the
areas of public finance, the financial sector, the phosphate sector, the cotton sector, the energy
sector, the transport sector, and the social sectors. This LDP goes on to describe the key actions
that we have taken in each of the foregoing sectors as well as the actions planned for 2011-2012.
Reestablishment of the Financial Orthodoxy
21.   Public expenditure management has improved considerably owing to the (i) sound
execution of the 2011 budget; (ii) effective implementation of a cash flow plan based on a
monthly budget execution performance chart; and (iii) strengthening of internal budget execution
audits. The Government will continue to improve cash flow management and procurement
procedures and will publish budget execution reports periodically. The activities listed below
illustrate the Government's reform efforts in the area of public finance:
*  Eighty percent of budget allocations for recurrent expenditures for all the priority
ministries were authorized since the beginning of the year, and 100 percent by July 2011,
and all investment expenditures were authorized since the beginning of the year;
*  The draft budget for 2012, along with the program budgets for the Ministry of Primary
and Secondary Education and Literacy, the Ministry of Technical Education and
Vocational Training, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and
Village Water Development, and the MTEFs of the Ministry of Agriculture were
submitted to the National Assembly, which approved them on December 30, 2011;
* The 2011 budget execution reports are produced quarterly and submitted to the World
Bank and the IMF within two months of the review period. This information is also
available on the website of the Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform and Financial
Program Monitoring (www.togoreforme.com);
* The performance chart for the monthly tracking of budget execution was introduced and
continues to be prepared and transmitted each month to the development partners and
published on the website www.togoreforme.com. This performance chart serves as a true
decision-making tool of the Treasury Planning Committee and thus of the Government;
54


﻿* The Government has continued with implementation of the strategy to settle domestic
debt arrears with a view to restoring the confidence of suppliers. The strategy applies to
all domestic debt arrears included in the 2007 audit conducted by the firm KPMG and
updated in subsequent years, which was validated by the Government;
* The Government has adopted a public procurement reform action plan, based on the 2003
CPAR, by establishing the National Directorate for Public Procurement Oversight
[Direction Nationale du Contr6le des Marchis Publics DNCMP] and the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority [Autorit de Rfgulation des Marchis Publics ARMP].
The creation of the Public Procurement Oversight Offices [Services de Contr6le des
Marchis Publics SCMPs] in the priority ministries was extended to other ministries,
major public enterprises, and the Municipality of Lom6. All these entities have been
operational since January 2011. The public procurement website has been created
(www.marchespublics-togo.com) and information has been posted on this website. The
public procurement journal is issued every two weeks.  A consultant hired with
assistance from the African Development Bank through its Institutional and Financial
Capacity-Building Support Project (PARCI-2) has sought to help with the establishment
of standard procurement documents so as to make the contract award process and thus
budget execution more efficient;
* The Integrated System for Public Finance Management (SIGFiP) has been operational
since 2009 and was used for execution of the 2011 budget in order to enhance efficiency
and transparency. It was used for the closing of the 2011 management accounts;
* The preliminary draft Decree-Laws and draft Decrees related to the adoption of the six
WAEMU Directives were prepared and transmitted to the Government General
Secretariat [Secrtariat Gndral du Gouvernement] on December 15, 2010. The
WAEMU Directive on budget laws was adopted by the Council of Ministers in January
2011 and transmitted to the National Assembly. The Transparency Code was adopted by
the Council of Ministers on March 1, 2012 and transmitted to the National Assembly.
The Council of Ministers is expected to adopt the implementing decrees after approval of
these different laws by the National Assembly;
* The cash balance is generated by SIGFiP;
* An Interministerial Committee and Technical Secretariat for Forecasting tasked with
assisting the Treasury Committee have been established by means of Decree and are
operational;
* The draft budget review law for FY 2010 has been prepared and submitted to the Audit
Office. The Audit Office submitted the report on 2007 budget execution to Parliament in
June 2011;
* The budgets for 2012, 2011, 2010, and 2009 have been published on the website www.
togoreforme.com;
55


﻿* The oversight entities (IGF and IGE) have been trained in planning risk-based approach
audit missions;
* The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority has prepared standard procurement
documents (works, consultants, supplies). These documents will be published on the
procurement website;
* 2010 contract compliance audits for the five key ministries (health, agriculture,
education, works, and water and sanitation), seven major companies (Togot616com,
NSCT, LONATO, CEET, TdE, SALT, and PAL), and the Municipality of Lom6 have
been conducted;
*  The NSCT and FNGPC [Federation Nationale des Groupements des Producteurs de
Coton] have provided a cost table for the 2010/2011 growing season, based on a detailed
cost structure and reconciliation with general accounting procedures;
*  The Director General of the CEET was appointed through an open and competitive
selection process and an engagement letter, based on the company's performance, was
signed by the CEET Board of Directors;
*  An updated strategy outlining a clear sequence of reforms for establishing a competitive
information, communication, and technology market was adopted by the Council of
Ministers; and
*  The privatization process of the four public banks (BTCI, UTB, BTD, and BIA-TOGO)
is ongoing. The deadline for deposit of the prequalification files by buyers of these four
banks was September 2011. Offers for two banks (UTB and BTD) were received in
January 2012. Evaluations were done and final offers are expected to be made by April
20, 2012. Invitations to tender for the other two banks (BTCI and BIA-TOGO) were also
extended on March 7 and the deadline for preliminary bids, set for April 10, 2012, has
been pushed back to April 24, 2012. All transactions must be completed before end-June
2012.
22.   During the 2012-2013 period, the Togolese authorities intend to take further action to
strengthen public finance management.
23.   The Government will continue to improve PEFA scores through implementation of the
public finance management reform strategy. It will also continue to address the challenges
pertaining to public expenditure management, which were highlighted in the recent Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) report. This includes
(i) improving budget programming; (ii) observing the budget schedule; (iii) aligning, in a more
effective manner, the composition of line item expenditures initially approved while maintaining
the priorities identified in Togo's poverty reduction strategy; (iv) increasing the share of
expenditures of the priority sectors; (v) expanding use of SIGFiP; and (vi) continuing publication
of budget-related information. Special emphasis will be placed on improving the business
climate with the aim of obtaining better doing business scores.
56


﻿To this end, the Government intends to:
*  Begin incorporation of the six WAEMU public finance Directives into domestic
legislation after their adoption, along with their implementing documents;
*  Shorten the timeframes for submission of the 2013 draft budget to the National Assembly
along with the Medium Term Expenditure Framework and program budgets for the line
ministries (education, health, agriculture, water and sanitation, infrastructure sectors,
etc.);
*  Close the management accounts for the 2012 budget using SIGFiP, as was done in 2011;
and
*  Implement the recommendations of the accounting, financial, and organizational audit of
the CEET.
Financial Sector Reforms
24.   In addition to the reforms in the aforementioned areas, significant reforms were also
instituted to restructure the banking system, with a view to making it more competitive and solid,
and capable of financing the economy. To that end, with support from partners, notably the
World Bank and the IMF, the Government proceeded with the development, and validation
during a workshop, of the financial sector's development strategy.
25.   The entity responsible for recovering non-performing loans acquired by the State [Soci6t6
de Recouvrement des Cr6ances improductives reprises par l'Etat] during the restructuring
exercise for State-owned banks was established by decree, and the law granting it the powers of
a public treasury is currently being drafted.
26.   The institutional restructuring process includes the development of internal procedures,
strengthening of internal audits and loan procedures, and the preparation of manuals of
procedure. An oversight committee was also instituted and is supervising the management-
related activities of the banks, with the assistance of the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO), until the completion of the bank privatization process. These measures, which are
supplemented by monitoring and evaluation activities conducted by World Bank and IMF staff
and the Financial Sector and Governance Project (PSFG), will contribute to improved
governance in the banking sector.
27.   The Government remains committed to selling these banks to reference partners with a
solid capital base and renowned expertise in the context of the privatization process currently
under way.
28.   The microfinance sector plays a key role in efforts to reduce poverty, create jobs, and
finance the economy in Togo. The Government therefore intends to continue its work in this
sector with a view to its development. A microfinance committee comprising representatives
from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, microfinance institutions, and the BCEAO, as well
as resource persons, was established to discuss ways to improve governance in this sector.
57


﻿29.   The pension sector has faced daunting challenges. A financial and organizational audit
and an actuarial study of Togo's Pension Fund [Caisse de Retraites du Togo CRT] were
therefore conducted to mitigate these problems.
30.   The Government will build on the gains made by the financial system during the 2012-
2013 period, by implementing a specific strategy and actions for each component, namely, the
banking sector, the pension system, and the microfinance sector, in accordance with the
recommendations emanating from the workshop held in February to validate the financial
sector's development strategy and the national economic forum organized in March 2012.
Mining Sector Reforms
31.   Togo became an EITI candidate country on October 20, 2010 and intends to implement
the detailed action plan within the specified timeframe in order to become EITI-compliant. An
international firm was hired to reconcile mining sector data pertaining to royalties and fees paid
to the Treasury. The first report was completed and posted on March 30, 2012 on the website of
the EITI-Togo secretariat and on the Permanent Secretary's website (www.togoreforme.com), in
accordance with EITI requirements, thus attesting to the Government's desire for a successful
outcome.
32.   As part of its efforts to promote transparency in the sector, the Government will continue
to publish the sector's financial flows, particularly the reconciliation of data on royalties and fees
paid to the Government in accordance with EITI requirements.
33.   The Government is also continuing with the implementation of the development strategy
for the phosphate sector, which was adopted in April 2010 to revitalize the phosphate sector.
34.   The restoration of good governance, underpinned by a sound strategic vision for
developing the mining sector as a whole, is the Government's key objective and the challenge in
the years ahead.
Cotton Sector Reforms
35.   Far-reaching reforms have been implemented in the cotton sector since 2008 and the
Government plans to put mechanisms in place with a view to benefiting from the potential
offered by the increase in global prices. Although these reforms contributed to an uptick in
cotton production in 2011, problems pertaining to the financing of inputs persist. The
Government hopes to launch feasibility studies on the opportunity for private investors to
become shareholders in the NSCT, joining producers and the State, which currently own 40
percent and 60 percent, respectively.
Energy Sector Reforms
36.   Major reforms have been instituted in the energy sector, in particular the implementation
of the recommendations from various studies and the settlement of debt owed to the CEET by
the State, local governments, government offices, and government agencies with autonomous
budgets.
58


﻿37.   The Government hired a consortium   to conduct the accounting, financial, and
organizational audit of the CEET and the implementation of the ensuing recommendations will
help improve the company's performance.
38.   The performance contract concluded between the Government and the CEET is being
executed, and the State intends to provide support to the company to ensure the successful
outcome of this contract.
39.   With a view to boosting energy capacity, a contract was concluded with the Contour
Global company for the production of 100 MW of thermal energy. Contour Global began
production in October 2010, which eased energy supply constraints and strengthened the
reliability of the energy supply, thus enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises. The
Government also provided the CEET with a 20 MGW thermal plant in 2009. Along with Benin
and Ghana, Togo is a member of the West African Power Pool (WAPP), which is working to
construct the 330 kV line aimed at significantly increasing the electricity supply in countries in
the subregion. Efforts aimed at the construction of the Adjarala dam are continuing. In view of
the energy sector's key role in development, the Government will spare no effort to provide the
Togolese people with an adequate energy supply.
40.   The Government will continue carrying out the following actions already under way: (i)
strengthening private sector participation in the development of energy production; (ii)
increasing subregional cooperation in the production, purchase, sale, and transport of energy;
(iii) promoting the general use of domestic gas (LPG); (iv) establishing a fund for rural
electrification; (v) introducing a financing mechanism for the sector with the participation of
donors and the domestic financial system; (vi) building awareness among households about the
efficient use of all forms of energy; (vii) ensuring the sector's financial sustainability through
improved collection rates, the replacement of certain equipment, and routine payment of public
consumption costs; and (viii) developing, in the longer term, a sector plan to provide low-cost
electricity to customers.
Transport Sector Reforms
41.   In the area of land transport, the Government intends to improve the road infrastructure
by rehabilitating highways and roads, and constructing new highways and roads. There are plans
to construct bypasses around two geological obstacles-the Faille d'Al6djo and the Faille de
D6fal6, and work on these bypasses has already begun. Several other segments in Lom6 and the
country's inland areas are either being rehabilitated or rebuilt. We have secured funding for
several works in the port area and the construction of a bypass for the city of Lom6. In the 2012
budget, substantial resources were earmarked for road construction and rehabilitation in Lom6.
In view of this sector's tremendous needs, the Government has requested financing for the
rehabilitation of the Atakpam6-Blitta segment, under a regional project linking Lom6 to
Ouagadougou currently being evaluated by the African Development Bank and a number of
donors.
42.   The Government is also counting on donor support for the road sector over the next five
years.
59


﻿43.   The Government intends to continue executing the following activities: (i) the
construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance of rural and agricultural roads, urban roads,
bridges, and national and inter-State highways; (ii) the expansion or division of segments of the
major access roads to the capital; (iii) improvement of the road network layout; (iv) support of
the private organization of mass transport; and (v) the resumption of the implementation of
common policies and regional projects within ECOWAS and WAEMU in order to improve the
circulation of goods and people. To this end, a decree establishing the maintenance and new
generation funds will be adopted within the next few months. The Autonomous Road
Maintenance Fund [Soci6t6 Autonome de Financement de l'Entretien Routier SAFER] was
established to replace CAPER and the FR.
44.   With respect to maritime transport, major reforms aimed at improving the quality of
services at the Autonomous Port Authority of Lom6 [Port Autonome de Lom6 PAL] have been
under way for several years. Handling services were contracted to three private firms-
Manuport, SE2M, and SE3M. In addition, the installation of the ASYCUDA++ software in the
Port Authority's customs offices helped enhance the efficiency and speed of port operations. A
preliminary assessment to ascertain the progress of concessions and adopt measures to enhance
effectiveness will be conducted in the short term. Additional steps will be taken in the medium
term to improve the competitiveness of the PAL. To that end, in an effort to provide high-quality
services to its customers, the Port Authority designed a port development program that includes,
inter alia, the construction of a third dock, for which work is already under way, and a harbor
basin to transform the Lom6 port into a hub for the subregion through an increase in port
capacity, the construction of several parking areas and an inland dry port, the forthcoming
introduction of a one-stop shop, whose primary objective is to facilitate and expedite the various
formalities, and the implementation of a transport monitoring program. With a view to
improving the security, speed, and efficiency of port operations, the Alliance for the Promotion
of Lom6 Port [Alliance pour la Promotion du Port de Lom6 (A2PL)], an association comprising
the entire port community, continues to execute its activities. The primary objective of this
association is to provide a discussion forum for all actors in Togo's maritime transport chain.
45.   The Government also intends to define a long-term vision for the development and
positioning of PAL. Plans are therefore in place to conduct a strategic study.
Social Sector Reforms
46.   With respect to the health sector, the Government intends to consolidate the
implementation of the National Health Development Plan in the medium term (2008-2012), an
effort that includes a medium-term human resource development plan for the health sector,
which was adopted in July 2009. The Government also plans to conduct an institutional audit of
the Ministry of Health. In addition to these measures, the Government will ensure the
implementation of other actions such as (i) the continued strengthening of health infrastructure
and equipment and human resources, the preparation of a health map to accord greater priority to
areas poorly covered by the health system; (ii) the promotion of child and maternal health
through access to preventive and curative services, the implementation of an Expanded Program
on Immunization (EPI), the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and the implementation
of primary health care for newborns, infants, and children; (iii) ongoing malaria prevention and
treatment through the provision and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), the
60


﻿lowering of the price of anti-malaria medication, and the implementation of a malaria treatment
policy; (iv) the ongoing strengthening of tuberculosis screening and treatment through increased
capacity to detect new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB+) and improvements in the quality
of therapeutic care; and (v) continued HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment through awareness
building among young people and sex workers, condom distribution, STI prevention, blood
safety, counseling for voluntary and anonymous testing, and capacity building in patient care.
Accordingly, the Government adopted a decree that provides health insurance for government
employees, which came into force on March 1, 2012. The Government has stepped up efforts in
this area in a bid to reduce the neonatal mortality rate and achieve one of the MDGs (with the
launch of CARMA).
47.   In the education sector, the Government intends to continue efforts to integrate volunteer
and assistant teachers into the public service and (i) construct and rehabilitate educational
infrastructure; (ii) train trainers and educators; (iii) incorporate, in the short term, all these
actions into a sectoral program related to the Education For All - Fast Track Initiative, for which
the financing agreement concluded between the Government and the World Bank is currently
being executed; (iv) continue to improve teaching conditions in technical and vocational
training; (vi) continue promoting the education of young girls by reducing schooling costs; (v)
further improve the quality of higher education and promote gender equity in this sphere; and
(vi) continue strengthening facilities to accommodate the increasingly large number of students
enrolling in the country's universities.
48.   The water and sanitation sector remains a priority for the Government, which intends to
continue its efforts to improve access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure. To that end,
the Government formulated and adopted the national water policy and drafted the policy letter
for water supply in urban areas. A draft action plan for the Integrated Management of Water
Resources (GIRE) and the water code were developed. Several potable water supply projects are
currently being implemented, and the rate of access by the population to water was significantly
increased with the construction and rehabilitation of boreholes. Cleaning operations in the lagoon
in Lom6 are ongoing. We will continue executing emergency stormwater drainage works in
Lom6 and developing sanitation master plans for other cities. The Government will continue to
build awareness among households in the area of water and sanitation.
49.   Support for community development: With a view to improving the living conditions
of the poorest populations, the Government, with World Bank support under the Community
Development Project (PDC), undertook to provide these poor population groups with greater
access to high-quality public services and economic opportunities. The Government recently
acquired buses to ease the transportation woes of urban populations and provide transportation to
students who had organized strikes in recent months to call for better education conditions.
Monitoring and Evaluation
50.   The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for the overall implementation of
the program funded by the Fifth Economic Recovery and Governance Credit (ERGC-5). The
Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform and Financial Program Monitoring (PS-PRPF) is tasked
with day-to-day monitoring and evaluation of the program. It coordinates the implementation of
61


﻿the Government's program and is assisted by a program and reform monitoring committee and
focal points in each ministry. The Government will submit quarterly reports to the World Bank
on the program's implementation progress, which is measured against agreed timetables and
performance indicators.
51.   The Government hopes that these political, economic, and social reforms will help
strengthen its relations with the World Bank and its other bilateral and multilateral partners in
order to marshal the resources needed to improve the Togolese people's living conditions and
achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Request for Financing
52.   The Government is determined to build on the gains made thus far with respect to
political stability, continue structural reforms initiated in 2006, and benefit from the reduction in
the country's debt. To that end, the Government of Togo is committed to implementing the
program outlined above and described in the matrix in the attached annex. The Government is
therefore requesting that the World Bank provide technical and financial assistance for the
execution of its ambitious program under the Fifth Economic Recovery and Governance Credit
(ERGC-5), and that consideration be given to the possibility of providing IDA loans to finance
the reconstruction of damaged road infrastructure in the aftermath of more than 15 years of
social and political turmoil.
Very truly yours,

Monsieur Robert B. Zoellick
Président de la Banque Mondiale
1818 H Street NW

Monsieur le Président.,
1 La présente Lettre de Politique de Développement (LPD) présente les avancées
enregistrées et retrace la situation socio-économique aciuelle ainsi que les tendances
pour 2012-2014. Elle décrit les objectifs et les politiques de développement définis par
Les autorités pour la poursuite de leur programme d'appui budgétaire démarré en 2008
ci qui vise à consolider la croissance économique et à améliorer les conditions de v ie
des populations. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, les autorités recherchent une fois encore
l'appui de la communauté internationale et notamment celui de la Banque Mondiale à
travers le Crédit pour la Relance Economique et la Gouvernance (CRFG-5).
I.    Contexte politique et socio-économique

plan du secteur visant a assurer aux clients, la fourniture à moindre coût de
l'électricité.
Réformes du secteur des transports
40. Dans le domaine du transport terrestre, le Gouvernement entend développer les
infrastructures routières par la réhabilitation des routes et pistes, la construction de
nouvelles routes et pistes. Il est prévu le contournement de deux obstacles montagneux
notamment la faille d'Alédjo et celle de Défalé dont les travaux ont été déjà entamés.
Plusieurs autres tronçons tant à Lomé qu'à l'intérieur du pays sont en train d'être
réhabilités voire reconstruites. Nous avons obtenu des ressources pour le financement
de plusieurs travaux dans la zone portuaire et la construction d'une route de
contournement de la ville de Lomé. Dans le budget 2012, d'importantes ressources
73


﻿sont prévues pour la construction et la réhabilitation des routes à Lomé. Compte tenu
des besoins énormes que nécessite ce secteur, le Gouvernement a sollicité le
financement de la réhabilitation du tronçon Atakpamé-Blitta dans le cadre d'un projet
régional reliant Lomé à Ouagadougou dont l'évaluation est en cours par la Banque
Africaine de Développement et certains bailleurs de fonds,
41. En outre, le Gouvernement attend le soutien des bailleurs de fonds dans ce secteur
des routes pour les cinq prochaines années.
42. Le Gouvernement entend poursuivre : (i) la construction, la réhabilitation et
l'entretien des pistes rurales et agricoles, des voies urbaines, des ponts, des routes
nationales et nationales inter-Etats ; (ii) l'élargissement ou le dédoublement des
tronçons sur les grands axes d'accès à la capitale : (iii) l'amélioration de l'ossature du
réseau routier ; (iv) le soutien à l'organisation privée du transport de masse : et (v) la
redynamisation de la mise en oeuvre des politiques communes et de projets régionaux
au sein de la CEDEAO et de l'UEMOA en vue d'améliorer la circulation des biens et
des personnes. Pour ce faire, un décret permettant de créer les fonds d'entretien de
nouvelle génération sera adopté dans quelques mois. La Société Autonome de
Financement de l'Entretien Routier (SAFER) qui a été créée remplacera la CAPER et
le FR.
43. Dans le cadre du transport maritime, des réformes importantes ont été engagées
depuis plusieurs années pour améliorer la qualité des services au Port Autonome de
Lomé (PAL). A cet égard, les services de manutention ont été concédés à trois
entreprises privées à savoir Manuport, SE2M et SE3M. En outre, l'introduction du
logiciel Sydonia++ au poste de douanes du Port a permis de contribuer à
l'amélioration de l'efficacité et de la célérité des opérations portuaires. A court terme,
il sera procédé à une évaluation préliminaire pour apprécier l'état d'avancement des
concessions et prendre des mesures pour plus d'efficacité. A moyen terme, des efforts
supplémentaires seront faits dans le cadre de l'amélioration de la compétitivité du
PAL. Dans cette perspective, le Port, en quête de service de qualité pour ses clients, a
élaboré un programme de développement portuaire qui comprend entre autres, la
construction d'un troisième quai dont les travaux ont démarré et d'une darse pour faire
du port de Lomé un hub pour la sous-région en augmentant la capacité du port,
l'aménagement de plusieurs aires de stationnement, la construction d'un port sec à
l'intérieur du pays, la mise en place prochaine d'un guichet unique dont l'objectif
principal est de faciliter et d'accélérer les différentes formalités et ta mise en place
d'un programme de suivi du transit. Afin de renforcer la sécurité, la rapidité et
l'eficacité des opérations portuaires, l'association dénommée «Alliance pour la
Promotion du Port de Loné» (A2PL) qui regroupe toute la communauté portuaire
poursuit ses activités dont le but principal est d'offrir un cadre de concertation pour
tous les acteurs de la chaîne de transport maritime au Togo.
44. Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement entend définir une vision à long terme pour le
développement et le positionnement du PAL. A cet effet, il est prévu une étude
stratégique à cet effet.

﻿Réformes des secteurs sociaux
45. Pour le secteur de la santé, le Gouvernement va consolider la mise en oeuvre du
Plan National de Développement Sanitaire à moyen terme (2008-2012) incluant un
plan à moyen terme de développement des ressources humaines pour le secteur de la
santé adopté en juillet 2009. Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement entend mener un audit
institutionnel du Ministère de la santé. Outre ces mesures, le Gouvernement veillera à
mettre en uvre d'autres actions telles que : (i) la poursuite du renforcement des
infrastructures et équipements sanitaires, le renforcement des ressources humaines,
l'élaboration d'une carte sanitaire en vue de favoriser davantage les zones mal
couvertes par le système sanitaire ; (ii) la promotion de la santé maternelle et infantile
à travers l'accès aux services préventifs et curatifs, la mise en uvre d'un Programme
Elargi de Vaccination (PEV), la prévention des infections sexuellement transmissibles
et la mise en uvre des soins de santé primaire infantiles et néonataux ; (iii) la
poursuite de la prévention et du traitement du paludisme à travers l'approvisionnement
et la distribution de la Moustiquaire Imprégnée d'Insecticide (MII), la réduction des
prix des médicaments antipaludéens et la mise en uvre d'une politique de traitement
du paludisme ; (iv) la poursuite du renforcement du dépistage et du traitement de la
tuberculose à travers l"accroissement des capacités de détection de nouveaux cas de
Tuberculose Pulmonaire (TPM-+) et l'amélioration de la qualité de la prise en charge

travers la sensibilisation des jeunes et des travailleuses de sexe, la distribution des
préservatifs, la prévention des IST, la sécurité du sang, le conseil pour le dépistage
volontaire et anonyme et le renforcement des capacités de prise en charge des malades.
De ce fait. le gouvernement a adopté un décret portant assurance maladie aux agents
publics qui est opérationnelle depuis le 1" mars 2012. En vue de réduire la mortalité
néonatale et d'atteindre l'un des objectifs des OMD (avec la mise en oeuvre du
CARMA) le Gouvernement a entrepris d'accélérer les mesures dans ce domaine.
46. Dans le secteur de léducation. le Gouvernement entend poursuivre l'intégration
dans la fonction publique des enseignants volontaires et auxiliaires et assurer : (i) la
construction et la réhabilitation des infrastructures éducatives. (ii) la formation des
l'ormateurs et éducateurs ; (iii) l'intégration à court ternie, de toutes ces actions dans un

I'augmentation de plus en plus importante des inscrits dans les Universités du pays .
47. Secteurs de l'eau et de l'assainissement: ce secteur demeure une priorité pour le
gouvernement qui entend poursuivre l'amélioration de l'accès à l'eau potable et aux
infrastructures d'assainissement. Pour ce faire, le gouvernement a élaboré et adopté la
politique nationale de l'eau et élaboré la lettre de politique d'alimentation en eau

﻿potable en milieu urbain. Un projet de plan d'actions de la Gestion Intégrée des
Ressources en Eau (GIRE) a été élaboré ainsi que le code de l'eau. Concernant
l'approvisionnement en eau potable, plusieurs projets sont en cours d'exécution. Ceci
a augmenté considérablement le taux de desserte de la population en eau avec la
réalisation et la réhabilitation des forages. La lagune de la ville de Lomé continue
d'être curée. Nous allons continuer l'exécution des travaux d'urgence en matière
d'assainissement pluvial de la ville de Lomé et l'élaboration des schémas directeurs
d'assainissement des villes autres que Lomé. Le Gouvernement poursuivra la
sensibilisation des ménages en matière de l'eau et de l'assainissement.
48. Soutien au développement communautaire : en vue d'améliorer les conditions de
vie des populations les plus démunies, le gouvernement s'est engagé avec l'appui de la
Banque Mondiale à travers le Programme de Développement Communautaire (PDC) à
assurer à ces couches pauvres du pays, un meilleur accès aux services publics de
qualité et aux opportunités économiques. Le Gouvernement vient d'acquérir des bus
de transport pour soulager la population des villes pour leur déplacement ainsi que
pour le transport des étudiants qui ont mené des mouvements de grèves ces derniers
mois pour réclamer les meilleures conditions d'études.
Suivi et évaluation
49. Le Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances est chargé de la mise en oeuvre
générale du programme soutenu par le premier Crédit pour la Relance Economique et
la Gouvernance (CREG-5). Le suivi quotidien et l'évaluation du programme sont de la
responsabilité du Secrétariat Permanent pour le suivi des Politiques de Réformes et des
Programmes Financiers (SP-PRPF). Cette structure coordonne la mise en oeuvre du
programme du Gouvernement et est assisté par un comité de suivi des programmes et
des réformes ainsi que des points focaux dans chaque département ministériel. Le
Gouvernement fournira des rapports trimestriels à la Banque Mondiale sur les progrès
dans la réalisation du programme, mesurés par rapport aux calendriers et aux
indicateurs de performance convenus.
50. Le Gouvernement souhaite que ces réformes politique, économique et sociale
permettent de consolider les relations qui existent entre lui et la Banque Mondiale et
l'ensemble des autres partenaires bilatéraux et multilatéraux afin de mobiliser les
ressources nécessaires à l'amélioration des conditions de vie des populations et à
l'atteinte des Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement.
Requête de financement
5 1. Le Gouvernement est déterminé à consolider les acquis de la stabilité politique, à
poursuivre les réformes structurelles engagées depuis 2006 et à profiter des retombées
de l'allègement de sa dette. Pour y parvenir, les autorités togolaises s'engagent à
mettre en ouvre le programme présenté ci-dessus et détaillé dans la matrice ci-jointe
en annexe. Le Gouv ernement sollicite donc l'assistance technique et financière de la
Banque Mondiale dans la réalisation de son ambitieux programme à travers le Crédit
pour la Relance Iconomique et la Gouvernance (CREG-5) et une possibilité

﻿Annex 3: IMF Relations Note
Togo-Assessment Letter
April 23, 2012
Economic growth has considerably strengthened, and it is expected to accelerate further in
2012. While budget execution in 2011 was satisfactory, the fiscal deficit for 2012 is set to
rise significantly due to a large increase in current expenditure. Structural reforms have
generally been implemented in a satisfactory manner. The authorities successfully organized
a National Economic Forum involving major stakeholders in Togo's economy in
March 2012. The Forum has provided the authorities the foundation for the next phase
of economic reforms. To assist them in the reform effort, the authorities have requested
discussions on a new IMF-supported program; these are expected to begin shortly.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.    Economic performance in 2011 was strong. Real GDP growth has been revised
upwards to about 42 percent on the back of strong performance in most sectors of the
economy, especially in cash-crop agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, and
transportation services. Private sector credit grew briskly at 35 percent through December,
though from a low base. Inflation is now abating, though average inflation rose to 3.6 percent
in 2011. Despite strong export performance (especially for cement and clinker, and cash
crops), the external current account deficit deteriorated marginally to 6.2 percent of GDP as
nominal import growth (notably for oil and capital goods) outpaced that of exports.
2.    Economic growth is expected to accelerate further in 2012 to about 5.2 percent
mainly on account of domestic demand. This reflects large infrastructure investments,
including modernization/expansion of the international airport and the port. The
US$500 million privately-financed port project is going to inject considerable impetus
into the economy, and should consolidate Lom6's position as a major deep-water harbor
on the West African coast over the medium term.
3.    The current European economic crisis will likely have only a limited impact
under the baseline projections of the IMF's World Economic Outlook. Growth is mainly
led by domestic factors, particularly public and private investment, and regional export
demand. Togo's commercial links with Europe are much weaker than before, with Asia
being the second largest export market. More generally, strong growth in West Africa-half
of Togolese exports go to the WAEMU-should provide considerable impetus. Finally,
Togo's financial system is not sufficiently integrated into global financial markets for the,
economy to suffer directly from crisis spillovers.
Fiscal Developments and Outlook
4.    Budget execution in 2011 was satisfactory. For the first time, Togo has met the
WAEMU secondary convergence criterion on tax revenue as percentage of GDP. In
particular, tax revenue increased by 1.4 percent of GDP to 17 percent, mainly reflecting
good performance of indirect tax revenue, particularly VAT. However, non-tax revenue fell
82


﻿short of targets and current expenditure increased, reflecting higher consumer subsidies on
petroleum products and a larger wage bill. The execution rate of investment spending
continued to suffer from poor planning and weak implementation capacity. The overall
deficit deteriorated to 2.9 percent of GDP.
5.    The fiscal outlook for 2012 is challenging. The 2012 budget targets large increases
for both current (particularly wages) and capital expenditures. The increase is expected to
be financed in part by non-permanent revenue sources (bank privatization proceeds and
revenues from the restructuring of the state-owned telephone company, Togot616com). The
authorities intend to rectify this by increasing the tax-to-GDP rate in the medium term,
including by intensifying revenue administration reform. In addition, although the good
revenue performance in 2011 will carry through into 2012, there are considerable risks that
the increased expenditure may not be adequately financed in the short run, potentially leading
to accumulation of arrears and/or unplanned cuts in capital expenditure. Budget execution in
2012 is also likely to be adversely affected by significant oil subsidies resulting from
international oil price trends (absent a pass-through to domestic prices), as well as from
possible delays in the privatization and restructuring process.
Structural Reforms
6.    The authorities have implemented structural reforms in a generally satisfactory
manner, albeit with delays in bank privatization. More recently, they launched the bids to
privatize four state-owned banks, and expect the sale process to be completed by mid-2012.
The state-owned cotton marketing company has been restructured to ensure that farmers are
paid a reasonable share of the export price-thus helping to build trust between producers
and the company, and positively impacting rural poverty. The authorities decided to cancel
the planned sale of a third mobile phone license; instead they adopted a strategy to make the
telecommunications market more competitive, including by restructuring Togot6l&com, to
allow more competition on fixed telephone lines as well as other new services using wide-
band technology. They have also become fully compliant with the requirements of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which should increase transparency and
accountability in the mining sector. However, progress in establishing an asset recovery
company to recover some of the loans the government took off the books of state-owned
banks to be privatized has been slow, and the company is not yet operational.
National Economic Forum
7.    The authorities organized a successful National Economic Forum involving
major stakeholders in Togo's economy, during March 27-29, 2012. The Forum, which
was organized with the assistance and participation of the IMF, had the theme: "Promoting
High, Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth in Togo." Information on the Forum is available at
http://www/imf.org/external/french/np/seminars/20 I2/togo/index.htm. The principal
achievements included:
83


﻿* Promoting a broad-based and open national debate among various stakeholders,
including members of the civil society, trade unions, private sector, academia, and
parliamentarians.
* Identifying main drivers of growth as well as highlighting the need for more focused
strategies for making growth more inclusive, while improving the business
environment to make growth more sustainable. While poverty has declined by about
five percentage points to 57 percent over the past five years, the poorest 30 percent of
the population have seen their real incomes decline.
*  Highlighting the need forfiscal reforms to mobilize more revenue tofinance social
needs and additional infrastructure expenditure. Participants also insisted on the need
for more public financial management reforms, with focus on greater transparency
and accountability.
The authorities have distilled the main lessons from the conference with a view to using these
as the foundation for their next economic reform program.
Next Steps
8.     The authorities requested IMF staff to initiate discussions on a new program
that could be supported by the ECFK Formal discussions could start as early as May 2012.

﻿Annex 6: Update of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (2011)
Using the Low-Income Country Framework
The analysis based on the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework for low-income
countries shows that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress. After full HIPC assistance, MDRI and
beyond HIPC assistance, Togo's external and public debt indicators have improved significantly and are
projected remain below the relevant thresholds in the 20-year period under baseline assumptions, thanks
to a stable economic and political climate and rehabilitation of key sectors. However, Togo remains
vulnerable to certain shocks and could breach the policy-related thresholds for the PV of debt-to-GDP
and the PVof debt-to-revenue ratios under some alternative scenarios in the latter years.
INTRODUCTION
1.     The last joint DSA for Togo was prepared in November 2010 and concluded that Togo was
at moderate risk of debt distress after full HIPC assistance, MDRI and beyond HIPC assistance.
This debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) for Togo assesses its external and public debt using the
forward-looking debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries.28 The outcome of this
analysis was in line with previous DSAs, finding generally favorable debt dynamics as a consequence of
expected enhancements in the macroeconomic policy framework, notably fiscal discipline and solid
implementation of growth-promoting structural reforms. Togo reached the completion point of the HIPC
Initiative in December 2010 and was granted debt relief from several multilateral and bilateral creditors.
As a result, the nominal debt stock fell from $1.7 billion at end-2009 to below $0.5 billion at end-2010.
2.     In the LIC-DSA framework, the present value of Togo's public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt is $539 million at end-2010, after full delivery of HIPC, MDRI and beyond
HIPC assistance. Around 56 percent of this stock of debt is owed to multilateral creditors and the
remainder to bilateral and commercial creditors.
BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
3.     The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are the following:
* Real GDP growth is projected to exceed its estimated potential of around 4 percent in the period
from 2012 to 2016, largely due to increases in public investment (see below). Subsequently, it
will vary around 4 percent, driven by the ongoing rehabilitation of the phosphate and cotton
sectors, growth in the agricultural sector (especially food production), an improved investment
climate, increased financial intermediation; additional FDI and foreign aid; and growing regional
integration, thanks to Togo's strategic geographical location and the role of the port of Lom6. The
4 percent potential growth was estimated based on a population growth rate of 2.5 percent (which
28 This DSA update has been prepared by Fund staff using the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low
Income Countries (see "Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt
Relief',
(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/PolicyPapers/21154573/DMSDR1S3149398v1DSFPape
rforweb.pdf). Togo's quality of policies and institutions, as measured by the average World Bank's Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for the period 2007-09 (2.7), places it as a "weak performer".
The corresponding indicative thresholds for the external debt indicators are 30 percent for the NPV of debt-
to-GDP ratio, 100 percent of the debt-to-export ratio, 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15
percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

﻿reflects the latest available, finalized data) and by building-up sectoral growth rates under the
assumptions outlined above and planned growth-enhancing reforms. The estimated potential
growth rate exceeds historical rates, which were depressed by the dislocations caused by the
protracted social, political, and economic crisis that the country experienced up to the mid-2000s.
*   Public investment is projected to accelerate starting in 2012, reaching 12.6 percent of GDP in
2013 and 2014 and then reverting back to 2011 levels. About 35 percent of this increase will be
financed by loans (75 percent of which will be concessional loans). Public investment projects are
expected to be mostly directed to infrastructure and will lead GDP growth to increase above its
long-term trend for these years.
*   The projections for key commodity prices (oil, cotton, cocoa, and coffee) through 2016 are based
on WEO projections of May 2011 and are assumed constant in real terms afterwards.
*   Inflation over the long-term is projected to remain stable at around 2 percent, reflecting sound
monetary policy at the regional level.
*   There is a gradual improvement in the current account deficit over the medium-term, following a
deterioration in first projection years. The deficit remains high, over 5 percent on average
between 2017 and 2031, with higher exports of phosphates, cement and clinker being insufficient
to fully compensate for a strong growth in imports as foreign aid is absorbed and foreign
investment increases.
*   The domestic primary fiscal deficit is assumed to stay close to zero29 during the projected period,
thereby providing a fiscal anchor to ensure fiscal sustainability over the long term. The scaling up
of public investment in 2012-14 is projected to lead to a temporary deviation from this fiscal
balance
*   FDI and donor flows are expected to increase over the medium-term reflecting improvements in
the investment climate and overall governance.
*   External financing is initially mostly on grant and highly concessional terms, with less
concessional financing gradually picking up, leading to a decrease in the grant element of new
financing (as shown in Figure 1). Concessional external financing is expected to come largely
from Togo's traditional multilateral donors.
EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Baseline
4.      Under the baseline scenario, Togo's external debt indicators remain below their relevant
indicative thresholds (Table la, Figure 1). The present value (PV) of public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt equals to 15.2 percent of GDP in 2011 and remains below the 30 percent threshold until the
end of the projected period. Furthermore, both the PV of external debt relative to revenues and exports
stay below their respective indicative threshold until 2031. Nevertheless, the three PV ratios (under the
baseline scenario) increase significantly over the projected period. This result reflects in part conservative
assumptions concerning the out years, particularly a declining share of concessional loans in new
financing, which results in the concessionality of new loans decreasing from 35 percent to close to 5
29 The primary deficit is projected to stay at around 2 percent of GDP over the projection period, with the temporary
exception of 2012-14.

﻿percent over the period 2011 to 2031. In fact, as shown in Table 1 a, the contribution of the nominal
interest rate to endogenous debt dynamics increases significantly in the post-2016 period.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
Togo's external debt outlook remains vulnerable to shocks especially toward the end of the
projection period (Table lb, Figure 1). The policy thresholds for two key ratios are breached under the
most extreme stress tests. The PV of external debt to GDP indicator deteriorates significantly under the
scenario in which new loans are obtained on less favorable terms. In this case, the threshold is breached in
2024. In addition, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios also surpasses the indicative thresholds at the end of
the period under the "less favorable terms" shock.
In light of the results from the baseline and alternative scenarios as well as the stress tests, IMF
staff concludes that Togo still is at moderate risk of debt distress.
PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
5.     The inclusion of Togo's domestic public debt in the analysis emphasizes the vulnerabilities
of the baseline scenario (Table 2a, Figure 2). Togo's domestic debt burden reflects years of weak fiscal
management and domestic arrears accumulation, as well as the need to recapitalize ailing banks. Much of
this debt arose from losses at state-owned enterprises in the past, highlighting the need for further reforms
in the governance of these enterprises. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public debt ratios are
projected to decrease until 2018 before picking up gradually until the end of the period. On average, the
PV of debt to GDP ratio amounts to around 23.2 percent over the overall period. Given the assumed
improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and the cautious debt strategy in the baseline scenario, debt
ratios would remain at a reasonable level over the long-run.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
6.     The evolution of the debt indicators would be highly sensitive to the most extreme shock--a
lower growth rate-which would increase the debt level and debt service over the long run. Total
public debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to a growth shock, which would lead the PV of debt to
GPD ratio to break the 30 percent threshold by 2014 (Table 2b, Figure 2). This highlights the importance
of a reform agenda that improves the business environment to support foreign investment and growth.30
CONCLUSION
7.     The DSA indicates that Togo is at moderate risk of debt distress after reaching the
completion point. Under the baseline scenario, the debt ratios remain below the thresholds for the
projected period, but under less positive yet realistic alternative scenarios, certain thresholds would be
breached in the latter years. These dynamics highlight the vulnerability of the Togolese economy to
certain shocks (in particular less favorable terms on new financing) and stress the need for a prudent
3 Note the historical scenario assumes that real GDP growth and the primary balance are set at historical averages
(over the last 10 years). In the case of Togo, this yields a primary surplus 0.6 percent of GDP for the historical
scenario, compared to a primary deficit in the baseline. As a result, gross financing needs and therefore gross new
borrowing under the historical scenario are much lower than under the baseline. The large negative new borrowing
compared to the baseline, eventually leads to negative PV ratios.

﻿approach to new borrowing and continuing to seek grant and highly concessional financing to the extent
possible, as well as pursuing reforms to improve debt management capacity. The assumptions and
conclusions of the DSA were discussed with the authorities, who broadly concurred.
8.     Maintaining a robust external debt outlook will depend on a sustained pick-up in real GDP
growth and foreign direct investment, as well as prudent debt management and solid fiscal
performance. The inclusion of Togo's domestic debt in the analysis reinforces the conclusions of the
external DSA and stresses the risks to Togo's debt prospects. In this context, it is essential that the
Togolese authorities continue current efforts, particularly to strengthen public financial management
(especially debt management), restructure the banking system, reform state-owned enterprises, and
improve the investment climate hence laying the foundation for accelerating growth.

(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
