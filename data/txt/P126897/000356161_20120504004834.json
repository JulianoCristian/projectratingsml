"This program document a Fifth Economic\n            Recovery and Governance Credit (ERGC-5) to the Republic of\n            Togo in the amount of SDR 9.1 million (US$14 million\n            equivalent). The ERGC-5 deepens the implementation of Public\n            Financial Management (PFM) reforms and shifts attention\n            towards structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. PFM\n            reforms focus on priority areas identified as weak by recent\n            analytical work. As more development partners become active\n            in PFM, the ERGC shifts attention towards areas in which the\n            World Bank has a comparative advantage: structural reforms.\n            The ERGC-5 will strengthen the cotton sector through\n            measures that improve insight in the cost structure of the\n            cotton company that lay the foundation for attracting\n            private investors; will improve the management of the\n            electricity company; will provide a clear path towards a\n            competitive telecommunications sector; and will support the\n            privatization of four state owned banks thereby generating\n            revenue for the government and putting the banking sector on\n            a more solid footing. The operation is a stand-alone; future\n            operations are expected to be part of a series. The proposed\n            operation seeks to provide financial support to the\n            Government to meet its financing needs and to facilitate the\n            execution of the ongoing reform program."}, "docdt": "2012-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
