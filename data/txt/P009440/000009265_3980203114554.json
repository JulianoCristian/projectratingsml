Government's policy of developing an adequate supply of\n            well trained technical manpower to meet the needs of the\n            public and private sectors.  One of its main objectives\n            would be to:  (a) improve the quality of training at the\n            engineering colleges and polytechnics through:  (i) teacher\n            training, curriculum development, and a Practical Attachment\n            Program, which would emphasize practical skills training,\n            for students and teacher trainees, (ii) equipment\n            modernization and improvements in maintenance; and (iii)\n            physical rehabilitation of academic, hostel and workshop\n            facilities.  Another priority is the; (b) improvement of the\n            management of the technical education program through:  (i)\n            establishment of a Program Inspection Wing in the\n            Directorate of Technical Education to oversee curriculum\n            development, monitor the adequacy of facilities, equipment\n            and training materials and liaise with industry and other\n            agencies to promote the Practical Attachment Program.  This\n            second objective will be accomplished through support of\n            procedural and institutional reform in the polytechnics and\n            engineering colleges; and (iii) support of examination reform."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
