The lessons learned from this project include:\n            a) A programmatic approach to support pension reform could\n            be relevant for pension reform since it allows for a series\n            of modular or sequential reform packages. It controls the\n            risk of non-performance by conditioning future programs\n            based on current performance. b) Protecting key social\n            protection sectors during adjustment operations may yield\n            positive payoffs in terms of improved poverty indicators\n            following the aftermath of economic shocks. c) Successful\n            pension reform requires substantial dialogue, discussion and\n            debate with local counterparts, policymakers, and experts.\n            Toward that end, the present pension reform agenda in Brazil\n            took its roots through a series of seminars, debates, and\n            training sessions organized jointly by the Borrower and the\n            Bank. d) Technical assistance and knowledge dissemination\n            are very effective de-politicizing tools. The widespread\n            training of Bank's Pension Reform Options Simulation\n            Toolkit - a toolkit developed by the Bank for analyzing\n            pension reform - in Brazil stirred debate and dialogue as\n            the structural weaknesses of these plans became evident to\n            policymakers, experts, and other relevant stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
