To this effect, legislation has\n            been enacted, defining the new basis for benefit\n            calculations for retirees, respecting the principle of\n            fiscal balance, to take place in the next three years.\n            Further reforms, include the drafting of legislation, and\n            issuance of regulations to strengthen the regulatory\n            framework of the pension system for private sector workers,\n            and of complementary pension funds in the restructuring of\n            the National Institute of Social Security. The adoption of\n            this new formula for private sector workers, will reduce the\n            deficit of the system, and contribute to fiscal adjustments,\n            which will in turn improve rapid growth, and low inflation\n            prospects, paramount for poverty reduction. However,\n            moderate risks remain, since it is common that the adoption\n            of this new benefit formula, could be subjected to legal\n            challenges. But the strong commitment to the reform program\n            suggests this risk is minimal, furthermore, when some of\n            these reforms have already been approved by the Chamber."}, "docdt": "2000-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
