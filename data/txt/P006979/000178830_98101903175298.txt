REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$4 million to
the Dominican Republic.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed credit wzould be the first by IDA to the Dominican
Republic. Because of its balance of payments weakness, discussed in
Part V and an annex to this Report, the Dominican Republic is not pres-
ently regarded as eligible for Banl loans except for projects of an
enclave type, such as that made to Falconbridge Dominicana, C. por A.
on December 10, 1969.
3.       The Government requested financial assistance from the Asso-
ciation in January 1970 for the education project which had been pre-
pared with the help of an IBRD/UlNESCO reconnaissance-identification
mission. The project was appraised in April/May and negotiations were
held on October 27-30, 1970. The Government was represented by Lic.
Victor Gomez Berges, Secretary of State for Education, Arts and Religions.
4.       The following is a summary statement on the only Bank loan to
the Dominican Republic as at October 30.

5.       A livestock project has been appraised and should be ready for
presentation to the Eaecutive Directors later in the fiscal year 1971;
other projects in the fields of irrigation and industrial credit are now
being prepared for later consideration by IDA.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
6.        Borrower:                 The Dominican Republic.
Amount:                   In various currencies equivalent to
US$4 million.
Purpose:                  To cover the estimated foreign
exchange cost of (a) construction
and equipment of comprehensive
secondary schools and primary teacher
colleges and (b) the establishment of
long range educational development
planning.
Amortization:             In 50 years, including a 10-year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments of one-half of 1% from
April 1, 1981 through October 1, 1990
and of 1½% from April 1, 1991 through
October 1, 2020.
Service Charge:           3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
7.        The appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project
Dominican Republic" (PE-20'a) is being distributed separately.
8.        Education is an obvious development priority in the Dominican
Republic because of historic weakness, aggravated by the rapid growth of
the population which has doubled in the last 20 years. The Government
is aware of the need to expand and reform the country's educational sys-
tem. It has been increasing the allocations for education in recent
annual budgets and has concentrated specifically on: (a) expansion and
improvement of the quality of secondary education; (b) providing teacher
training colleges for primary and secondary school levels. Beginning
with the current academic year, the secondary education is being reorgan-
ized and will now consist of a ccmnon four-year lower cycle (grades 7 - 10),
followed by a two-year (grades 11 - 12) diversified course with emphasis
on pre-vocational training in industrial arts, agridulture, commerce and
home economics.
9.        The project is designed to assist the Government in implement-
ing its education reform by improving the quality and relevance of
secondary education and by meeting specific manpower needs. The entire
project is estimated to cost about US$8.1 million equivalent.



-3-
LO.       Tile proposed credit of US$L4 million equivalent would finance
the estimated foreign exchange cost of:
(a) construction and equipment for:
- three new lower secondary schools and equipment only
for three existing ones;
- six new multilateral upper secondary schools;
- two new primary teacher training colleges and exten-
sion of three others;
(b) 13 man-years of specialists' services and 8 man-years
of fellowships; and
(c) a unit for the implementation and supervision of the
project.
11.       The project would be carried out by a special Project Adminis-
tration Unit which has been set up in the office of the Secretary for
Education and whose key staff has been found satisfactory. Consulting
architectural firms satisfactory to the Association would be employed
for the design and supervision of the project schools.
12.       Contracts for civil works and procurement of furniture and
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Bid packages would be of a size to facilitate bulk procurement.
Domestic mnanufacturers of furniture and equipment would be accorded a
preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports
or to the existing rate of import duty, whichever is lower.
13.       The credit includes the cost  of foreign specialists' services
and of fellowships for the training abroad of local staff.   This techni-
cal assistance would be for the preparation of a comprehensive long-term
education plan, strengthening the administration of the educational sys-
tem and guidance on teaching methods and organizati.en.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
14.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Dominican
Republic and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.  The draft Development
Credit Agreement contains provisions usual to agreements for education
projects.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
15.       The last economic report, "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Dominican Republic" (WH-176(b) was distributed in April
1968 and an updating "Note on the Recent Economic Position and Prospects
of the Dominican Republic,' was attached to the President's Report on the
Falconbridge Nickel Project in November 1969 (P-757). Both reports em-
phasized that the country's balance of payments was weak and that a very
limited capacity existed to service external debt on conventional terms.
They also noted the Governmentts efforts to carry out an effective public
finance, credit and wage policy as well as an increase in both public
and private investment. Recent economic information, summarized in a
note attached to this Report, indicates that progress in these fields
has continued. Following the Presidential elections last summer the
economic eituation   continues to improve and the performance of private
savings and investments suggests growing confidence in the economy.
Basic balance of payments weaknesses still exist, however, and the
Dominican Republic is properly following a general policy of obtaining
external loans on concessional terms whenever possible.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
16.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
17.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Attachment
NOTE ON PRESENT ECONOMIC POSITION AND PROSPECTS OF
THE DOvIINICAN REPUBLIC
Introduction
1.        A report on Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
Dominican Republic (OC-176b) was distributed to the Executive Directors
in April 1968. An updating Note on the Recent Economic Position and
Prospects of the Dominican Republic was attached to the President's
Report on the Falconbridge Nickel Project in November 1969 (P-757). An
economic mission is currently in the Dominican Republic and a report
on its findings will be distributed in 1971.
2.        The last decade has been an agitated period in the history
of the Dominican Republic. Following the end of the Trujillo regime
in 1961, political changes were frequent and culminated in the Civil
War of 1965. Since then, conditions have become more stable; President
Balaguer -- who took office at the end of the civil war -- was
reelected for a four-year term in May 1970. The election results were
accepted by the major parties, and political tensions appear to have
abated. The return of civic tranquility encourages the belief that the
ecoromic environment is improving; certainly the performance of private
savings and investments in 1969 and 1970 suggests growing confidence
in the economy.
Recent Trends in Output and Employment
3.        Despite the unsettled political climate and a severe drought
in 1967 and 1968, the Dominican economy had regained or surpassed pre-
civil war levels of output and activity by the end of 1969. The high
rate of output growth of almost 8 percent in 1969 alone, contributed
significantly to the recovery. Favored by excellent weather conditions
in that year (and in sharp contrast to the droughts in 1967 and 1968),
agriculture recorded a 9 percent growth in output. At the same time
mining and industry production grew by 10 percent while construction
output rose by 9 percent (See Table 1). Furthermore, the increased
pace of activity in the private sector was accompanied by an expansion
of 15 percent in public investment, while ccnsumption expenditure,
particularly in the public sector, was effectively restrained by the
national austerity program. This program, introduced in 1966, provided
for general wage, price and credit controls. In part, its effectiveness
is also reflected in price movements which show a 1 percent rise in the
cost of living index for 1969 and a decline of 4 percent in wholesale
prices for the same year. Data for the first half of 1970 do not alter
the picture of stable prices. The rapid rate of output growth in 1969
resulted in an advance of real GDP per capita of about 4 percent. This
is in sharp contrast to the experience in 1967 and 1968 when per capita
GDP in both years actually declined. According to official projections,

the net increase in population for 1969 has been estimated to be
3.6 percent, although preliminary results from the 1970 Census suggest
a rather lower rate of population growth. Using currently available po-
pulation data the GhP per capita in 1969 was US8299.
4.        Agriculture, which acciounts for about a quarter of GDP, employs
more than 60 percent of the labor force and contributes almost 90 percent
of foreign exchange earnings, was the focus of the Government's reconstruc-
tion policy throughout the recovery period. As a result, virtual self-
sufficiency has been achieved in respect of locally consumed staples such
as rice, beans and plantains, while major advances in the production of
meat, edible oils and fruits and vegetables were also recorded. Measures
taken to revitalize the production of the major agricultural exports were
most successful in respect of sugar, less so for tobacco, and not at all
in the case of coffee and cocoa. The output of raw sugar has grown
rapidly from 640,ooo metric tons in 1965 to 920,000 in 1969, while costs
of production have been reduced from more than 8 cents to an average of
5.3 cents per pound. V-1hile the volume of tobacco production has not
increased greatly, there has been an important shift in the composition of
output in favor of high-value leaf. The output of both coffee and cocoa
has declined over the last four or five years because of neglect. Since
1967, the Dominican Republic has failed to meet its export quota assigned
under the International Coffee Agreement. The rehabilitation of production
of these two products calls for measures more far-reaching than those
adopted hitherto by the Government.
5.        From the data available for the first five or six months of 1970,
it would appear that the volume of output has continued to grow at roughly
the 1969 pace, and GDP for the full year is expected to grow by 6-7 percent-
Agricultural production in particular has advanced strongly. Further, the
Dominican economy will benefit from a number of major investment projects
to be launched or completed this year. These include the Falconbridge
ferronickel mine and processing plant (US$ 200 million), the Shell Oil
refinery (US$ 30 million), and the Nestle-General milk products processing
plant (us$ 5 million).
Public Finances and Public Investment
6.        Fiscal management has improved steadily over the last few years.
Central Government revenues have grown in response to increased production
and trade as well as more effective tax administration and collection.
(See Table 2.) Revenues, which in 1969 amounted to roughly 17 percent of
GNP, are heavily dependent upon import taxes. The Government's expressed
intention of introducing a land tax on urban and rural property has yet
to be fulfilled. Current expenditures have been dramatically restrained
under the austerity program and are below the level of 1964. Current
outlays in 1969 represented 13 percent of GNP as compared with 16 percent
a year earlier.



- h -
7.        An important contribution to fiscal management was the
change from   large deficits incurred by the State Sugar Corporation
(CEA) and the State Enterprises Corporation (CORDE) to substantial
surpluses. The combined impact of increased tax revenues, reduced current
budgetary outlays and public enterprise surpluses is striking. Over a
period of only two years, the ratio of public sector savings to GDP has
doubled and now stands at slightly more than 6 percent.
1/
8.        Capital expenditures of the Central Government7in 1969 rose
by 20 percent, or a rate almost three times faster than GDP. Given the
prevailing administrative and financial constraints, investment
activities within the public sector have accorded reasonably well with
the priority requirements of the economy. Agriculture, including
irrigation, has absorbed more than two-fifths, transport and communica-
tions one-fifth and power and industry about one-eighth of total public
investment. The social sectors, including health, education, housing,
water and sewerage, accounted for about one-fourth of public investments.
The public investment program has been addressed to some of the more
urgent needs of the economy and contributed to the carrying out of the re-
construction process. Public sector savings have financed an increasing
share of capital expenditures ranging from two-fifths in 1964 to about
four-fifths in 1969. The remainder has been covered by external
assistance, largely in the form of U.S. aid. Internal borrowing has not
been an important source of financing in recent years.
9.        The new Government has recently abolished the 1966 austerity
law. This may be interpreted as a sign of increasing confidence in the
strength and resilience of the economy. However, since wages and certain
cost items were practically frozen for about four years, it also means
that the pressure for increased salaries and wages may now become
substantial. Under these circumstances it may be difficult for the
Government to keep its current expenditures at the low levels of the last
two years. Moreover, the execution of a more ambitious development
program is, by itself, likely to require some additional current
expenditures.
Money, Credit and Prices
10.       Throughout 1969 and the early months of 1970, the monetary
authorities continued to follow a cautious credit policy with the dual
objective of maintaining a relatively stable price level and avoiding
excessive pressures on the balance of payments. With the help of an
intricate system of reserve requirements and with a rediscount policy
1/ Including capital transfers to autonomous public institutions.

closely supervised by the Monetary Board, the Central Bank has so far
successfully managed to limit credit expansion to the apparent needs
of the economy. The policy of monetary control was facilitated in 1969
by an extraordinarily high increase of savings and time deposits
amounting to almost 30 percent for the year. On the other hand, domestic
credit extended by the banking system was restrained to an increase of
only 10 percent or at a rate roughly in line with output growth
(See Table 3).

11.       As previously noted, available price series indicate that a
high degree of price stability has been maintained in the face of strong
demand pressures. The overall consumer price index for Santo Domingo
is at about the same level recorded in 196h, and is the result of a
decline in the price of a number of agricultural products offsetting
price increases of a variety of miscellaneous items, some of which are
in the industrial product lines. The reduction in agricultural prices
in 1969 can be attributed mainly to the favorable climatic conditions



experienced in that year. There is little doubt that a restrictive
monetary policy in combination with sound fiscal management has helped
maintain relative price stability and contributed to the strengthening
of the Peso.
Wages, Manpower and Population
12.       The success attending the Government's efforts to hold prices
down during the last three years, at the same time helped restrain
wages. Apparently, the partial lifting of the wage-freeze in mid-1968
has not resulted in any strong upward movement in wages. Additional
factors contributing to wage restraint are the large-scale urban
unemployment, alleged to be close to one-fifth of the urban labor
force, and the ever present pressures from rural underemployment. With
the improvement of agricultural output in 1969/70 and the increased
activity in the industrial and construction sectors, employment is
reported to have increased since the end of 1968 in both rural and urban
areas. However, the high annual rate of increase in population and
the existing hard core of unemployed, especially in the cities, means
that it will be some time before the unemployment problem can be
lightened appreciably. There is widespread recognition of the existing
serious population problem in the Dominican Republic, and non-official
agencies have launched a family planning program.
Balance of Payments
13.       In 1969 the Dominican Republic achieved a substantial overall
balance of payments surplus for the first time since the outbreak of the
Civil War, mainly because of improvement in the capital account. Net
private capital inflows increased some US$ 15 million; these inflows are
expected to continue to increase steadily during the next few years in
view of the major private investment projects underway and in prospect.
(See Table 4).
14.       The trade deficit declined in 1969 because of a greater than
expected expansion in exports (13%), particularly as a result of
sizeable expansion of sugar exports to the preferential U.S. market,
larger meat exports to Puerto Rico, and larger shipments of fruits,
vegetables and processed agricultural products. In addition, the increase
in imports (7%) was smaller than in 1968 because of the improved domestic
supply of agricultural products, which saved the country an estimated
US$ 17 million in imports of foodstuffs, The improvement in the trade
balance was offset, however, by an increasing deficit in net services and
the deficit on current account was slightly larger than in 1969.
15.       The balance of payments surplus of US$ 17 million contributed
to an increase of US$ 4.9 million in the gross reserves of the Central
Bank, an increase of US$ 0.2 million in the gross reserves of commercial
banks and a reduction of US$ 11.9 million in the foreign debt of the
banking system. At the same time the 1969 volume of payments arrears was
reduced to US$ 19 million from the level of US$ 23 million the year before.

16.       Information covering the first half of 1970 indicates that
the balance of payments continues to show a surplus. For the first
seven months of 1970 net foreign exchange resources of the banking
system rose by US$ 14 million.
17.       Sugar exports, representing about 55 percent of total
commodity exports, are a key element in the balance of payments of
the Dominican Republic. In recent years, access to the preferential
U.S. sugar market has contributed significantly to a strengthening of
the balance of payments position. In 1969, for example, the Dominican
Republic exported almost 670,000 tons under the U.S. sugar quota system
at an average price well above that obtained in the free world market.
The quota consisted of a basic allotment of 225,000 tons, a temporary
prorated share of the quotas withheld from Cuba and Southern Rhodesia
of 2h0,000 tons and an allocation of about 215,000 tons arising largely
from the inability of the Philippines to fulfill its quota that year.
Thus, almost a third of the value of Dominican sugar exports depends
precariously on annual fluctuation in the supply capacity of other quota
countries, while roughly another third is subject to the uncertainties
surrounding U.S.-Cuban relations. The U.S. Sugar Act is to be revised
in 1971 and the prospects are that the assignment of quotas will be
altered. The Dominican Government is hopeful that the new Act will
assign it an increased basic quota and thus help to stabilize a major
source of export earnings. Until such time as the provisions of the
new Sugar Act become known the trade and payments prospects of the
Dominican Republic will continue to be uncertain.
External Public Debt and Creditworthiness
18.       As of December 1969, the medium and long-term external public
debt outstanding is estimated at about US$ 272 million, of which roughly
US$ 87 million was undisbursed. Of this total, about 80 percent is due
to the United States Government. The rest is held by international
organizations (US$ 29 million) private institutions (US$ 9 million), and
unclassified creditors (US$ 18 million). Debt service in relation to
estimated foreign exchange earnings rose to 8.5 percent in 1969.
However, service payments on total debt in 1970 are expected to drop to
between 6 and 7 percent as a consequence of improved debt management
policy since 1967. This policy restricted further contraction of debt
to loans on concessionary terms only. Thus, the debt service burden
is not likely to vary appreciably over the near to medium-term future.
19.       Given the continued basic weakness of the current account
deriving from the heavy dependence on the preferential U.S. sugar market
and the uncertainties surrounding the size of the basic United States
sugar quota and the level of future official capital inflows, the
Dominican Republic still cannot be regarded at this juncture as credit-
worthy for Bank lending, except for enclave type projects.
