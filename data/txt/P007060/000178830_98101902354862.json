   strengthening of feeder road planning nationwide and the\n            preparation of follow-up feeder road projects; (ii) the\n            implementation of a 1981-84 maintenance program for the main\n            road network and the reinforcement of highway maintenance in\n            the three provinces mentioned above; and (iii) technical\n            assistance for transport planning and for training. The\n            project's construction and main road network\n            maintenance components pose no special risks. Improving road\n            maintenance at the level of the three provinces gives rise\n            to some uncertainties owing to the presently low\n            administrative and technical capacity of the three\n            provincial highway authorities. To minimize this risk: (i)\n            the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOP) and\n            the provincial councils would sign comprehensive Maintenance\n            Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, whereby MOP would\n            provide, inter alia, technical assistance (supported by\n            consultants) and supervision necessary to carry out the\n            maintenance works; (ii) the Bank and the Government would\n            annually review with each province the adequacy and\n            performance of the staffing provided by MOP and the\n            province; and (iii) experienced MOP staff (with the help of\n            consultants) would train provincial personnel in maintenance activities."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
