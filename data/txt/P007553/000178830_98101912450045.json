      construction and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage\n            infrastructure serving 76,000 ha in the Rio Sinaloa\n            Irrigation District; (ii) reclamation of 60,000 ha of saline\n            lands and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage\n            infrastructure serving another 60,000 ha in the Rio Fuerte\n            Irrigation District; (iii) a program of technical\n            assistance, applied research and studies benefitting area\n            farmers; (iv) equipment for operation and maintenance of the\n            districts; and (v) a telephone network to link major\n            operating centers of the two districts. The project will\n            directly benefit 19,700 families comprising 17,250\n            ejidatarios and 2,450 private farmers. Family incomes will\n            typically increase three-fold as a result of the project;\n            preproject annual family incomes are typically in the range\n            of US$500-US$1,700. About 95 percent of the project\n            beneficiaries have present incomes corresponding to the\n            lowest 30 percent."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
