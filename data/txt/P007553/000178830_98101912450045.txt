I. THE AGRICIJLTURAL SECTOR
The Resource Base
1.01      Mexico has a land area of some 2 million km  and a population of
62 million (in 1976), growing at an annual rate of over 3%. Some 40% of the
total population, or about 24 million people, gain their livelihood from
agriculture. Agriculture is also an important foreign exchange earner: it
had a share of 23% of the total value of exports in 1976. The wide range
of latitudes and altitudes results in a great diversity of crop and livestock
output; but the extent of arid and mountainous lands is such, however, that
only about 18% of the total land area, some 35 million ha, is considered
cultivable. Of this, an estimated 15 million ha are harvested of which an
estimated 5 million ha under irrigation; Mexico is presently the sixth largest
country in the world in expanse of irrigated lands.
Agricultural Production
1.02      Crop Production.  Until the early 1940s, total cultivated area in
Mexico was about 7.5 million ha, located mainly in the central highlands
where maize, beans and other food crops were grown under rainfed conditions
together with small irrigated areas under fruits and vegetables. Since, the
development of irrigation in the arid regions along the Pacific coast,
and in the Northern States (combined with successful research efforts to
develop irrigated crop technologies) both cropped areas and yields increased
substantially and output of wheat, sorghum, oilseeds, cotton, fruits and
vegetables and alfalfa grew rapidly.
1.03      Notwithstanding the growth and diversification of crop output over
the years, maize is still the most widely grown crop in the country, accounting
for about 8 million ha, or over half the country's cultivated area. Most of
it is cultivated together with smal]er areas of beans, under rainfed conditions
by small farmers and concentrated in the central and southern highlands, along
the Gulf coast and in the Chiapas region. In the humid tropical regions along
the southern Gulf coast and Chiapas, sugarcane, bananas, cocoa and coffee are
also grown. Table 1.01, presents the production of main crops grown in
Mexico over the 1960-1976 period.
1.04      Livestock Production.  In the past, most of the commercial livestock
output used to come from extensive cattle breeding on the arid and semi-arid
rangelands of the North with income derived from the sale of feeder cattle,
mainly to the U.S. market.  Milk, hogs and poultry were produced in small
quantities, mostly in the central highlands and for subsistence. The increase
in domestic demand has, however, caused a rapid expansion of output country
wide. It has enabled the opening up of new cattle producing areas along the
Gulf coast where better rainfall and good pasture quality has enabled much
higher stocking rate. The growth of Mexico City has also accounted for a
rapid increase in milk, pork and polultry meat production iin the central plateau
region. Table 1.02, presents the production of main livestock products in
Mexico over the 1960-1976 period.

1.05      Production Trends.  The table below compares the growth of GDP with
the growth in the crop and livestock sector, on an average 10-year basis, in
the 1945-1975 period:
Average Rate of Growth per Annum
Period     GDP      Crops      Livestock      C + L
1945-55    5.8      7.3          3.7           6.0
1955-65    6.7      4.4          3.7           4.2
1965-75    6.2      0.9          4.2           2.1
1.06      As can be seen above, growth of crop production was most impressive
in the first decade, good in the second, but less satisfactory in the third.
The early increases were due mainly to large scale irrigation development which
commenced about 1945. However since the middle sixties crop production growth
almost stagnated in spite of continued high investments in irrigation. This
decline and finally the stagnation in production growth came about because:
(a) Irrigation projects became increasingly complex and more costly to prepare
and carry out and as a result the area under irrigation grew less rapidly;
(b) excessive water use and inadequate drainage and maintenance on irrigated
lands caused extensive salinization which reduced cropped areas and yields;
(c) crop specific problems such as cotton (disease), fruits and vegetables
(export limitations) or sugar (production organization) had a dampening effect
on output; and (d) in later years, more land in newly irrigated areas were
allocated to small farmers and "ejidatarios" rather than to private medium and
large scale farmers; the small farmers and ejidatarios needed more and better
extension services to insure production increases in line with those being
obtained by medium to large size farmers but until recently extension services
made available have not been of the extent and quality required to achieve this.
1.07      It also became evident since 1965 that performance in the rainfed
subsector had always been poor relative to the irrigation subsector but had
also received much less support. It has now become better recognized that
with relatively smaller investments than those required for successful irriga-
tion development, substantial increases in rainfed production can be achieved,
which has caused government to shift its development strategy towards a more
balanced program including both subsectors (paras. 1.10-1.11).
1.08      Contrary to the crop sector, the livestock sector has maintained,
and in later years even somewhat increased its growth over the 1945-75 period.
This was made possible mainly because the rapid demand growth for livestock
products (para 1.04), which even outstripped the supply capabilities in some
areas: Mexico has had to import increased quantities of powdered milk to
satisfy internal consumption since the mid-1970s.
Rural Population, Employment and Income
1.09      The agricultural sector provides the livelihood for a rural popula-
tion of some 4 million families scattered over 95,000 villages.  Unemployment



_ 3 -
and/or under-employment is a serious problem of the agricultural sector.
With a rural labor force between 8 and 12 million people and a harvested
area fluctuating around 15 million ha, the ratio of cropped area to
potential active population is between 1.3 and 2.0 ha per person, very low
when the land use pattern (about two-thirds of the croppecl area devoted to
grains) is considered. This is one of the major causes determining the level
of income in the agricultural sector, lower than that of other sectors, as
the following table illustrates.
GDP per Worker (19-75) /a
US$            Index
Agriculture                120              1(0
National Average           384             320
Industry and Services   504                420
/a   Based on data of "Prontuario Estadistico
de la Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos"
(SRH) Mexico, D.F., 1976.
Moreover, the income distribution pattern within the agricultural sector is
skewed, as 50% of the rural families account for about 20%' of the agricultural
output while the upper 10% of the agricultural population provides 50% of it.
Government Policies
1.10       Within the agricultural sector, Government policies aim primarily
at increasing production for domestic consumption, particularly basic food
crops so as to attain self-sufficiency by 1982, and to increase income levels
and generate rural employment.  Moreover, with favorable prospects for in-
creased petroleum production and export earnings, coupled with an easier bud-
getary situation, Mexico has the means to diversify its agricultural develop-
ment strategy, enable more of its farmers to reach higher levels of produc-
tivity and return to the higher sector growth rates of earlier periods.
1.11       To meet these objectives, Government is pursuing the following
strategies: (a) In the irrigation subsector, various large-scale projects
are still planned to be developed in areas where an unused hydraulic poten-
tial exists; attention, however, will be focused on an expansion of irrigated
lands through small scale irrigation and an improved performance in presently
irrigated areas through rehabilitation of old conveyance systems, reclamation
of saline lands and more efficient use of available water; (b) a major effort
will be made to expand rainfed cult:ivation in previously utilized or under-
utilized lands, mostly along the Gu:Lf coast. The latter will require invest-
ments in drainage and flood control, but it will also necessitate a strong
effort by research services to deveÌop adequate crop technologies and by
extension services to promote improved cultivation methods; (c) to improve
productivity in existing rainfed agriculture, extension services need to be



- 4 -
further expanded and made more effective; towards this end, the Government
has recently created "distritos de temporal" or rainfed districts, next to
already existing irrigation districts; and (d) Government is using its mini-
mum price support system to induce changes in cropping patterns towards
increased production of food crops.
1.12      The Bank's lending program to Mexico's agricultural sector, ongoing
or under preparation, contains a mix of projects that respond to the policies
of the Government as outlined above. The proposed project which would expand
irrigated lands and, at the same time rehabilitate old irrigation systems and
reclaim saline lands, would correspond well with Government strategies in this
field.
Bank Participation
1.13      In the past five years (FY1974-78) Bank participation in the agri-
cultural sector amounted to US$835 million distributed over ten projects as
follows: Irrigation (Panuco, Sinaloa and Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan), US$174
million; rural development (PIDER I and II and Papaloapan Basin), US$280 mil-
lion; credit (Fifth and Sixth projects), US$325 million; area development
(Tropical Agriculture), US$56 million; and small-scale agriculture infrastruc-
ture development, US$44 million. Implementation of irrigation projects were
delayed, mainly because of budgetary constraints. These delays were further
accentuated by high price increases unforseen at appraisal. As a result
Government and Bank agreed that the projects should be financed over a longer
period of time. These circumstances led to the reformulation of Bajo Bravo/
Bajo San Juan project with subsequent cancellation of US$100 millÌon (from an
original loan of US$150 million) and to a supplementary loan of US$25 million,
approved by the Bank on July 11, 1978, to assist financing cost overruns of
the Panuco project. With these actions, implementation of the above projects
is now progressing satisfactorily. PIDER I and II are multi-sectoral projects
designed for improving living conditions and increasing productivity in
localized areas of rural poverty ("micro-regions"). After some difficulties
inherent to their nature, overall progress of these projects is improving
along with steps taken to decentralize the decision-making process, although
the success in carrying out the different components of the project varies
with the implementation capacity of the agencies involved. The Papaloapan
project had also a slow start due to a severe shortage of budgetary allocations,
a situation that now is being corrected with recently increased appropriations
of funds. The disbursement pace of the Fifth Credit project was faster than
projected, although lately has slowed down with respect to funds earmarked for
low-income producers; the project is however expected to be completed about
six months before closing date (January 1, 1980). The Sixth Credit project,
the Tropical Agriculture project and the Small Scale Agricultural Infrastruc-
ture project became effective on January 12, 1979.
1.14      A Project Performance Audit (OED's Report 1573, April 27, 1977) on
the Third Credit Project (Loan 747-ME) pointed out that the Project made a
significant contribution to improve financial assistance to commercial farmers,
but noted that technical aspects at farm level needed to be improved; to this
end, specÌfic actions for monitoring agricultural development were introduced
in the Fifth and Sixth Credit projects.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The proposed project is located in the area of two irrigation dis-
triets, Rio Sinaloa and Rio Fuerte, in the northern part of the State of
Sinaloa on Mexico's Pacific coast (mnap IBRD 13953R). The two districts together
have a net irrigable area of 315,000 ha (105,000 ha in Sinaloa and 210,000 ha
in Fuerte), all in the coastal plains below the Sierra Madre mountain range.
2.02      The region has good transportation links to national and inter-
national markets. The international highway linking Mexico City with Nogales,
Arizona, passes through the project area, and combined with other paved roads,
provides a basic road network suitable for distributing farm inputs and for
moving produce to other parts of Mexico or for export. Tle Pacific railway,
linking Mexico City with Nogales, also bisects the project- area, while marine
transportation is available at Topolabambo and at the major west coast port of
Mazatlan. Four small airports within the project area serve local needs, and
regularly scheduled air service is available at Culiacan.
Soils, Topography and Drainage
2.03      Soils in the Sinaloa district are derived largely from recent
alluvial deposits of volcanic origin. About 70% of the soils are clay loams
and clays and the remainder, mostly adjacent to stream beds, are of a lighter
sandier texture. The soils are moderately fertile, of good depth and water-
holding capacity. About 80% of the lands are Class I and II (highly suitable
for irrigation) under a five-class system developed by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) and based on US Bureau of Reclamation
suitability standards. The area lies between 5 m and 55 in above sea level and
has a gradient of about 2 m to 6 m per km to the sea.  As a result, natural
drainage conditions are generally satisfactory and except for a limited area
of 800 ha lying at low elevation, salinity problems do not occur.
2.04      Soils in Fuerte district are also mainly recent alluvial deposits
of volcanic origin.  They form extensive flat areas between 3.5 m and 35 m above
sea level, intersected by shallow drain ways. As drainage is inefficient the
area suffers from high water tables (between one and two meters), and the
combination of high water tables, low rainfall and moderately high evaporation
has resulted in salt accumulation over much of the area. The soils have good
physical properties; they are more than two meters deep, medium to light tex-
tured and have good infiltration rates and permeabilities. The pH values range
mostly between 7 and 8.5. The content of organic matter is low and crops in
the area respond well to nitrogen aind phosphate fertilizers. The potash con-
tent is moderate to high. In accordance with the Mexican irrigation capability
classification (para. 2.03), close to 70% of all soils are in the Class 1 and
II categories.
2.05      Salinization affects about 60,000 ha or 50% of the proposed project
area in Fuerte district. Of this, an estimated 12,000 ha are saline-alkali
soils. The table below indicates the extent of the salt-affected land in the
three units of Fuerte district which are included in the proposed project:



Salt-Affected Lands
Unit  Irrigable Area   Saline Land    Saline-Sodic Land   Total Salt Affected
(ha)         (ha)    (%)    (ha)           (%)      (ha)          (%)
1       43,690       15,000   34.3    2,000          4.6      17,000       38.9
4       48,018       18,500   38.5    5,500         11.5      24,000       50.0
5       27,922       14,500   51.9    4,500         16.1      19,000       68.0
Total   119,630       48,000   40.1   12,000         10.0      60,000       50.2      
2.06      Extensive field investigations and previous experiences in the proj-
ect area have shown, however, that with an expanded drainage network, deeper
main drains and better water applÌcation and distribution, the saline soils
can be reclaimed and sustain permanent irrigated agriculture. Saline-sodie
soils would require applications of gypsum, which is locally available.
Climate
2.07      Climate in the project area is classified as desertic with an aver-
age annual precipitation of 347 mm, and pan evaporation of 2,299 mm per annum.
Monthly average temperatures vary from 18.2 C (Jaunary) to 30.9%C (July-August),
and light frosts may occur occasionally in January and February. About 80% of
the precipitation falls between July and October.
Irrigation Systems
2.08      Irrigation systems have been built in the two districts over a
period of some 30 years, covering altogether about 264,000 ha. In the Sinaloa
district, some 54,000 ha now have access to irrigation water from wells and
from direct diversion of waters from the Sinaloa River but are not necessarily
irrigated fully. In the Fuerte district, some 210,000 ha have access to water
from an upstream dam. However, because of poor water distribution systems
many areas have been only partly irrigated and inadequate drainage has caused
growing salinity levels. As a result of salinization, in Fuerte district
about 150,000 ha either suffered from declining production or were completely
abandoned. In one of its earliest loans to Mexico for irrigation development
(275-ME in 1961) the Bank assisted in the succesful reclamation of saline
lands in two of the five units in Fuerte district, covering about 77,000 ha.
In addition farmers reclaimed about 13,000 ha. In 1974, the Bank helped to
finance the Sinaloa project (970-ME) which will now establish a storage
dam, headworks and the distribution system for 29,000 ha in Sinaloa district
(see Chapter III). The proposed project would expand the distribution system
for the Sinaloa district to cover the remaining irrigable area of 76,000
ha and rehabilitate and reclaim the 120,000 ha in the three remaining units
of Fuerte district to provide coverage to all the 210,000 ha of irrigated
land. The two proposed actions would thus realize the full irrigation poten-
tial of the two districts. Past and proposed irrigation developments in the
two distriets are summarized in Table 2.01.



7-
Present Use of Project Lands
2.09      Land use is similar in the Sinaloa and Fuerte districts.  The main
winter crops are wheat, safflower, vegetables, cotton, maize and beans. The
main summer crops are soybeans, sorghum, rice, vegetables and maize.
2.10       Sinaloa.  Of the 76,000 ha in the Sinaloa part of the proposed proj-
ect, some 33,000 ha are currently cuJtivated.  Of these, about 28,000 ha have
some type of irrigation, either through surface water diversions, extraction
of groundwater, or a combination of the two, with about 5,000 ha cultivated
under dry farming conditions.  The 43,000 ha balance (mostly on the right
bank), is still under brush. In the portion of Sinaloa district irrigated
only by surface water diversion, water availability is restricted to summer
and early fall, and cropping is restricted mainly to rice and soybeans with
safflower and beans grown on residua:L moisture in late fall. Where there is
also pumping of groundwater, cropping is more diversified and cropping inten-
sity is high, reflecting year-round availability of water. The mean cropping
intensities in the district reach only about 122%.
2.11      Of the 120,000 ha to be rehabilitated in Fuerte ølistrict, only about
80,000 ha can be cropped because of an inadequate distribution system (10,000
ha) and of excessive salinization of the remaining 30,000 tia. The area planted
varies from year to year according to water availability, but the mean cropping
intensity for the 80,000 ha is about 109%.
Population
2.12      Overall population of the three municipios (counlies)--Ahome,
Guasave and Sinaloa--in which the project area lies, is about 550,000. There
are about 96,000 households with some 154,000 economically active members of
which nearly 50% are employed in agriculture. Annual population growth in
the region is estimated at 6% of which about 2.5% is attributed to immigration
of people attracted by employment opportunities opened up by development of
irrigated agriculture, agro-business and secondary economic activities. The
literacy rate is about 76%.
Land Tenure
2.13       Table 2.02 shows the farm size distribution for the area of Sinaloa
distriet and Units 1, 4 and 5 of Fuerte distriet which together comprise the
proposed project area.  About 70% of the area belongs to "ejidos" a legal
entity which, in essence, consists of the right of rural communities to enjoy
the usufruct of lands whose ownership remains with the Fed,eration and defines
the rights of individual members (ejidatarios) to share the usufruct right of
their community. The average share per family in the project's ejido area
is about eight ha and ranges from less than five to a maximum of 20 ha. The
remaining land is of private ownership with 66% of the farmers holding less
than 20 ha units.
2.14      Under the Agrarian Reform Law all single-owner holdings in excess
of 100 ha of irrigated land are subject to expropriation for redistribution to
ejidos. The new Federal Water Law 1/ carries this further by specifying that
1/   Ley Federal de Aguas, January ]1, 1972.



- 8 -
when a Federal Irrigation Distriet is established, the maximum size holding
of newly irrigated land is 20 ha.
2.15      In practice, however, it is expected that the applicability of
these laws will be minimal and few changes will occur in i-'  pre<^- 1-1
tenure situation since the Agrarian Reform Law would apply to only about 2%
of the proposed project area. Furthermore the Federal Water Law gives no
legal authority to intervene where lands are already irrigated, i.e. covered
by irrigation systems; this excludes all of Fuerte district and most of
Sinaloa district as in the latter, it is mostly the larger farms that possess
privately developed wells and irrigation systems.  Thus it is estimated that
in the legal sense, lands liable to expropriation under the existing laws do
not exceed 4,000 to 5,000 ha in both districts. The authorities are in the
process of purchasing part of these lands for the settlement of farmers whose
lands will be covered by the lake behind the Bacurato storage dam.
Credit and Crop Insurance
2.16      Credit is provided by more than a dozen private banks as well as
five branches of the official Banco Nacional de Credito Rural (BNCR) in the
Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa area. BNCR lending for the 1977-78 crop year by its
Los Mochis (Fuerte) and Guasave (Sinaloa) branches was, respectively: Mex $417
million for 69,389 ha and Mex $113 million for 26,977 ha. Nearly 98% of the BNCR
lending was to the ejido sector for which it is the primary supplier of short-
term credit. All of the above banks are able to use the Fondo de Garantia of
the Bank of Mexico (FIRA) for rediscounting long term loan paper. The avail-
ability of short- and long-term credit has not been a limiting factor in the
project area. A government-sponsored crop insurance program, the Aseguradora
Nacional Agricola and Ganadera S.A. (ANAGSA), operates in close cooperation
with the lending programs, with the insurance covering on average about 70%
of the cost of inputs for irrigated production.
Agricultural Inputs
2.17      In addition to commercial firms, associations of private farmers
and unions of ejidos are involved in supplying seeds, fertilizers, pest con-
trol and custom machine operations.
2.18      Seeds.  Most of the improved seed used in the project area is selec-
ted and introduced by the local experimental stations (para 2.23). Multipli-
cation is carried out either by the government-operated Productora Nacional de
Semillas (PRONASE) or under supervision of the National Service for Inspection
and Seed Certification. The farmer's associations also produce seeds of the
improved varieties for their members.
2.19      Fertilizer.  Production, import and distribution of fertilizers on
the national scale is handled by the government owned firm, Fertilizantes
Mexicanos (FERTIMEX). Local distribution in the Fuerte/Sinaloa area is handled
effectively by a combination of public, private and farmer organizations.
Sinaloa state is one of the heaviest users of fertilizers in the nation,
particularly nitrogen where the average application under irrigated conditions
such as the project area is about 105 kg/ha in terms of elemental N. However,



in spite of this high use of N there is a need to improve use efficiency and
for research development of more fertilizer responsive varieties. Phosphorus
responses are common and there is a continuous need to maintain adequate
phosphorus levels which are drawn dosm by high output resulting from irriga-
tion and heavy nitrogen applications.
2.20      Custom Machine Operations.  Hiring of machinery for certain farm
operations is a well established practice in the project area. Most of the
ejidos and small private farmers make use of custom operators for heavy
tractor work, harvesting and aerial applications. Most of the operators are
private but services are also provided by two large unions of ejidos. 1/
Large private farmers and ejidos have their own tractors and implements and
are generally independent for land preparation and cultivation purposes. On
the whole the system functions efficiently and the capacity of the operators
is such that they are able to perform the farming operations in a timely
manner. Price guidelines for each custom operation are set annually through
negotiation between representative of the various farmer groups and the union
of private custom machine operators (maquileros). These prices then serve as
the basis for bank lending for the upcoming season.  This system is flexible
and more than adequate to meet the needs of any proposed expansion in the area
provided that the custom operators are assured adequate access to long term
credit for the purchase of additional machinery which to date has been the
case (para. 2.16).
2.21      Plant Protection.  Adequate control of plant pests and diseases is
essential to both present and future development of irrigated agriculture in
the project area. The present regional infrastructure provides adequate plant
protection programs for the state's irrigation districts and consists of:
(a) the SARH offices in charge of plant protection, which have insect, disease
and rat control responsibilities and provide leadership in biological control
of important pests; (b) custom operators who apply insecticides by tractor
or plane; and (c) product distribution points operated by farmer's associa-
tions and private farms. Financial support for area-wide programs of biolo-
gical control is provided in part by farmer's associations.
2.22      Processing and Marketing.  The project area is well served by basic
processing and storage facilities for grains and cotton, and has developed
specialized and efficient procedures for handling some 10,000 ha of vegetable
production for export and internal markets. The agro-industries located within
the area include cotton gins, rice millls, a sugar mill, gas distribution, fer-
tilizer and insecticide mixing, seed processing, and, of major economic value,
vegetable packing and cold storage facilities for export via refrigerated vans
and railroad cars, and a local canning industry.
1/   These Unions operate ejido-owned businesses, municipio-wide in their
coverage. The first is controlled by and serves 38 ejidos in Ahome; the
second, 116 ejidos in Guasave.

Research and Extension
2.23      Research.  Research activity in the project area has been limited by
modest annual budgets, however, giving the need for expanding this activity,
the quality of ongoing programs is generally high. A positive aspect of the
research structure is that a mechanism has been developed during the past 12
years for local support of research in the form of a statewide (Sinaloa)
permanent Commission for Agricultural Research and Experimentation.  Of a
total research budget of Mex$32.5 million for Sinaloa in 1977, private farmers
and ejidatorios contributed Mex$6.2 million through a special tax on production.
The National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA) has one experiment
station located in the project area, between Los Mochis and Guasave (CIAPAN)
but has had little budget for off-station trials. CIAPAN's main activities
include testing for local adaptability of the improved varieties of rice,
sorghum and soybeans developed at international centers, as well as the new
wheat varieties emanating from the research conducted cooperatively by INIA
and the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT) at
Obregon, Sonora. The main deficiency of the station's program is in the need
to expand its program for: (a) disease resistant varieties with greater
production potential, especially of beans and maize; (b) better advice on
water management and fertilizer use taking into account rotations which are
most efficient in production per unit of water as well as unit area.
2.24      Extension.  Extension services are provided by (i) the technical
staff of FIRA and BNCR; and (ii) SAPH extension staff which is numerically
the most important. Extension Services in already established districts have
been particularly effective.  However, recently, the SARH extension effort has
been organized and consolidated as part of each district's integrated technical
program in line with a countrywide reorganization in all irrigation districts.
A main feature of the new approach is its similarity to the training and visit
system being used in a number of Bank financed projects in other countries.
The irrigation districts in Northern Sinaloa have had no problem in recruiting
agricultural graduates and technical staff for this new program: most come
from the Agricultural faculties of the University of Sinaloa at Culiacan or
from local schools offering agricultural courses at a technical level.
However, recruits lack experience and inservice training and supervision is
needed to ensure their effective use.

III. THE ONGOING SINALOA PROJECT
Original Project Description
3.01      The original Sinaloa Irrigation Project (Loan 970-ME for US$47 mil-
lion, approved February 19, 1974) was intended to develop intensive irrigated
agriculture on about 105,000 ha on both banks of the Sinaloa river. Project
works wers to consist of: (a) the Bacurato dam and storage reservoir
(2,900 Mm ); (b) the Sinaloa de Leyva diversion dam; (c) a concrete-lined
irrigation coveyance and distribution system; (d) 60 new wells to complement
the surface water supply; (e) a system of primary and seccndary drains;
(f) land clearing and leveling; (g) an intensive four year farm extension
program; and (h) ancillary items such as operation and maintenance equipment,
roads, ditchrider houses, a communications system and project headquarters
offices. The construction period was estimated to be five years.
3.02      The total project cost amounted to US$145.6 million, inclusive of
interest on the Bank loan during the construction period. The Bank loan of
US$47.0 million was to finance the foreign exchange component of the project
(US$46.3 million) and one-half of thLe estimated cost of the four year exten-
sion program (US$0.7 million).
3.03      The net value of agricultural production expressed in 1972 prices
was expected to increase from about US$3.5 million to about US$29.5 million
in an eight year period, which corresponds to a net incremental value of
production expressed in 1978 prices of about US$65 million. The rate of
return to the economy was estimated at about 17%.
3.04      In the project area about 651,300 ha were occupied by 10,900 families
in 74 ejidos (or 5.6 ha per family) and about 39,600 ha were held by 1,170
private producers (or 33.8 ha per family). With the project, it was expected
that an ejidatarios' on-farm income would increase 10 times to about US$2,000 1/
equivalent, while the income of a private farmer would increase at least
six times to about US$15,000 equivalent.
Project Execution, 1974-1977
3.05      The project got off to a s]ow start.  Insufficient budget allocations
caused delays in project implementation and the budgetary situation became
extremely critical during 1976-1977 when Mexico, facing rapid inflation and
a severe financial disequilibrium, launched a stringent stabilization program.
By mid 1977, little progress in execution had been made and the cost estimate
for the original project had more than doubled to US$300 million.
3.06      Government reviewed the situation and consulted with the Bank on
how to proceed with the project. The following alternative options were
discussed. Firstly, to continue loan disbursements at the rate foreseen in
the Loan Contract (e.g., 38% for civil works). This would liave exhausted
1/   Expressed in 1972 prices.



- 12 -
the loan amount well before project completion and was not acceptable to
either party. Secondly to reduce the loan disbursement percentage to about
15% so that disbursements could be made during the full construction period.
This too was rejected by both parties. Thirdly, to redefine the scope of
the original Sinaloa project, limiting it to the works underway or those
intimately related to them, with the remaining works being rescheduled and
financed under a follow-up project.  A President's Memorandum containing this
proposal was approved by the Board on March 27, 1979.
The Revised Sinaloa Project
3.07       The project as now redefined includes the main civil works originally
contemplated (dam, diversion structures and main canals) but reduces the irri-
gation and drainage network considerably. It consists of (a) Bacurato dam and
storage reservoir; (b) Sinaloa de Leyva diversion dam; (c) 94 km of lined main
irrigation canals on the left bank and 47 km lined main canals on the right
bank of the Sinaloa river; (d) an irrigation and drainage network covering
29,250 ha 1/; (e) land clearing and leveling on about 12,000 ha; (f) a farm
extension program; and (g) ancillary items such as O&M equipment. The Rio
Sinaloa irrigation network has been connected by two canals to the adjacent
Rio Fuerte irrigation distriet. The total cost of the revised project expressed
in 1978 prices including price contingencies and interest during construction
is estimated to amount to US$137.3 million with a foreign exchange component
of US$44.71 million as outlined in the table below.

1/   A further area of 15,750 ha on the left bank will partially benefit from
this infrastructure, but will achieve full development levels only with
the infrastructure and services to be provided under the proposed
Fuerte/Sinaloa Project.



- 13 -
3.08      The problems, which initially delayed project implementation (para.
3.05) have been resolved; budget allocations have substantially increased
and Ìt is expected that Government will now execute the remaining items of
the revised Sinaloa Project in a timnely manner. Bacurato dam and reservoir
will be completed and fully operational by July 1981. The Sinaloa de Leyva
diversion structure was completed in 1976. The main canals, irrigation and
drainage networks and land clearing and leveling will be completed and opera-
tional by the end of 1979. The extension service has already initiated its
activities in the project area and by the end of 1978 about 40% of works under
the revised project had been completed. Disbursements have been slow, mainly
due to delays in preparation of corresponding requests; about 15% of the Bank
loan was disbursed by December 1978. It is expected, however, that execution
of the revised project would be completed in December 1981, and disbursements
by July 1982.
Revised Project Benefits and Economic Justification
3.09      With the reduction in irrigated area to 29,250 ha, Bacurato storage
reservoir capacity would be well in excess of maximum irrigation water require-
ments in Sinaloa distriet, even supposing that high croppirng intensities will
be reached on the newly irrigated lands.  Assuming, for purposes of calculation
that no follow-up project would be carried out, the excess storage could then
be used to channel water through interconnecting canals to Fuerte district,
where water shortages also exist and cropping intensities on existing irrigated
lands could be raised with water froni Bacurato dam.
3.10      Benefits under the revised project would therefore consist of
(a) incremental production on 29,250 ha of newly rehabilitated lands in
SÌnaloa, with an estimated cropping i.ntensity of 140% at full development;
(b) incremental production on an additional 16,000 ha of existing irrigated
lands in Sinaloa, which would produce only 60% of benefits assumed under
(a) due to deficient water distribution and drainage facilities; and
(c) water releases to Fuerte district which would enable raising cropping
intensities on 70,000 ha in the Fuerte district from 110 to 120%. The rate
of return of the revised project is estimated at 12%.



- 14 -
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Concept
4.01      On first appearance the concept for the proposed project was to
follow the design of the original Sinaloa project and complete the field
distribution system on the entire area, i.e. on an additional 76,000 ha. This
would, however, have entailed a serious disadvantage: it would take about
four years to complete the field distribution system while during this time
the Bacurato storage reservoir would have considerable excess capacity.
Although these waters could in theory be released to Fuerte district during
that period, they could not be used where they would be most urgently needed,
i.e. for the leaching of saline lands; without simultaneous improvements in
the Fuerte drainage system, leaching would lead to waterlogging and increase
salinity levels even further.
4.02      These considerations prompted the Mexican authorities to propose
a different concept for a follow-up project under which (a) the field distri-
bution system in Sinaloa would be completed in four years, covering 76,000
ha; (b) meanwhile, excess water from Bacurato reservoir would be channeled to
Fuerte district and used for leaching saline lands, which would also take about
four years to complete; (c) concurrent with the leaching program in Fuerte,
improvements in the drainage network and installation of control structures
to avoid excessive water use, covering about 120,000 ha would be carried
out; and (d) after completion of leaching in Fuerte, water releases from
Bacurato dam would all revert to Sinaloa district and be put to productive
use there since by this time the distribution system would have been built.
4.03      This concept is acceptable to the Bank as it would spread the bene-
fits of irrigation over a larger area and more equitably over a larger number
of farmers; it would provide water for leaching which could otherwise have
been provided only by reducing cropping intensities (and possibly cropped
areas) in Fuerte district; and it would implement a project - the rehabilita-
tion of Fuerte district - which was already foreseen by the Mexican authorities
as the next stage in the overall Plan for Irrigation Investment in the North-
west (PLINO).
Project Description
4.04      The Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa Project would inerease agriculture pro-
duction productivity and farm incomes of 196,000 ha through rehabilitation and
extension of irrigation and drainage networks, and reclamation of saline soils.
Project works include:
(a)  rehabilitation of about 1.7 km of lined main canal, 130 km
of unlined main irrigation canals, about 600 km of unlined
irrigation laterals, and 154 km of open drains in the Fuerte
district;
(b) construction of about 375 km of lined irrigation laterals and,
171 km of open drains, in the Fuerte district;



- 15 -
(c) construction of about 16 km of lined main canal, 313 km of
lined and 280 km of unlined irrigation laterals, 510 km of
open drains, and 170 km of feeder roads in the Sinaloa
dÌstriet;
(d) reclamation of about 60,000 ha of saline and saline-sodie
soils in the Fuerte district;
(e) land clearing and leveling;
(f)  telecommunication and other works;
(g)  expansion of the district agricultural extension and
research programs; and
(h)  execution of drainage and other studies within the Sinaloa and
Fuerte river basins.
4.05      The irrigation works would be designed for water delivery to 60 ha
blocks. Water control and measuring structures would be part of the canal
network and permit monitoring of water use down to the 60 ha block turnouts.
Drainage works comprise rehabilitation and deepening of existing drains and
construction of new drains. Drain depth would vary from two to four meters
and the overall drain density would be about 12 rn/ha. Feeder roads would be
6 m wide. In addition service roads would run along the main drains and
canals.
4.06      On-farn development includes leveling of about 60,000 ha in Fuerte
a9d 40,000 ha in Sinaloa district.  Earth movements would average about 400
m /ha and be generally below 700 m /ha. In Fuerte's district the project would
also reclaim 48,000 ha of saline lands, of which 18,000 ha are presently unpro-
ductÌve and 30,000 ha produce about 35% of normal yield in the region. In
addition about 12,000 ha of unproductive saline-sodic lands require gypsum
applications (15 tons/ha) and leaching for their reclamation.  Although most
of the water for leaching in Fuerte would come from Bacuratc reservoir (para.
4.02) Fuerte drainage water would also be used for leaching and is recommended
for rehabilitation of saline-sodic solls.  Reclamation would require about
one and a half meters of water for saline soils and about two meters for
saline-sodic soils including half and one meter respectively for evaporation
losses. Rice would be grown during reclamation.
4.07      Other civil works include 2915 km of telephone lÌnes to link Guasave,
Los Mochis and Bacurato dam (Map IBRD 13953), 50 ditch rider houses, and build-
ings for supporting services. In addition the project would supply equipment
for operation and maintenance of project facilities (Table 4.01). Intensive
programs for supporting agricultural services would involve provision for
buildings and equipment, incremental salaries and incremental recurrent costs
for expanding the agricultural extension and research servic,es in the area.
Further details are discussed in Chapter V.
4.08      The project would also provide for expansion of the groundwater
observation well network and monitoring of the water table (para 5.10) and
for studies on drain spacing, use of tubewells for drainage, draÌnage materials



- 16 -
etc. This is considered necessary as there is a danger that, with time,
after the completion of Bacurato reservoir, groundwater tables could rise to
undesirable shallow levels in Sinaloa district and those parts of Fuerte
district near to Sinaloa River. Levels of possible future drainage investments
cannot be provided at this time, but some allowances for this purpose have been
made in the project analysis (para 8.02). In addition Covernment agreed to
provide credit for ejidos and private farmers for on-farm drainage as required.
Water Supply and Demand
4.09      Sinaloa Irrigation District.  The district will derive its water
from Bacurato dam and from the 3underground aquifer.  Bacurato dam will have
a maximum capacity of 2,900 Mm  and a normal irrigation capacity of 1,800 Mm
The average reservoir inflow b sed on 37 continuous years of hydrologic records
has been estimated at 1,330 Mm . Water requirements were determined by the
modified Blaney-Criddle method and assuming conveyance and field efficients
of 70% each (overall efficiency 50%); the results compare with actual water
use in the neighboring fully developed El Carriso district. Between 1978 and
1982 the Sinaloa district could supply 1,065 Mm to the Fuerte district for
leaching purposes. Details on water availability and requirements are sum-
marized below and shown in more detail in Tables 4.02 and 4.03.

4.10      Fuerte Irrigation District.  The district covers an area of 210,000
ha and receives its water from (a) Miguel Hidalgo dam; (b) the underground
aquifer; and (c) rediversion of return flows at Camayeca/Porvenir and Guamu-
chilera. The Miguel Hidalgo dam regulates the streamflow of the river for
the five units of the Fuerte district and for the Josefa Ortiz dam which
regulates the availabilities for the Carrizo district. In accordance with
hydrolog cal records the average rese 5voir inflow at Miguel Hidalgo is
4,400 Mm and the outflow is 3,093 Mn with a probability of shortage of

Water Quality
4.11      The quality of water available for the project is excellent for
irrigation use, the impurities carried by the water in solution or in sus-
pension are very few. During the dry season from November to May, the dis-
solved solid contents rarely exceed 200 ppm at the inlets of Bacurato and



- 18 -
Miguel Hidalgo and the pH factor ranges from neutral to slightly acid.
Contamination of quality of irrigation water may be caused by use of
return flow or drainage recoveries. At the present, the irrigation water
contains no toxic or harmful elements and there is no evidence of water
borne diseases.
Construction Schedule and Status of Engineering
4.12      Implementation Schedule.  Project implementation would begin in
January 1980 and be completed in December 1985. Although civil works would
be constructed in a four year period (1980-1983), the project would support
studies, agricultural research and extension activities during a six year
period. This would ensure timely realization of potential benefits from the
project. Table 4.06 summarizes the project implementation schedule.
4.13      Status of Engineering.  Feasibility level designs for the irriga-
tion and drainage networks have been satisfactorily completed. Detailed
designs of the project works would be carried out under the project by the
Office of Hydraulic Infrastructure for Northern Sinaloa in Los Mochis (Chart
No. 20103) which has sufficient qualified staff and experience for this pur-
pose. The same staff has designed the irrigation and drainage networks for
Sinaloa I in a most satisfactory manner.
Cost Estimates
4.14      Total project cost expressed in December 1978 prices amount to
US$249.7 million (Mex$5,620 million) including price and physical contingen-
cies. There are no identifiable taxes. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at US$84.6 million (Mex$1,904 million) or 34% of total costs. Cost
estimates for civil works and major equipment are based on unit rates obtained
in contracts for the ongoing Sinaloa I irrigation project (Loan 970-H1E).
Physical contingencies for civil works and equipment were taken at 15% and
for engineering at 10% of civil works in view of recent experience with
similar work in the area. Total price contingencies amount to US$65.5
million or 26% of total project cost and were compounded at 7% annually for
the foreign exchange component of civil works, at 6% annually for the foreign
exchange component of equipment between 1979 and 1985, and for local cost at
15%, 10% and 6.5% in 1979, 1980 and from 1981 to 1985 respectively. These
price contingencies are based on projected price inflation in Mexico's civil
works industry. Cost estimates are summarized below and shown in detail in
Table 4.07. Table 4.08 shows the schedule of expenditures.
Financing Plan
4.15      The proposed Bank loan of US$92 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange requirements of the project (US$84.6 million) plus 50% of
studies and incremental operational costs of agricultural extension and
research services (US$7.4 million). The Government would finance the re-
mainder of project costs amounting to US$157.7 equivalent or 63% of total
project costs. The Bank loan would be for a period of 17 years including
four years of grace. Interest and commitment charges on the Bank loan during
the construction period would be paid by Government.

Procurement
4.16      Contracts for principal irrigation and drainage works amounting
to about US$108 million would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Mexico has a well developed and competent contracting industry, capable of
doing all type of civil works at competitive prices, and only rarely is a
bid submitted from a non Mexican firm. However to facilitate the participation
of international contractors, civil works would, insofar as possible be grouped
into contracts having a minimum value of US$2.0 million.
4.17      On-farm development works (US$22 million) would be procured under
local competitive bidding or through negotiated contracts on the basis of
Government procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. Most frequently in
the project region farmers organize themselves into partnerships to contract
land clearing and leveling on small tracts up to 100 ha in size using their
own machinery.  The work provides income to the farmers pending completion of
the rehabilitation works, but more importantly, it trains them in proper
leveling procedures and prepares them to maintain their fields in good
condition for irrigation. SARH provides engineering services and supervises
such contracts.
4.18      To expedite the construction of civil works under international
competitive bidding, small jobs (telecommunications, buildings, houses)
whicli, because of timing or nature of the work, could be better handled if
they were not included in major contracts, would be contracted out under
ordinary Government procedures, up to a maximum value per contract of
US$0.22 million.
4.19      The estimated cost of vehicles, farm machinery and equipment is
about US$8.8 million, out of which US$6 million would be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding according to Bank Guidelines for Procurement
(March 1977). For bid evaluation a 15% margin of preference or the prevailing
custom duties if lower would be allowed for equipment and vehicles produced in
Mexico. About US$2.8 million worth of minor equipment are not suitable for
international competitive bidding would be purchased through normal local
procurement procedures. Government agreed to follow procurement procedures
outlined above.
Disbursements
4.20      The proposed Bank loan would disburse against itemized categories as
outlined below. In the case of incremental staff salaries, the appropriate
documentation would be a summary of those staff salaries applicable to the
project and based on positions incremental to the staff list at June 30, 1979.
Other disbursements would be made against normal documentation. The estimated
disbursement schedule is presented in Table 4.09.

The percentage under category I reflects the non financing of retention
monies under civil works contracts.
Accounts and Audit
4.21      SARH would maintain separate accounts to reflect the financial
situation of the project. Such accounts are subject to periodical internal
audits conducted by a special audit division of SARH. Government agreed to
(a) maintain or cause to be maintained separate accounts adequate to reflect
in accordance with constantly maintained sound accounting practices, resources
and expenditures in respect of the project of the departments and agencies of
the Government responsible for carrying out the project or any part thereof,
(b) annually furnish to the Bank a summary statement of such accounts, and
(c) furnish to the Bank such other pertinent information concerning such
accounts as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to time.
Environmental Impact
4.22      The project would not adversely affect the environment:  better
irrigation water management, drainage and reclamation would in fact improve
environmental conditions in the project area. Monitoring of the water table
would permit immediate action to avoid possible waterlogging in the future.
There are no water borne diseases in the project area.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01      The project would be administered by SARH through its established
channels; no changes to existing arrangements are considered necessary under
the proposed project. Thus the nominal responsibility for the project would
rest with SARH's representative for the state of Sinaloa, with headquarters
in Culiacan, which in turn would be passed to his representative in Los
Mlochis, the SARH Coordinator for Northern Sinaloa. This coordinator is
responsible for all SARH activities in the northern part of the state. Under
the coordinator operate (a) the office of Major Hydraulic Infrastructure
Prograns (MHIP) which is the lead office for execution of the ongoing project
(970-ME) and would also fulfill this role for the proposed project; and (b)
the three irrigation districts of Sinaloa, Fuerte and Carrizo organized along
similar lines and responsible for on-farm development operations and main-
tenance, and extension services. Chart 20103 shows the organization of the
proposed project within the framework of the SARH organization in Northern
Sinaloa.
Major Hydraulic Infrastructure Programs
5.02      The organizational structure of this office has been in existence
since the establishment of the first irrigation district in Northern Sinaloa
in 1963.  It is currently headed by an experienced and competent engineer with
management teams assigned for specific activities such as rehabilitation of
Fuerte, construction of Bacurato dam, etc. These teams are supported by a
headquarter administration and technical staff. The chief of MHIP is res-
ponsible for engineering design, field planning, and specifications, for
supervision of construction and for the preparation of annual budgets. While
the annual budgets have to be approved by the SARH state representative,
approval of the engineering design, planning and specification aspects is the
responsibility of the SARH Subsecretary of Infrastructure in Mexico City.
These arrangements are operating satisfactorily and it is considered that the
existing organization and staffing are adequate and could well handle the
proposed project without major changes or additions.
Irrigation Districts
5.03      Each irrigation district is assisted at the executive level by a
steering committee to ensure the participation of non-SARH public and private
organizations, and has three departments for its day to day operations -
Conservation and Maintenance, Operations and Development, and Administrative
Services.
5.04      Conservation and Maintenance is responsible for all major repairs
for which it operates its own machinery pool and workshop. Details and costs
of additional maintenance equipment needed under the proposed project are
shown in table 4.01 while operation and maintenance costs, estimated to total
Mex$183.6 million (US$8.2 million) annually, are detailed in table 5.01.



- 23 -
5.05      Operations and Development is responsible for the daily operation of
the irrigation system, for extension servÌces and for the collection of water
charges. The basic unit for operating the irrigation system is the zone covering
about 6,000 ha each and employing one zone chief and a team of seven ditch riders.
Extension services have been recently reorganized into a newly created District
Integrated Technical Assistance Program, (DITA).
5.06      DITA replaces the services that were provÌded under the umbrella
of PLAMEPA and involves two main activities: agricultural extension, and
water management/distribution, with procedures similar to the training and
visit system which has been supported in a number of Bank financed projects,
particularly in Asia (Chart 20103).  At farm level, extension activities
are handled by separate teams assigned to specific areas. In addition to
regulating water supply over these areas the team advises farmers on on-farm
leveling prograns. Regarding extension a field extension officer at graduate
level is assigned to an area of about 3,000 ha, with responsibility for about
300 to 500 families. Depending on work load the field extension officer may
be assisted by an agricultural technician. Farm visits are nmade on a regular
basis in the course of 10 to 14 days. At each visit the extension officer
gives written recommendations to the farmer or ejido management keeping a copy
for his own records. Field extension officers meetings are held regularly at
weekly intervals at either the zone or area levels to discuss problems and fÌx
field work programs. Meetings are also held at 2-3 weekly intervals at the
unit or district level for more formal training and technical discussions.
5.07      Field technicians are supported by special units attached to the
office of the Chief of Operations and Development (e.g. hydrology; deep wells;
water use; applied research). Of particular importance is the unit for applied
research which works on selected farmer sites to orient the field extension
officers who in turn use the sites for field days for farmer demonstrations.
Also, in this unit are located some six to nine subject matter specialists
who work closely in training and problem solving with the field extension
workers through their respective zone, area and unit coordinators.
5.08      With the DITA system, the overall quality of extension services
has become quite satisfactory and is among the best available in Mexico; it
has also sufficient flexibility to meet additional demands under the proposed
project. New staff would be recruited gradually as the need arises and new
irrigation units are initiated. In this regard no problemus are anticipated in
recruiting the 68 professional, 66 sub-professional and 46 support staff for
the DITA component of the proposed project. However these staff will need
further training before they can be considered effective extension workers.
Thus in service training will be an important feature of the extension activi-
ties provided under the project.  Total investment costs for the proposed
extension program amounts to Mex$7.3 inillion (US$325,000) and incremental
operational costs for a six year period to Mex$194.7 million (US$8.7 million)
and are detailed in table 5.02.
5.09      Research.  The research being carried out by the -[NIA staff at the
CIAPAN research center is generally well executed and no changes in exist-
ing administrative arrangements are envisaged for the small research component



- 24 -
under the project. However, under the project research programs will be
organized to study water management and plant yield improvement at the farmer
level rather than at the research station as at present. For this purpose no
major expansion in the existing physical facilities will be needed. The main
requirement will be additional 15 research staff with appropr4ate supPrct -'
clerical staff. Thus total investment cost for agricultural research amount
to Mex$9.8 million (US$436,000) and incremental operational costs for a six
year period to Mex$74.2 million (US$3.3 million) and are outlined in table
5.03.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.10      Monitoring and evaluation of the proposed project forms an integral
part of the existing operation. Basic data collection is carried out routinely
within the system, the most important of which are cropped areas, cropping pat-
terns, water use, yields, prices, marketing and handling, operation and main-
tenance activities, extension activities, ground water levels, progress of works
and reservoir storage. With the exception of expanding the grid for measuring
ground water levels (para 4.08) no significant changes in current procedures
are envisaged. These procedures will also be applied under the proposed
project.

VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKETS,
MARKETING AND PRICES
Area, Cropping Patterns, Yields
6.01      Total cropped acreage in the project area totals about 128,000
ha at present (paras 2.10-2.11 and table 6.01). Without the project, this
area in the future would be reduced as in Fuerte District, land would go out
of production due to increasing salinity levels: estimated on the basis of
past experience at about 10,000 ha over 10 years. Cropping intensities would
increase as additional water becomes available from Bacurato dam to 120% in
Fuerte and 140% in the in the Sinaloa area. With the project, this process
would be reversed, more land would be brought under production and cropping
intensity would only be slightly above present levels as detailed in table 6.01
and summarized below:

6.02      Although with the project th,e same crops would be grown as at pre-
sent, some crops would increase their share of total area while others would
be reduced. Changes in cropping patterns are predieted due to the need to:
(a) minimize areas of high water constunption crops (rice, sugar) and to maxi-
mize areas of more efficient water usi.ng crops (beans, sorghum, safflower); (b)
maximize areas for crops with good market prospects both domestically (feed



- 26 -
grains, oil seeds) and for export (cotton); and (c) maintain vegetable produc-
tion to about the present level in spite of its high returns because of con-
straints in both the domestic and the international markets. Yield projections
are based on average yields presently obtained on fully irrigated lands in
both the project area and neighboring areas. Overall yield increases are
relatively small compared to many new irrigation districts in Mexico, due to
the existing high level of applied technologies on lands where water is
available; projected increases would mainly be due to more efficient water
use and better drainage and leaching brought about by the project. The
following table shows present, projected with and without project status
regarding areas and yields for the main crops.

Production
6.03      Based upon the above yields, cropping patterns and cropping inten-
sities, incremental production for the main crops would be: (a) soybean
71,500 mt; (b) sorghum 71,600 mt; (c) vegetables 57,000 mt; (d) seed cotton
47,800 mt; (e) safflower 72,200 mt; (f) alfalfa/pasture 36,160 mt; (g) fruit
35,300 mt; and (h) sugar 42,000 mt. Production of maize, rice and wheat is
projected to decline; although yield increases are projected for these crops,
these increases would not be sufficient to compensate for the reduction in
areas predicted under the project, as the net return on these crops would
be decidedly lower than for others such as oil seeds and cotton.  With the
exception of cotton and vegetables which would be mainly exported, the remainder
of the crops would be for local consumption.
Markets and Prices
6.04      No marketing problems are foreseen for project produce.  Farmers in
the project area have in the past shown a strong flexibility to cope with
changes in demand for their products, and marketing facilities are operating
efficiently and able to cope with additional supplies from the proposed project.
At full development, incremental output would be less than 8% of local demand
in the State of Sinaloa, Chihuahua and Durango, and less than 2% of the require-
ments of Mexico City, and no market disruptions due to oversupply are expected.
6.05      The National Marketing Corporation (CONASUPO) purchases agricultural
commodities on the basis of official support prices. These prices are generally
in line with free market prices except for commodities for which there is a
national shortage and/or imports are increasing, such as maize or soybeans, in
which case support prices are perceptibly higher. Sales to CONASUPO, however,
are on a voluntary basis and CONASUPO purchases nationwide seldom exceed
25-30% of total market production. In northern Sinaloa CONASUPO purchases are
mostly limited to beans; most marketing is done by producer organizations
or private firms at farm gate prices generally above those fixed by Government.
While farm prices have been used in the farm budgets, present and future
economic prices converted to farmgate levels have been used to calculate
the value of production for purposes of economic analysis; calculations of
economic prices are based on Bank projections. Farmgate and economic prices
are summarized below:

VII. PROJECT BENEFICIARIES FARM
INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
7.01      IThe proposed project would through increased production directly
benefit 19,700 families comprising 17,250 ejidatarios and 2,450 private
farmers.  It would also decrease on-farm underemployment, through provision
of additional 3.3 million man-days of labor per year at full development.
More than 9C0% of the beneficiaries wou]d be from the lowest income group of
farmers in the area with average farm sizes of less than 13 ha representing
about 73% of the farm area of the proposed project. The present weighted net
farm incomes 1/ before charges and taxes for this group would vary from
Mex$12,000 to Mex$38,000 for average farm sizes within the range of 4-13 ha.
At full development net farm incomes before charges and taxes for the same
range would be Mex$42,000 to Mex$135,000, A detailed breakdown by average
farm size showing present status of land use and present and projected NVP
values per farm with and without the proposed project are shown in Table
7.01. Representative farm models for the proposed project are shown in Table
7.02 and 7.03. Production costs are sunmmarized in table 7.04. The FRR's for
the models of 23% for the farm unaffected by salinization and 25% for the
farm affected by salinization is considered conservative and in most
instances, particularly amongst the small landholder group will probably be
somewhat higher.
7.02      Tle recovery of project costs through water charges has been the
subject of a continuing dialogue betweien the Government and the Bank.
Government has recently stated that its aim is to eventually recover all
operation and maintenance costs plus those capital investment costs that
producers can afford.  However, no timoe schedule has been set to achieve these
objectives except that changes should be increased gradually on a country wide
basis. Under the ongoing Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project (Loan 970-ME) Govern-
rment agreed to "charge and collect wat,er charges on the basis of the ability
of water users to pay and the need to obtain an incentive for them to make
best use of the land and water available to them as shall be necessary to
recover all operation and maintenance costs of irrigation facilities included
in the projoect and as much as practicable of their investment costs".
7.03      7te Government proposes to recover for the proposed Rio Fuerte/Rio
Sinaloa project total operation and maintenance costs plus a proportion
of investment costs. Government would carry out a socio-economic study in
the Sinaloa and Fuerte irrigation districts to determine farmners ability to
pay. The study is important as even with the project, part of the farming
population would remain below or close to the poverty level and should in any
1/   Weighted to include: (a) farms on which the present yields and cropping
patterns are similar to those from the better developed units/districts
in the region; (b) farms on which present production is on average
about 35% of (a) because of the scarcity of water, salinity or poor
drainage; and (c) those areas that have not yet been developed for
irrigation.



- 30 -
case be exempt from any additional charge or levy. Government would in
addition recover about Mex$70.7 million per annum of incremental income tax
which is directly related to crop grown in the area.
7.04      Assuming full recovery of operation and maintenance costs for the
time being, Government would have to raise the water charge from about 70
pesos to about 90 pesos per thousand cubic meters of water. On a per hectare
basis this means an average increase from about 430 pesos to about 560 pesos.
Water would be levied per ha and kind of crop grown.
7.05      The incremental water charges plus returns from incremental income
tax would result in rent recovery indices of 17% for farms of less than
13 ha, and 73% for farms of more than 13 ha; the cost recovery index would
amount to 19% (table 7.05). Total charges and taxes would represent 13% of
the incremental cash income of small holders and 62% of large landholders.
During negotiations Government agreed to: (a) recover full operation and
maintenance cost of irrigation and drainage works provided under the proposed
project; (b) carry out a study in the Fuerte and Sinaloa project areas to
determine the farmers ability to pay for investment costs; (c) not later than
December 31, 1984 submit this study to the Bank together with a proposal for
recovery of investment costs; and (d) review this study periodically with the
view to revising such charges if appropriate.

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits
8.01      Execution of the project would entail significant benefits for both
the participating project farmers and the Northern Sinaloa area as a whole.
The project would (a) increase agricultural production by providing irrigation
water to previously part irrigated or non-irrigated areas and by reclaiming
saline lands; and (b) prevent salinizaton on presently non-saline lands which,
without drainage improvements, would become affected in th,e future. The
project would also have significant social effects: 87% of farm families and
70% of the land are in ejidos with holdings of 20 ha or less, and as it is
presently the larger individual farmners who have the better irrigated lands,
the share of smallholders in total net value of production would increase
(from 57% at present to 71% at full project development for farmers with
eight ha or less). Indirect benefits would also be important: not only
would small farmers that now mainly depend on seasonal off-farm employment
revert to full time employment on the farm, thus increasing total family
income and thus liberating employmerit opportunities in the services and
industries sector, but increased agricultural production would itself generate
more employment in other sectors, as demonstrated by the net influx of people
into the area of between 2% and 3% per year.
8.02      The economic rate of return of the project, counting direct benefits
alone, has been calculated at 17.9% (table 8.01). The assumptions for this
calculation have been (a) the treatmient of investments under the ongoing
Sinaloa project - as revised - as stnk cost; (b) the area under crops and crop
yields assumptions as given in paras 6.01 and 6.02; (c) economic prices
converted to farmgate as specified in para 6.05. An estimate on future
drainage investments (para 4.08) has been made at the rate of 1,500 ha per
year starting from 1985 onwards, ancl its costs taken into account in the
economic cost benefit analysis. Finally, all labor including farmily labor,
has been costed at current wage rates for the area. As the project is the
completion of an ongoing program in which major infrastructure investments
(dam, main canals) will already have been carried out before, however, an
integrated analysis of the ongoing -- revised - Sinaloa prc.ject and the Fuerte/
Sinaloa project gives a better indication of its profitability. The rate of
return on the integrated project, again counting only direct benefits,
is 13.4% (table 8.01).
Risk and Sensitivity
8.03      The project carries no major risks.  The quality and performance
of the project organization in the area is well above average even for Mexican
standards, and experience has shown that it is able to carry out infrastructure
works, operate the irrigation system and provide extension services in a
satisfactory manner.  Moreover, farmers are well established, employ modern
technology and improved production mnethods, and are open to advice from
extension workers; the chances that yield levels on newly irrigated land would
not reach predicted levels are remote.  Reclamation of saline lands would
follow the same principles as those successfully applied in the area in the



- 32 -
past. The only risks would be that, in view of the many ongoing activities,
project execution might be slightly delayed or that, with more rapid inflation,
costs might be higher than estimated.
8.04       Sensitivity tests for the proposed project are summarized below
and show a range of 14% to 18% for the economic rate of return; in view of
the above, the critical parameters are (2), (3) and (6).
ERR %
(1)  Expected                                 17.9
(2) Investment costs 10% higher, crop
yields 10% lower                      14.5
(3)  Costs 10% higher                         16.3
(4)  Costs 10% lower                          19.7
(5)  Crop yields 10% lower                    16.1
(6)  Benefits delayed by one year             15.5
8.05       Sensitivity tests for the combined Sinaloa I Irrigation project
and the Rio Fuerte/Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project have shown, that a one
year delay in project execution would reduce the rate of return from 13.4% to
11.9% and a 10% increase of overall costs would reduce it to 12.1%. A 10%
decrease in benefits would result in a rate of return of 12%.

IX. RECODNiENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations agreement was reached that Government would:
(a)  provide credit for ejidos and private farmers for on-farm drainage
as required (para 4.08);
(b)  follow procurement procedures outlined in paras 4.16 to 4.19;
(c)  (i) maintain or cause to be maintained separate accounts adequate
to reflect in accordance with constantly maintairLed sound accounting
practices the resources and expenditures in respect of the project
of the departments or agencies of the Government responsible for
carrying out the project or any part thereof, (ii) annually furnish
to the Bank a summary statement of such accounts, and (iii) furnish
to the Bank such other peritinent information conc:erning such
accounts as the Bank shall reasonably request from time to time
(para 4.21); and
(d)  (i)  recover full operaton and maintenance costs of irrigation and
drainage works provided under the project; (ii) carry out socio-
economic studies in the Fuerte/Sinaloa project areas to determine
the farmers ability to pay for investment costs; (iii) not later
than December 31, 1984, submit this study together with a proposal
to recover investment costs; and (iv) review the study periodically
with the view to revising such charges if appropriate (para 7.05).
9.02      With the agreements above the proposed project would be suitable
for Bank :Loan of US$92 million on standard terms and conditions.

a/  This model assumed a before development situation Ìn which all of the land js in
production and in which present yields are average for those areas in the El Carrizo,
Rio Fuerte and Rio Sinaloa Districts which are not affected adversely by poor
drainage and salt accumulation aud for which the supply of irrigation water js generally
adequate.  The FRR is 23%.  No models are presented to reflect those present situations
in which (i) the lands are affected by salination or poor drainage and from which
production is only about 35% of the non-affected areas; or (ii) the laude are not yet in
production due to no irrigation. The majority of farmers in these latter two situations
own 10 ha or less aud it can be safely assumed that the FRR on their investrents will be even
higher than that for the above.
