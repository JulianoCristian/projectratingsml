                   (i.e., investors and lenders) by covering only those

                   risks that the market cannot bear.              For partial

                   credit     guarantees,       this      generally   means

                   guaranteeing the later maturities (in the case of a

                   bond, this means covering repayment at maturity).

                   The extent of risk sharing for a bond issue backed

                   by the Bank's partial credit guarantee can be

                   measured by taking the present value of the

                   bond's cash flows and tends to be a reflection of

                   the market's perception of the creditworthiness of

                   issue, the present value of the Bank's put option
