          will provide for the balanced and integrated development of\n            telecommunication facilities for urban and rural areas. The\n            main objectives of the project are to: (a) formulate and\n            implement reforms to improve the overall policy framework\n            for the commercialization of the telecommunications sector\n            and TCC (Jordan Telecommunications Corporation); (b) expand\n            network capacity, improve service quality, increase\n            geographic coverage and introduce new value-added services;\n            (c) strengthen TCC's capacity to develop and implement\n            competitive strategies for procurement, financing and system\n            planning; (d) help the Government and TCC to revise\n            telecommunications pricing policy and tariffs to reflect\n            changes in cost structure and market demand; and (e) support\n            TCC in conducting a review of its organizational structure.\n            The project, which covers TCC's entire revised 1988-92\n            telecommunications investment program, comprises consultancy\n            services, switching equipment, local networks, additional\n            microwave and cable transmission links, a new switching\n            center, a new satellite earth station, computer systems, and\n            ongoing works still to be completed.
