This note analyzes the respective project\n            guarantees, and discusses each project financing, indicating\n            the maturity and pricing obtained with the support of the\n            Bank's guarantee program are, for both issues,\n            significantly better than those which could be achieved\n            without the Bank's support. Putting the NPC and TCC\n            issues into a global capital market context, developing\n            country borrowers took advantage of historically-low\n            interest rates and launched a record number of bonds in 1992-1993."}, "docdt": "1995-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
