LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Sultanate of Oman.
Amount:             US$15 million equivalent.
Terms:              Interest rate of 8.20 percent per annum.
Fifteen years amortization including three years grace.
Proiect
Description:       In accord with the Government's intentions to protect
its heavy concentration of highway investments in recent
years and sustain an efficient national transport network
to serve the present and forecast transport demand, the
project would assist the RD to establish effective and
efficient routine highway maintenance procedures. The
Government recognizes the significant shortage at all
staff levels of suitable trained Omani nationals to
participate in the highway maintenance effort. An
important project objective would be to help overcome
this shortage by both a specific training program and
on-job training. The major components are:
Hifthway Maintenance
i. maintenance equipment and spares;
ii. workshop construction;
iii. workshop equipment and spares;
iv. fuels, oils and lubricants;
v. soils laboratory, survey and communications
equipment and highway supplies.
Training
i. construction and equipment of classrooms;
ii.  overseas and lotal training.
Technical Assistance
i. consultants for maintenance management and
training;
ii. consultants for administrative, planning and
operational support to the Roads Department.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help finance
a highway maintenance project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, in-
cluding 3 years of grace, with interest at 8.20 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Oman" dated February 10, 1976 was distributed to the Executive Directors on
February 17, 1976. An economic mission visited Oman in November/December 1976
and is preparing its report. Its main findings are summarized below. Country
data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The Sultanate of Oman occupies most of the southern corner of the
Arabian Peninsula covering an area officially estimated at 300,000 square
kilometers. Since no reliable population census has been taken in Oman,
little is yet known of the size, characteristics or the detailed geographical
distribution of its population. Under these circumstances, estimates of total
population for 1975 range from 750,000 (based on the UN estimate for 1974) to
the Government's official estimate, adopted for planning purposes, of 1.5
million.
4.        Oil dominates the economy.   Deposits of limestone and natural gas
are known to exist in commercially exploitable quantities, but they have not
yet been exploited. Deposits of copper, iron, coal and asbestos are also
known to exist, but their value remains to be established. The only other
natural resource which is currently being tapped in commercial quantities is
fisheries. Due to scarce water resources, the total area under cultivation
is limited to 36,000 ha, which is less than 0.2 percent of the total area of
the country, although nearly 60 percent of the Omanis live in rural areas.
Recent Developments
5.        When Sultan Qaboos took power from his father in mid-1970, he
initiated a series of political and social reforms to transform a medieval
society into a modern one, with the principal aim of boosting economic
development as rapidly as possible. As part of this process, he undertook
a major government reorganization, which resulted in significant power being
delegated to individual ministers and the creation of three high-level coun-
cils to control and coordinate development activities and expenditures.
However, Oman continues to suffer from a serious shortage of trained Omani
manpower at both a managerial and worker level; it is thus heavily dependent,
and for the foreseeable future will continue to be dependent, on expensive
expatriate services in almost all fields.



- 2 -
6.        The decade-old guerrilla movement in the southern province of
Dhofar, known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, gave rise to
heavy defense expenditures. Following a major offensive launched in late
1975, guerrilla activities seem to have been substantially crushed, if not
stopped, but the process of consolidation in Dhofar has not allowed such
expenditures to decrease since then.
7.        Prior to the commercial exploitation of oil, Oman's economy existed
at a subsistence level, based entirely on agriculture, fishing and some minor
handicraft activities. Output probably merely kept pace with the growth of
the population. Since 1967, with the emergence of oil as a major export,
Oman's economy witnessed a period of significant growth as well as structural
change. Real GDP is roughly estimated to have increased between 4-6 percent
annually between 1967 and 1973, about 40 percent from 1973 to 1974, and 20
percent from 1974 to 1975; a much smaller growth rate is expected in 1976.
The growth of oil revenues provided the basis for this exceptionally rapid
growth, including public expenditures for development. This, in turn, is
reflected in the expansion of construction, public administration and trade.
The share of the oil sector in GDP rose from an estimated 30 percent in 1967
to over 67 percent in 1970 and thereafter; the share of construction, almost
negligible prior to 1967, grew to 10 percent of GDP in 1970, and subsequently
leveled off in the 10-16 percent range. Public administration expenditure
has continued to increase in importance, from 2 percent in 1967 to 7 percent
in 1975. The agriculture sector stagnated and accounted for only 2 percent
of GDP in 1975, in contrast to 37 percent in 1967.
8.        Using the 1974 UN population estimate of 750,000, the per capita
GNP is estimated at $1,980 in 1975, based on the Bank's Atlas methodology.
However, based on the current official Government estimate of 1.5 million
people, the per capita GNP would be half that figure. Both figures are mis-
leading as a measure of the income and living standards of the average Omani.
A high proportion of the income generated in oil, industry, construction,
transport and commerce accrues to the foreigners who undertake those activi-
ties, although the Government receives most oil revenues. Taking this into
account, the average per capita income of an Omani is roughly estimated at
around $485 in 1975; but even this does not reveal the true picture of the
poverty and backwardness of the bulk of the population. While the average
per capita income of Omanis in major urban centers (who make up 25 percent of
the total population) is estimated at about $1,250, most of the rural popula-
tion (which accounts for approximately 60 percent of the total population, the
remaining 15 percent being expatriates), has an average per capita income of
less than $200 per year, even including transfer incomes from families working
in urban centers and neighboring countries.
9.        Oil revenues account for almost all government revenues and foreign
exchange earnings. There are two views as to Oman's oil reserves. One, which
seems more realistic on the basis of available data, estimates Oman's estab-
lished oil reserves at only 1.1 billion barrels as of January 1975, which is
equivalent to 9 years production at the 1975 production rate (125 million bar-
rels). The other, less plausible, estimate is 3 billion barrels, which would



extend the 1975 level of production up to 24 years. Oman is not a member of
OPEC but follows most OPEC decisions. The only company so far producing and
exporting oil is Petroleum Development (Oman) Limited (PDO), in which the
Government acquired a 60 percent share in 1974. While extensive exploration,
both on and offshore, is underway by foreign companies, only two new fields
with very limited reserves have so far been found in Dhofar and in the Straits
of Hormuz (offshore) near the Musandam Peninsula. Production from these fields
will require substantial investments, and hence the companies involved have not
yet decided whether to invest the required amounts. The costs of production
from these new fields will be considerably higher than that of other oil
produced in Oman and in neighboring Gulf countries. Even if these new fields
are exploited in the medium-term future, the total volume of oil production
will continue to decline for some time from the peak level (135 million bar-
rels) reached in 1976, mainly due to technical problems at the existing oil
wells.
10.       The relatively high level of oil income has enabled the Government
to sustain high levels of expenditure in the post-1970 period, when the Gov-
ernment launched major investment projects aimed at providing the minimum
.amount of economic and social infrastructure, as well as a substantially
increased defense effort to combat the guerrilla operations in Dhofar. Gross
capital formation increased from 18 to 37 percent of GNP between 1970 and 1975
while the proportion of defense expenditures in GNP grew from 15 to 39 percent
over the same period. With the concomitant growth of recurrent expenditure
for the maintenance of social infrastructure, the ratio of national savings to
gross national product declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1975,
thus requiring external resources to finance part of the capital formation.
Over the same period, the ratio of public to total investment increased from
around 22 to 78 percent. Most of the private investment has remained in the
oil sector.
11.       The higher levels of public expenditures since 1970 brought about
a marked deterioration in the fiscal situation. The budget, which showed a
surplus of OR 25 million in 1970, registered deficits of about OR 18 million
in 1972, OR 65 million in 1974, and OR 43 million in 1975. The deterioration
took place despite continued increases in revenues resulting from successive
upward revisions of oil prices (more or less in line with OPEC prices), as
well as of the Government's share of income taxes and royalties and its income
from its shares in PDO. While the Government's total revenue increased from
OR 45 million in 1970 to OR 459 million in 1975, development expenditures
also increased from an estimated OR 2 million to OR 173 million in that
period. The overall budgetary deficits since 1972 were financed partly by
short-term borrowing from banks at home and abroad, and partly by drawing
down Government reserves, as well as by loans and grants from neighboring
governments.
12.       The increased level of economic activity brought about a substantial
increase in the money supply, which grew from OR 7.6 million in 1970 to an
estimated OR 94 million in 1976, an average annual increase of 54 percent.
With an expanded money supply and the economy's limited production capacity
together with the limited import capacity due to severe port congestion,



-4-
inflationary pressures were exerted on prices, particularly during 1974 and
1975. In 1976 however, due to declining growth of both Government expenditure
and money supply, as well as increased imports following improvements in
port facilities, inflationary pressures seem to have lightened significantly,
although no reliable domestic price data are available.
13.       Since the private sector plays only a minor role in the economy and
all goods and services are imported under liberal trade and exchange regimes,
Oman's balance of payments closely reflects developments in the public sector.
Like the budget, the balance of payments has registered deficits since 1972.
Due to increased Government spending, imports of goods and services increased
by 88 percent per year in current prices during 1970-75, and reached OR 360
million in 1975, resulting in commensurate increases in current account
deficits, even though oil exports rose sharply from OR 44 million in 1970 to
OR 373 million in 1975. Non-oil exports amounted to less than OR 1 million
annually in recent years. Increased imports of services reflected Oman's
increasing reliance on expatriate labor and foreign construction companies.
Compared to a surplus of OR 28 million in 1970 the current account balance
registered a deficit of OR 25 million in 1972 and increased to OR 116 million
in 1975. However, a smaller deficit is projected for 1976, mainly due to
stabilized commodity imports accompanied by an increase in oil exports by
about OR 100 million.
14.       These current account deficits were financed partly by grants, mainly
from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and partly by external commercial
loans. Private foreign capital investment appears to have contributed little
to financing these deficits, mainly because of Oman's unfavorable resource
endowment, including a small domestic market and a shortage of trained man-
power, rather than to inadequate incentives. Use of accumulated foreign ex-
change reserves was necessary in every year since 1972, to fill the gap in the
current account. Thus, Oman's net reserves fell from OR 82 million at the end
of 1970 to OR 33 million at the end of 1975, and declined further to OR 8 mil-
lion by the end of September, 1976, representing approximately one month of
commodity imports.
15.       Oman had no foreign debts outstanding until 1972.    Since then, it
has acquired sizeable debts. They totalled OR 78 million (outstanding
and disbursed) as of December 1975. The structure of Oman's officially re-
ported external debts is heavily biased toward commercial loans. Some 20 per-
cent of outstanding debt was in supliers' credits, 60 percent in commercial
bank credits, and the remainder in governments' and Bank loans. Thus, most
of the debt has medium-term maturities of 3-7 years, and interest rates of
6-9 percent. Debt service payments on existing loans amounted to OR 13
million in 1975, about 3.5 percent of Oman's export earnings. These debt
service payments were stable for 1975, but are projected to rise slightly
in 1976 with a similar debt service ratio.
The Five-Year Plan and Prospects of the Economy
16.       One of the striking features of the Plan, which was prepared under
a Technical Assistance Project which the Bank helped to finance in 1974, is



- 5 -
a sharp decline in the volume of public investment by about 20 percent per
annum between 1976-80, directly reflecting the prospect of falling oil revenues.
The Plan also projects a 3 percent per annum increase in GNP (1.5 percent in
GDP), despite a decrease in the value added in the oil sector by 2 percent per
annum.  While construction is expected to decline by 11 percent per annum,
mainly due to declining Government development expenditures, agriculture and
manufacturing are projected to increase by 14 percent and 70 percent per annum
respectively. The Plan also projects a sharp decline in the share of economic
and social infrastructure investments in overall public investment: from 84
percent in 1976 to 60 percent in 1980. In the context of declining oil reve-
nues, it is important that in the next few years Oman's investment be con-
centrated in directly productive sectors, including fisheries. The Plan
therefore envisages investments in such projects as cement manufacture, a gas
pipeline, oil refining, fisheries development, a flour mill, and sponge iron
production.
17.       Most of the macro targets of the Plan were projected on the basis
of fairly rudimentary assumptions, and the projects, apart from a few major
ones, are mere concepts not yet supported by feasibility studies. The
economic growth targets, therefore, will probably be difficult to achieve.
The situation both in the presently exploited oil fields, and with regard to
new exploration activites, suggests that oil production will decline at a
somewhat faster rate than envisaged in the Plan. Similarly, slower growth
is expected in agriculture and manufacturing. Targets in manufacturing also
seem high and are unlikely to be achieved, due to delays in major public and
private projects and perhaps over-optimistic targets for private investment.
18.       With this background, GDP is at best likely to stagnate over the
Plan period, 1976-80. "Omanization" of the existing labor force will probably
not progress as fast as the Plan forecasts, due to limited training and other
educational shortcomings. The Plan also envisages a sharp decline in loans
and grants from OR 155 million in 1976 to OR 19 million in 1980 (in constant
prices), based mainly on the assumption that military expenditures will fall.
If they do not decline as fast as expected in the Plan, or if recurrent ex-
penditures grow faster than projected because of the operating and maintenance
costs associated with the large investment program in recent years, external
assistance requiremments are likely to be substantially higher than projected;
part of these requirements may continue to come as grants from neighboring
Arab countries. However, given its present low debt service ratio of 3.5
percent, Oman has the capacity to service conventional debt at much higher
levels of borrowing than projected in the Plan, and remains creditworthy for
Bank financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN OMAN
19.       The Bank has made only two loans totalling $8.4 million to Oman,
both in FY74. The details are provided in Annex II. The education project,
for which a loan of $5.7 million was made in April 1974, was part of an
integrated program of assistance by the Bank, UNDP and the United Kingdom.



- 6 -
Bank funds are financing two basic education and skill training centers, a
primary teacher training institute and an agricultural secondary school; the
United Kingdom and UNDP/UNESCO are financing technical assistance and overseas
fellowships.
20.       The second Bank loan, made in May 1974, provided $2.7 million for
a Technical Assistance Project to help finance three specialist teams for (i)
economic planning and management, (ii) agriculture and fisheries, and (iii)
transport. The work of these teams has been of considerable value to the
Government. The leader of the economic team and his colleagues were largely
responsible for the content of the country's first Five-Year Development Plan,
published in mid-1976. The team continues to play a central role in the
economic management of the country. It not only introduced an awareness of
the financial constraints likely to be faced, but shaped most of the budgetary
and fiscal procedures being followed by the Government. The transport team
has provided valuable advice to the Ministry of Communications in all areas
of road transport and development, and did feasibility studies which formed
the basis of the proposed highway maintenance project. The agriculture team,
after a slow start, is now helping the Government to identify and prepare a
.future project in rural development for Bank financing, and has provided
agricultural research data to the Government.
21.       These two projects, as well as likely future projects in fields such
as education, non-oil industrial development (cement), fisheries, telecommuni-
cations, rural development, and development finance companies, are designed to
help Oman to develop despite the following serious constraints it faces: the
acute shortage of trained manpower; the absence of a non-oil productive re-
source base; and the lack of an institutional framework within which economic
development benefitting all Omanis can be approached on the basis of economic
priorities, technical feasibility and least-cost solutions. The Government is
becoming increasingly aware of the need for selective development, made all
the more imperative by the prospect of declining oil revenues in the early
1980s; an example of this was its recent request to the Bank to organize and
monitor studies to determine short and long-term priority power and urban
water needs in the country, and how these can be met on a least cost basis.
A Bank loan of $1.5 million to finance these studies is being proposed.
22.       IFC has made no investments in Oman, but has expressed an interest
in helping to finance industrial development in the private sector. Oman has
purchased almost $40 million of Bank bonds, of which $30 million consisted of
15-year bonds purchased in 1974.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
23.       Until 1970 there was no transport system as such in Oman.    The
road network consisted of only 10 km of paved roadway and an unknown length
of earthen tracks; there was no railway, no internal water-borne and little
sea-borne domestic traffic and very limited air communication. Now, the
country's basic transport system includes an extensive and rapidly growing
road network of about 1,000 km of asphalted roads and perhaps six times that



- 7 -
length in graded but unpaved roads, one modern deep-water port and another one
under construction, an oil port, an international airport and several civilian
and military airstrips.
Highways
24.       The national road network is under the jurisdiction of the Roads
Department (RD) within the Ministry of Communications. It includes 1,287
km of paved roads, completed or under construction; 2,564 km of maintained
earth roads; and 714 km of tracks which only 4-wheel drive vehicles can
negotiate. In addition, there are 952 km of well maintained gravel roads
belonging to the Ministry of Defense, and 908 km of Ministry of Communica-
tions tracks which will be handed over to the RD in January 1978.
25.       The RD is a well conceived organization, but because it was only
established in 1972, it is very short of trained staff at all levels. The
transport team, provided under the Bank's Technical Assistance Project (para
20), provides much of the technical and administrative input for the RD,
together with other consultants and expatriate staff hired directly by the
Ministry of Communications. One of the objectives of the training component
of the proposed loan is to help upgrade the technical and managerial skills
of Omanis in the RD.
26.       Highway planning, design, construction, and maintenance are largely
carried out by expatriate staff, consultants, and foreign contractors. To the
extent that they are available, Omani nationals are assigned as counterparts
to the foreign experts, but there are not enough to fill all the counterpart
positions.
27.       Highway expenditures are financed from the general budget, and for-
eign sources when available. Direct and indirect taxes on road users are in
the form of taxation on vehicles, spare parts, tires and petroleum products.
However, these taxes consist of only a 2 percent tax on the c.i.f. value of
imports, a circulation tax based on the weight of the vehicle, and a modest
fuel tax. These taxes are not earmarked for highway expenditure but go into
the general fund. Investment in highway infrastructure was the equivalent
of about US$95 million in 1975, and recurrent expenditures in 1976 were almost
the equivalent of US$4.3 million.
28.       Traffic data in Oman is sketchy, but over the past two years there
has clearly been a very high rate of growth. Increases of well over 100 per-
cent have been recorded on some main roads. The vehicle fleet has grown
from 1,000 in 1970 to over 31,000 at the end of 1975. There is virtually
no Government regulation of transportation (although police enforcement of
traffic rules in the major towns is very strict), and there is considerable
competition between small operators. There are no axle load limits, but
a study will be initiated shortly under the existing Technical Assistance
Project (para 37).
Ports, Civil Aviation, and Railways
29.       Oman has a number of natural harbors, including the historically
important small port at Muscat. The completion of Port Qaboos in 1975, very
close to the capital city of Muscat, provided the country with a modern



- 8 -
deep-water port with a capacity of 1.5 million tons of cargo per year. The
port has eleven berths, ten transit sheds, a cement silo, fish canning and
general deep-freezing facilities, and will soon have a grain silo. A nearby
oil port serves as the export terminus for Oman's oil. In the southern town
of Salalah, the present port is being expanded to handle one million tons a
year, which will entail substantial excess capacity for some time to come.
There are also several natural coastal harbors for dhow traffic.
30.       Civil air transport is still in an early stage of development.
The mostly hot, dry climate and subsoils with good bearing capacities allow
for numerous natural landing places for light aircraft, and rudimentary
airstrips exist in many parts of the country. Regular domestic service is
limited to flights between Muscat, the capital, and Salalah in the south.
Seeb International Airport, 32 km west of Muscat, opened in late 1972 and can
handle the largest commercial airplanes, although some expansion of the repair
and hangar facilities will be needed soon.
31.       There are no railways in Oman, and none are planned or necessary.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
32.       Because of the very recent expansion of Oman's paved and gravel
highway network to connect all the major areas of the country, additional
highway construction ic not of high priority in the next few years. The
preservation of these recent heavy investments in road construction through
adequate maintenance, however, has high economic priority. The proposed
project was prepared by consultants provided under the Bank's Technical Assis-
tance Project (Loan No. 985-OM), in close collaboration with the Roads Depart-
ment. It was appraised in January 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington
in April 1977. The Omani delegation was headed by Mr. Abdullah Bakatheer,
Director General, Ministry of Communications.
Description of the Project
33.       The proposed project covers the first three years (1978-80) of a
five-year routine highway maintenance program, together with related training,
and technical assistance. The project includes: (i) the purchase of highway
maintenance equipment and spares; (ii) the construction of six highway work-
shops and one training center; (iii) equipment and spares for these workshops
and one existing one; (iv) fuel, oil and lubricants for the highway maintenance
program; (v) soils laboratory, survey and communications equipment and highway
supplies; (vi) technical assistance to the RD to establish and manage the
routine highway maintenance program over the three-year period 1978-80; (vii)
a three-year, all-level staff training program for Omani highway maintenance
personnel; and (viii) general technical assistance to the RD following the
completion of the present program under Loan 985-OM. The project's details
are provided in the report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Maintenance Proj-
ect, Oman" No. 1508-OM dated May 1977, which is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors, and in a Loan and Project Summary.

34.       The Highway Maintenance Program.   Under the current Technical Assis-
tance Loan, transport consultants to the RD prepared a five-year routine and
periodic maintenance program for the highway network. The Government has
approved this overall program in principle, and the detailed scope of the
program has been discussed with the Bank. The project to be financed by the
proposed loan relates specifically to the first three year time slice of the
routine (excluding the periodic) maintenance program. Because the paved road
network is new and of high design standard, periodic maintenance requirements
(rehabilitation, resealing, pavement reinforcement) are not likely to occur
frequently within the next five years; if and when necessary, this work will
be done by contractors.
35.       For highway maintenance purposes, the country has been divided
into seven regions. In each region, a maintenance workshop would be operated
to service and repair equipment (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05). Major repairs,
such as engine overhauls, would be carried out at two major workshops near the
capital, Muscat, and in the south at Salalah.
36.       Under the routine maintenance program, specialized force account
units in each of seven maintenance regions would regularly replenish gravel
and reshape earth road surfaces, carry out minor patching of asphalt surfaces,
and maintain shoulders, drainage, side slopes, signs and markings. A list
of equipment and machinery to be procured under this program has been pro-
visionally identified and discussed with the Bank; it is subject to a later
review of requirements by maintenance consultants as organized highway
maintenance gets under way.
37.       To help preserve the existing pavement and not jeopardize the work
to be performed under the maintenance program, an axle loading study will be
carried out by consultants under the ongoing Technical Assistance Project.
The Government has agreed that the legal limits with respect to the dimensions
and axle loads of vehicles will be observed and enforced (Loan Agreement, Sec-
tion 4.03).
38.       Technical Assistance:   Under the proposed project two forms of tech-
nical assistance will be provided. Firstly, about 200 man-months of maintenance
management consultants services will be provided to establish and manage the
routine maintenance program according to agreed terms of reference. These
consultants would also be responsible for the training program, and for the
establishment and performance of cost accounting procedures to monitor and
control the costs of different highway maintenance operations (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.02).
39.       Secondly, about 100 man-months of consultants' services have been
included in the project for general administrative, planning and operational
support to the RD, including the continuation of highway and traffic data
collection. Terms of reference for these services have also been agreed
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). As explained earlier, this kind of technical
assistance is already being provided under the ongoing Bank Technical Assis-
tance Project, and has been very valuable to the RD. The Government has
therefore requested that similar services be included in this project.



- 10 -
Man-month rates for consultants average $7,000 including all overheads, air
transportation and escalation.
40.       Training:  The lack of trained manpower at all levels of economic
activity is perhaps the single most pressing problem faced by the country.
The RD is no exception, with many of its authorized positions vacant, and many
others occupied by partly qualified personnel.
41.       To strengthen the RD's capability to administer, control and
undertake highway maintenance work, the proposed project includes a compre-
hensive training program for all staff levels in a training center to be
constructed as part of the project, and in field units for on-the-job
training. This will supplement training in engineering trades provided
at an existing vocational training center, where some courses relevant to
highway maintenance are given. Initially, the program would concentrate
on upgrading those semi-skilled nationals already working for the RD,
and eventually it would enable unskilled Omanis to be trained for work
in the maintenance program.
42.       A training center would be constructed at the headquarters region
in Azaiba, near Muscat, where existing RD staff and new recruits would receive
six to eight weeks of training before being assigned to regional workshops or
Training Production Units for further on-the-job training. Senior staff would
receive overseas training in maintenance program management. Agreement has
been reached that sufficient numbers of Omanis would be made available for
training and that details of the senior staff training program would be sub-
mitted to the Bank for prior approval (Loan Agreement, Section 3.07). A
comprehensive training policy would be promulgated by the Government and a
training unit would be established in the RD to supervise the training program
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.06). It is expected that each Training Production
Unit will be able to train not less than 200 personnel per year, consisting of
overseers, equipment operators, truck drivers and mechanics.
Project Cost and Financing
43.       A detailed breakdown of the cost of the proposed project is given
in Annex III. The total cost of the three-year routine maintenance program,
with related training and technical assistance, is estimated at the equiva-
lent of $47.1 million (including contingencies). The foreign exchange cost
is estimated at about $22.9 million. The proposed Bank loan of $15 million
would therefore cover 66 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 32 percent
of the total cost, with the balance to be provided either by the Government
from its own resources, or to be arranged from other foreign sources. The
Government would provide the local cost equivalent of $24.2 million from the
general budget. The Government will also finance the total costs of the
last two years of the five-year routine maintenance program (Loan Agreement,
Section 4.04).
Project Implementation
44.       The RD will have overall responsibility for the execution and
implementation of the maintenance and training programs, with the assistance
of consultants.



Procurement and Disbursement
45.       The highway maintenance equipment and spares would be procured
after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines. Contracts for the construction of maintenance workshop buildings and
classrooms would be procured after local competitive bidding. The presence of
a large number of foreign and local contractors in Oman would assure adequate
competition. The purchase of small items of training equipment would follow
the normal procedures of the Government, which are satisfactory.
46.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the foreign exchange
costs of imported equipment and spares; 80 percent of the total costs of
workshop construction and training equipment; the foreign exchange costs of
consultants; and the foreign exchange costs of overseas fellowships.
Economic Justification
47.       The standard of maintenance on unpaved roads now under the jurisdic-
tion of the RD is poor, and no efficient organization exists to adequately
maintain the paved network. The proposed project would protect the sub-
stantial investment in highways and would improve Omani highway maintenance
capabilities to match the increasing demands of growing traffic on an expand-
ing highway network.
48.       The economic benefits of the project would accrue directly to (i)
the country, which would preserve its investment and ultimately lower its
maintenance costs as Omani nationals are trained to take the place of expa-
triates; (ii) the trucking industry through reduced vehicle operating costs
which would be passed down to consumers because the trucking industry is
currently freely competitive; and (iii) the wide range of income groups
who use highway passenger transport.
49.       The only quantifiable element in the project is the routine main-
tenance program, which represents 90 percent of the project costs. The
economic rate of return for the program was obtained by comparing the economic
costs with the economic benefits resulting from savings in operating costs,
using six surface and Average Daily Traffic categories and calculating a
single, composite vehicle operating cost from the weighted average of the
traffic composition observed in traffic surveys. These calculations showed
Benefit/Cost ratios of 6.2 and 5.8 when allowing both 15 percent and 20 per-
cent, respectively, as the opportunity cost of capital in Oman. On the
basis of savings in highway user costs the maintenance component of the
project shows an overall economic rate of return of over 100 percent.
50.       Project risks are associated mainly with whether a sufficient number
of Omanis would be made available for training under the proposed project
to take over, in due course, the highway maintenance functions currently being
carried out by expatriates.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
