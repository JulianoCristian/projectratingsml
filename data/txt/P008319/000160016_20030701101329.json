The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory. The project was one of the first\n            investment operations for the Bank in Bulgaria. The broad\n            sector reform objectives of the project allowed\n            institutional reforms to take place and made an impact in\n            the water and wastewater and the district heating sectors as\n            described earlier. However, there may have been some\n            optimism in the pace of reform that could take place. 1)\n            Investment projects should be designed in line with the\n            macro-economic conditions in the country. The primary delay\n            in the early stages of the project was due to the fact that\n            the regional water companies (RWCs) could not afford to take\n            on the sub-loans when tariffs were low and prospects of\n            increasing them fast were not high. This was further\n            complicated by the fact that the Bulgarian leva was not\n            stable against the US Dollar, prior to the Currency Board\n            being established, and the on-lending interest was high. 2)\n            Projects should be simple, have limited objectives, and\n            success should be defined during preparation. For example,\n            if there were less objectives under the water component,\n            project implementation would be more focused. For the\n            future, projects with limited objectives and possibility of\n            a repeat operation by the Bank should be considered. 3)\n            Decentralization should be linked to fiscal and\n            administrative autonomy. the transfer of shares to the\n            municipality should have been linked to greater fiscal and\n            administrative autonomy at the local level. Under the\n            project, the municipalities owned part of the assets but did\n            not have the ability to take independent decisions about\n            raising tariffs or taxes and operations of the RWCs."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
