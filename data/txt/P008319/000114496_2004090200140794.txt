Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Water Companies Restructuring and Modernization 
Project) dated June 29, 1995, between the Republic of Bulgaria (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the request made

Regional Water and Sewerage Companies.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank accedes to your request.  
Accordingly, Section 3.04 (b) of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to read:
"By December 31, 1996, the Borrower shall complete the said restructuring 
of all RWCs 
servicing regions controlled by local authorities that accepted 
the Borrower's offer 
to become shareholders of the relevant RWCs."
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing, dating

Very truly yours,
