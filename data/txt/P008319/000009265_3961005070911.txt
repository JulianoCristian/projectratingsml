MEMORA1NDUHJ AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
FOR A WATER COMPANIES RESTRUCTURING AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommenoation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Bulgaria for the
equivalent of US$98 million to help finance a Water Companies Restructuring
and Modernization Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen years, including four years of
grace.
2.        Country/Sector Back2round.  Bulgaria is a lower-middle income
country with a population of about 8.5 million in 1992. Following the
collapse of the communist system in 1989, economic pe;formance deteriorated
rapidly. In 1991, a radical economic reform program was initiated by the
Government, supported by the World Bank and the IMF. Since then, Bulqaria has
been implementing reforms whose aim is to reduce macroeconomic imbalances and
to transform the economy from a centrally-planned system to a market-based
one. The Government's primary focus is to accelerate privatization, adopt an
adequate social safety net for low income groups, and renegotiate the external
debt to restore creditworthiness. The Government also seeks to facilitate
private investment by establishing a credible legal framework, restoring
business confidence, eliminating excessive regulatory burdens, and removing
infrastructure bottlenecks.
3.        Water is a relatively scarce resource in Bulgaria with a per-capita
endowment less than half the European average. One-third of the country faces
permanent or seasonal water shortages. About 98% of the population is
connected to the water supply network, but only 18% are connected to sewers.
only one-third of water and sewer systems have wastewater treatment.
4.        The Ministry of Regional Development and Construction (MRD) plays a
key policy and operational role in the water and sanitation sector. Under its
authority are the main sector engineering and construction enterprises along
with 29 regional water and sewerage companies (RWCs) providing services to 85%
of the population. In addition, 14 municipal companies were created and
transferred to local authorities in 1991.
5.        Key problems facing RWCs are: (i) lack of accountabil'ty to
customers and of incentives for efficiency, which is partly attributable to
decision making being centralized at the Government level; (ii) low operating
efficiency and cost recovery, with water losses estimated at a high 40%, and
tariffs barely covering operating costs; (iii) staff lacking access to
training; (iv) lack of access to capital needed to complete water and sewerage
investments, some which were started many years ago, and to upgrade and
rehabilitate networks and facilities; and (v) lack of experience in planning
and implementing investments. These shortcomings in sector policies and
priorities have resulted in overdesign of facilities and inefficient provision



- 2 -
of services. In addition, dependence on annual budgetary allocations has
resulted in long and uncertain construction periods, cost escalatior., and a
huge investment backlog.
6.        A number of important sector reforms have been adopted recently.
First, the National council on Water was establishee in 1991 to improve water
resources management. Second, the State engineering, construction and water
and sewerage companies were transformed irto "Sole Proprietorship Limited
Liability Companies" under tne new Commercial Trade Act and all operatinq
subsidies were eliminated. Third, the de-monopolization of engineering and
construction activities and the shedding of excess staff were initiated as a
prelude to eventual privatization. Fourth, new managers were competitively
recruited for the RWCs, new accounting standards were adopted and water and
sewerage companies were authorized to set their own tariffs based on MRD
guidelines.
7.        Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement.  As there is no previous
Bank experience in the sector in Bulgaria, the Project reflects Bank
experience in the water and sanitation sector worldwide, as reflected in OED
reports, which indicate the need to develop managerially and financially
autonomous water and seweraae utilities so as to promote efficiency.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country's assistance
strategy (CAS) for Bulgaria, discussed by the Board on March 9, 1993, aims at
supporting the Government's structural adjustment and macrseconomic
stabilization, as well as providing investment financing aimed, Inter-alia, at
assuring adequate infrastructure for economic growth. Improving the
environment is also an important objective of the CAS. The proposed project
contributes to achieve the objectives of the CAS by providing a vehicle
through which to pursue a broad sector dialogue and establish the basis for
Bank medium-term support to the sector. Bank involvement encourages the
adoption of a coherent framework for the sector based on principles of
commercial viability, demand orientation, and sustainability. In the absence
of Bank involvement, it is unlikely that the country would be able to mobilize
the technical assistance and financial resources needed to simultaneously
restructure the sector and finance priority infrastructure. The Bank's
procurement guidelines will introduce competitive bidding as a means of
stimulating supplier efficiency and transition to a market orientation for the
sector. Finally, the Project meets the Bank's program objective category of
environmentally sustainable development.
9.        Project Objectives.  The Project objectives are to assist the
Government to: (i) increase RWCs' autonomy and commercial orientation and make
their management accountable to local authorities; (ii) improve health and
environmental conditions and conserve water resources; (iii) increase RWCs'
operating efficiency and cost recovery; and (iv) demonstrate the benefits of
introducing transparent and competitive procurement procedures.



- 3 -
10.       Project Description.  The Project comprises two main components:
(i) tha Institutional Strengthening Window (7% of base cost); and (ii) the
Priority Water and Sewerage Investments Window (93% of base cost). The
Institutional Strengthening Window includes RWCs capacity building through
in-country training and provision of technical assistance; carrying out a
study of options for improved management of water resources; strengthening and
providing technical assistance to the Pro4ect Management Unit (PNU) that has
been set up by the MRD; and enhancing RWCs investment -lanning and
construction supervision capabilities. The Priority Water and Sewerage
Investments Window includes, in turn, two components; rehabilitation and
upgrading of water and sewerage facilities (Completion/Rehabilitatiot Window)
and the reduction of non-revenue water (Non-revenue Water Window).
11.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project
(excluding the sunk costs -- US$75 million -- of investments initiated by the
Government in earlier years, which will be completed under the Project) is
estimated at US$131 million net of taxes.  The Bank loan of $98 million would
finance 75% of project costs including 80% of interest and other charges on
the Bank loani amounting to US$5.6 million. The interest and other charges to
be financed by the loan correspond to part of the loan to be on-lent by the
Government to water and sewerage companies. The interest and other charges
(20%) not financed by the loan will be funded by the Government. The
financing of interest and other charges is justified because the RWCs are only
now being established and their cash flow is still limited in relation to
their investment needs. The local counterpart financing of US$33 million will
*be provided by the Government (US$11.4 million) and by water and sewerage
companies (US$21.6 million).
12.       Prolect Implementation.  The MRD is responsible for project
execution on behalf of the Government. To assist in supervising the Project,
the MRD has established the PMU within the National Center for Regional
Development and Housing, a specialized institute under the MRD. The MRD, in
addition to overseeing the PHU, will issue the updated tariff guidelines as
approved by the Council of Ministers; complete the restructuring of the RWCs;
collect and publish performance indicators of the water and sewerage
companies; award and sign consultant contracts under the Institutional
Strengthening Window; sign jointly with water companies contracts with
consultants for construction supervision; and certify that the sub-projects in
the Annual Investment Program meet the eligibility criteria agreed by the Bank
and the Government.
13.       The PMU was established by the MND at the outset of project
preparation and it has gained a great deal of experience that will serve it
well during implementation. The PMU's responsibilities during project
execution, include: (i) organizing the selection process for consultants and
supervising their work; (ii) assisting water and sewerage companies in
preparing sub-projects; (iii) appraising sub-projects and compiling the Annual
Investment Program; (iv) monitoring sub-project implementation; and (v)
reporting to the MRD and the Bank on the status of implementation.



-4-
14.       Water and sewerage companies will have enhanced responsibilities
for sub-project implementation. They will prepare their own investment
proposals including technical, economic, financial, legal and environmental
studies. They will also sign on-lending agreements with the MRC, prepare and
launch tenders for goods, works and services, and negotiate and sign contracts
with suppliers and contractors aftet obtaining the necessary no objections
from the PMU and/or the Bank.
15.       Sustainability.  A long-term strategy has been agreed to ensure
that project benefits are sustainable over time. To gauge progress in
implementing the strategy, a series of objective Sector Engagement Criteria
have been identified. The Sector Engagement Criteria, which will be monitored
by the Bank during supervision, are as follows: i) restructuring RWCs as Ltd.
Companies with municipal shareholders; ii) establishing effective
institutional arrangements and procedures for proposed sector investments
based on objective criteria, channelling resources to those that qualify, and
ensuring water and sewerage companies repay sub-loans; iii) maintaining the
reduced role of MRD in water company operations, while strengthening MRD's
role in collecting and publishing sector performance indicators; iv)
establishing tariff policies to reflect the full cost of services; v)
privatizing State engineering and construction enterprises serving the sector;
vi) inplementing improved institut:onal arrangements for water resources
management; and (vii) improving environmental protection practices.
16.       Azree4 Actions.  There is a convergence of objectives and strategy
between the Government and the Bank and there are no outstanding major policy
issues. As noted in para. 6, important actions have already been taken,
including significant increases in real tariff leveis. At negotiations, the
Government confirmed the timetable for restructuring the RWCs into Limited
Liability Companies witn not less than 49% local ownership, not later than
March 31, 1995. The Government also confirmed its agreement to: (i) on-
lending terms and conditions; ii) revised tariff-setting guidelines which
provide for an adequate contribution to investment and for debt service; (iii)
implement the institutional eligibility criteria for sub-loans under the
Project; (iv) seek the Bank's prior review and approval of the first six sub-
projects under the Priority Water and Sewerage Investments Window; the first
four Institutional Strengthening activities; all sub-projects estimated to
cost US$5 million or more; all sub-projects that involve surface water from
international waters; and all sub-projects that involve potential population
displacements; (v) hire consultants to assist the PMU; (vi) maintain the PMU
adequately staffed; (vii) apply the agreed standard bidding documents; and
(viii) carry out Mid-term and Annual Reviews of project implementation. The
Government also confirmed its agreement with the following conditions of
effectiveness: (i) four RWCs registered as Limited Liability Companies; ii)
issuance of satisfactory tariff-setting guidelines approved by the Council of
Ministers; and (iii) selection of the Implementation Assistance Consultant.
17.       Environmental AsRects.  The project has been classified in
Category B, requiring sub-project environmental analyses consistent with O.D.
4.01. The Project is expected to generate significant environmental benefits
resulting from reduced pressure on the environment because of reduced water
losses and improved sewage treatment facilities. All environmental analyses
for sub-projects will be evaluated by the Ministry of Environment (HOE) in



-5-
line with Bulgaria's Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation, which along
with MOE evaluation capability was found satisfactory by the Bank. The
environmental analyses and their evaluation by MOE will then be submitted to
the Bank for review and approval before individual sub-projects are tendered.
18.       Some sub-projects that could be eligible for funding under the
Project would involve international waterways. However, notification to other
riparians will not be required under the Bank's policy because the Project
will only finance sub-projects that will involve the rehabilitation, upgrading
and completion of existing water and sewerage systems, and will be
complemented by water demand management and loss reduction programs. Thus,
the sub-projects will have no adverse effect on either the quantity or quality
of present and future water flows. To ensure that the proposed sub-projects
satisfy these two conditions, assurances were obtained at negotiations that
the Bank will only approve the financing of sub-projects which will: (i) have
no adverse effect on the quantity of water flows to any other riparian
countries, since they will have to involve no or only marginal increase in
water extraction and will incorporate measures to improve demand management
and lo3s reduction; (ii) have no adverse effect on water quality as they will
involve, where appropriate, completion and/or upgradirg cf existing wastewater
treatment plants which will help to improve the quality of downstream river
water; and (iii) be of such nature as to not be subject to adverse effects
from the uses of water made by other riparians. In addition, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the terms of reference for studies involving
international waterways will include examination of any potential riparian
issues.
19.       No resettlement issues have been identified at present.
Feasibility studies for sub-projects will include a review and identification
of potential population displacements. In such event, sub-borrowers will be
required to comply with the relevant resettlement provisions of the Bank.
20.       Project Benefits.  The project provides benefits in three areas:
(i} direct benefits for consumers of water and sanitation services from the
improved quality of services, cost containment and affordable tariffs; (ii)
macroeconomic benefits in terms of support for the Government's policy of
decentralizing public services, improving public sector management, reducing
budgetary dependence for the sector, stimulating depressed sectors and
providing employment; and (iii) social and environmental benefits arising from
improvements in public health, employment gains, and completion of water and
sewerage investments with positive health or environmental benefits. Eligible
sub-projects should have an economic rate of return not lower than 12%.
21.       Risks.  There are many political risks that could negatively affect
project execution which are not amenable to mitigating measures that can be
built into the Project. Those mitigated through project design include the
following: (i) political factors which may interfere with RWCs' commitment to
raise tariffs.  This is minimized by financing relatively small affordable
investments scattered among a number of water and sewerage companies, and the
up front approval of updated tariff-setting guidelines; (ii) diminishing
political commitment to decentralization. This is unlikely given the
widespread political support for the policy, the fact that all political
parties will benefit from local authorities participation as RWC shareholders,



and restructuring of at least four RWCs is to take place before loan
effectiveness; (iii) the difficulty of establishing a capable PMU. This has
been handled by involving the PMU from the outset of project preparation,
financing implementation assistance, ensuring competitive staff salaries and
preparing a detailed Manual of Procedures; and (iv) lack of counterpart funds
given adjustment-induced budgetary restraint. This risk is zrinimized by
agreeing on appropriately sized Annual Investment Programs, and financing with
the loan proceeas a relatively large percentage of each component, ranging
from 70 to 100%. The proposed Annual and Mid-term Reviews will provide the
Bank with the opportunity to reassese periodically the progress achieved in
meeting the Project objectives and discuss further measures that may bucome
necessary. In addition, intensive Bank supervision with significant
participation from the Resident Mission technical staff is envisaged,
particularly in the early years to ensure that the required reforms are
implemented and that the sub-projects are adequately appraised and supervised
by the PMU.
22.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
