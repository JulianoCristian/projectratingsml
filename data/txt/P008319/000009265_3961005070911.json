The project comprises two major\n            components: (i) the institutional strengthening window; and\n            (ii) the priority water and sewerage investments window. The\n            institutional strengthening window includes: RWCs capacity\n            building through in-country training and provision of\n            technical assistance; carrying out a study of options for\n            improved management of water resources; strengthening and\n            providing technical assistance to the Project Management\n            Unit that has been set up by the Ministry of Regional\n            Development and Construction; and enhancing RWCs investment\n            planning capability and construction supervision. The\n            priority water and sewerage investments window includes,\n            in-turn, two components: the completion and rehabilitation\n            window and the non-revenue water reduction window. The\n            project completion/rehabilitation window will fund\n            completion of ongoing investments that have high rates of\n            return, and rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities. The\n            non-revenue water reduction window will respond to the\n            emerging incentives for water companies to reduce water\n            losses and to improve their operating efficiency."}, "docdt": "1994-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
