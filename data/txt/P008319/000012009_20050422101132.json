Lessons indicate: 1) The timeframe of\n            water sector reforms and sequencing of various steps, should\n            be carefully designed to take full account of their links\n            with economic, legal, and other reforms upon which they\n            depend. The restructuring of Regional Water Companies (RWCs)\n            was linked with the legal issue of asset transfer, delayed\n            because the new water law to cover the ownership of assets\n            had not been enacted. Similarly, decisions on tariffs and\n            other financial matters depend on the autonomy of the\n            entity, and the steps it must take to improve its finances.\n            RWCs are still subject to political pressure, which tends to\n            delay decisions on critical financial issues. 2) The project\n            components should be in line with project objectives, scale\n            of operation, goals, and funding; with defined components\n            and measurable targets. The objectives of this project were\n            rather broad, emphasizing system-wide operational\n            improvements. The project components, on the other hand,\n            were designed to initiate many of the improvements in\n            different zones on a pilot scale with corresponding limited\n            funding. As a result, achievements do not fully meet the set\n            objectives and goals, although they are quite reasonable if\n            compared to the limited scope of activities and respective\n            volume of funding. 3) Simple, straightforward components\n            often produce efficient results. The district heating\n            component is an excellent example of a clear and practical\n            project design. It was well defined, highly relevant, and\n            was implemented through an effective operator within the\n            given period, including with some cost savings."}, "docdt": "2005-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
