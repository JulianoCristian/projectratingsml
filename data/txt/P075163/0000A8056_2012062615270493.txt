                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overall objective of the project is to assist the Government of Romania in reducing the environmental, social, and economic vulnerability to natural disasters and
                         catastrophic mining accidental spills of pollutants through: (i) strengthening the institutional and technical capacity for disaster management and emergency response
                         through upgrading communication and information systems; (ii) implementing specific risk reduction investments for floods, landslides and earthquakes; (iii) improving
                         the safety of selected water-retention dams; and (iv) improving on a pilot basis the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dump facilities.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Hazard Risk Mitigation & Emergency Preparedness GEF Project (P081950)
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The Global environmental objective is to demonstrate and provide for replication for the reduction of catastrophic accidental spills of transboundary pollution loads from
                         mine operations flowing into the Danube and Black Sea basins. In support of this objective, the project, through a GEF co-financed component, will assist in piloting
                         and replication of hazards prevention and remediation activities for improving the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dump facilities; and in catalyzing
                         transboundary cooperation on integrated water resources management of the Tisza Basin. The successful implementation of the GEF co-financed component will serve

                         as a model for replication for reducing mining accident risks to human and aquatic ecosystem health throughout Romania and other parts of the Tisza and Danube
                         basins.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Shortly before the Closing Date, the project appears to have substantially met its development and global objectives through fulfilling most output and outcome indicators (formally
                         revised in 2010). Seismic retrofitting of 39 buildings has been completed and for two more buildings would be completed by the Closing Date, meeting the revised target, while other
                         three buildings currently underway would remain to be completed with Government funds by December 20, 2012, exceeding, eventually, the target. The population considered at
                         direct risk (without the project) in case of a severe earthquake and benefiting of protection after the project is estimated to 23,350 people while a much larger population potentially
                         affected indirectly in such an event (mainly by the temporary disruption of regular activities of the respective institutions) would also benefit of the project (the number was estimated
                         to 2.8 million people). A wide range of buildings would be eventually retrofitted under the project to include 14 hospitals, 10 local administration buildings, nine education facilities,
                         seven emergency response facilities, 4 social protection facilities, with their complete functional restoration finalized by May 2013.

                         All flood protection works in 10 vulnerable sites and increased safety of seven large and small dams have been completed, thus contributing to meeting the outcome objective to
                         provide protection to about 266,245 people (and 68,000 households) at direct risk of flooding, slightly exceeding the estimated 234,000 people at project outset. In addition, 94 km of
                         national and 115 km of county roads have been protected, as well as many socio-cultural buildings (schools, churches, kindergartens, etc).

                         In support of the project development and global objectives, the project assisted the Government in piloting and replication of hazard prevention and remediation activities for

                         improving the management and safety of tailings dams and waste dumps facilities and in catalyzing trans-boundary cooperation on integrated water resources management in the
                         Tisza River basin. Remediation works in six sites have been completed, exceeding the initial target of three sites, at a very good quality, resulting a very good post closure condition
                         of the mines. The remediated sites have clearly ceased to be a significant environmental risk, and the former continuous emissions of contaminated dust, surface runoff and
                         groundwater infiltration have been terminated.

                         The Project also assisted the Government with the creation of a mandatory catastrophe insurance scheme through technical assistance for development of a high resolution flood
                         and earthquake risk model, a dynamic financial analysis model (DFA) for the establishment of the Pool for Insurance against Disasters (PAID), advisory services in support of the
                         preparation of the Law for Mandatory Insurance of Dwellings against Natural Disasters and supporting its implementation through insurance norms and regulations, as well as a study
                         tour for government officials on international experience in disaster risk insurance pooling schemes. A public awareness of catastrophe exposure and need for insurance in the
                         country was developed under the project. The result was a major increase in the number of catastrophe risk insurance policies bought by the Romanian homeowners, from about 5%
                         of residential dwellings before the adoption of the law to 59% (or about 5 million policies) today.

                         One other Project objective was to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity for emergency management and response functions as well as disaster preparedness. The
                         critical activity to attain this goal has been the design and establishment of a comprehensive Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) to improve the coordinated
                         response to disasters. Implementation of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) developed under Component A (Strengthening of Emergency Management and
                         Risk Financing Capacity) progressed slower than expected and is still nearing completion with a final operational roll-out of the system expected before the Closing Date, in 48 sites

                         in the emergency operational centers at the national and county levels (exceeding the target of 23 sites). The full effect of EMIS should be observed in the months following project
                         closing.

                         In contrast with the above results, the Landslides Pilot Area Studies have not been completed mainly because of the limited implementation capacity. A full set of monitoring
                         equipment was, however, installed in each of the two pilot locations (Sacele and Sinaia), including inclinometers, piezometers, rain and temperature gauges, which can transmit real
                         time information on the local situation to the terminals installed at the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) and local beneficiaries, via password-protected Internet platform.
                         Therefore, it remains for the Borrower to identify solutions MEF to find solutions to develop the required mathematical model to help interpretation of the data collected from the
                         monitoring equipment including alerts issuing.
