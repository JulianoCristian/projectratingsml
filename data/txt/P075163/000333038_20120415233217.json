The project has achieved seismic\n            retrofitting of 40 public buildings, flood protection at all\n            ten project sites, enhancing the safety of six large and\n            small dams, and safety of six tailings management facilities\n            (TMF) at three mines. Thus, all output targets set under\n            component B (seismic risk reduction), component C (flood and\n            landslides risk reduction), and component D (Risk Reduction\n            of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin) have been met and even\n            exceeded.  Under component A (strengthening of emergency\n            management and risk financing capacity), the roll-out of the\n            Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) is well\n            underway and its installation in all 48 locations envisaged\n            (exceeding the target of at least 23 locations) would be\n            completed by April 20, 2012, as planned.  Seismic\n            retrofitting of five additional public buildings is underway\n            and should be completed by the current closing date (June\n            30, 2012).  Installation of the landslides monitoring\n            equipment has been completed and data collection will start\n            soon, to enable finalization of the monitoring manual and\n            hand-over of the equipment and operational guidelines to the\n            relevant public authorities in charge with further\n            monitoring activity.  The reallocation is necessary to\n            increase the amount available for operational expenditures\n            under component C until project closing."}, "docdt": "2012-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
