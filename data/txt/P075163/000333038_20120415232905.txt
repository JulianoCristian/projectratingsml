  2.      Brief summary of project implementation progress. The Project implementation
  progressed in the last six months towards meeting in full its development objectives (PDO) under
  all four components. So far, the project has achieved seismic retrofitting of 40 public buildings,
  flood protection at all ten project sites, enhancing the safety of six large and small dams, and
  safety of six tailings management facilities (TMF) at three mines. Thus, all output targets set
  under component B (seismic risk reduction), component C (flood and landslides risk reduction),
  and component D (Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents in Tisza Basin) have been met and even
  exceeded. Under component A (Strengthening of Emergency Management and Risk Financing
  Capacity), the roll-out of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) is well
  underway and its installation in all 48 locations envisaged (exceeding the target of at least 23
  locations) would be completed by April 20, 2012, as planned. Seismic retrofitting of five
  additional public buildings is underway and should be completed by the current Closing Date
  (June 30, 2012). Installation of the landslides monitoring equipment has been completed and


                                                       6
data collection will start soon, to enable finalization of the monitoring manual and hand-over of
the equipment and operational guidelines to the relevant public authorities in charge with further
monitoring activity. Rehabilitation works at Dridu Dam are being completed and the hand over
is scheduled for mid-April 2012.

3.    The proposed reallocation is necessary to increase the amount available for operational
expenditures under component C until project closing.
