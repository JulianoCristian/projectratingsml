for Romania were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            it is important to establish the implementation team at the\n            beginning of the project so that the implementation of\n            project activities will be smoother. The Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) for component C was established only after two\n            years of implementation, which delayed progress on this\n            component. Assigning project implementation to a Government\n            team exclusively dedicated to the task, working within the\n            structure of the implementing agency, ideally from the\n            advanced preparation stage, would be highly desirable,\n            provided that the team is not affected by changes in\n            Government. The team's responsibilities should be\n            clear, well defined and well known within the agency.\n            Previous experience in managing investment programs should\n            be a core requirement for selecting the team's\n            technical staff and managers. A good procurement plan should\n            be in place from the start, and should be revised and\n            updated annually, to reflect all changes in the project\n            implementation schedule and address any shortcomings that\n            become apparent. It is advantageous to have a strong agency\n            such as CONVERSMIN (Romanian public agencies) to complement\n            the Government during implementation, to ensure mutual\n            support and cooperation. Such an agency should continue\n            after project closure and take responsibility for the\n            closure of mines, remediation of tailing dams, and\n            post-monitoring of environmental factors."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
