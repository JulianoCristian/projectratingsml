                         components B (Seismic Risk Reduction) and D (Risk Reduction of Mining Accidents). Seismic retrofitting of 22 public buildings has been finalized while works are underway for 13
                         more buildings. However, in absence of adequate funding in 2010 and 2011 meeting the development objectives for component B would be at risk since about 1.4 million people
                         would not benefit of the expected protection under the project in case of a strong earthquake. All works for flood protection and safety of five dams have been completed and one
                         dam is under rehabilitation under the project. Despite meeting and exceeding the objectives regarding increasing the safety of infrastructure for safety of tailings management
                         facilities, insufficient allocation of GEF funds would not allow development of a mine-spill disaster response system and of a mine-specific environmental monitoring system
                         contributing to a lasting, sustainable project impact. Progress in development of the Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) allows for completion of pilot operational
                         acceptance before end of 2010 and start rolling out the system in January 2011. The Romanian Catastrophe Insurance program was formally launched in July 2010 and the Pool for
                         Insurance Against Disasters started registration of mandatory insurance policies.

                         Although sufficient funds are available in the Loan and GEF Grant accounts, the Borrower's strict regulations for management of scarce fiscal space under the current economic and
                         financial crisis impose limited funds allocation to the implementing agencies. Therefore, the Ministry of Public Finance required the implementing agencies / ministries to prioritize the
                         investment programs under their authority. In addition, the government changed the rules of public financing in 2009 and decided to pre-finance the project activities and seek
                         reimbursement from the loans, thus depending on current cash available in the budget.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In 2009, the closing date of the project was extended by 2 years to allow meeting most of initial project development and global environment objectives. In August 2010, the project
                         was restructured to reflect the new safeguard triggered during implementation (Involuntary Resettlement) because private land had to be acquired for implementation of project
                         activities under component C (Flood and landslides risk reduction).

                         In absence of additional budget allocation, the Government (MInistry of Public Finance) would need to cancel the funds likely to remain unused, amounting to about US$ 18.7 million
                         from the Loan and US$ 2.25 million from the GEF Grant.
