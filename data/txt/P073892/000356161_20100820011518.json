{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Health Sector\n            Strengthening and Modernization Project for Costa Rica were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in the case of this project, the\n            possibility of issues with procurement had been identified\n            up front, and actions expected to mitigate potential delays\n            had been prepared. Effectiveness delays, taken here to mean\n            delays of more than six months in loan effectiveness\n            following approval, are increasingly commonplace in\n            countries that require legislative approval of external\n            financing. Although the Bank has recently sought to minimize\n            the number of effectiveness conditions as a means of\n            ensuring timely project start-up, the reality is that there\n            is often a long lag in effectiveness pending legislative\n            approval. This fact should be considered in the\n            project's timetable as one in which selected activities\n            could be finalized, thereby permitting earlier loan\n            approval. Monitoring and evaluation should be an integral\n            part of project implementation. This is especially true in\n            projects which focus on institutional capacity\n            strengthening, in support of what in the case of the project\n            was a much broader Government program. Monitoring should not\n            be contracted out in most instances."}, "docdt": "2010-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
