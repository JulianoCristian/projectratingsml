Health Sector Strengthening and\n            Modernization Project for Costa Rica aims to improve health\n            system performance and financial sustainability by\n            supporting the ongoing policy changes in the health sector\n            in Costa Rica (See also report no. 11986). Most of these\n            changes are part of second-phase reforms in the Costa Rican\n            Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricanse de Seguro\n            Social, or CCSS). There are two project components. The\n            first provides financing to develop the strategies and\n            instruments required to achieve the objectives set forth in\n            the Policy Activity Schedule (PAS) (Annex 2A). The component\n            will be executed through two mechanisms that 1) finance\n            local and foreign consultant services, information systems,\n            the development of supply chain solutions--including\n            e-procurement, equipment for the Basic Health Care Teams\n            (EBAIS), training in health policy, clinical practice and\n            management, and study tours to incorporate international\n            \"best practice\" into the Costa Rican health\n            sector; and 2) allocations to decentralized sub-projects\n            with the hospitals and health areas. The second component\n            supports the development of a monitoring and evaluation\n            system, and includes resources to establish and sustain\n            information, education, and communication campaigns related\n            to the modernization process. Support will also be given for\n            the day-to-day operations of the Project Coordinating Unit\n            assisting in project implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
