F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
This project aims to improve health system performance and financial sustainability by
supporting the ongoing policy changes in the health sector in Costa Rica. Most of these
changes are part of second-phase reforms in the Costa Rican Social Security Institute
(Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, or CCSS). For the short- to medium-term, these
policy changes will: (a) align the organizational and functional structure of the CCSS
with recent changes separating financing, purchasing and provision of health services at
all levels; (b) promote improvements in quality and fulfillment of consumer rights, as


                                               ii
well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the Ministry of Health (MH) as a regulatory
agency, by strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework; (c) improve the
quality and efficiency of the CCSS health delivery system by supporting decentralization
of decision-making, consolidation of the primary care delivery network based on a
population-based system, and introduction of performance-based incentives for
providers; (d) reduce inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical sub-sector and promote rational
drug use by introducing changes in the planning, purchasing and distribution of
pharmaceuticals and supplies; and (e) develop financial mechanisms that will improve
the equitable distribution of resources, improve efficiency in the provider payment
mechanisms and strengthen the CCSSs capacity to collect payroll contributions.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal of the Second Health Sector Strengthening and
Modernization Project (the Project) in 2001, the challenges that Costa Rica faced in its
health sector were unique in Latin America: to maintain very good health conditions and
a high level of access, while at the same time correcting underlying causes of
inefficiencies and inequities in health service delivery so that an even higher level of
performance could be achieved and sustained in the future. Over the ten years prior to
appraisal, Costa Rica's health indicators had continued to improve. Infant mortality was
estimated at 10.3 per 1,000 live births, life expectancy had reached 77.6 years, and social
insurance covered 85 percent of the population. Costa Rica's health conditions were the
best in Latin America, and in line with those of OECD countries.

2.      In the early 1990s, Costa Rica introduced reforms to its health system whereby
responsibility for provision of primary care was transferred from the Ministry of Health
(MOH) to the Costa Rican Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricense de Seguro
Social, or CCSS), and a population-based model of care was extended to relatively
underserved rural populations. The reform brought several institutional and health care
delivery changes. First, population-based "health areas" (Areas de Salud) were created,
each covering approximately 50,000 people.           The health areas represented a
reorganization of the primary health care model. Each health area had about 10 Basic
Health Care Teams (Equipos Básicos de Atención Integral en Salud, or EBAIS), which
were introduced under the reforms. One EBAIS consisted of a physician, a nurse and a
technician. In addition, reform brought the approval of a desconcentration law that
increased autonomy of CCSS providers ("Ley 7852, Ley de Desconcentración"); and
introduction of new management arrangements.

3.     At the time of appraisal, significant improvements had occurred as a result of this
reform process. Management contracts for health areas and major hospitals had been
implemented successfully, generating innovation in hospital management and the use of
budgets proposed on the basis of health outcomes. The monitoring of processes and
evaluation of results had become fundamental to health care delivery in Costa Rica.

4.      In spite of this progress, there were strong signals that further improvements in
health service delivery were needed in order to address uneven quality and health
outcomes. Quality deficits were still apparent at the level of primary health care--
quality-adjusted coverage rates for key programs were about half as high as direct
coverage rates.

5.     More importantly, however, reforms       in finance, organization and management
required timely and strong follow-through       to ensure that the health sector's good
performance could be sustained in the future.     The present and expected future financial
burden on the public sector was significant.     In 2000, Costa Rica already allocated an

                                            1
estimated nine percent of GDP to investments in health care, and changes in the country's
epidemiological and demographic profile were increasing pressure on health care
spending. While Costa Rica did not envisage reducing government spending on health,
the country was conscious of the need to allocate resources more equitably and efficiently
in order to obtain better results and curtail future increases in health spending. While the
health system guaranteed universal coverage, there were opportunities for improvement
in assuring that good quality services reached disadvantages populations and that
government resources were well targeted.

6.     In this context, the Government, and the CCSS in particular, were eager to
consolidate the 1990 reform and take on new challenges. The CCSS had plans to
improve the allocation of resources by improving its existing algorithm and introducing a
formula-based system that took into account population and health risk. The targeting
system was to be improved to allocate public subsidies in a more equitable manner.
CCSS planned to introduce a system whereby budget would be allocated based on
performance, and sought to use incentive packages for health workers to motivate
productivity and efficiency, to introduce mechanisms to reduce waiting lists and to make
expenditures on pharmaceuticals more efficient.

7.       At the time, Costa Rica faced three main categories of challenges in its health
sector: (a) institutional strengthening and regulation; (b) health care service delivery; and
(c) financing and resource allocation. In institutional strengthening and regulation,
several pieces of legislation had major implications for the health sector, yet existing
institutional and managerial structures and capacities were not prepared for their
implementation. In addition, both public and private sub-sectors lacked appropriate
regulation in many key areas of health care delivery, and medical education and
continuing education required modernization and investment.            Health care service
delivery also required strengthening and adjustment. The health care delivery model
needed to shift from costly inpatient to more efficient outpatient care for certain
conditions and interventions. The pharmaceutical supply chain management was also
inefficient, and out of step with other sector reforms. Investment in hospital
infrastructure and equipment had lagged behind demand, inhibiting efficiency and
quality. Information systems for providers remained weak, and increased attention to
prevention and promotion was warranted. Finally, the system for health care financing
and resource allocation was only weakly linked to health needs, performance or
outcomes, as the introduction of annual performance agreements had not been fully
supported by the required changes in the resource allocation model needed to ensure
greater equity and improved targeting.

8.      During Appraisal, the Government was seen as considering the health sector as an
essential determinant of Costa Rica's economic and social development, assigning to the
sector a priority that was reflected in sustained high levels of spending and active policy
attention at the highest levels. Building on previous successes that had been partially
financed by the Bank under the Health Reform Project1, the Government had identified

million, ICR Report No.25713 dated May 14, 2003.

                                                2
specific plans to address the challenges it faced in institutional strengthening and
regulation health care service provision, and financing and resource allocation.

9.      To address the health sector's institutional challenges, the Government was
supporting efforts to reorganize and decentralize the CCSS' functions, strengthen
capacity of the newly autonomous health sector entities and complete the transformation
of the MOH into an effective regulator. For improving the effectiveness and efficiency
of the health care provision, the Government intended to encourage the shift away from
over-dependence on inpatient service and introduce decentralized purchasing and
distribution of pharmaceuticals, based on price and quality bidding processes by the
health care facilities. To address challenges with respect to financing and resource
allocation, the Government was committed to consolidate CCSS revenue collection for
all areas of the country through improvement and extension of the Centralized Collection
System (Sistema Centralizado de Recaudación - SICERE), developing effective
supervision to reduce evasion and improve efficiency in collection, using Diagnostic
Related Groups (DRGs) as a basis of reimbursement to complete the transition from
allocations based on historical budgets to a performance-based system, and improving the
targeting of resources toward underserved populations.

10.     The Bank had supported Costa Rica in its 1993 health sector reform under a
US$22 million loan for the Health Sector Reform Project. As it tackled even more
complex tasks in the health sector, the Government sought the Bank's continued
technical and financial support under a follow-on project. The Project was fully
consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)2, which identified health
sector improvements as a critical -- and leading -- element in improvement of social
programs. The CAS also highlighted the importance of improving efficiency,
strengthening the referral system, channeling increasing resources to disadvantaged areas
thereby improving equity, and integrating curative and preventive services. The Project
was also consistent with a Social Expenditures Review that emphasized the need to
improve resource allocation and equity, and develop mechanisms to encourage private
sector participation. Finally, the Project was consistent with the Bank's Health, Nutrition
and Population (HNP) Strategy in that it recognized: (a) the Bank's comparative
advantage in the areas of system strengthening; (b) the importance of supporting reforms
that separate the functions of financing, purchasing and provision of health services; and
(c) the overall institutional mission to address the needs of poor and underserved
populations.



1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11.    The Project aimed to improve health system performance and financial
sustainability by supporting the policy changes that were ongoing in Costa Rica's health

sector. Most of these changes were part of second-phase reforms in the CCSS. For the
short- to medium-term, these policy changes aimed to: (a) align the organizational and
functional structure of the CCSS with recent changes separating the financing, purchasing
and provision of health services at all levels; (b) promote improvements in quality and
fulfillment of consumer rights, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the MOH as
a regulatory agency, by strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework; (c)
improve the quality and efficiency of the CCSS health delivery system by supporting
decentralization of decision-making, consolidation of the primary care delivery network
through a population-based system, and introduction of performance-based incentives for
providers; (d) reduce inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical sub-sector and promote rational
drug use by introducing changes in the planning, purchasing and distribution of
pharmaceuticals and supplies; and (e) develop financial mechanisms that would improve
the equitable distribution of resources, improve efficiency in the provider payment
mechanisms and strengthen CCSS' capacity to collect payroll contributions.

12.    Progress towards the Project's Development Objectives would be measured
through a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that would build on established
information systems. The evaluation would collect and compare data before (baseline),
during and after project implementation. For some outcome measures, comparisons
would also be made between geographic areas that were supported by project
interventions and those that were not, adjusting for certain factors.

13.     The M&E system was designed to permit measurement of three types of
indicators: (a) input indicators associated with investments/expenditures; (b) process
indicators associated with completion of key project activities; and (c) outcome and/or
impact indicators that were aimed at measuring the Project's results in relation to its
objectives. The number of indicators that were to be measured by the M&E system was
extensive. The key output/impact-related performance indicators included the following:

   ¾ Coverage of priority primary health care (PHC) programs, as measured by the
     difference between the absolute coverage rates and quality-adjusted coverage
     rates. (The programs included well baby care, well child care, adolescent health,
     women's health, adult health and elderly health.);
   ¾ Percentage of the population newly covered by the primary care model (EBAIS);
   ¾ Percentage of public and private providers accredited by the MOH;
   ¾ New organizational structure for the CCSS (based on separation of financing,
     purchasing and provision functions) approved and implemented;
   ¾ Design and implementation of systems to improve equity in the distribution of
     CCSS funds;
   ¾ New strategy for human resources management, including recruitment, staff
     redeployment and training plans;
   ¾ Percentage of CCSS hospitals that have a professional manager as CEO;
   ¾ Percentage of hospitals operating under the rules and procedures of the Ley de
     Desconcentración and corresponding regulations;
   ¾ Percentage of CCSS health care providers with performance contracts;
   ¾ Satisfaction of low-income patients with health service providers;

                                            4
      ¾ Percentage change in ambulatory and inpatient surgery rates;
      ¾ Percentage of total pharmaceutical budget spent on rented, versus owned,
        warehouse space; and
      ¾ Average processing time between initial bid and warehouse delivery of
        pharmaceuticals.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The Project's Development Objectives were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     By providing support to the ongoing modernization in the CCSS and the MOH,
the Project identified its expected beneficiaries as the four million persons covered by
CCSS who would obtain better quality services (as described below), with a reduction in
waiting times. The implementation of a management information system that would
allow for more effective identification of the most disadvantaged CCSS members would
improve targeting for an estimated 350,000 families. CCSS employees were expected to
benefit from the implementation of the CCSS decentralization policy that would provide
hospital managers more autonomy as well as additional resources to improve working
conditions.

15.    The Project was expected to result in the following benefits that would accrue to
all CCSS beneficiaries: (a) universal coverage of the population under the EBAIS
primary care model; (b) a MOH that was better prepared to enforce minimum quality
standards for healthcare providers and to develop national health policy; (c) a CCSS
organizational structure that would better respond to the needs of a decentralized
framework and to the separation of functions; (d) reductions in unnecessary
hospitalizations by increasing ambulatory surgery; (e) fewer instances where pharmacies
run out of medicine stocks and a more efficient pharmaceutical supply chain; and (f) a
more equitable distribution of resources.

1.5 Original Components

16.      The Project consisted of two components described below:

Component I, Policy Design and Implementation (estimated total cost US$20.75
million), would provide financing to develop the strategies and instruments required to
achieve the objectives set forth in the Policy Activity Schedule (PAS, Annex 10). The
strategies and instruments of the PAS focused on guaranteeing access to and provision of
quality, effective and efficient health services in the CCSS. This component was to be
executed through two main mechanisms, outlined below.

17.    The first mechanism was to support the PAS' objectives through financing of
local and foreign consultants, information systems, development of supply chain

                                            5
solutions, including e-procurement, equipment for EBAIS, training in health policy,
clinical practice and management and study tours to incorporate international "best
practice" into the Costa Rican health sector. The second mechanism for execution of this
component provided for the allocation of an estimated US$9 million to decentralized
subprojects with hospitals and health areas. Under this mechanism, health care providers
that complied with the CCSS criteria for autonomy would assume direct responsibility
over the procurement process for equipment, rehabilitation of infrastructure related to
ambulatory care, information systems, consultant services and other innovative projects
approved by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). This component was expected to
support the CCSS' overall policy to devolve responsibility to health care providers, allow
greater decision making for administrators and speed up the procurement process.

18.    Component 1 was designed to be implemented through activities supporting the
CCSS, the MOH and sector coordination. The CCSS board would have an active role in
evaluating and approving the critical strategies and instruments developed by the Project,
and internal CCSS management units would have the responsibility of implementing the
changes within the institution. For activities implemented by the MOH, the PCU would
make resources available for the development of the proposed activities and would
coordinate implementation with the Ministry.

19.    The Project would support the following main activities for each of the PAS
Areas:

Institutional Strengthening and Evaluation (estimated cost US$4.6 million)

The objective of this PAS area was to strengthen and improve the CCSS and the MOH to
allow each institution to better execute their functions and roles within the national health
system. Strategies and instruments would focus on each institution's organizational
structure and functional divisions, human resource strategies and the regulatory
framework, for the following activities:

20.      Supporting the implementation of CCSS and MOH organizational and
institutional restructuring processes that were designed and initiated under the Health
Sector Reform Project (HRP) which was approved in 1993. Continued implementation
would require ongoing support to redesign internal processes and organizational designs,
to ensure that the organizational and functional structures `fit' with the new roles in the
health system:

   ¾ Providing ongoing support to the CCSS Purchasing Department (Dirección de
     Compra) to allow for further development of outcome-based indicators and to
     support the implementation of the national health plan (PASP) and the strategic
     health service plan (PESS);
   ¾ Strengthening of the systems related to planning, procurement and distribution of
     pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to CCSS providers, focusing on improving
     transparency, reducing inefficiencies, promoting rational use policies and re-
     engineering processes to reduce stock shortages, spoilage and theft;

                                             6
      ¾ Supporting improved sector coordination among human development actors:
        CCSS, MOH, the Ministry of Education, and IMAS3; and
      ¾ Assisting the MOH with the development of regulations for quality assurance that
        promote a strengthened stewardship function for MOH.

Health Care Service Delivery (estimated cost US$12.3 million)

21.    The objective of this PAS area was to strengthen the CCSS provider network to
improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of health care services. The strategies
and instruments developed would support the CCSS decentralization policy aimed at
improving provider capacity to manage resources and improve responsiveness to
consumer needs at the facility level, invest in ambulatory solutions that would allow the
CCSS to consolidate and extend the implementation of the primary care model (EBAIS)
and develop new instruments to improve supply chain efficiency for pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies.

22.     The activities in the area of implementation of the decentralized incentive
framework would be financed by two different mechanisms, as described above. Under
the first mechanism, providers undergoing decentralization would be supported in their
efforts to decentralize, increase efficiency and promote greater use of ambulatory
solutions through strategic planning and bidding processes supported by the CCSS and
the PCU. This support was to be complemented by the use of grants for the
implementation of subprojects that promoted decentralization and developed institutional
capacity among health care providers. These grants, that were to be approved ex-ante by
the CCSS, would finance two distinct types of activities: (a) subprojects to strengthen the
provider's capacity to assume decentralized management and improve the quality of care
to patients; and (b) subprojects to increase ambulatory interventions, reduce waiting times
and improve patient focus through the introduction of innovative interventions.

23.      To support the improvements in the provider network, the Project would focus on:

      ¾ Support to CCSS providers throughout the implementation of the decentralization
        process, ensuring that they receive technical assistance and training required for a
        timely and successful implementation;
      ¾ Development and implementation of a comprehensive strategy to increase
        ambulatory solutions that leads to greater quality, user satisfaction and efficiency
        for CCSS hospitals. This would include ambulatory surgery, home care and other
        innovative solutions;
      ¾ Supporting providers through the implementation of policies related to
        decentralized purchasing of pharmaceutical and medical supplies. The actions
        would focus on building capacity in CCSS providers to assume their new
        responsibilities under the decentralization law; and

 The project planned to support IMAS' institutional modernization since it was responsible to update the
Poverty Information (SIPO).


                                                    7
   ¾ Continuing to support the implementation of EBAIS in low-income regions that
     had not been fully developed under the prior Health Sector Reform Project and
     consolidate the development of the model in those areas that required additional
     support.

Financing and Resource Allocation (estimated cost US$3.84 million)

24.    This PAS area was to support the development of resource allocation mechanisms
that would promote greater equity in the CCSS and develop reimbursement mechanisms
for providers that promoted incentives to increase quality and efficiency in the delivery
network. It would do so through support to the following activities:

   ¾ Design and implementation of algorithms to improve equity in the distribution of
     CCSS resources to health areas;
   ¾ Implementation of the SIPO Population Identification information system
     (Sistema de Identificación de la Población Objetiva) to improve targeting of
     public subsidies to CCSS beneficiaries;
   ¾ Implementation of provider reimbursement mechanisms for health areas and
     hospitals that sought to introduce incentives to improve efficiency and quality of
     services, building upon previous developments in the areas of DRGs and
     capitation payments;
   ¾ Roll-out of the SICERE system to extend coverage of the CCSS collection system
     to the remaining branch offices; and
   ¾ Support to the CCSS in the development of actions required to ensure
     implementation of the Workers Protection Law (Ley de Protección del
     Trabajador).

25.    Component II, Monitoring & Evaluation and Project Management (estimated
total cost US$2.75 million) would support the development of an M&E system to
provide for a comprehensive evaluation of the Project's results as well as routine
monitoring. This component also included resources to establish and sustain information,
education and communication campaigns related to the modernization process.
Resources were also to be provided to support the day-to-day operations of the Project
Coordinating Unit that would assist the CCSS and other agencies involved in the reform
process. The component was designed to finance local and international consultants,
computers and office equipment, and the recurrent expenditures associated with
management of the PCU.

1.6 Revised Components

26.    The components were not revised during implementation. However, there was a
cancellation of US$3 million in loan proceeds on June 13, 2005 (notified June 30, 2005),
since IMAS failed to sign an agreement with the CCSS to implement the project activities
for which it would have been responsible: specifically, the update of the Poverty
Information System (SIPO) and support for IMAS' institutional modernization. The
reasons for which this agreement was not signed had to do with lack of accordance in the

                                           8
country on what was required to ensure successful project implementation prior to Project
approval. This is further explained later in the document (paragraphs 47 and 60).

1.7 Other significant changes

27.     In addition to the US$3 million cancellation described above, there were several
reallocations, closing date extensions, and minor modifications to the Project's
implementation arrangements. The Closing Date extensions were in response to the
major delays in reaching loan effectiveness, and later in getting the Project off the
ground, as well as circumstances in Costa Rica related to other externally-financed
Health Projects. In addition, several activities originally included under the Project were
carried out with government resources.

28.    On April 27, 2006, the Bank agreed to a reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect
higher than expected expenditures on goods and ambulatory solutions subprojects, and
lower than expected expenditures on consultant services, training and decentralization
subprojects.

29.    On July 21, 2006, the Bank agreed to amend the Project Agreement to modify the
Procurement Schedule to: (a) allow for the use of National Competitive Bidding for the
procurement of works estimated to cost between US$350,000 equivalent and US$3.0
million equivalent, up to an aggregate of US$6.0 million equivalent; (b) increase the
aggregate limits of goods procured under shopping procedures from US$2.5 million
equivalent to US$6.3 million equivalent; (c) increase the aggregate limit of procurement
of small works under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of three
quotations from US$1.350 million equivalent to US$4.0 million equivalent, and (d) to
increase the aggregate limit for consultant services procured with selection based on
consultant qualifications.

30.    On December 21, 2006, the Bank agreed to extend the loan's December 31, 2006
Closing Date by eighteen months until June 30, 2008.

31.    On April 28, 2008, the Bank agreed to again extend the loan's Closing Date by an
additional eighteen months until December 31, 2009.

32.      On May 13, 2008, the Bank agreed to amend the Loan Agreement to increase the
disbursement percentages to 100% across all expenditure categories and, in order to
facilitate this, to apply the Country Financing Parameters for Costa Rica to the Project,
inter alia, which does not permit taxes to be considered as an eligible expenditure.

33.     On December 8, 2009, the Bank agreed to a reallocation of loan proceeds to
reflect higher than expected expenditures on consultant services, training and
decentralization subprojects, and lower than expected expenditures on goods and
ambulatory solutions subprojects.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

34.     Background Analysis. The background analysis that went into the Project's
preparation was extensive, drawing on the Bank's longstanding support for Costa Rica's
health reform since it began in the 1990s. The prior Health Reform Project was
completed in 2001 and the achievement of its development objectives was rated Highly
Satisfactory.4 As a result, support for the Project was the logical next step in the Bank's
assistance, as it would provide continuing support for the implementation of Costa Rica's
health reform especially in the areas of institutional strengthening and regulation; health
care service provision; and financing and resource allocation.

35.     The PAD described lessons of experience from the HRP, similar Bank-financed
projects in Latin America, and other projects financed by the Bank in Costa Rica. The
lessons included those related to: (i) the process of designing and evaluating management
contracts; (ii) the need for technical assistance to support the process of decentralization

and bringing more autonomy to hospitals and health care areas; (iii) the fact that
improvements in the planning, procurement and delivery of pharmaceuticals are some of
the most difficult changes to introduce; (iv) the fact that the successful primary health
care model (EBAIS) requires specific changes to be implemented in urban settings; (v)
coordination with other reform efforts supported by other donors (e.g., restructuring of
the MOH, then financed by the IDB), had proven successful; and (vi) prior
misunderstandings between the requirements of the National Procurement Law (Ley de
Contratación Administrativa), which exempted international financing agreements, and
the hierarchy of Bank norms and procedures applicable to Bank-financed projects.

36.    Previous Bank-financed projects in Costa Rica had experienced delays in
procurement due to differences in the Government's procurement policies and procedures
and the Bank's guidelines. As a result, the preparation team sought a legal opinion from
the Government to the effect that since the Project involved external financing, the
Bank's procurement guidelines would take precedence over local legislation. The PIU
decided to follow both guidelines simultaneously, which explains some delays in the
completion of procurement processes.

37.    Assessment of Project Design.        The Project's objectives and design were
reasonable yet unquestionably ambitious in terms of the institutional capacity
requirements for implementation. The PAD mentioned specifically that the "institutional
capacity of the CCSS continues to be satisfactory while that of the MOH is less so", and
"the MOH has not produced satisfactory results, including substantial delays in
implementation of its Action Plan". The Project's implementation arrangements were by
and large the same that were in place for the HRP, and the same unit within the CCSS
was to be responsible for overall coordination of the Project. The activities under the
components were designed to achieve expected results, and the PAS and the
corresponding Project Actions Matrix that fed into it provided a detailed "roadmap",
from activities through to objectives.

38.     A design issue that in retrospect made little sense relates why the preparation
team opted for contracting an external agency to design and implement the Project's
monitoring and evaluation system. As discussed below, the contracting of this agency
ended up being very problematic and in the end, the PIU designed and implemented this
system internally, with several activities (such as monitoring and evaluation of
management agreements -Compromisos de Gestión-, equity-based resource allocation to
health units, and others) internalized by CCSS operating departments. This revision
made more sense: the unit that was responsible for implementation of the Project, and its
coordination with other units in CCSS was made responsible for its monitoring and
follow-up. The institution-building achieved, as well as coordination with the PIU and
other CCSS units, would have been difficult had an external agency been entrusted with
the Project's monitoring.

39.    There were several issues with respect to the Project's preparation and timing that
could have been addressed more systematically. The Project was not fully prepared at
the time of approval, especially by current Bank standards that require completion of all

                                           11
institutional arrangements and readiness of the project management unit to perform at the
time the project is approved. In addition, recognizing the time required for approval of
external funding by the country's National Assembly, the Project's schedule and
timetable were overly optimistic--(five years with expected closing on December 31,
2006), especially considering that national elections were scheduled for early 2002 in
Costa Rica. The project was under preparation in 2001, and it should have been foreseen
that the 2002 elections would very likely affect eventual approval of the Project by the
Assembly.

40.     Finally, although potential problems with procurement had been identified up-
front as a substantial risk that could affect implementation, in the end the Project's design
involved around 225 different procurement processes, of which only three involved
goods or services costing over the equivalent of $1 million.

41.     Government Commitment and Stakeholder Involvement. The Government's
commitment to the Project (and to its own process of health reform) was strong.
Recognizing that the then upcoming national elections could lead to implementation
delays, the Project's preparation involved a broad process of consultation across political
parties that indicated that the main themes of the reform would be adopted regardless of
the outcome of the elections. Authorities of the CCSS held more than ten broad
consultation meetings with key members of the main political parties involved in the
healthcare sector. The PAS was discussed with these groups, and recommendations were
built into the Project's design. Specific consultations were also held with aspiring
presidential candidates and key congressmen.

42.     Consensus-building had been a critical element of Costa Rica's health reform
process from its very start. The first phase of the country's health reform had built
several mechanisms into the functioning of the health system that served to incorporate
beneficiary input and feedback that guided the Project's design. These include
mechanisms to incorporate community participation in the primary care model, including
specific activities where the community and stakeholders could be involved in planning
and evaluation of health care services, and also in the establishment and implementation
of the health care boards (Juntas de Salud). The Juntas were auxiliary entities designed to
enhance the use of citizenship rights by making individuals co-participants in the
definition, implementation, and monitoring of CCSS priorities.

43.      Assessment of Risks. The Project's risk matrix underestimated the number of
risks, their ratings, as well as the risk the Project in its entirety, which received a modest
risk rating. In the end, two identified risks, both rated as substantial in the PAD,
impacted the Project from the beginning. The first identified risk was described as the
"Government's commitment and institutional stability" and the second was described as
the "National contracting law procedures related to procurement will slow
implementation". Risks assessed during preparation did not include the risk of staffing
changes, which as described below were a serious issue during the Project's early years.
Nor did preparation activities consider the risk that institutional agreements required for
implementation (e.g., with IMAS), and that had not been secured during preparation,

                                             12
would never materialize. The preparation process also failed to identify the potential risk
of a major scandal that affected the main implementing agency's credibility, although this
would have been extremely difficult to foresee, especially in Costa Rica.

2.2 Implementation

44.     The US$17 million loan for the Health Sector Strengthening and Modernization
Project was approved by the Bank's Board on July 12, 2001 and signed on August 23,
2001. The approval of the loan by Costa Rica's National Assembly took significantly
longer than originally expected, in part because approval was affected by the national
elections in early 2002 and subsequent change in Government administration. Then,
however, with Congressional approval secured on May 15, 2002, it took the Borrower
almost an additional eight months to comply with conditions of effectiveness. The loan
only became effective on January 9, 2003, almost eighteen months after approval by the
Bank's Board.

45.     With a difficult and significantly delayed start, the Project faced important
challenges that, together with weaknesses in preparation, affected performance
throughout the implementation period. From December 2004 through October 2006, one
or more of the ratings covering the Project's Implementation Progress, Development
Objectives, component and other issues were either unsatisfactory or moderately
unsatisfactory. Even with the $3 million cancellation in June 2005, disbursements lagged
until almost the last two years of the Project. In late 2006 and early 2007, with new
leadership in the CCSS at all levels, implementation began to turn around. The Project
was able to accomplish in its last three years a range of objectives that it had been unable
to even start in its first four years of implementation.

46.      Incomplete Preparation. There were several aspects of the Project's preparation
that were not in place when it was approved. These included the Operational Manual
(including the definition of management procedures for subprojects in line with the Loan
and Project Agreements), the first year's Annual Action Plans and Procurement Plans, the
Institutional Agreement between CCSS and the IMAS, and the Terms-of-Reference
(TORs) for contracting of the agency that would handle external monitoring of the
Project. Inter-institutional agreements to formalize the Project's implementation
arrangements had not been drafted, much less formalized. Internally, the Bank still had
issues with arrangements for procurement, for example, to the point that although it was
not a formal condition of effectiveness, the Bank requested a revision of a supplementary
legal opinion (which had been issued on September 11, 2002 and considered insufficient
by the Bank) dealing with certain applications of the Bank's Guidelines for contracting
consultants.

47.     These arrangements and documents that were not formalized could have caused
delays in and of themselves, but the reality was that there was no agreement internally in
Costa Rica on what was required to ensure successful project implementation, nor was
there documentation that confirms a joint vision between the Bank and the Government
on what was required in terms of fiduciary and institutional arrangements to ensure
satisfactory performance of the project. As a result, the back and forth on reaching
                                            13
agreement on several issues (such as the MOH's first year Action Plan, the Terms of
Reference for contracting an M&E agency, and the criteria for selecting, evaluating and
implementing subprojects) resulted in additional delays. The case of the Institutional
Agreement between CCSS and IMAS was by far the most extreme example of lack of
up-front preparation that should have been carried out. When discussions regarding this
Agreement began in Costa Rica, the Contraloria General de la República issued legal
opinions against its signing. For a couple of years the subject was under discussion at the
highest levels of Government until finally, on June 13, 2005, the MOF decided to request
cancellation of funds allocated to IMAS for the strengthening of the SIPO. Obviously,
without an Institutional Agreement in place, funding for carrying out scheduled activities
was not provided (and CCSS came up with alternative mechanisms to replace the
information the SIPO was to provide). Similarly, on June, 25, 2005 the Contraloria
General de la Republica decided that a formal agreement was needed between the MOH
and CCSS, and funding was delayed pending signature of that agreement.

48.      Changes in Administration, Staffing and Reporting Arrangements for the PIU.
From the beginning of implementation, the Project was affected by changes in
government and government-appointed staff that were responsible for various roles and
activities. Both the Minister of Health and the President of the CCSS were changed as
well as the Executive Director responsible for the PIU in the CCSS. Annex 12 presents a
table summarizing the various changes at all levels that affected the environment within
which the Project was implemented. In all, during implementation, there were three
different government administrations (following electoral processes in February 2002 and
February 2006), five Presidents of the CCSS (following changes in government
administrations and the allegations of corruption described below) and six Executive
Directors of the project's implementation unit (following changes in the Presidents of the
CCSS).

49.     In addition, the reporting arrangements and focus of the unit responsible for the
Project's management in the CCSS were modified on several occasions. These changes
left the implementing responsibility of the project management unit poorly defined.
Originally, this unit reported directly to the CCSS Executive President. Project activities
related to planning, contracting and monitoring were implemented through the CCSS
Directorates under the overall coordination of this unit. In 2006, what had essentially
been a Project Coordination Unit responsible for coordinating the Project's overall
implementation was transformed into a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the
Operational Directorate5. The PIU became more active in project decisions relating to
planning, contracting and monitoring, and took the leadership and responsibility for the
project's successes and failures. In addition the PIU worked in a coordinated fashion with
all of the CCSS' Directorates, using the institution's established processes and
procedures, while ensuring their compatibility with the Bank's requirements.



5
  CCSS' Operational Directorate was split in 2006, and from that time, the PIU reported
to the new Directorate of Infrastructure and Technology.


                                            14
50.     CCSS Allegations of Corruption. In early 2004, the media in Costa Rica
announced several cases of alleged corruption, involving several former presidents of
Costa Rica as well as a former President of the CCSS. The first case that was made
public involved a loan to the CCSS for the procurement of medical equipment, of which
about 20 percent had allegedly been diverted for other purposes. High level CCSS
authorities were prosecuted and placed under arrest. The internal and external credibility
of the CCSS' management immediately came into question and clearly affected the
management decisions within the CCSS related to purchases of goods and services.
Managers in the CCSS delayed or postponed decisions related to purchases and contracts,
since many CCSS procurement actions started to be intensively reviewed by the National
Controller's Office and Internal Auditing Unit.

51.     In response, the President of Costa Rica appointed a Special Committee to
investigate CCSS management, and requested extensive information regarding the
implementation of both the prior HRP and the current Project. The results of this
investigation showed the allegations to be more political than technical. With respect to
both of the Bank-financed projects, the investigation revealed only minor questions about
contracting of one staff as well as more extensive questioning about what the Committee
felt were excessively high expenses for consultancies.

52.     This overall situation impacted the Project and its implementation adversely in
several ways: (i) the new CCSS Board of Directors recentralized all project-related
decisions; (ii) internal administrative and legal reviews of project-related procurement
decisions began to be scrutinized, increasing substantially the already excessive steps and
time involved in what should have been normal reviews; (iii) all externally-financed
projects started to be viewed with extreme distrust, especially regarding the financing of
consultancies. In addition, there was a major change in staffing of the CCSS from its
President, Directing Board, and Legal Department down through other levels.

53.     Procurement. Despite the up-front agreement that Bank procurement guidelines
would take precedence over local legislation for all project procurement, ambiguity
regarding the appropriate procedures to follow, and the increased scrutiny that the CCSS
faced after the allegations of corruption, created a situation in which the procurement of
works, goods and service under the Project became extremely complex and time-
consuming. When implementation improved and procurement got underway in earnest,
procurement was carried out in a manner that followed both local legislation and Bank
guidelines. Even so, this required an enormous effort on the part of the PIU to ensure
appropriate follow-up and adherence to schedules. In addition, procurement decisions
were also delayed by a critical factor that had not been identified during the Project's
preparation: the time it took for internal approvals of large procurements under the CCSS
internal procedures. Under those procedures, the Junta Directiva was required to provide
ex-ante approval of contract awards of more than US$1 million. Composed of nine
members (divided evenly among organized labor, the private sector and government) the
Junta is an ad-hoc group that meets periodically on dates scheduled in advance.
Therefore, if the Junta raised any questions regarding a proposed award that required



                                            15
research or investigation, resolution would not happen until the next scheduled meeting
of the Junta.

54.     The problems that the Project faced with procurement caused important delays in
the contracting of goods, works and services. These delays were eventually addressed by
the PIU, which in the end was able to recover previous slippages and implement most of
the Project's activities in its final years. However, by that point, the mentioned problems
had driven the CCSS to finance several of the activities that were to be financed by the
Bank with its own internal resources. The activities that the CCSS self-financed included
small works, rehabilitation of health facilities, and other purchases of goods that the PIU
considered difficult to implement in a reasonable time period using the Bank's
procedures. A major factor why this happened was because some Units within the CCSS
were not fully engaged with the procurement process and execution of the Bank's
Project.

55.    Actions Taken in Response to Problems. Starting in 2005, CCSS and the Bank's
supervision team intensified efforts towards getting the Project's implementation back on
track. This was accomplished in part through the preparation of a very detailed Action
Plan setting out a critical path of activities and procurement actions that would be
necessary to bring implementation to a successful conclusion. This Action Plan was
monitored closely by staff of the PIU and the Bank.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

56.     Monitoring and Evaluation Design. A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
system was to be developed during the first six months of the Project. The system was to
be managed by a third party to ensure transparency and lack of bias in the evaluation
process. The M&E system was to be used to carry out bi-annual evaluations with the
Bank; these evaluations were to be an integral part of the planning process to guarantee
that the proposed investment plans were directly related to the social development
objectives. The evaluations were to include all key performance indicators, in addition to
other indicators that the CCSS and the Bank would agree to include for M&E purposes.
The Project was to be monitored according to compliance with the PAS and the Project
Actions Matrix (Annex 11). Some of the defined indicators were complex, and depended
on several variables. Beneficiary assessments and surveys on user satisfaction that had
been conducted during the previous Health Reform Project and that had been used as an
instrument for performance and evaluation would be updated under the Project.

57.     With assistance under the Project subcomponent "Financing and resource
allocation", CCSS planned to improve its allocation of resources by improving the then
existing algorithm and introducing a formula-based system that took population and
health risk into account. The targeting system used by SIPO was to be improved in order
to allocate public subsidies in a more equitable manner.

58.    Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation. The contracting of a third party to
design and maintain the Project's M&E system was continuously delayed due to
problems in contracting. In a first attempt, there was a conflict of interest in one of the
                                            16
firms selected to implement this task. In a later attempt, there were no qualified bidders.
The MOF provided software they had developed for project monitoring, but the PIU felt
that the system did not meet the Project's needs. The PIU then developed a very detailed
system for monitoring implementation and progress toward the Project's development
objectives. Starting in early 2007, the PIU developed and/or relied upon systems to
monitor several key elements and activities: (i) the Project's monitoring indicators and
the PAS; (ii) critical procurements and other actions needed to keep the Project on track;
(iii) progress in implementation of the sub-projects; (iv) the CCSS' existing internal
control systems; (v) internal auditing by the CCSS; and (vi) external auditing by the
Contraloria General de la República. The last three included financial management and
monitoring the use and application of resources and internal control systems.

59.     Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization. Baseline data for the Project's monitoring
indicators only became available in 2006, and was only used as an instrument to monitor
progress since that time. Starting in mid-2007, project monitoring became a priority to
the PIU, which assigned high importance to getting the Project on track and overcoming
the previous delays in implementation. The PIU adopted strict measures to monitor
project activities, including progress toward objectives. Together with the Bank, the
Project's procurement and activity monitoring system was updated and reviewed weekly,
with follow-up actions identified to ensure compliance with strict deadlines that were
designed to bring the Project and the activities it financed to a satisfactory completion.

60.     Several monitoring activities included in the Project's design were carried out by
the CCSS operational directorates and monitored for purposes of the Project's objectives
by the PIU. These activities include the allocation of resources to health regions on the
basis of equity considerations (by the CCSS Administrative Management Directorate);
the establishment, agreement, monitoring and follow-up to the Compromisos de Gestión
(by the CCSS Administrative Management Directorate); and the efforts to increase
efficiency in the procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other medical
supplies (by CCSS Medical Management Directorate). Because of the issues with
signing the Inter-Agency Agreement with IMAS, the Project's activities related to the
strengthening of the IMAS database were never implemented. As an alternative, CCSS
opted to establish a new system of identifying poor households, Ficha Familiar, that will
provide more extensive, broader, information on all CCSS beneficiaries across the
country, through a census, that gathers important vital statistics, health information,
information on living conditions and consumption. The Bank provided hands-on
technical assistance to the establishment of this system that is being utilized on a pilot
basis to prioritize the allocation of resources, thereby furthering the Project's equity
objectives.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

61.     Safeguard. None of the Bank's Safeguard policies were triggered by the Project.
While the Project was to deal mostly with institutional and organizational issues in the
health sector, there were activities to be financed that would enhance the ability of the
CCSS to increase ambulatory surgery in order to rationalize hospitalization use when
appropriate, and for this reason an environmental assessment was prepared. The
                                            17
preparation team analyzed all environmental legislation in Costa Rica and the procedures
used in hospitals for waste collection, disposal and/or storage, related issues with
transportation of waste, etc. The team, in consultation with the CCSS, the MOH and
environmental health specialists, concluded that the Project should not include special
environmental measures beyond those already being followed by the CCSS, and the
regulatory efforts by the MOH.

62.     The vast majority of sub-projects and activities carried out under the Project
incorporated the country's indigenous areas. In such areas, equity was interpreted as ease
of access. To this end, activities included the improvement of information systems with
the introduction of the automated Ficha Familiar, the Geographic Information System for
Epidemiology, the incorporation of GPS (Global Positioning System) for location of
homes, and the Integrated Pharmacy system. In addition, access to primary care
technicians was improved through the provision of all-terrain vehicles and the `floating
hospital', and service delivery was strengthened by improving the cold chain for more
effective vaccination delivery as well as equipment to enhance problem-solving in health
services. The impact of these and other cross-cutting efforts has contributed to the
reduction of infant mortality.

63.     Procurement. The Project's procurement capacity assessment had concluded that
based on the experience under the ongoing Health Reform Project, the PCU had adequate
coordinating and operational arrangements for the new Project. However, the assessment
identified the following issues: (i) difficult national procurement environment in light of
the conflicts between the Bank's guidelines and national contracting law, as well as
controversies resulting from the ex-post review by the Contraloria General de la
República (CGO) of signed contracts, which often required conformity with national law;
(ii) added responsibilities of the PCU in responding timely and effectively to the delays in
project Procurement and Contracting Plans, and following up of frequent bidder disputes;
and (iii) capacity of the PCU to coordinate and advise the health units in the procurement
of inputs included in their sub-projects. An Action Plan to strengthen and enhance the
procurement capacity of the PCU was agreed with the Bank during preparation. As
described in Section 2.2 above, procurement was one of the biggest challenges the
Project faced during implementation.

64.     Financial Management.        The Project's financial management assessment
similarly concluded that the PCU had in place adequate financial management
arrangements for the then ongoing Health Reform Project, and an Action Plan for
enhancing those arrangements and adapting them to the new Project was agreed. The
signing of a contract with the Project's external auditors was complied as a Condition of
Effectiveness. Despite a few comments on the Project's external audits that were
addressed by the PCU, financial management arrangements proceeded rather smoothly
and there were no significant issues with the external auditors' opinions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

65.   Since completion, the Project has become a program maintained and managed by
the Government. While a next phase Bank project is not currently being prepared, a
                                            18
furthering of the Project's objectives is fully incorporated in the current operational plans
of both the Government and the CCSS. The Project was carried out by CCSS and MOH
staff, and these institutions remain responsible for continuing to pursue the reforms,
activities and other objectives with their own financial and staff resources.

66.     Costa Rica has recently gone through a national electoral process, and a new
Government administration took office in May 2010. While specific details of the new
Government's program were not available at the time of ICR preparation, some themes
are already apparent. The new President's Program, Plan de Gobierno 2010-2014,
recognizes Costa Rica's achievements in health, especially vis-à-vis other countries of
similar income levels, and prioritizes programs to improve coverage, quality and service
delivery within an overall framework of greater efficiency in resource usage.
Specifically, the Plan de Gobierno 2010-2014 maintains and aims to improve the health
service delivery model supported by the Project. Specifically, the Plan calls for creating
150 new EBAIS, improving another 100 EBAIS in lower income areas of the country,
and promoting even more ambulatory solutions as a means of making services more
responsive, timely and efficient. It also prioritizes a further strengthening of the CCSS,
to be achieved through more financing, staffing and through greater use of information
and technology to strengthen its internal managerial and external service provision
functions.

67.     For its part, the CCSS Strategic Plan 2007-2012 emphasizes the objectives that
were supported under the Project while reaffirming the institution's objectives to reduce
disparities in health service delivery through a sustained effort to improve physical,
technological, human resource and process improvements in the primary and secondary
health service networks. At the same time, CCSS will continue to pursue more efficient
service provision at its hospitals through increased incorporation into the primary and
secondary health networks, and through greater ambulatory and other work process
improvements. The CCSS strategic plan identifies five challenges moving towards 2025:
(i) Costa Rica's demographic transition which means an aging population and its
consequent implications for contributions and demand for health care; (ii) the country's
epidemiological transition, whereby the leading causes of death will become similar to
those of a developed county, resulting in higher costs to the system as a whole; (iii)
changes in the structure of the labor market, with a reduction of employment in
agriculture in favor of services, that will require efforts for the CCSS to incorporate a
greater number of independent workers, often under temporary contracts; (iv) a steady
flow of immigrants, and the need to address their needs to maintain internal cohesion in
the country; and (v) the Government's ability to regulate effectively the provision of
complementary areas and/or sectors such as the quality of water resources, protection of
the environment, public transport, education and culture, all of which ultimately have an
impact on the health status of Costa Rica's citizens.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



                                             19
68.     The Project's objectives were and continue to be extremely relevant to Costa
Rica's health sector strategy. The project spanned and was consistent with two CASs. As
described in Section 2.5 above, the objectives are fully aligned with the country's and the
CCSS' current development priorities. Bank assistance, especially starting in 2006, was
responsive to helping the Borrower make up for initial delays in the Project's
implementation and ensuring progress towards its development objective (Section 5.1
(b)). The PDOs were ambitious, but as they were and continue to be aligned with those
of the Government; they in fact represented the Government's own goals. Perhaps more
than the PDOs themselves, individual targets in the PAS were ambitious, and given
delays and other implementation problems described in Section 2.2, were in some cases
only partially achieved.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

69.    The Project's progress towards the achievement of its Development Objectives is
presented below, according to the indicators and targets set out in the PAS. Overall, the
Project met most of its expected objectives, only falling short in the extent of
achievement of those objectives as a result of initial implementation delays. There is
every reason to believe that with continued priority assigned to the health care delivery
model that the Project supported, full achievement of the objectives and targets will be
achieved in the near term.

(a) To align the organizational and functional structure of the CCSS with recent
changes separating financing, purchasing and provision of health services at all
levels;

70.      The Project accomplished this objective with only minor shortcomings. Costa
Rica's health care delivery system is composed of three integrated layers of health
institutions: at the top, seven large general and/or specialized national hospitals that
deliver services to the entire population based on need; three large health networks or
redes (Red Noroeste, Red Este, Red Sur) each divided into regions by population (8 in
total, including the metropolitan San Jose region) that include regional hospitals; and then
Equipos Básicos de Atención Integral de Salud (EBAIS) which are composed of a
general medical practitioner, a nurse auxiliary, a pharmacy auxiliary and a primary health
technical assistant, and are also created or identified based on population. At present,
there are 962 EBAIS functioning in Costa Rica, each composed of a team of at least a
medical practitioner, a nursing assistant and a technical assistant in primary care. Some
EBAIS also have a pharmaceutical assistant and an assistant for health statistics. All of
these health units, general or specialized hospitals, regional hospitals or EBAIS are
currently operating under management agreements (Compromisos de Gestión) with the
CCSS' Dirección de Compra de Servicios de Salud. This arrangement has resulted in
health services coverage of 100% throughout the country.

71.     The Project achieved this objective with minor shortcomings. Because of delays
in implementation, activities designed to achieve this objective began later than
anticipated, with the result that while the overall framework for strengthening the MOH
in its new regulatory role is in place, progress towards expected targets was slower than
originally envisaged.

72.     The MOH designed and published its Plan Strategic 2008-2010 following a
participatory course designed and delivered to all of the institution's managers at the
central, regional and area levels. The course focused on public negotiation and
leadership of and strategic planning in public institutions, and culminated with the
preparation of its strategic plan. The strategico Plan clearly identifies the MOH's
regulatory role in the health sector under one broad strategic area, with five specific
objectives: (i) strengthen and maintain health surveillance activities; (ii) formulate the
National Health Policy and strategic plans in health; (iii) oversee the use of financing for
public health to guarantee equitable access to health services and protection of the
environment; (iv) develop, maintain and promote the national system of scientific and
technological development in health; and (v) develop and monitor the system for impact
evaluation of health programs. The Plan also contains institutional actions and
requirements for accomplishing these objectives, and detailed indicators and time-bound
targets for the three-year period, and is available to the public on MOH's website. Those
requirements include, among other things, the modernization of the MOH's information
technology platform, which the Project supported through purchase of equipment,
software, training and systems design. At the same time, it was considered important that
the general public understand the MOH's new regulatory role, and a Communications
Plan was prepared and is currently being implemented.

73.      With technical assistance supported by the Project, the MOH developed standards
for hospitals; designed a sustainable accreditation process that emphasizes the evaluation
of hospital processes and results to be rolled out country-wide; trained interdisciplinary
and inter-institutional teams in carrying out the accreditation process; designed a system
for analyzing the resulting information; and created, defined and strengthen the
institutional structure needed to ensure its sustainability. The new hospital standards
cover the following areas: (i) attention to patients; (ii) emergencies; (iii) obstetrics; (iv)
operating facilities; (v) human resources; (vi) information management; (vii)
environmental management; (viii) leadership; and (ix) training and internships (for
hospitals with medical training programs). Four pilot hospitals (a national, a regional, a
local and a private hospital) were selected for rolling out the accreditation process.
Twenty-two external evaluators and six evaluators from the MOH's Dirección de
Servicios de Salud, Unidad de Acreditación responsible for accreditation received
training on the evaluation process, and the respective coordinators in each of the four
hospitals received training on preparing a self-evaluation to start the process. Following
the self-evaluation, the accreditation process was continued through the visit of the
external evaluators (in teams of two, including an external evaluator and one from the
MOH) and the preparation of the evaluation report, including requirement for follow-up
by the hospital to receive accreditation. Recommendations from the pilot experience
include: (i) MOH should establish a continuous program of training in hospital

                                             22
accreditation; (ii) minor adjustments should be made in providing to hospitals a better
understanding of what to expect; (iii) MOH should develop a pre-selection checklist so
that hospitals can determine their stage of preparation for accreditation; and (iv) the
process of twinning internal and external evaluators should be continued in order to
maintain the credibility of the accreditation process.

(c) To improve the quality and efficiency of CCSS' health delivery system by
supporting decentralization of decision-making, consolidation of the primary care
delivery network based on a population-based system, and introduction of
performance-based incentives for providers;

74.     The Project achieved the above objective with minor shortcomings. As described
under the first objective in this Section and in the table below, CCSS made significant
progress in decentralizing decision-making, consolidating the primary health care
delivery networks and introducing performance-based incentives to providers. CCSS
reports that in 2008, 70 percent of the targets set in the aggregate of its management
agreements (Compromisos de Gestión) were met. The CCSS was able to improve the
overall quality and efficiency of health services delivered through several efforts: (i) a
significant expansion in the number of operating EBAIS; (ii) performance agreements
with health care providers; (iii) the development of guidelines for ambulatory surgeries;
(iv) extensive training efforts for both hospital administrators and staff of health units in
decentralized management (on normative and legal aspects of health networks, planning,
health care delivery models, human resource management, among other topics),
supported by subprojects that financed medical equipment, information technology
equipment and software; and (v) technical assistance for process improvements in health
units. In all, 60 subprojects financed some combination of the above inputs for 17 health
areas, 6 peripheral hospitals, 13 regional hospitals, and 7 national hospitals, for a total
value of US$6.2 millions

75.     A pilot plan for ambulatory surgery was introduced in two national hospitals and
one regional hospital, and has since been expanded to another national hospital. In all,
ambulatory services have increased, and now represent about 40 percent of all hospital
discharges, more than double the initial target. In its 2008 Annual Report, CCSS reports
that as a result of this plan, the waiting list for surgery at the national level has dropped
for the first time in five years. In addition, the first three hospitals to participate in the
pilot plan reported that their surgery waiting lists have dropped by about 30 percent, on
average.

(d) reduce inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical sub-sector and promote rational drug
use by introducing changes in the planning, purchasing and distribution of
pharmaceuticals and supplies;

76.     This objective was achieved with only minor shortcomings. A key activity was
the introduction of an integrated pharmaceutical information system, Sistema Integrado
en Farmacia (SIFA) that monitors and follows pharmaceuticals through purchasing,
                                              25
distribution, inventory management and dispensing to patients. Approximately 86
percent of CCSS' health units were linked to the system in January 2010, and plans are in
place to cover the remainder by the end of the year. Survey results show that waiting
times for pharmaceuticals have dropped by as much as 50 percent, while around 98
percent of needed pharmaceuticals are on hand at any given time. Further, SIFA has
delivered other important results: (i) errors in dispensing medications and prescriptions
have been reduced, especially for patients that are treated in different health units; (ii)
users' prescription history is recorded, feeding into the system for purchasing and
distribution; (iii) inventory costs have been reduced; (iv) SIFA facilitates purchasing and
distribution based on epidemiological characteristics of beneficiaries by health unit; (v)
SIFA permits improved budget planning based on better estimates of purchasing
requirements, not only at the national level but at the level of health units as well; and (vi)
SIFA reduces wastage of unutilized pharmaceuticals.

77.     CCSS also reviewed and introduced improvements in pharmaceutical and medical
equipment procurement arrangements looking carefully at local legislation, costs, and
services offered by providers, process control and packaging quantities. CCSS also
implemented measures to reduce storage costs for pharmaceuticals. By redesigning its
arrangements for storage of pharmaceuticals, relying to a greater extent on its own
storage facilities as opposed to contracted facilities, CCSS estimates from April 2008
(when it introduced these arrangements) through December 2008 it was able to reduce
storage costs by about C. 265 million (US$511,7216). The decrease was approximately
20 percent in December 2008. Finally, the Project financed a technical, legal and
financial feasibility study of a new model of inventory control for CCSS and later the
development and implementation of a bar code system, with the goal of more precise
identification of the products that CCSS produces and purchases, in order to have better
control of the institution's physical inventory.

78.      A Technical, Legal and Financial Feasibility Study for a New Model of
Management for CCSS Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies Inventory aimed to analyze
and evaluate the policies, standards, criteria and variables that existed within CCSS; and
to assess the efficiency of the theoretical and practical procedures used for the planning
and programming of the pharmaceutical supply cycle. The study measured the impact of
the pharmaceutical inventory purchased under the legal, financial and technical criteria
established by the CCSS, its terms and conditions, and the entire process of the
institution's supply chain, both at the central and the local level. In addition, the study
was designed to define operating financial, and other costs, as well as current centralized
methods for procuring goods. Finally, the study developed a situational analysis on the
status and condition of the infrastructure of the Central Warehouse, the Puntarenas
Warehouse, pharmacy warehouses, suppliers for hospitals and health areas, and the
infrastructure of warehouses of the production plants. The analysis was designed to
establish their current capacity to meet their obligations: receiving, storage, control,
rotation and distribution, among others. It would also determine the impact on the

(e) Develop financial mechanisms that will improve the equitable distribution of

CCSS' capacity to collect payroll contributions.

79.     Progress towards the above objective was achieved, with some shortcomings, in
the implementation of programmed activities. Equity, as defined by the indicator
selected to measure progress, improved under the Project. The gap between the average
per capita spending in the Brunca Region and the National Average was reduced from 46
percent in 2002 to 13.1 percent in 2009, an overall reduction of about 72 percent

80.     The Project financed the purchase of software, as well as continued training for
users on how to utilize the software to establish a system of 25 Diagnostic Related
Groups. The information for the Diagnostic Related Groups that has been compiled is
being used for decision making in regards to resource distribution and will be
incorporated in the payment mechanisms for hospitals in the future. As explained in
Section 2.2, the IMAS component was never implemented. As an alternative, CCSS
opted to utilize and update an internal beneficiary registry, the Ficha Familiar, that
contains extensive socio-economic information and information on usage of the health
system for all beneficiaries in a given region. The Project financed the design of the
Ficha Familiar system and the purchase of small laptops for surveyors, as well as a pilot
survey in one region of the country. The information currently exists for other regions,
but needs to be updated through household surveys and incorporated in the information
system. Further efforts to expand the system will require additional staff, training, and
computer equipment for surveyors. Costa Rica's centralized collection system (Sistema
Centralizado de Recaudación - SICERE) was consolidated and expanded, through
training and through development of improved reporting methods (i.e., web-based) and
other systems improvements.        These efforts produced impressive results. From
November 2007 to November 2008, collections increased by 68 percent among
employers (number of employers) and 71 percent among workers (number of workers).

3.3 Efficiency

                                                 28
81.     An ex-post economic analysis was not prepared. However, the Project's impact
on the overall efficiency of CCSS health services provision can be inferred from the
assumptions in the Project's economic analysis carried out during preparation. The
analysis forecast that, at completion, the Project would produce substantial savings for
the sector, primarily through reductions in hospitalization costs resulting from
ambulatory surgery. Another area of savings (the economic analysis considered direct
benefits only) was to be derived from improvements in the management of the
pharmaceutical supply chain. The long and complex bidding process for pharmaceuticals
that led to the need to keep excess inventory, which caused problems in the storage and
distribution of drugs, was causing sizable losses to the CCSS. Finally, the Project was
expected to lead to reductions in overhead from increasing decentralization, specifically
administrative savings that would be produced by reorganization and improved
management information systems in the MOH and CCSS.

82.     At the time of Project completion, 40 percent of all hospital discharges in Costa
Rica were the result of ambulatory surgeries, as opposed to a target of 20 percent upon
which the Project's ex-ante economic analysis had been based. Similarly, the entirety of
the CCSS pharmaceutical budget is now managed under the integrated pharmaceutical
information and distribution system, Sistema Integrado en Farmacia (SIFA), developed
by the CCSS under the Project. In addition to these benefits, the time interval between
bids and delivery of pharmaceuticals has been reduced by an average of about 50 percent.
All pharmacies within the CCSS are connected to SIFA, which has resulted in improved
inventory control, reduced wastage, and reduced waiting times for patients to have
prescriptions filled as well as greater standardization across different levels of health
centers.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.     The Project's Overall Outcome Rating is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This
rating is based on the Project's continued high relevance, the increased efficiency that it
brought to the CCSS, and the progress toward achievement of its objectives, as presented
in Section 3.2. On balance, the Project achieved most of its objectives with only minor
shortcomings. There were significant shortcomings in the achievement of improving the
equitable distribution of resources, or at least in the ability to substantiate this
achievement. This issue undoubtedly in part resulted from cancellation of the activities
that were to be implemented by IMAS, as well as the resulting late start of activities to
update and expand the Ficha Familiar that would have been instrumental in providing
the information required for achieving greater equity in resource allocation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                            29
84.     As mentioned above, it is difficult to measure the Project's impact on poverty
since the updating of the SIPO was never carried out, and the Ficha Familiar was only
implemented on a pilot basis in three Health Areas (Talamanca, Alajuelita, y Puntarenas).
The Project did have some direct impacts on indigenous groups, through implementation
of a subproject which aimed to create a real-time mobile census of all families in an
indigenous area. The census was designed to analyze 250 variables covering information
on the health, economic, social, environment and cultural status of each family, which
would allow improved decision making and better targeting of the real needs of
indigenous communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

85.     The Project was by and large and institutional development project that, despite
the delays that it encountered, had an important role in strengthening the CCSS and MOH
in several areas described in Section 3.2. The most important institutional development
results include: (i) the separation of financing and service provision functions within a
decentralized framework; (ii) the strengthening of the MOH regulatory capacity; (iii)
strengthened capacity of CCSS for delivering health care services through decentralized
networks, the purchasing of those services under performance contracts, and for planning
and distributing pharmaceuticals; and (iv) the development and piloting of the Ficha
Familiar in three health areas as the basis for improving regional equity through formula-
based allocations based on population, risk-adjustment and poverty.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low to Negligible

86.      The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Low to Negligible. The
Project's main contribution was in supporting the restructuring of the CCSS and MOH
and developing institutional capacity to carry out their newly-defined functions under the
health reform. CCSS' Strategic Plan 2007-2012 sets out the institution's policies,
priorities, institutional plans and proposed investments that envisage the continued
pursuit of the Project's objectives. Similarly, the MOH's current Strategic Plan reinforces
the institution's regulatory function within the overall framework of the Government's
vision of the health sector. The functional changes in the national health system count on
strong support from across the political spectrum, and also from the beneficiaries who
count on more equitable, quality health care since health service delivery is seen as a key
pillar of Costa Rica's public social services. Change is slow in Costa Rica, mostly
because of the country's strong democratic tradition that relies on a system of gradual
consensus building and institutional accountability during any reform process. But these

                                            30
very same issues that affected project implementation by causing multiple delays almost
guarantee the long-term political and social sustainability of the Project's outcomes. As
the backbone of the country's social insurance, CCSS counts on the necessary funding
from workers' and employers' contributions to continue its pursuit of delivering high-
quality, efficient and equitable health services to its beneficiaries.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory
based on the factors mentioned below.

88.     Strategic Relevance. The strongest element of the Bank's performance in
ensuring quality at entry related to the Project's strategic relevance, which was very high.
The Project represented a continuation of support that the Bank had provided in an earlier
operation and was the next logical step in the country's health reform, a high priority for
the Government. Project design incorporated lessons learned under the previous Bank-
financed project, including findings and recommendation of technical studies and
evaluations of the experience with the reform process on the primary health care model
(EBAIS), the management contracts through the annual reports, an assessment of the
pharmaceutical sector and policy options, a public expenditure review and patient
satisfaction surveys.

89.     State of Project Preparation. As mentioned in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, there were
several aspects of preparation that, in retrospect, were not sufficiently advanced or
completed at the time of approval/effectiveness. These aspects later affected the
Project's implementation. Although approval of external financing by Costa Rica's
Assembly normally involves a period of time after approval during which preparation
could be advanced, it is not clear that even preliminary agreements had been reached on
the content of what would be required. Thus, finalizing initial agreements and documents
continued through the stages of early implementation.

90.     Fiduciary Aspects. The Bank's preparation team rightly addressed the possibility
of issues with procurement that could affect implementation. Unfortunately, the solution
that was pursued did little to resolve delays in procurement, and, furthermore, did not
address the issue that delays were caused not only through the requirement of ex-ante
approval by the Contraloria, but also through the requirement of ex-ante approval by the
CCSS Junta Directiva for larger contracts.

91.    Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. A very detailed monitoring and
evaluation framework, supported by a detailed Policy Action Schedule, was in place at
approval. As mentioned in Section 2.1, however, it is not clear why the Bank opted to

                                            31
support the contracting out of the Project's M&E, under a contract to be financed with
loan funds. As the Project supported basically the strengthening of institutions capacity
to deliver health services under the Government's health reform, monitoring and
evaluation of those institutions and the programs and activities that they financed should
have been seen as an integral element in their institutional capacity strengthening.

92.     Risk Assessment. As described in Section 2.1, the Project's Risk Framework
underestimated or did not make explicit several risks that emerged, although in retrospect
since this was the follow-up to an operation that was rated Highly Satisfactory, these
risks might have been difficult to envisage at the time of preparation. One of these risks
includes the fact that, while the institutional capacity of the CCSS was rated satisfactory
based on the rating of the previous HPR project, the Project was unable to foresee that
additional internal supervision procedures put in place, which stemmed from corruption
allegations made to the CCSS, exacerbated the already cumbersome procurement
procedures, rendering the CCSS unable to perform at its potential capacity.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Bank supervision
can be separated in two phases: from approval through 2006 and then from 2006 until
loan closing.

94.     From Approval through 2006. The Bank's supervision from approval, through an
extended period until effectiveness was focused almost exclusively on getting the Project
ready for implementation. In part because of the issues with the quality of preparation
described above, early implementation had to address many tasks that should have been
completed before project effectiveness. These include such issues as agreeing upon
drafts of operations manuals, interagency agreements, procurement plans, other
effectiveness conditions, etc. Because of this, during early implementation Bank
supervision was unable to focus its supervision around development impact. In
retrospect, the Project likely received less supervision inputs than would have been
justified for a project that was facing such important implementation issues. At the same
time, early supervision was slow to take action to downgrade project ratings, almost
seeming to take the position that there was little that the Bank could do to contribute to
resolving Costa Rica's internal issues. During this period, Bank Supervision is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

95.     From 2006 through Project Completion and Loan Closing. Supervision changed
dramatically starting in 2007. This change was precipitated in part by the Project's
continued unsatisfactory implementation performance, the perception that unless
implementation improved dramatically, the Project would not have a chance of meeting
its development objectives and that project restructuring should be discussed as an option
to improve performance. A detailed Action Plan was agreed with CCSS, and was
updated with progress reports and submitted monthly to the Bank. Supervision became
more intensive with focus on fiduciary aspects of the project and technical assistance, in

                                            32
general more hands-on, and for the first time focused on development impact and
monitoring progress towards the PAS and Action Matrix. The Bank provided support for
procurement, through training and several special missions; although in the end it is not
clear whether these actions had significant impact on shortening the delays in
procurement actions. During this period, Bank Supervision is rated as Satisfactory.

96.    Taking into consideration the Bank Supervision ratings for both periods as
described above, and the fact that supervision during the final period was able to turn
implementation around in an important manner, on balance Bank Supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97.     Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This is based on a
Moderately Satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry and an overall rating of Moderately
Satisfactory for Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     Government Performance is taken to mean the broader government, i.e., the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and other central government institutions. In this sense,
Government Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Throughout implementation,
the Government demonstrated commitment to achieving the Project's development
objectives which also supported social outcomes that the Government has consistently
prioritized in national policy. During preparation, the Government supported the CCSS
objectives, and made significant efforts to structure a project that responded to these
objectives. In spite of these positive efforts, the Project's implementation was affected
by several broader factors that were beyond the control of the implementing agencies, but
that were generally well-understood at the time of preparation. Costa Rica's internal
democratic and fiduciary framework is well-established, with well-defined mandates and
procedures. In many instances, these existing procedures influenced the pace and timing
of key decisions with respect to project preparation and implementation, especially when
Government's procedures (e.g., procurement) were not fully compatible with those of the
Bank. On the other hand, the cancellation of the loan resources allocated to IMAS was
justified since it was not possible to reach consensus on formalizing an agreement to
support implementation of the SIPO.

99.    The allegations of corruption in the CCSS resulted in increased scrutiny not only
on the activities of the implementing agency, but also in increased questioning of
financing technical assistance and consultancy contracts with external borrowing.
Despite its concerns regarding delays in implementation and efficient use of external
borrowing, the MOF agreed not to request cancellation of loan funding. Beyond that, the
Borrower provided an overall environment of stability, both institutional and otherwise,

                                           33
and an established process of continuous consultation and involvement that bodes well
for the sustainability of the Project's accomplishments.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. Implementing Agencies' Performance is taken to mean that of CCSS, and the
MOH, the two agencies responsible for implementing project activities.

101. The CCSS continuously demonstrated commitment to the Project's development
objectives, which were fully congruent with its own objectives. As discussed in the
section covering Bank Performance for Supervision above, however, it is relevant to
disaggregate CCSS' performance by phases, done below.

102. Project preparation flowed immediately from the final phases of the HRP's
implementation. The Project's design and implementation arrangements also followed
those of the HRP. When loan effectiveness was delayed, the CCSS continued
implementing the logical next steps in their reform with internal resources, and began
implementation of certain activities under the Project that were considered inherent to
CCSS' internal program. Unfortunately, the delays in implementation, coupled with the
allegations against the CCSS' former Executive President, and the HRP's former Project
Manager, had a noticeable impact on the pace with which all CCSS programs, including
the Project, were implemented. With an internal investigation ongoing, CCSS planned
activities slowed, as did any efforts to decentralize activities. The increased scrutiny
invariably affected staffing decisions as well as individual staff's disposition to make
decisions that might later be challenged. During early implementation, CCSS'
performance would be rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Although efforts towards the
PAS continued, they did so at a very slow pace.

103. With new leadership starting in mid-2006, CCSS performance improved
dramatically. The entire institution remained not only committed to the Project's
objectives, but also to improve its implementation and recover some of the time that had
been lost during its first four years. One of the first decisions made by the institution's
leadership was to modify what had been the Project Coordinating Unit's (PCU) reporting
relationship. The PCU was moved to an operational directorate -- first the Directorate of
Operations and then the Directorate of Infrastructure and Technology -- and was
transformed into a Project Implementing Unit (PIU) that worked in coordination with
other CCSS Directorates. An increased focus on the Project and its financing resulted in
the appointment of highly qualified and experienced staff to the PIU. The new staff had
the knowledge and authority necessary to make decisions, as well as a "can-do" attitude
that put plans into action. During this phase, the PIU put into place an ambitious Action
Plan which was supported the Bank with a stronger and more intense supervision. The
PIU monitored the Action Plan regularly and followed up on compliance when necessary.
As a result of these efforts, the Project succeeded in accomplishing in a little over two
years what it had been unable to accomplish during the previous four or five. CCSS
performance during this period would be rated Highly Satisfactory.


                                            34
104. The MOH's performance was more stable, albeit from the start it had a smaller,
though no less important role in the country's health reform. The MOH had also been
perceived as having weaker implementation capacity than CCSS. However, the MOH
was able to carry out most of the planned activities under the Project, and therefore the
MOH is now in a stronger position to carry out its regulatory functions. Overall, its
performance would be rated Moderately Satisfactory.

105. Overall, the Implementing Agencies' performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory, in view of the serious problems during early implementation, that were in
the end compensated for by a strong, reinvigorated effort towards the accomplishment of
the Project's objectives in the later years.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106. Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory in view of similar
ratings for both Borrower and Implementing Agencies' Performance, as described above.

6. Lessons Learned

107. There are several Lessons Learned from the Project, with respect to its design and
implementation experience, that are relevant not only to similar projects, but also to the
design of projects in Costa Rica, or countries with similar environments.

Project Design

108. Procurement. Procurement delays, due to complex processes, or lack of
understanding of or incompatibility with Bank procurement procedures, are often cited as
a cause of delays in project implementation. In the case of this Project, the possibility of
issues with procurement had been identified up front, and actions expected to mitigate
potential delays had been prepared. In spite of this, the Project as implemented involved
a total of around 225 procurement processes, of which only three involved goods or
services costing over the equivalent of US$1 million. While the Bank's procurement
guidelines and processes are efficiency-enhancing, and the Bank should continue to work
with its clients to streamline their own internal processes and procedures (both in the
context of the projects it finances and on a broader basis), it is possible to design projects
that minimize potential procurement delays while supporting broader public sector
objectives. For example, it should be possible to design an investment project for
eventual Bank financing around the procurement of a small number of large contracts, for
which bidding specifications and documents could be detailed during preparation, or that
involves the financing of smaller, often called "non-procurable" items.

109. Effectiveness Delays. Effectiveness delays, taken here to mean delays of more
than six months in loan effectiveness following approval, are increasingly commonplace
in countries that require legislative approval of external financing. Although the Bank
has recently sought to minimize the number of effectiveness conditions as a means of

                                             35
ensuring timely project start-up, the reality is that there is often a long lag in effectiveness
pending legislative approval. This fact should be considered in the project's timetable as
one in which selected activities could be finalized, thereby permitting earlier loan
approval. Such a plan would require careful definition of what type of activity could be
"left" to be completed during this "waiting" period. Obviously, any activity requiring up-
front decision by the Government should be agreed in advance (e.g., in the case of the
Project, the agreement with IMAS), with specific arrangements and details further
elaborated after approval. Such an arrangement would also involve a change in how the
Bank addresses supervision during a project's early stages, shifting from waiting for a
government to comply to having the Bank actively engaged in supporting compliance,
similar to what is now done in the final phases of project preparation.

110. Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation should be an integral
part of project implementation. This is especially true in projects which focus on
institutional capacity strengthening, in support of what in the case of the Project was a
much broader government program. Monitoring should not be contracted out in most
instances. If the institutional capacity for monitoring is appraised as being weak, project
design should incorporate activities aimed at strengthening that capacity, which should be
viewed in the context of being part and parcel of strengthening an institution's overall
project management and implementation capacity.

Implementation

111. Reporting relationships of project units. The reporting relationship of a project
unit can have an important impact on project implementation. Under the Project, the
change in location of the PCU/PIU from the Office of the Executive President to an
operating directorate in the institution had an important impact in improving the
efficiency and pace of implementation. The change also resulted in a detailed Action
Plan that played an important role in turning the Project around (in addition to other
changes in the Project's operating environment). In this case, the Office of the Executive
President did not have capacity for project management or implementation, and the mere
fact that the unit reported to the Executive President did not result in greater Government
commitment to implementation. It is clear that in the case of the Project, the relocation of
its implementation responsibilities to the CCSS departments responsible for project
management, staffed with specialized managers and staff, resulted in a major
improvement.
