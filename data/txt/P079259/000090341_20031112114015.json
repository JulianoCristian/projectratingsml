{"cdata!": "The objectives of the proposed Community\n            Development Fund II Project will be to: (i) Improve the\n            quality, access, and availability of community\n            infrastructure and services in poor and conflict-affected\n            communities, and for the most vulnerable groups, including\n            returnees; and (ii) Promote institutional capacity building\n            at the community and municipal levels so as to improve the\n            quality and sustainability of service delivery, and enhance\n            greater stakeholder participation and empowerment in local\n            development. This project has the following three\n            components: Component 1) will finance on a grant basis,\n            small-scale community works and services projects selected\n            on a demand-driven basis with the active participation of\n            community groups and local governments. The Community\n            Infrastructure Sub-component will address the need for\n            rehabilitation and construction of small-scale social and\n            economic infrastructure at the local level through the\n            financing of community investment micro-projects. The\n            Community Social Services Sub-component will support\n            community services programs targeted to address the needs of\n            vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in Kosovo with a view to\n            promote inter-community integration by actively engaging\n            citizens in the development process of their communities.\n            Component 2) will complement the community investment\n            component, enabling local level institutions and community\n            groups to address the needs and priorities for local\n            development through a comprehensive capacity building\n            program which would be consistent with current transference\n            of responsibilities under the Mandate to establish\n            substantial self-government. At the Micro-project level,\n            institutional strengthening will focus on local governments,\n            communities and contractors participating in community\n            infrastructure and services micro-projects. At the local\n            government level the project will focus on capacity building\n            needs in municipalities with the aim of enhancing the\n            understanding of municipal authorities of their potential\n            role in facilitating and supporting community-based\n            initiatives to address major priorities. Component 3) will\n            support the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) covering\n            operating costs such as acquisition of minor\n            additional/replacements of office furniture and equipment,\n            communications, local travel, utilities and publications,\n            office rent, office supplies, fuel, internet service, bank\n            commission charges, vehicle maintenance and repair, and\n            Community Development Fund (CDF) staff salaries. It will\n            also finance financial audits."}, "docdt": "2003-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
