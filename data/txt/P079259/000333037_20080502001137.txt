1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Country Background

Kosovo is a small, landlocked, mountainous territory in South East Europe with a population
estimated at 2.1 million. Kosovo remains a province of Serbia, but has been under the
autonomous administration of the United Nations since 1999, consistent with United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1244. The majority of the population is of Albanian ethnicity (88
percent), followed by ethnic Serbians (7 percent), Slav Muslims (2 percent), Roma (2 percent),
and others (1 percent). Tensions between the Albanian and Serbian populations, especially
following the 1989-90 constitutional changes, led to conflicts which culminated in air strikes by
NATO between March and June 1999. The conflict ended in June 1999, leaving Kosovo with a
collapsed state of industrial and agricultural output. Inter-ethnic tensions remain high. The
Special Representative of the UN Secretary General (SRSG) remains the final legal authority and
responsibility for administering Kosovo is shared between the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government
(PISG).

Sector Background

Dimensions of Poverty. With a GNI per capita of US$1,170 at the time of the mid-term review,
Kosovo remains one of the poorer territories in Eastern Europe ­ largely reflecting the ethnic
conflict which intensified in 1998 and 1999.         The Kosovo Poverty Assessment (KPA) of
December 2001 found that Kosovo has one of the highest poverty rates in the region with 50
percent of the population living in poverty (less than US$2 a day per person) and 12 percent of
living in extreme poverty (less than US$1 a day).

Unemployment. According to the Kosovo Labor Market Study of June 2003, the most likely
unemployment rate in Kosovo was estimated at 23-33 percent of the labor force, although the
formal labor market analysis based on adjusted labor force survey data indicated an estimate of
around 40 percent in 2001. The KPA found that after a decade of discrimination, Albanians felt
discouraged in their job search, and therefore stopped looking for work. According to labor
source surveys, youth unemployment was estimated at 69 percent in 2001. Kosovo is one of two
post-conflict areas in South-East Europe affected by youth population bulges and high rates of
school leaving, youth unemployment, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and young
male suicide. Youth risks are the highest in Kosovo due to the combined conditions of conflict,
poverty, and high levels of youth unemployment.

Educational Standards. Education in Kosovo suffered a setback in the 1990s following the
adoption of Serbian as the official language for formal education.             Consequently, ethnic
Albanians were forced to adopt an informal parallel system of education at the primary,
secondary, and tertiary levels.     The lack of adequate school infrastructure has resulted in
overcrowding and poor access to schools. The provision of education was severely curtailed in
the areas affected by the conflict. This lack of access to formal education in the 1990s resulted in




                                                  1

an increase of illiteracy from 15 to 22 percent among 16 to 25 year olds. Furthermore, the lack of
adequate school infrastructure resulted in overcrowding in and poor access to schools.

Health Standards. Kosovo ranks the lowest in Europe on virtually every health indicator. At the
time of project appraisal, the infant mortality rate of 45 deaths per 1,000 live births was the
highest in Europe. Access to health care (in terms of distance to facilities) is constrained by the
shortage of primary health clinics, especially in the rural areas. Kosovo's health status is
negatively affected by severe inadequacies in safe drinking water and sewerage disposal.

Displacement of Population. The 1999 conflict destroyed 700 villages and caused 10-12,000
casualties and missing people. The KPA found that 70 percent of the population was displaced
during the 1999 conflict. At the time of the KPA, 4 percent of the total population and 8 percent
of all Serbs were internally displaced and an additional 3 percent were diaspora returnees who
were outside Kosovo before the conflict. The study found that both categories were twice as
likely to be extremely poor as the rest of the population due to poor access to land and lack of
non-agricultural employment opportunities.       Many rural communities are in the process of
disintegration due to migratory movements, isolation and poverty.

Institutional Capacity at the Local Level.       The lack of institutional capacity at the local
government and community levels to effectively address social sector issues remains a major
problem and is due to: (i) institutionally weak local governments with limited financial resources;
(ii) inadequate systems of accounting, financial planning, and budgeting; (iii) the lack of effective
partnerships; (iv) the lack of citizen involvement in the decision-making process in development
activities and service provision; and (v) citizen lack of access to basic information regarding
services and entitlements, particularly in rural areas. While some of the larger municipalities
have received attention through donor-assisted programs, smaller municipalities, along with local
communities, particularly in rural and remote locations, are receiving much less attention and
financial support.

Government Priorities and the Rationale for Bank Assistance

PISG's current development strategy aims at addressing the above-mentioned issues.
Accordingly, the four broad priorities of the PISG are: (i) fostering economic development and
growth, and increasing employment; (ii) improving the living standards of vulnerable groups, and
enhancing the quality of and access to education and health; (iii) ensuring an efficient and
transparent public administration; and (iv) providing equal opportunities for all citizens. The
Community Development Fund (CDF) II was designed to support the second, third, and fourth of
these priorities.

The CDF I project made significant progress in local level capacity building, focused on training
project committee members in preparing project proposals, developing business plans, enhancing
community participation and partnerships with local governments and NGOs, selection of
contractors, and supervising project implementation. However, more needed to be done to
establish and strengthen relationships among the local stakeholders.

The CDF II was designed to address poverty through rehabilitation or construction of small-scale
social and economic infrastructure, and by targeting project funds to the poorest, especially those
in remote isolated villages, and in mixed and minority communities, including returnees. The
project supported the PISG's programs which are aimed at improving service delivery in health,
education, and social assistance to communities within a decentralized framework. Support was



                                                 2

provided through technical assistance and training to local government officials in areas relevant
to the project.

The CDF II Project is an integral part of the Bank's development assistance strategy for Kosovo
as set out in the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, Bank Report 24275-KOS). The TSS was
endorsed by the Board on July 25, 2002. As noted in the TSS, although Kosovo has moved
beyond the emergency phase and much of the reconstruction has been completed, it faces many
of the structural issues as other low-income, rural, transition economies. The main focus of the
Bank's assistance program is on poverty reduction. Accordingly, the financial assistance program
provided for the Community Development Fund II Project (US$ 4 million), which is essentially a
continuation of the previous project, targeting the poor and vulnerable groups, especially in the
conflict-affected and rural areas.

The medium- and long-term challenge of the CDF II Project was to build upon the
decentralization process started under the first operation, and move forward to an integrated
development framework responsive to the priorities of the poor, vulnerable groups, and returnees.
The most vulnerable groups include the disabled, the elderly, widows, the destitute, victims of the
conflict, children at risk, mixed and minority communities, and communities in remote and
mountainous villages.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objectives of the CDF II Project were to: (i) improve the quality, access, and availability of
community infrastructure and services in poor and conflict-affected communities, and for the
most vulnerable groups, including returnees; and (ii) promote institutional capacity building at the
community and municipal levels so as to improve the quality and sustainability of service
delivery, and enhance stakeholder participation and empowerment in local development.

The project was designed to support key policy and institutional reforms consistent with the
Government's current development strategy and the related mandate to establish substantial self-
government. The project was to support the efforts to transfer responsibilities from UNMIK to the
PISG and municipalities by strengthening their capacity to absorb and carry out their new
responsibilities within the development framework of the project.

The key performance indicators of the CDF II project reflect monitorable outcomes and impacts
covering key project activities. These include quantitative indicators relating to project benefits
and qualitative assessments of demand-driven mechanisms, service delivery, and community
participation. The specific areas that were assessed include: (i) processes relating to poverty
targeting, participatory mechanisms, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation; (ii)
outputs relating to successful completion of cost-effective and good quality community
infrastructure and services projects which are sustainable, and those relating to timely and
effective capacity building programs benefiting local governments and communities, as well as
capacity building at the national level to effectively carry out poverty monitoring on a regular
basis; and (iii) project impact in terms of social and economic benefits to poor communities in
rural and urban areas relating to the improvement of the quality and availability of community
infrastructure and services in poor and conflict-affected communities, and increased institutional
capacity at the local level.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project objectives and key indictors were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The main beneficiaries of the CDF II Project included the poor and vulnerable groups. The
Project focused on the disabled, the elderly, widows, the destitute, victims of conflict, children at
risk, mixed and minority communities, and communities in remote and mountainous villages. The
Project also targeted Serbian communities which were living in `enclaves' with poor
infrastructure facilities. The Project also targeted returnees a group that had a different set of
problems arising from internal displacement in Kosovo such as poor access to land, the lack of
non-agricultural employment opportunities, and poor housing.         Because other donors were
providing financial support for returnee-oriented projects, the CDF II Project provided
administrative support in the implementation of housing microprojects for the returnees which
were financed by other donors.

The lack of a population census was a major impediment to constructing a poverty map for
Kosovo.     However, the availability of poverty indicators following the Bank's Poverty
Assessment Report of 2001 provided an opportunity to improve the CDF's methodology of
targeting project funds. Accordingly, the design of the CDF II Project included an improved two-
stage poverty targeting strategy (see Annex 10 for details) consisting of: (i) a regional allocation
mechanism based on population estimates, poverty indicators from this Poverty Assessment
Report; and (ii) detailed criteria at the community level. The existence of extremely poor
communities, living in isolated and remote villages or pockets of poverty without access to basic
public services, was a cause for concern and was addressed through the second stage of the CDF
II poverty targeting strategy. It was recognized that while economic growth helped reduce the
overall level of poverty, a well designed poverty targeting strategy and specific anti-poverty
interventions were required to meet the needs of the extremely poor and vulnerable.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Project Component 1 - US$3.33 million

Community Investment Projects

This component was to finance small-scale community infrastructure and services projects
selected with the active participation of community groups and local governments. These types of
projects are important in getting communities to work together in designing and implementing
community projects which yield visible and immediate improvements for the common good of
the community. The CDF II team was to focus their efforts on strengthening the demand
orientation of projects, community outreach and participation.

Community Infrastructure Sub-component: This subcomponent was to address the need for
rehabilitation and construction of small-scale social and economic infrastructure at the local level.
These investments are necessary for economic growth, employment creation, human development



                                                 4

and poverty reduction. To ensure sustainability of project outcomes, the CDF II Project would
finance a comprehensive capacity building and technical assistance program, benefiting
Community Project Committees, local governments, and contractors. The microprojects were to
be carried out by Community Project Committees (CPCs) and focus on renovation, rehabilitation,
or construction of key infrastructure mainly covering education (i.e., kindergarten, primary and
secondary schools), health (i.e. primary health care facilities), small-scale water supply and
sewerage, community access roads, and other priority sectors. In addition, this sub-component
included the financing of consultant services for microproject design and supervision to assure
good quality works.

Community Social Services Sub-component: This subcomponent was to support community
services programs targeted to address the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to
promote inter-community integration by actively engaging citizens in development. Community
services projects were to be carried out by qualified local NG0s and would focus on a wide range
of programs benefiting different groups in support of the decentralized management of basic
social services. Some of these programs were designed to include: community health awareness
and education including dissemination of information and workshops on safe motherhood and on
treatment of sexually transmitted diseases; assistance for returning families; community-based
day care centers for the disabled, elderly and other marginalized and vulnerable groups; support
for inter-ethnic activities such as sports events and open market places; and literacy courses for
elderly women, civic education for minority children, sewing classes, computer courses, and
special programs for women who were victims of violence during the war.

Project Component 2 - US$0.25 million
Institutional Capacity Building

This component was to complement the community investment component, enabling local level
institutions and community groups to address the needs and priorities for local development
through a comprehensive capacity building program. A community profiling, needs, and capacity
assessment was to be carried out as a first step to systematically identify the priority social needs
of communities. The proposed local level institutional strengthening program was to focus on two
key levels, the microproject level and the local government level.

At the microproject level, institutional strengthening was to focus on local governments,
communities and contractors participating in community infrastructure and services
microprojects. The focus was to be on building the capacity of local groups to plan, manage,
operate, supervise and maintain investments and improve the quality and availability of local
service provision. At every phase of the microproject cycle, promotion, appraisal and follow-up
teams from the PIU were to provide technical, managerial and organizational support--including
on-the-job training--to the local groups. At the local government level, the project was to focus
on enhancing the understanding of municipal authorities of their potential role in facilitating and
supporting community-based initiatives. The training was to support local governments to: (i)
develop, plan and manage budgets related to community investments; (ii) acquire a basic
knowledge of asset management of public facilities rehabilitated or constructed under the CDF II
Project; and (iii) improve communications and information flows to local communities and
marginalized groups, as well as to the donor community.

Project Component 3 - US$ 0.84 million
Project Management

This component was to support the PIU and cover operating costs such as office furniture and
equipment, communications, local travel, utilities and publications, office rent, office supplies,
fuel, internet service, bank commission charges, vehicle maintenance and repair, and CDF staff
salaries. It was also to finance financial audits.

Project Financing

The majority of project financing was to come from a US$4 million IDA Grant financing. The
communities would contribute US$420,000 as their share of community investment costs. A
CIDA Grant of US$800,000 provided support to the components focusing on social services,
institutional strengthening, and technical assistance in support of consultancies for project design
and supervision, and support to the Project Management Unit. About 74 percent of the CIDA
grant was for the community social services component, 16 percent for consultant services, and
10 percent for project operating costs. Bank supervision was carried out systematically with
CIDA counterparts. All progress reports were submitted to CIDA on a timely basis and CIDA
did not raise any issues during project implementation. (see Annex 9 for CIDA's comments)

1.6 Revised Components

None.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

There were no significant changes.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at Entry. The project's quality at entry was satisfactory. Although it was a follow-up to
the CDF I Project, its design had a number of new features such as an integrated development
framework to enhance community participation and capacity building at the local level, an
improved poverty targeting strategy, and greater attention to cost-effectiveness. The project
design addressed its objectives to "improve the quality, access, and availability of community
infrastructure and services in poor and conflict-affected communities and to promote institutional
capacity building." They were consistent with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS).

Poverty Targeting.      Notwithstanding the modest size of the CDF II (US$4.0 million), the
objective of the regional allocation was to ensure equity across regions and all ethnic groups in
the use of CDF II Project funds and to provide the basis for planning the disbursement of project
funds to the poorest segments of the population. The allocation mechanism also included
additional flexibility in dealing with the Serbian, mixed and minority communities, including
returnees through two special funds (see below and also Annex 10).




                                                  6

A two-stage poverty targeting strategy (see Annex 10) experience gained over the four-year
implementation period of the Kosovo CDF I Project; (ii) key lessons learned in Bank funded
projects in supporting the transition of countries involved in conflict; and (iii) World Bank
experience with social funds in more than 95 countries since 1987.

Community based approach.             The design of the project was based on a successful
implementation of CDF I which demonstrated how a community-based project can serve as a
catalyst for a process in which targeted communities, especially mixed and minority
communities, gradually come together and participate in the design, implementation and
monitoring of projects for the common good of the community. Furthermore, setting aside funds
for mixed and minority communities has proven to be an effective mechanism for ensuring
equitable access to project resources.

Consistency with other Development Programs. Social fund projects have shown that it is
critical that social fund activities are consistent with social sector strategy priorities, government
reform programs, and activities of municipal, NGO, UN, and donor agencies. Under the CDF II
project, this was achieved through the Project Steering Committee - - a new institutional structure
under the CDF II Project. The Committee was established by a Government Decision and
consisted of one representative from key relevant ministries including: (i) the Ministries of
Education, Science and Technology, Health, Labor and Social Welfare, Local Governance,
Returnees, Environment and Spatial Planning, and Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development.
The key role of the Steering Committee was to ensure consistency of the CDF work programs
with Kosovo's social sector strategies and Government reform programs in relevant sectors. It
was to be further strengthened through the implementation of an effective information, outreach,
and communications strategy.

Project Sustainability. Social fund operations in the region have clearly demonstrated the need
to improve project sustainability. Experience has pointed to the development of a comprehensive
framework encompassing strong institutional support from the Project PIU, effective systems and
procedures, and greater involvement of key stakeholders. Based on these experiences, procedures
were put in place under the CDF II to: (i) improve the quality of works through compliance with
technical standards and close supervision; (ii) develop the capacity of local authorities to help
formulate budgets which provide adequate financing for operation and maintenance of completed
microprojects; (iii) carry out effective monitoring and evaluation under the joint responsibility of
the PIU and the project committees; (iv) strengthen local government and community
involvement in the design, implementation, and maintenance of microprojects; and (v) enhance
information dissemination activities. (see also section 4 below)

Project Preparation. The background analysis and rationale for Bank support was thorough and
provided a solid ground for the proposal. The design was not complex or unrealistic. The project
was a high priority for the PISG and other stakeholders. The project preparation team prudently
assessed the operation's risks and made suitable provisions for mitigating them. The importance
given by the project team to project preparation, design and quality at entry was critical to the
successful implementation and outcomes of the CDF II Project.

The project objectives were sensitive to, and realistic about, the tensions between the majority
Albanian population and Serb minorities. These had been worsened by such actions as the
banning of the use of the Albanian language in schools. Following the 1989-90 constitutional
changes, Serb officials reduced local authorities' autonomy, removed 150,000 Albanians from the
civil service and denied badly needed funds for infrastructure. After the conflict, there were inter-
ethnic disputes following the return of a relatively small number of Serbs. These restrictions


                                                   7

needed to be undone in order to meet the UN resolution's call for Kosovo's "substantial
autonomy and meaningful self-administration."           Therefore, the project design opted for
channeling IDA assistance through a community-based vehicle for public services, responsive to
citizens' priorities and aimed at strengthening local institutions.

There was no Quality Assessment Group assessment of the project's preparation.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Following the successful completion of the CDF I Project in December 2003, the CDF II project
was launched in January 2004 and gathered momentum very quickly. The first six months
focused on promotional activities in all five regions of Kosovo. The promotional team targeted 24
out of 30 municipalities and 75 communities including one Serb community and one mixed
community. During this period, a total of 1,971 community members participated in general
community meetings organized by the CDF promotion team, of whom 226 were women and 742
were youth. A total of 207 community members joined Community Project Committees (CPCs).
Following this intensive period of promotional activities, the CDF moved forward with the next
phase of activities covering appraisal, procurement and implementation of infrastructure and
social services projects.

In response to the recommendations of the June 2005 supervision mission, to ensure the
sustainability of social services projects implemented under the project at the local level, the CDF,
in partnership with the Ministry of Labor and Social Services, initiated an integrated social
services pilot project covering the coordination, management, training and monitoring and
supervision of social services projects at the local level. This pilot directly supported the
Government's decentralization legislation focusing on social and family services and on local-self
government.

The first phase included in-depth assessment of the social service delivery situation in the pilot
region covering three municipalities and the development of a training proposal to build the
capacity of local municipal officials, staff of Social Service Centers, and NGO representatives.
The social service delivery assessment was carried out by a respected local firm from June to
August 2006. The assessment was carried out with the close cooperation of the Ministry of Labor
and Social Welfare, the municipalities selected, and the CDF. The main goal of this work was to
increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of the provision of social services. The
key tasks were: (i) analysis and assessment of the key roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Welfare, the Centers for Social Works and the respective Municipal
Directorates; (ii) analysis of service delivery including perceived gaps; and (iii) identification of
capacity gaps at key levels.

The assessment found agencies with overlapping responsibilities, lack of coordination with regard
to social service delivery, lack of clarity on the roles and mandates, lack of strategic planning at
the municipal level, lack of communication and understanding within and among social services
and with citizens, weak monitoring systems, inadequate social service standards, insufficient staff
at social service institutions, lack of specific services, concentration of social services in urban
areas, and the need for capacity building. The CDF conducted a second phase of the social
services pilot which consisted of training programs for the capacity gaps identified in the
assessment and the implementation of priority social services projects identified by communities.



                                                  8

Two technical assessments were conducted during 2006. The aim of the technical assessments
was to provide a professional opinion on the technical quality of CDF II projects.             The
assessments included the technical quality, field implementation, preliminary documents prepared
for tender announcements, documents for contractor's selection, and quality of works by the
supervising consultants, project operations and maintenance, and the need for further
interventions. It concluded that the buildings are in good condition and functioning with no
particular problems. All water supply projects worked well. The civil works were in conformity
with projects supervisors' recommendations and technical terms and standards. The sewage
projects were found to be functioning properly. The works has been performed in conformity
with the design and supervisors' recommendations.

The CDF hired consultants from utility companies to provide technical assistance in the design of
projects, as well as in the supervision of projects, which has been very important in ensuring good
quality designs and works. CDF engineers spent a good portion of their time in the field working
with communities.        An external consultant was also contracted to carry out a technical
assessment of infrastructure programs. The quality of the designs has improved over time as a
result of innovative design ideas generated by the CDF engineers, design consultants, and the
external consultant.

During microproject appraisal, the CDF team discussed maintenance issues with community
members and ensured that a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the relevant formal
entity responsible for the sustainability of the community investments. All microprojects were
linked to formal local institutions of the PISG by involving officials in all stages of the
microproject cycle and through training in financial and asset management. As a result of this
training, municipalities have begun to include line items in the municipal budgets to finance
operation and maintenance of public facilities.           The report of the May 2006 Technical
Assessment identified methods to improve operation and maintenance, mainly more training.

A mid-term review of the CDF II Project was carried out in November 2006. This review was
scheduled at a later date than planned to take account of the results of (i) the BA/institutional
assessment; (ii) the social services pilot; and (iii) the community mapping and profiling exercise.
The mid-term review provided helpful recommendations for improving implementation drawing
on the findings from the first two beneficiary assessments (BAs), the first technical audit, an
environmental assessment, a monitoring and evaluation review, and an integrated social service
pilot project. These included recommendations on improving: (a) social service delivery and
information about entitlements and benefits, (b) the monitoring and evaluation framework, and
(c) the environmental assessment process including staff training on environmental assessment.

Considering the focus on quality throughout project implementation, the results of the reviews
and assessments carried out, and the actions taken by the CDF to produce the good results
achieved under the project, project implementation can be considered as satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Project monitoring was the joint responsibility of the CDF II PIU (under the supervision of
UNMIK and the Project Steering Committee), the CPCs and the Bank supervision team. The
objectives of the monitoring and evaluation activities were to: (i) ensure that procedures carried
out for implementing microprojects, executing contracts, and managing project accounts were in
compliance with the Operational Manual; (ii) provide information regularly on progress toward
achieving project objectives and facilitate reporting to the Board of Directors, the Government,
and donors; (iii) provide information on project performance in terms of social development


                                                   9

outcomes; (iv) alert managers to actual or potential problems in implementation so that corrective
actions could be taken in a timely manner; (v) determine how the project was affecting the
intended beneficiaries; and (vi) provide a vehicle whereby beneficiaries could reflect on and
improve their performance.

The monitoring and evaluation framework included: (i) community investment project
monitoring and reporting by CDF II staff, Community Project Committees, and local supervisors;
(ii) the management information system (MIS); (iii) technical and financial project audits; (iv)
annual beneficiary assessments; (v) special evaluations of community investments carried out by
CPCs before the final hand-over of projects; (vi) informal surveys of the impact of community
investments conducted by the CPCs; (vii) semi-annual Bank supervision missions; (viii) a mid-
term review; and (ix) quarterly and annual progress reports prepared by the CDF PIU.

The CDF used multiple methods of monitoring performance throughout the project. They are
described in Annex 7 and include: MIS/database tracking, technical assessments of infrastructure
programs, beneficiary assessments, and project assessments carried out by beneficiary
communities, social services training evaluations, financial audits, and monitoring of operation
and maintenance.

During project implementation, the key performance indicators were monitored and tracked in the
CDF Progress reports, Bank Mission Reports, and in Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). They
provided information on: (i) the number of community members benefiting from community
investments including minority groups; (ii) results from qualitative assessments (i.e., beneficiary
assessments) documenting the levels of satisfaction with services received, the positive effect the
project had on social integration, and how projects helped build confidence; and (iii) specific
outcomes related to training such as the development of five-year municipal plans, three year
regional plans and annual budgets which provided for line items for the maintenance of facilities
rehabilitated under the project, development of a government/citizen web page used for
information dissemination, and ratings for maintenance of facilities.

As part of the mid-term mission, an international monitoring expert was hired to carry out an
initial review to assess the capacity of the CDF to monitor youth inclusion in project activities.
The consultancy was financed by SDV as the CDF was a beneficiary project of the TFESSD
Grant for youth and inclusion. The review focused on the development of methodological tools,
indicators and analysis to assess impact of programs on youth inclusion leading to stronger
actions and project responses to promote youth inclusion. The review also focused on the skills
and management of the project team in order to implement improved monitoring. As a result of
this assessment, a number of recommendations were primarily targeted at actions to be taken by
the CDF, with oversight and assistance from the Bank. They included recommendations focused
on ways to improve program monitoring, issues to consider during the design of a possible
follow-up operation to both improve overall monitoring and evaluation and incorporate youth
inclusion, and modifications to the organizational structure of CDF to improve monitoring and
evaluation. The first set of recommendations on improving program monitoring was fully
implemented by the CDF during the remaining period of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Safeguards Compliance. As a financial intermediary project, the environmental category for the
CDF II is F. Some of the projects clearly have beneficial environmental impacts (e.g. sanitation,
solid waste management), but others could have had minor negative impacts if they were not
designed and implemented correctly. These negative impacts were mitigated.

Local capacity, while limited, was considered sufficient for case-by-case review and assessment
of environmental impacts and recommended mitigation measures by CDF staff and limited
environmental assessments by outside local consultants. During the pilot phase and the previous
project, CDF staff successfully identified, jointly with the community, mitigation measures and
monitored their implementation. Projects requiring a full environmental impact assessment would
not meet cost effectiveness criteria for CDF funding and were not eligible for financing.
According to Kosova environmental legislation, none of the CDF II projects required an EIA.

An environmental impact assessment of 11 completed infrastructure subprojects was undertaken
in early 2007 to assess the environmental impacts of CDF projects. It confirmed that the 11
subprojects were implemented in accordance with the environmental legislative framework, and
that the prevention and mitigation measures were effective.

Given the growing importance of adequately addressing the environmental impact of projects
carried out under the Project, an independent environmental assessment was carried out by BLK-
Environmental Consulting, a local firm in Prishtina, covering CDF projects completed during the
period January 2004 to December 2006. As a result of this assessments the following actions
were taken by the CDF: (i) training on Environmental Impact Assessment for CDF staff, (ii) a
health and safety assessment was made a part of the CDF project appraisals, and (iii) the CDF,
through a donor project and in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment and Spatial
Planning, offered training sessions to other local NGOs in projects similar to the CDF program.

Fiduciary Compliance.       The CDF had previously implemented a Bank-financed Grant. The
internal controls and procedures for the CDF I project were reviewed and found satisfactory for
the CDF II. The CDF II also benefited from an accounting system effectively linked to the MIS
developed under the CDF I project. Accounts were maintained in accordance with the required
financial standards and World Bank guidelines, and were audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. In addition, a simplified cost accounting system was integrated with
the upgraded MIS to strengthen monitoring and to ensure the cost-effectiveness of microprojects
under the CDF II Project.

The financial audit report of June 2006 and the review of financial management arrangements
carried out in October 2006 confirm that the financial management system--including accounting,
controls, auditing and reporting--continue to be adequate and satisfied the Bank's financial
management requirements. Internal control procedures were documented and duly followed by
project staff. The project maintained its accounting records correctly and regularly reconciled all
general ledger account balances with relevant source documents. Audit reports for project
accounts were submitted on time and were acceptable to the Bank. The FMRs were on time and
found satisfactory in terms of format and content.

The procurement management arrangements of the CDF II PIU remained the same as in the CDF
I operation. No specific procurement issues and complaints have been reported during the
discussions on the implementation of the procurement activities and the procurement plan.


                                                 11

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The Kosovo Development Strategy and Plan, 2007-2013 (KDSP) will serve as the framework of
the evolving role of the CDF over the medium term. The KDSP takes into account the findings
of the European Commission Staff Working Document of August 18, 2006, as well as the current
progress towards the resolution of the status of Kosovo.

CDF management's vision of the future role of the CDF is of an agency engaged in providing
opportunities for community development by offering high quality services in support of local
initiatives for improving the living conditions of the poor through small and medium-scale
infrastructure construction or renovation, especially in rural and isolated communities. The CDF
will also continue and enhance its well recognized role of capacity building services to
municipalities, communities and local groups and increase their participation in development
processes. These activities would prepare it to take on additional responsibilities inherent in the
PISG's evolving development plans, and, in particular, its decentralization program. UNMIK and
the PISG share a similar vision in which the CDF will become a relatively independent entity and
function as an active partner in social development. The financing of such an entity could come
from the PISG, external donors, local NGOs and sponsors.

At the request of the Prime Minister, the CDF developed a Corporate Plan highlighting the
planned directions of the CDF in line with the evolving environment in Kosovo and in support of
Government policies and reforms related to local development activities. The plan covers the
challenges, directions, and opportunities facing the CDF over a five-year time horizon. The Plan
is the result of a three-month process of active participation of CDF Board and staff, independent
experts on management and European integration, representatives from the governmental and
partner institutions, as well as other stakeholders. The CDF Corporate plan draws from relevant
documents on development programs in Kosovo, analysis of needs of communities, studies and
reports on impact of the CDF projects on communities, as well as the situational analysis
conducted by synthesizing varied points of view.

The Corporate Plan (summarized in Annex 11) presented by the CDF to the Prime Minister and
key government officials received the full support of the PISG. The Plan was approved by the
CDF Board and by the CDF Steering Committee. The Prime Minister sent the Plan to Bank
management expressing his support for the Plan and requested a follow-up CDF project noting
that this was an opportune time for the CDF to continue and expand its activities in support of the
evolving environment in Kosovo. On behalf of UNMIK, the Acting Deputy Special
Representative of the Secretary-General also expressed support for a follow-up project, noting in
particular the quality and impact of the CDF II Project and the role a follow-up project could play
in poverty alleviation initiatives in Kosovo.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project objectives, design, and implementation remain relevant to Kosovo's development
priorities, as well as to the Bank's assistance strategy. The Vision Statement of the Kosovo
Development Strategic Plan (KDSP) highlights the importance of eradicating poverty and social


                                                 12

exclusion, enhancing the quality of life, and investments in education and health. The project was
also an integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy of 2002, which focused on
poverty reduction. At a regional level, the project contributed to the PISG's European Integration
agenda through capacity building, especially on the priority standards for municipalities. The
objectives continue to be just as important now as when the CDF was established. Frequent
meetings of the PSC ensured consistency between the project's implementation and government
social sector strategies and priorities.

The capacity building component was also highly relevant. The project was designed to support
key policy and institutional reforms consistent with the Government's development strategy and
the related "Mandate to establish Substantial Self-Government." The project also supported
efforts to transfer responsibilities to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and
municipalities.

Local government is in great need of professional assistance to increase their capacities, develop
professionally, and increase their efficiency. Local authorities lack qualified human resources to
manage their day-to-day business and engage in strategic mid and long-term planning. The
capacity building projects are in three vital fields: public financial management, urban planning
and European integration. The need for such training was rather obvious due to the poor
condition of the cadastre and urban planning departments.

As confirmed by the three beneficiary assessments, the project was relevant to the needs of the
project's beneficiaries. The biggest concerns of surveyed Kosovars are related to economic issues
and poverty. Other issues of concern that also are partly related to economic situation include
lack of institutional care, poor education system, social assistance and an extremely passive
cultural life. Income generation and assisting children with disabilities were other top priorities.

Respondents to the BAs believed the CDF project addressed their priorities. The vast majority
(90 percent) of respondents answered that the project was a community priority. Even the
beneficiaries of the projects for people with disabilities believe that infrastructure is a higher
priority for the community.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The project development objectives were to increase the quantity and quality of infrastructure and
services and to promote local capacity building including participation and empowerment. This
was a small (US$4 million), three year project that attempted to provide quick, tangible benefits
to help stabilize poor and vulnerable communities not being reached by other projects and donors.
It was not looking for long-term outcomes. That is why the project development objectives
focused on more immediate outputs.

Project impacts are often measured by household surveys. This was not economically justifiable
given the small size of the CDF and its 115 microprojects with average costs of less than
US$50,000, of which 68 were services projects with an average cost of US$12,000. Therefore,
this impact assessment relies on the project's monitoring and evaluation system. The outcomes
reflect feedback received from beneficiaries documented in the three annual beneficiary
assessments (see section 3.6 and Annex 5 for details) carried out under the project.




                                                  13

The Bank's Kosovo Poverty Assessment (KPA) Report of October 2007 provides poverty
profiles for 2003/04 and 2005/06. This report draws much of its content from the Household
Budget Survey (HSB), which is a core survey conducted by the Statistical Office of Kosovo
(SOK), on a monthly basis since June 2002. Although the HSB provides a useful start for
monitoring poverty and inequality, uncertainties remain regarding the representativeness of the
samples. The surveys still use the 1981 population frame (from the last census) for selecting areas,
and therefore households, to include in the sample. Much has changed since then; some areas
which were highly populated may not be now, and vice versa. Furthermore, the sample size of
2400 was noted in the KPA to be rather small. Thus, the results of the KPA are not representative
at the community level. Nevertheless, at more aggregated levels (administrative regions, or rural-
urban divides) the results of the KPA provide some useful results, which are of relevance for the
second level poverty targeting (see Annex 10).

Project Development Objective 1: Improve the quality, access, and availability of
community infrastructure and services in poor and conflict-affected communities, and for
the most vulnerable groups, including returnees.

The CDF II Project achieved its first development objective of improving the quality, access, and
availability of community infrastructure and services in poor, conflict-affected communities, and
for the most vulnerable groups, including returnees. This objective was achieved through the first
project component. The success of CDF II is attributable to its implementation of high quality
and cost-effective microprojects which made a tangible development impact on the living
conditions of the Kosovo population as well as in capacity building at the local level (see Table 1
below).

Community Infrastructure microprojects. Infrastructure projects accounted for 84 percent of the
community investment budget. As shown in Table 1 above, the CDF financed 39 infrastructure
projects serving 57,380 direct beneficiaries. Two thirds of the projects were schools or water
supply systems. There were no more than three projects in any other sector. Of the 39 projects, 5
were in Serbian communities and 4 were in mixed and minority communities (see Annex 2 for
details). Communities are now enjoying potable water in their homes, rehabilitated and warmer
schools for their children, cleaner and safer sewerage systems, access roads to neighboring
communities, and multi-purpose community centers and local market places. The latter, in
particular, have helped strengthen social interaction and provided incentives to the young to
remain in local areas, thus stemming the tendency for rural-urban migration. Infrastructure
projects generated 26,188 days of temporary labor which was an important contribution, given
Kosovo's very high unemployment rate.




                                                14

Community Social services projects. The CDF II funded 68 social service projects reaching
59,984 direct beneficiaries. They cover a wide range of services including 10 for youth, 11 for
women and 30 for the disabled. There were fewer than six projects in any other category (see
Annex 2). Some particularly innovative projects included multi-ethnic camps, computer courses
for the handicapped, and bee-keeping and flower cultivation for widows. Some activities for the
handicapped were commended by the beneficiary assessments in the belief that they would
facilitate these persons' greater integration into society. The social services projects provided
employment for 130 experts and 199 NGO staff, but the number of job days is not known.

CDF Support for the Living Conditions of Returnees. The CDF II Project also provided
administrative support for the implementation of microprojects for the returnees which were
financed by other donors. These included the following microprojects and programs.

    · At the request of the Central Inter-Ministerial Committee, established by the Government,
         the CDF carried out the reconstruction of 81 private houses in a Serb community in the
         Obiliq Municipality which were damaged during the March 2004 conflict.
    · The CDF was contracted by the UNDP to administer the process of reconstructing 111
         houses for returnees covering all parts of Kosovo.
    · With funding from the Government, the CDF was contracted to administer five
         infrastructure projects for returnees of minority communities in the Municipality of Klina.
         These projects included the reconstruction of schools and houses, and the construction of
         water supply systems, electrical networks, and septic tanks.

Project Outcomes and Development Impact. According to the perceptions of beneficiary
communities, the outcomes of CDF II Project have had a significant impact on the quality of
living standards in these communities. Some of the impacts were social inclusion and integration,
improved confidence and sense of worth, better dialogue between communities and
municipalities, and better informed and trained municipal officers. One of the reasons that the
CDF financed projects made such a difference, even more than three years after the conflict
ended, was the sheer magnitude of the remaining tasks in rehabilitating basic social and economic
infrastructure, and improving service delivery to poor and vulnerable communities. One needs to
compare the pre-project and post-project situations to gauge their impact, and the following
project examples are designed to capture some of the key outcomes and development impacts.

Better Health from Clean Water Supply. After years of failed water supply systems and the
destruction of some systems during the conflict, the CDF II financed the rehabilitation of the
system and people finally had running water in their homes. According to a review carried out by
the CDF in consultation with stakeholders, a direct outcome of the CDF's water supply projects
has been a dramatic reduction of water borne diseases. For example, in the Bakshi dhe Raskovë
project area of 1,520 beneficiaries, the number of people suffering from water borne diseases
dropped from 84 to 0. In Petrove, out of 5,220 beneficiaries, the number dropped from 98 to 12.
In total, in four projects analyzed by the CDF, the number of people suffering from water borne
diseases declined by almost 90 percent, from 245 to 25.

Saving of Time and Effort in Carrying Water. Another important outcome of the water supply
systems financed by the CDF II Project has been the elimination of time and effort in carrying
water. For example, in a study carried out by the CDF, prior to the water supply project in Bakshi
dhe Raskovë, 160 people carried water 200 meters. The time and effort in doing so has been
completely eliminated as an outcome of the project. Likewise, in Ljubinje e Epërme with 2,730
beneficiaries, 250 people carried water 150 meters before the project; the time and effort in doing



                                                  15

so has been completely eliminated. On average, in the four projects analyzed, 104 people
(average) had carried water prior to the projects. The time and effort in doing so has been
eliminated as a result of these projects ­ thus improving the quality of life of the community.

Improved Learning Environment as a Result of School Construction. Prior to the CDF II
Project, children in the Budrikë village had to attend classes in containers because their old school
building had been burned down during the war. In another village, before the school was
constructed, students had to travel up to 8 kilometers to the next village to receive education.
This was extremely difficult during winter and students would get sick. The impact of new
schools on the lives of community members has been significant, as students benefited from
better school conditions for effective learning, vicinity of the school, and students' health.
Parents interviewed under the BAs carried out, expressed the satisfaction of their children
attending better schools with more functional hexagonal designs and attractive color schemes. It
should be noted that primary education is compulsory and the choice of attending or not does snot
arise ­ which in effect precludes the quantification of "income earning potential" by attending
primary schools. In these circumstances, the use of cost-benefit analysis is not applicable to these
primary school projects. The only quantifiable aspect, based on available data, was a modest
improvement in school attendance due to better access and improved school conditions. In four
school projects analyzed by the CDF, the total number of students increased from 772 to 819.

Inclusion and Empowerment of People with Disabilities. The social services projects had
similar dramatic impacts. Nearly half of the social services projects targeted the disabled through
employment generation activities, public awareness campaigns, rehabilitation and counseling.
The acquisition of computer skills gave them a sense of hope and opened up employment
possibilities.   One project provided psychosocial and physiotherapy rehabilitation for 153
children from rural areas. In another project, during a six month period, 112 persons with mental
disabilities attended daily classes including math, English, and computer training. The project
brought great satisfaction to the parents, seeing someone taking care of their disabled children.
Previously there had been a lack of respect for people with disabilities. They were often teased
and mocked. The disabled have increased their self-confidence and believe that they are very
valuable members of society. Municipal authorities have established a committee to deal with
disability issues and have promised to create a budget for office space and efforts for their
employment; medical treatment; and training.

Reducing Rural-Urban Migration. Another outcome of CDF projects is reduced migration from
rural to urban areas and an increase of property values. The percentage of people who believe that
the value of property has increased as a result of the implemented projects is quite high (over 60
percent), thus reducing the tendency to leave rural areas. Community projects have provided
economic hope, better services, and cultural activities, thereby making life in those communities
more attractive.

Social Integration. Close to two-thirds of the BA respondents stated that implementation of
these projects had a positive effect on integration. One project targeted both Serbian and
Albanian youth. The project gave attention to multi-ethnicity of the northern part of Kosovo, and
to inter-ethnic youth cooperation, which for some time had been nonexistent. As the 2007 BA
noted, "The CDF, the Kosovo Relief Committee and the youth activists have shown to both
Albanian and Kosovar politicians that cooperation is possible and that only through inclusive
dialogue and decision-making, problems can be resolved successfully."




                                                 16

Project Development Objective 2:             Promote institutional capacity building at the
community and municipal levels so as to improve the quality and sustainability of service
delivery, and enhance stakeholder participation and empowerment in local development.

The CDF II achieved the second development objective of building the necessary institutional
capacity to ensure the quality and sustainability of microprojects. This objective was achieved
through 8 institutional capacity building projects of the second project component. Six projects
were targeted at municipalities to strengthen the capacity of municipal officials in areas such as
public financial management, standards implementation, and European Integration (see Annex 2
for details). Two projects were targeted at community members--in the areas of operation and
maintenance and informal settlements--to ensure the quality and sustainability of newly
constructed or rehabilitated facilities. This component trained community members and local
government officials (245 and 550 respectively).         The capacity building projects provided
employment for 7 experts and 6 NGO staff.

Participation and Inclusion. The second element of the capacity building objective was to
"enhance stakeholder participation and empowerment in local development." Promotional
activities of the CDF consist of initial meetings with regional administrators and municipalities,
General Community Meetings (GCMs) following the submission of priority lists from the
municipalities, meetings with Community Project Committees (CPCs), and media-based publicity
campaigns. A total of 3,848 people from 28 municipalities participated in GCMs and 59 CPCs
were formed with a total membership of 321, of whom at least 40 were municipal officers. The
majority (75 percent) of respondents of the beneficiary assessments was very enthusiastic to
speak about their involvement in village and community meetings.

Youth participation is considered relatively high in comparison to similar programs in other
countries. The most common explanation is that youth comprise a high percentage of the overall
population. The percentage of people attending General Community Meetings that were youth
ranged from 11 to 91 percent, with an average of 42 percent. Communities were encouraged to
elect youth members to the CPCs, and most elected 1 to 3 youth. In 8 of the 59 communities, a
young person received the highest number of votes and was elected chairperson.

Considering the large youth population bulge in Kosovo, most of whom are unemployed, youth
empowerment projects assume great importance, especially in developing productive skills,
fluency in foreign languages, and information technology (IT) to expand their employment
opportunities. The CDF supported NGOs that design programs specifically for youth. Ten of
the 68 social services projects targeted youth. These focused primarily on providing minority-run
youth centers with capacity building assistance and promoting awareness campaigns on HIV &
AIDS. One project benefited 23 youth through skills enhancement programs. Two projects
disseminated information on employment opportunities to 560 youth. Another project opened a
youth center for Bosnian and Roma minority, at the same time helping local NGOs to conduct
their activities, as well as raising awareness for cooperation among different community groups.
Table 2 provides some indicators of youth involvement in the CDF II Project.

specifically targeting youth

The main impact of the project on youth was capacity-building to do voluntary work, initiate new
projects, and become involved in organizational work or other activities. Now, more young
people consider themselves capable of action and feel they have gained important experience.

Around 62 percent of the households participated in funding the projects. A considerable portion
of the households did not participated in financing projects because, according to them, there was
no need for it (22 percent), they did not have the means for it (10 percent), or they were not
informed about it (2 percent). Beneficiaries were of the view that the CPCs needed some
strengthening. This was considered important for increasing the commitment and accountability
of the local governments, community-based associations and community members. The CDF
promotion team enhanced their outreach and training activities in the targeted communities to
ensure a greater engagement of CPCs in community investment projects.

The main impact on communities was their empowerment through participation in subproject
decision-making and the creation of social capital through cooperation in community projects,
especially between different ethnic groups with previously low levels of trust. Beneficiary
Assessments reported that the microprojects boosted participatory spirit and civic identity. The
project also empowered communities through training and capacity building.               The 321
community members of CPCs were empowered by engaging with municipal officials on project
related issues and in particular on issues related to the maintenance of project facilities. Seven
years of CDF operation has helped build the capacity of community members who were engaged
in CDF community subprojects. In some of the more proactive communities, participation in
CDF project activities helped community members lobby for projects from the donor community
and to develop project proposals.

The Development of Five-Year Plans in Municipalities. One important outcome of the CDF's
capacity building program is that the sustainability of community investments has significantly
improved through the financial management training. The resulting five-year financial plans and
the annual budgets developed in the municipalities now provide line items for maintenance
expenditures of public facilities. In recognition of the quality of capacity building provided, the
CDF was invited by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Ministry of Administration
and Local Government to coordinate a comprehensive training program in financial management
and budgeting for all budget units at the central and local government levels in Kosovo.

Standards Implementation and European Integration. The standards implementation training
helped prepare municipal officials for that task. In most cases, municipalities were behind in
implementing the standards for Kosovo, but after training, most municipalities advanced quite
rapidly. While this project is probably not the only reason, municipal officials state that the



                                                 18

training has been very helpful in clarifying a significant portion of the tasks ahead of them and
receiving a better evaluation in standards implementation. Similarly, the training on European
Integration has improved their understanding of the current situation of Kosovo with regards to
European Integration and the mechanisms of integration which were rather unclear to them before
the training.

Support for the Decentralization Program. In addition to ongoing, systematic training carried
out under the CDF benefiting participating communities, the CDF has also made impressive
progress in their local government capacity building activities. The CDF is involved in a number
of municipal training activities requested by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry
of Administration and Local Government, the Ministry of Labor and Social Services, and the
Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. The CDF's active participation in supporting the
Government's decentralization program through critically needed capacity building activities at
the local level has brought the project much recognition and an increased number of requests
from the Government and the donor community in the area of municipal level training.

The project has successfully built upon the decentralization process, started under the first
operation, and moved forward to an integrated development framework. Through the efforts of
the CDF, an important process is gradually emerging in support of the decentralized management
of basic social services.    Community members have been progressively engaging in self-
generated development activities combined with training activities aimed at having communities
take part in ensuring the quality, effectiveness and sustainability of service delivery. The CDF
promoted the concept of self-help mechanisms, increased the sense of community ownership, and
enhanced the efficiency of local community development operations.

Development of a Popular Government/Citizen Website. The training program was conducted
in four phases, benefiting 30 municipal officials and 8 officials from the Ministry of
Administration and Local Government. As a result, there have been close to 20,000 visits to the
website, which has been instrumental in improving interactions between citizens and government.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The project's economic rate of return was not calculated because operations of this type yield a
wide range of external benefits to society that are not readily quantifiable. Moreover, the demand-
driven character of the microprojects--and the fact that neither their size nor their type was
known ex ante--precluded the use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. At the
microproject level, although the costs of projects are known with some precision at the appraisal
stage by the CDF, data deficiencies at the community level precluded the quantification and
valuation of the wide range of benefits and externalities generated by microprojects. Therefore,
the assessment of efficiency was focused on studying the cost-effectiveness of CDF microprojects
vis-à-vis those of comparator organizations.

Accordingly, a cost-effectiveness study was conducted in 2003 by specialized local consultants
under the guidance of an international consultant. The approach adopted was to examine the
economic use of project funds at the macro and micro levels as follows: (i) the project rationale
within the broader context of national development objectives, government strategy, and the
Bank's TSS and programs; and (ii) the cost-effectiveness of microprojects completed under the
CDF compared with those completed under government programs and NGO programs. Cost-
effectiveness comparisons showed that the costs of school rehabilitation and construction carried


                                                 19

out under the CDF were substantially less (by 19 percent) than those under NGO programs; the
result was even more favorable in the case of roads projects, where the average cost of
microprojects was 34 percent less than those under NGO programs.

Since the CDF II as a whole is a non-revenue generating project, no detailed financial analysis of
the net present value and the financial rate of return were carried out. In the case of microprojects
which are revenue generating, such as water projects or solid waste disposal projects, the CDF
ensured that beneficiaries contributed to cost recovery through the payment of user fees to
government or local authority collection systems already in place. Communities were required to
finance up to 15 percent of the total microproject costs. This was considered feasible since
community contributions under the CDF I averaged 19 percent.

Costs during the CDF II proved those assumptions. The CDF closely monitored microproject
costs, as well as the unit costs of construction and costs per beneficiary. In regard to schools, the
overall trend is that actual unit costs (per square meter and per direct beneficiary) have been
contained below planned costs for the years 2002-2006. Costs for new construction declined
from 2002 to 2006, from 386 to 174 Euros/square meter. During that same period, costs per
direct beneficiary fell from 611 to 320 Euros.

For water supply projects, the overall trend is that actual unit costs (per meter and per direct
beneficiary) have been contained below planned costs for 2003-2006. During this 4-year period,
actual costs of pipelines have fluctuated within the range of 12 ­ 18 Euros per meter, reflecting in
part, the type of water supply project involved. These costs are still below the planned unit cost
of 20 Euros per meter and costs declined from 82 to 34 Euros per direct beneficiary. As cost
controls are now in place, it is likely that CDF's comparative advantage in cost-effectiveness vis-
à-vis the NGOs reported in the 2003 study has been maintained during 2003-2006.

During project implementation, the CDF carried out a simple cost-effectiveness analysis for each
microproject proposal presented by the communities. The analysis was based on viable project
alternatives, least-cost solutions, unit cost estimates from private construction firms, specific
circumstances of the community, estimated benefits from the project, number of beneficiaries,
and other relevant factors at the micro level.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The project achieved its development objectives by effectively delivering benefits to target
groups that are among the poorest in Europe. It used innovative poverty targeting methods to
ensure its infrastructure improvements and social services benefited the poorest communities in
remote and isolated areas, and the socially vulnerable including children, returnees, disabled
persons, the elderly, Serb and other ethnic minorities. Infrastructure was built at lower cost than
by comparator government agencies and NGOs. Participation, while not broad based, was judged
to be greater than that under CDFI, particularly due to the expanded membership of CPCs. Three
beneficiary assessments demonstrated that beneficiaries greatly valued the project, held very
positive views about the CDF, and believed the project significantly improved their lives. The
Project also supported local level institutional capacity building consistent with the Government's
decentralization initiatives, so as to improve the quality and sustainability of community
investments. The project did not have any significant shortcomings, inefficiencies or other
inadequacies.    Its accomplishments are still consistent with Kosovo's present development




                                                  20

priorities and current Bank strategies and goals. And the Government has recognized the CDF II
Project as an important tool for poverty reduction in Kosovo.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. The focus of the project was on non-income poverty reduction through the
provision of local infrastructure and social services. The project was not designed to generate
income. Nonetheless, the infrastructure subcomponent generated 26,188 days of work that
provided at least short term income. Some of the social services projects--such as the milk
collection and processing, beekeeping, and flower cultivation projects--directly provided income
to poor communities. The project made the communities more livable and may have indirectly
led to poverty reduction. For example, road reconstruction probably reduced transport costs,
improved water supply and sanitation probably reduced health costs, and so on.

Social Development. The main social development achievements were empowerment of
communities through participation in subproject decision-making and creation of social capital
through cooperation in community subprojects, especially between different ethnic groups with
previously low levels of trust. A total of 3,848 participants from 28 municipalities participated in
General Community Meetings. A total of 321 community members served on Community
Project Committees. The project also empowered communities through training and capacity
building.   More than half (56 percent) of BA respondents claimed that as a result of the
implementation of these projects, these was an increase in undertaking these kinds of initiatives.
Close to two-thirds of the 2005 and 2006 BA respondents stated that implementation of these
projects had a positive effect on integration.

Gender Aspects. Eleven of the social services projects were specifically targeted to women. For
example, one project supported cooperative milk collection where cow milk is delivered by 20
women. Three women are in charge of the project committee and responsible for the processing
and sale of the milk. A second project supported an experienced NGO to provide health
education to 243 women from five villages, especially pregnant and antenatal women. A third
project provided legal advice to women and taught them about their legal rights. A fourth project
supported greenhouse productive activities for women. Women also were the main beneficiaries
of many of the infrastructure projects, such as the water supply systems, because women were
primarily responsible for collecting water.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

As discussed above the CDF contributed to a notable institutional development impact (as part of
its second component) in three areas: (i) in municipal government, (ii) among NGOs, and (iii)
within CDF itself. CDF strengthened the capacity of municipal officers in financial management,
budgeting and accounting and in the formulation of 5-year financial plans and annual budgets
with line items for operations and maintenance for public facilities constructed or rehabilitated
under the CDF. Furthermore, the participation of municipal authorities in the CPCs established
under the CDF contributed to more effective and frequent interactions between municipal
authorities and community members. The capacity of local NGOs was strengthened through their




                                                21

engagement in capacity building activities, social service projects, and in a community mapping
and profiling exercise financed under the CDF program.

The CDF II was designed to support key policy and institutional reforms consistent with the
Government's current development strategy and the related "Mandate to establish Substantial
Self-Government." This allowed the CDF to branch into areas involving medium-term
development activities focusing on service delivery and governance. The result has been the
evolving role of the CDF under the second operation, which is increasingly being recognized by
the PISG and by the donor community as an effective development agency linking local
development activities with government programs and institutions. The CDF became the leading
NGO in Kosovo to administer key capacity building programs benefiting local government
officials.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

The strongest message of the BAs is the sense of satisfaction with the CDF, expressed both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Some of the quotes speak more eloquently than any statistics.
One BA respondent said, "CDF has done an incredible job and we have no complaints." Another
said, "As far as CDF is concerned, there are no words large enough to thank them." Finally, "As
for CDF, what can I say more than God will reward them." The author of the BA noted, "Not a
single person encountered during site visits to the communities has expressed dissatisfaction with
this organization." These responses came from multiple BAs (see Annex 5 for description of the
methodology of each of the BAs and for a more detailed description of the results).

The CDF has certainly earned strong support and admiration from some individuals. The
quantitative data, from the surveys and interviews, provides a statistical measure of the breadth of
support. About 83 percent of respondents have expressed various degrees of satisfaction with the
support provided by CDF: 55 percent are extremely satisfied, and 28 percent are satisfied with the
support provided by CDF. Table 3 summarizes community satisfaction with the CDF and the
community investment component on a variety of measures.

With regard to the capacity building component, recipients of training have expressed high level
of satisfaction. All beneficiaries interviewed during the assessment are satisfied with all aspects
of the training. Participants were satisfied with the quality of training. Nonetheless, there was
some sentiment that the training made a good start and needed follow-up training activities on
institutional capacity, fundraising, working with donors, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low.

There is only a low risk that the project's development outcomes will not be maintained, in part,
because Kosovo's economic and social perspectives indicate that there will be both an ongoing
need for, and continuing public policy to provide, the types of assistance which CDF's activities
have supported. In all likelihood, they will remain priority Government objectives.

The sustainability of community investments has significantly improved through the financial
management training received, and the resulting five-year financial plans developed in the
municipalities which now provide line items for maintenance expenditures of public facilities.
However, the role of the municipalities in CDF projects is very limited in the rural areas.
Nonetheless, the project's sustainability is rated likely on the basis of the following factors:




                                                    23

     · Kosovar communities were shown to be interested in, willing to, and well prepared to
         participate in CDF activities. Their substantial self-help contributions demonstrated the
         importance they attached to CDF products.
     · The CDF has been successful in actively engaging community members in self-generated
         development activities. The latter have been combined with training activities aimed at
         having communities better appreciate and take part in ensuring the quality, effectiveness
         and sustainability of infrastructural and service improvements.
     · Municipal governments have been made more conscious of their residents' desires for
         infrastructure and service improvements. The CDF established a model for municipal
         officials of greater transparency and responsiveness to poverty and social protection
         concerns which may induce increased appreciation of their electorate's expectations and
         priorities. Local governments have been made more sensitive to operations and
         maintenance issues, as well as the importance of ensuring the sustainability of the newly
         constructed or rehabilitated facilities, and new or upgraded services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's work during the preparation of the project was of high quality. Its strategy and
instruments were very appropriate. The project's design took into account lessons from previous
projects in Kosovo and elsewhere.         Appraisal of the commitment of the Government, the
implementing agency and potential beneficiaries for the tasks appear to have been generally
sound. Technical aspects were thoroughly examined, as were the fiduciary elements. Links with
other donors were well considered and incorporated. The implementation plan was thorough and
well balanced. Preparation costs (US$118,770) were reasonable.

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry of the project is rated satisfactory. This
takes into account the efficacy of the work carried out in the activities described above, which
covered the most important aspects of the project's strategic relevance and its preparation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project was closely monitored through frequent field supervision, special studies and
assessments of the project. These covered broad issues about the CDF's operations and their
benefits, as well as technical, environmental, administrative, financial, procurement matters, and
qualitative assessments of the project's progress, functioning and impacts. These reports were
comprehensive and well documented and effectively informed the Government and Bank
management of the operating conditions in an objective and timely manner. They dealt
professionally with the problems and possible solutions. The mid-term review comprehensively
assessed overall performance.

The Bank staff had a good working relationship with the CDF officials and its project unit. The
Bank and CDF were in continuous dialogue with CIDA, UNMIK, and the PISG. The PSC



                                                   24

ensured more frequent communication and closer coordination than in other similar projects.
This permitted constructive resolution of any issues that arose. Bank supervision responsibilities
have been effectively discharged. These were reflected in the quality of project status reports, the
early detection and elimination of important bottlenecks to progress, and the positive feedback
from CDF on the support it had received. Careful, detailed attention to beneficiary assessments
also figured into the Bank's supervision, whose costs (US$248,120) are reasonable.

The Bank's performance during project supervision did not show any shortcomings in the
identification of opportunities and promptly and effectively resolved all issues. Therefore, the
Bank's supervision performance is rated highly satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory on the basis of the aforementioned factors
and the other elements of the Bank's work described elsewhere in this report.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Under the CDF II Project, the Recipient of the IDA and CIDA Grants was UNMIK. This was in
accordance with the TSS which refers to the practice followed under the Bank's Trust Fund
financed program and which is consistent with UNMIK's legal status and responsibilities in
Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The counterpart Ministry was the Ministry
of Finance and Economy (MFE). UNMIK and the MFE effectively participated in the design and
implementation of the CDF II Project. The responsibility for the flow of funds between UNMIK,
the MFE and the CDF II PIU was carried out effectively with no problems during project
implementation. Both UNMIK and the MFE were part of the CDF II Steering Committee set up
specifically for overseeing the activities of the CDF II Project. The PSC effectively carried out
its key role to ensure consistency of the CDF work programs with Kosovo's social sector
strategies and Government reform programs in relevant sectors. UNMIK, as a member of the
PSC, systematically monitored project activities both at the technical and operational levels. It
reviewed, discussed and formulated recommendations on semi annual and work programs as well
as on technical reports and on the CDFII Corporate Plan. UNMIK also participated in field visits
to demonstration projects with other Steering Committee members. As the Recipient of the Grant,
UNMIK submitted timely requests to the Bank for minor revisions to the Grant Agreement, and
met with Bank staff during each of the supervision missions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project clearly demonstrated the CDF's main strength of being able to reach remote, isolated
and poorer communities, obtain their residents' consensus on development priorities, help
mobilize collaborative efforts to address them, and to bring them to fruition. The CDF, as a local
foundation functioned as the CDF II Implementation Unit (PIU) effectively administering its
operations as an autonomous entity, governed by its Board, and reporting to the Project Steering
Committee. The CDF has built up a solid technical and professional capacity based on close to 8
years of experience. As the beneficiary assessments noted, the CDF has impacted Kosovo's
smaller and medium-sized communities, in which it has earned widespread popular trust, more
than that of other national institutions.

The CDF performed very well. It merits praise for being reportedly the only local agency that
tackled infrastructure and service improvements for poor residents, and for its useful institution-
building initiatives. It produced the quick, tangible results needed. The CDF performed well in
project selection, operating procedures, technical design and community involvement in its
activities. It followed the agreed typology of, and criteria for, projects to be funded. It was quite
disciplined about, and tightened, contracting (particularly tendering) while simultaneously
obtaining broad contractor participation. The CDF systematically monitored and evaluated
project execution.     Towards the project's conclusion, Bank staff judged the CDF to have
developed sufficient capability for ensuring proper financial management.

An independent assessment of the quality of the community works commended the CDF for its
careful evaluation of each request it received. It credited the CDF with ensuring that project
implementation faithfully followed the defined specifications and design. Beneficiary
assessments noted community commendations of CDF's performance with only relatively modest
reservations. These achievements were supported by CDF's recruitment and maintenance of
professionally competent, hard working and committed personnel. The Bank staff judged them to
have gained valuable experience in all aspects of project management and administration.

In summary, the CDF was very effective in carrying out the project's activities. It established
itself as a credible, independent entity with demonstrated competence in the delivery of technical,
managerial and organizational support to Kosovar communities. It became a cost-effective
instrument for meeting social infrastructure and services needs of the poor.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

CDF performance in the project is rated highly satisfactory on the basis of its highly creditable
performance, as described above and in other portions of this report. CDF was the implementing
agency, and the Borrower played a lesser role as described above.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Social Fund Approach and Community Based Development: The project confirmed that social
fund activities can provide a better quality of life for the poor, can be efficient mechanisms for
constructing small-scale infrastructure, can build social capital, and have a visible, inclusive
development impact. Indeed, these operations can serve as catalysts for a process in which
citizens in targeted communities, especially in mixed and minority communities, gradually came
together over time and participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of projects which
respond to the common good of the community.

Cost Effectiveness: This project demonstrated that social fund projects can deliver infrastructure
at lower costs than NGOs or government.          Cost analysis showed that the costs of school
rehabilitation and construction carried out under the CDF were substantially less (by 19 percent)
than those under NGO programs. The result was even more favorable in the case of roads projects,
where the average cost of micro-projects was 34 percent less than those under NGO programs.

Importance of Poverty Targeting: Given a typically limited budget envelope in social fund
projects, a clearly formulated poverty targeting and allocation mechanism based on objective



                                                26

criteria and poverty data, is critical for ensuring the flow of project benefits to the neediest
segments of the population.

Youth Participation: The targeting of young people in this type of project, and particularly given
the sensitive political situation in Kosovo, was of considerable importance because among
conflict-affected areas, youth risks are the highest due to the combined conditions of conflict,
poverty, and high levels of youth unemployment.

Importance of building communication networks: A critical aspect in this type of operation is
the development of a comprehensive framework for stakeholder involvement and participation, in
addition to strong institutional support from the project team, effective systems and procedures.
Outreach and promotion, a community mapping and profiling exercise, and needs assessments
are important elements to the success of this operation. Indeed, better communication between
project committees, municipality authorities and beneficiaries also underline the importance of
including an awareness raising component in this type of operation.

Capacity Building: An important lesson of this project is that the sustainability of community
investments has significantly improved through the financial management training which resulted
in municipalities preparing five-year financial plans which now provide line items for
maintenance expenditures of public facilities. In addition, training in the areas of monitoring and
supervision of micro-projects is equally critical.

Links to Government Policies and Priorities: It is important to ensure that projects focus on
greater coordination of social fund-type activities with relevant sectoral policies (i.e. health and
education) and investment priorities. One mechanism for achieving this to institutionalize a
Project Steering Committee that ensures that project activities are consistent with social sector
strategy priorities and government reform programs in relevant sectors.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Component 1: Community Investment Projects

The community investment projects component dominated the project budget, accounting for 93
percent of total project program costs (excluding project management costs).              The SDR
appreciated against the dollar so the project budget increased in dollar terms. This enabled the
project to target a greater number of poor communities and better meet its development objectives.
This is attributable to: (i) a higher level of community contributions (22 percent) than the
expected share of 9.5 percent; and (ii) a significant decline in the price of construction materials
due to heavy competition. The CDF implemented 115 projects of which 39 are infrastructure
projects, 68 are social services projects and 8 are capacity building projects (see Table 1).

Infrastructure projects. While there were many more social services projects, infrastructure
projects accounted for 84 percent of the community investment budget. Two thirds of the
projects were schools or water supply systems (see Table 2). There were less than four projects
in any other category. The cost per completed infrastructure microproject averaged US$112,599.
The cost per direct beneficiary is estimated at US$77. Infrastructure projects generated 26,188
days of temporary labor which is greatly valued given Kosovo's very high unemployment rate.

Infrastructure projects in Serbian and Mixed and Minority Communities. The project
planned to allocate US$260,000 (10 percent of the community investment component) to Serbian

communities and US$260,000 to mixed and minority communities. The CDF fell slightly short
of the goal for the Serbian communities in percentage terms (it allocated 7 percent) but exceeded
the target in dollar terms (US$305,897). The CDF met the goal for the mixed and minority
communities in percentage terms and exceeded the target in dollar terms (US$429,242). Costs
per project were less than the other CDF infrastructure subprojects (see Tables 3 and 4). Costs
per beneficiary for the infrastructure projects in Serbian communities were significantly higher.

CDF support for returnees. The CDF II Project also provided administrative support for the
implementation of microprojects for the returnees which were financed by other donors. These
included the following microprojects and programs.
    · At the request of the Central Inter-Ministerial Committee, established by the Government,
         the CDF carried out the reconstruction of 81 private houses in a Serb community in the
         Obiliq Municipality which were damaged during the March 2004 conflict.
    · The CDF was contracted by the UNDP to administer the process of reconstructing 111
         houses for returnees covering all parts of Kosovo.
    · With funding from the Government, the CDF was contracted to administer five
         infrastructure projects for returnees of minority communities in the Municipality of Klina.
         These projects included the reconstruction of schools and houses, and the construction of
         water supply systems, electrical networks, and septic tanks.

Social services projects. Three fourths of the social services projects were for the disabled,
women or youth. There were fewer than six projects in any other category. Social services
projects were more numerous, cheaper and had slightly more total direct beneficiaries than
infrastructure projects (see Table 5). Given that their per project costs (US$12,008) were much
less than those for infrastructure projects (US$112,599), its costs per beneficiary (US$14) were
much lower than those for infrastructure projects (US$77). The social services projects provided
employment for 130 experts and 199 NGO staff, but the number of job days is not known.

B. Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building

The second component focused on capacity building. Most of this assistance was provided
through training programs (see Table 6). This component trained community members and local
government officials (293 and 550 respectively).      The capacity building projects provided
employment for 7 experts and 6 NGO staff, but the number of job days is not known.

The CDF carried out six key local government capacity building training programs covering:
    · public financial management in budget institutions (two projects);
    · priority standards in municipalities and their implementation through MIS;
    · the role of local government in European integration issues;
    · an integrated training program focusing on informal settlements; and
    · a training program on e-governance.




                                                31

The CDF administered and coordinated a comprehensive training program in the areas of public
financial management covering planning, budgeting, coordination and control in support of the
Government's Budget Circular 2005-2007. Three-day workshops benefited 123 participants,
including financial officers from 30 municipalities and representatives from key sector ministries
and budget institutions. The training program received high marks from participants regarding
the course agenda, coverage of the topics, lecturers, the participatory process used in engaging
participants in the course work, fulfillment of the participants training needs, and the impact of
the training in terms of expanding knowledge and professional skills. One of the main outputs of
the training was the formulation of 5-year plans for operating and maintenance of assets.

The CDF provided training for 30 municipal officers from 30 municipalities on eight sets of
standards relating to public administration. CDF provided training at the municipal level for the
implementation a new Manual for Inclusion of the Informal Settlements into municipal
development plans benefiting 84 municipal officials from 33 municipalities. The Ministry of
Administration and Local Government requested training related to the implementation of the
project "Role of the Local Government in European Integration." The training benefited 290
municipal officers from 33 municipalities. The web-application software design and the training
benefited 23 officials from 30 municipalities.

At the microproject level, institutional strengthening focused on local governments, communities
and contractors participating in community infrastructure and services projects. The focus of the
training was on building the capacity of these local groups to plan, manage, operate, supervise
and maintain investments and improve the quality and availability of local service provision. At
every stage of the microproject cycle, the promotion, appraisal and follow-up teams of the CDF
provided on-the-job training and technical, managerial and organizational support to these
community groups.        The training covered a variety of topics including the roles and
responsibilities of members of Community Project Committees, project identification and
formulation, competitive bidding procedures, operations and maintenance, quality control and
monitoring and evaluation. In addition, special technical training was organized covering: (i)
operations and maintenance of water supply projects in 5 villages benefiting 53 community
members; and (ii) application of the manual for incorporating the informal settlements into spatial
planning in the Brekoc neighborhood, benefiting 240 community members.

Component 3: Project Management Component

The Project helped develop the CDF into a much stronger, broader based institution. It also
expanded its capacity to penetrate into more remote, isolated and poorer communities stimulate
effective discussions on their perceived priorities, and to bring to fruition proposals to meet their
needs. The CDF's improvements are credited to a large measure to inputs from the IDA Grant
with CIDA's support. These provisions included training benefiting the Fund's management and
staff, and administrative support. The financing also covered the Fund's operating costs and the
expenditures related to the monitoring and evaluation work, and financial audits. The capacity of
CDF staff was strengthened through training and study tours in the areas covering service
delivery at the local level, promotion and outreach, monitoring and evaluation, and local
governance.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The objective of this annex is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the CDF II Project. The demand
driven nature of the project, which responds to microproject proposals from poor communities
during the life of the project, clearly precludes the ex-ante use of traditional methods of cost-
benefit analysis. Instead, the approach adopted is to assess the project at the macro and micro
levels. At the macro level, the focus is on assessing the project rationale within the broader
context of Kosovo's development objectives, government strategy, and the Bank's Transitional
Support Strategy and programs.        At the micro level, the focus is on examining the cost-
effectiveness of microprojects completed under the CDF compared with those completed through
NGO programs. The micro level assessment in this annex is based on the findings of a cost-
effectiveness analysis carried out by a team of local consultants, as part of project preparation.

The CDF II Project supported the PISG priorities mentioned earlier through the project's focus on
rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure, especially in the education and health sectors
and the provision of social services to help improve the living standards of the poor and
vulnerable groups. The project's support at the local level enhanced the capacity of local
government officials and communities to effectively address post-conflict and poverty related
issues on a sustainable basis. The CDF II Project similarly supported the TSS objective of
poverty alleviation through its support for small-scale infrastructure and social services at the
local level, and its demand-driven approach and strong emphasis on community participation.
The CDF II Project was also consistent with the objectives of the Bank's Fourth Economic
Assistance Grant and the Bank-financed Education Project (US$4.5 million). The CDF II Project
is also consistent with the main findings and recommendations of Bank economic and sector
work, including the 2001 Poverty Assessment and the Public Expenditure Review.

The CDF II projects generated short-term employment for the poor, at least through the
construction phase of microprojects. It also stimulated the development of the local construction
industry through introducing competitive procurement and encouraging small-scale contracting
firms. More importantly, through the use of participatory mechanisms and its demand-driven
approach, significant qualitative benefits from the CDF II project increased the sense of
ownership, trust and social cohesion in many communities throughout Kosovo.

Cost-effectiveness comparisons showed that the costs of school rehabilitation and construction
carried out under the CDF I were substantially lower (by 19 percent) than those under NGO
programs; the result was even more favorable in the case of roads projects, where the average
cost of microprojects was 34 percent less than those under NGO programs. That cost-
effectiveness analysis suggested that the CDF II Project would also be a cost-effective means of
meeting the social infrastructure needs of the poor, provided that the same standards of technical
and economic efficiency were maintained or improved.

Costs during the CDF II proved those assumptions. The CDF has been closely monitoring the
cost of microprojects, as well as the unit costs of construction and costs per beneficiary. In regard
to schools, the overall trend is that actual unit costs (per square meter and per direct beneficiary)
have been contained below planned costs for the years 2002-2006. Construction costs for new
construction declined from 2002 to 2006, from 386 to 174 Euros/square meter. During that same
period, costs per direct beneficiary fell from 611 to 320 Euros.




                                                  33

For water supply projects, the overall trend is that actual unit costs (per meter and per direct
beneficiary) have been contained below planned costs for 2003-2006. During this 4-year period,
actual costs of pipelines have fluctuated within the range of 12 ­ 18 Euros per meter, reflecting in
part, the type of water supply project involved. In fact, these costs are still below the planned unit
cost of 20 Euros per meter and costs declined from 82 to 34 Euros per direct beneficiary. As cost
controls are now in place, it is likely that CDF's comparative advantage in cost-effectiveness vis-
à-vis the NGOs reported in the 2003 study has been maintained during 2003-2006.

During project implementation, the CDF carried out a simple cost-effectiveness analysis for each
microproject proposal presented by the communities. The analysis was based on viable project
alternatives, least-cost solutions, unit cost estimates from private construction firms, specific
circumstances of the community, estimated benefits from the project, number of beneficiaries,
and other relevant factors at the micro level.

Because the CDF II as a whole is a non-revenue generating project, no detailed financial analysis
showing the net present value and the financial rate of return was carried out. Such microprojects
are of the non-revenue generating type and do not lend themselves to detailed NPV and FRR
analyses.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

Methodology. The CDF conducted three beneficiary assessments (BA). The 2005 BA was
conducted from September to December 2005. It included 476 individual quantitative interviews
with beneficiaries, 72 in-depth interviews with key informants, 43 in-depth interviews with non-
beneficiaries, 35 focus group discussions with beneficiaries (5-8 participants per group), and at
least two day-long observations of each project. The distribution of the 476 beneficiaries was
almost evenly split between men and women, and split between infrastructure and service
projects in about the same proportion as the sample of 11 infrastructure projects and 10 social
services projects. The sample reflects the general population in terms of employment and
household income.

The 2006 BA was conducted between October and December 2006. The methodology was more
qualitative than quantitative. The sample included 11 infrastructure projects. The survey included
220 beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries (20 respondents per project). In-depth interviews were
conducted with 5 respondents per project. Special attention was dedicated to identifying key
informants from various elements of the community such as women, men, youth, senior citizens,
widows, orphans, the disabled, leaders and non-beneficiaries. In turn, they were requested to
suggest names and contacts of other suitable respondents. This selection method offered accuracy
and an internal perspective on the beneficiary communities.

The 2007 BA was conducted between April and June 2007. Its methods included in-depth
individual quantitative interviews with beneficiaries, focus group discussions with beneficiaries,
and direct observation of each project. The sample included 15 projects. The survey covered 300
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries (20 respondents per project). Because the 2006 BA focused
on infrastructure projects, the 2007 BA focused on social services and capacity building projects.
While the assessment of social projects sought to obtain subjective/qualitative perceptions of
beneficiaries, the assessment of capacity building projects sought to obtain concrete and tangible
benefits of participants receiving training.

The findings of all three are reported in this annex. All the various methods have provided
similar results regarding the level of satisfaction with the CDF. It is clear that the quality of life
has changed significantly due to CDF implemented projects. The importance of these projects is
also demonstrated by the readiness of the vast majority of respondents to fund similar projects in
their respective communities.

Relevance of CDF community subprojects. Respondents to the BAs believed the CDF project
addressed their priorities. The vast majority (90 percent) of respondents from the communities
where infrastructure projects were implemented answered that the implementation of the
respective project was a community priority. Around 40 percent of respondents saw the
implemented projects as priority projects for their community, while 55 percent claimed that there
was a big need for those projects, but they were not the main priorities. Even the beneficiaries of
the projects for people with disabilities believe that infrastructure is a higher priority for the
community.

Rural communities identify infrastructure as the main problem (41 percent). Urban communities
mention unemployment as the main problem (38 percent). Urban communities also mention
water supply (25 percent), electricity (12 percent) and local infrastructure (11 percent) as major




                                                 36

problems. Men emphasize infrastructure and unemployment as the main problems, while women
emphasize the lack of water, lack of health centers, children's education, and other social needs.

Satisfaction with CDF. The strongest message of the BAs is the sense of satisfaction with the
CDF, expressed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Some of the quotes speak more eloquently
than any statistics. One BA respondent said, "CDF has done an incredible job and we have no
complaints." Another said, "As far as CDF is concerned, there are no words large enough to
thank them." Finally, "As for CDF, what can I say more than God will reward them." The
author of the BA noted, "Not a single person encountered during site visits to the communities
has expressed dissatisfaction with this organization." These responses came from multiple BAs.
Table 3 summarizes community satisfaction with the CDF and the community investment
component on a variety of measures.

The CDF has certainly earned strong support and admiration from some individuals. But how
representative are these attitudes?       The quantitative data, from the surveys and interviews,
provide a statistical measure of the breadth of support. Almost 98 percent of respondents have
expressed various degrees of satisfaction with the support provided by CDF: 55 percent are
extremely satisfied, 28 percent are satisfied, and 15 percent are somewhat satisfied. Only 2
percent are dissatisfied.      Almost three fourths (72 percent) of the respondents expressed
satisfaction with the work of the CDF. The respondents consider their cooperation with CDF
very positive (83 percent). There is a positive correlation between the amount of community
contribution and the overall level of satisfaction.



                                                    37

Respondents also compared their satisfaction with CDF to other development organizations. One
respondent stated, "In CDF, we have found the support we couldn't find in other organizations."
When asked about which organization helped the community the most during the last two years,
the respondents within the visited communities most often named the CDF (56 percent), as well
as Municipal Authorities (30 percent), Handikos (an NGO, 18 percent), international NGOs (14
percent) and the "Mother Teresa" Humanitarian Society (4 percent). In a similar measure,
international NGOs have succeeded in completely satisfying or satisfying 61 percent of the
respondents compared to CDF's 75 percent of the community.

Satisfaction with project implementation. Community members say that they were surprised
by the meticulousness in project management and implementation. Results of the survey show
that 84 percent thought that the CDF has done good quality work, 66 percent considered the
organization of services as good, 77 percent were very satisfied with how CDF organized work in
the community, and 60 percent are satisfied with the way these projects have been implemented.
Three fourths of respondents in the 2006 survey were satisfied with how CDF monitored the
project implementation, up 3 percent from the year before. Perhaps most telling, 98 percent of
respondents answered that they would support an initiative for implementing another CDF project
in their community.

Satisfaction with the contractor. The community members were very satisfied with CDF's
selection of the contractor (76 percent) and between 73 (2005 BA) and 83 (2006 BA) percent
thought that the selection of the implementing agency was the right one. The same percentage
(83 percent) was satisfied with the quality of performance by the implementing parties.

Contractor behavior and professionalism were two key criteria in community satisfaction with the
contractor. In two BAs, more than 95 percent of respondents claimed that they were satisfied
with the contractor's behavior in relation to their community. Respondents are satisfied with the
manner concerns are addressed (75 percent) and the level of professionalism on the part of
implementing organization (85 percent). About 75 percent of respondents were happy about the
materials and the equipment used for completing the work. The only reservation was that some
felt contractors had a tendency to use inadequate materials and leave small unfinished details.

Satisfaction with training. Recipients of training have expressed high levels of satisfaction. All
beneficiaries interviewed during the assessment are satisfied with all aspects of the training.
Aside from the content treated by the trainers, participants were also quite satisfied with the
logistical aspects of these exercises. Participants were satisfied with the quality of the training.

Nonetheless, there was some sentiment that the training, although a good start, were insufficient.
A common attitude was that the training is the "tip of the iceberg" in comparison to the need for
training in the field of European integration. One participant stated that "The few training
sessions that we had (4 or 5 modules) were just an isolated spark. Now, they need additional
training on institutional capacity, fundraising, working with donors, monitoring, evaluation,
reporting, etc."   Beneficiaries suggest longer local government-specific training that would
provide them with necessary skills. Exercises and training were perceived by participants more
as a presentation on the changes introduced, than actual training, because during these exercises
participants were exposed to information rather than skill-building. Exercises and training were
perceived by participants more as a benchmark presentation on best practices than actual training
because during these exercises participants were exposed to information rather than skill-
building. The level of capacity building carried out through this project is not certain.         The
participants believe that the training will enhance their performance at work and are convinced it

will result in better evaluation of their work in the future. Time will tell. Although short term
benefits for participants are evident, the long term capacities have not been affected a great deal.
The reason is not the manner in which the training were conducted, but mainly due to the
changing nature of procedures of the subject.

Satisfaction with transparency.         The majority of respondents are satisfied with CDF's
transparency regarding project implementation expenditures: 32 percent claimed that they were
very satisfied while 25 percent were somewhat satisfied. The percentage of those that are
dissatisfied with CDF's transparency is very small. The same is true of satisfaction with the
transparency of the Village/Community Committee: 60 percent claimed that they were satisfied.

Satisfaction with sustainability. Beneficiaries were a little less satisfied with the
sustainability/maintenance issue of social services projects, in comparison to what was the case
with infrastructure projects: 36 percent were very satisfied, while 31 percent were somewhat
satisfied with the solution of the project sustainability issue. The relatively high level of
dissatisfaction with the sustainability issue of these projects has to do with their nature. Social
projects are often linked with a set time period, deal with a narrow social category or a very
specific activity, and are not projects that have physical results or that have a large number of
direct beneficiaries.

Satisfaction with project impacts. There was unanimous agreement from BA respondents that
the services projects have had a positive impact on local communities. The level of satisfaction is
very high with the overall project impact on the lives of interviewed respondents with over 90
percent expressing positive remarks: 51 percent were very happy with the impact of these projects
on the community, while 33 percent were somewhat satisfied. Only 4 percent of respondents
claimed they were unhappy with the impact these projects had on their community.

Impacts of infrastructure. Almost three fourths (72 percent) of respondents emphasize the
improvement of the living environment. School reconstruction in one village had a direct impact
in improving the quality of the classes, consistency of the education process and even the
students' health. Approximately half (48 percent) of respondents have claimed that
implementation of these projects has resulted in temporary employment. They believed that
infrastructure projects have prevented the emigration of the population from villages to the cities.
More than half (56 percent) of the respondents claimed that as a result of the implementation of
these projects, these was an increase in undertaking these kinds of initiatives.

Psychological impacts. Social programs have been very effective in restoring self-confidence in
certain vulnerable groups in Kosovo, in particular, the disabled, the youth, the elderly, and mixed
ethnic communities. Two thirds of (66 percent) of surveyed community members claim that the
implementation of the projects has led to a confidence boost and a sense of worth within the
community. The projects' implementation in rural areas has helped in modernizing life there.
With the improvement of living standards, the citizens feel they are involved in the trends of
contemporary/modern life. It has provided for a sense of financial security. It has also increased
the interaction of women. For example, service projects for women in one community where 100
men were lost in a single day of the war provided a forum for alleviating their emotional suffering
and as awareness-raising mean for realizing that `life must go on'. More young people now
consider themselves capable of these actions and feel they've gained important experience.

Projects working with the disabled brought great satisfaction to parents, seeing someone taking
care of their disabled children. According to the respondents' claims, these children need to get
out of the house from time to time, change the environment and get involved in any activity.


                                                 39

Previously there had been a lack of respect for people with disabilities. They were often teased
and mocked. Besides the increase of the respect that others had for the people with disabilities,
the disabled have also increased their self-belief and believing that they are very valuable
members of society.

Half of the respondents claimed that the implementation of these projects has also had a positive
influence in cultural development within the community. In the communities where schools were
built, not only is there an improvement in working conditions within the school, but also an
increase in literacy, especially among girls.

Integration. Close to two-thirds of the BA respondents stated that implementation of these
projects had a positive effect on integration. Almost three fourths (72 percent) of respondents
emphasize this aspect of the change in their community's life. One project targeted both Serbian
youth and Albanians. The project gave attention to multi-ethnicity of the northern part of
Kosovo, and to inter-ethnic youth cooperation, which for some time had been nonexistent. As the
2007 BA noted, "The CDF, the Kosovo Relief Committee and the youth activists have shown to
both Albanian and Kosovar politicians that cooperation is possible and that only through
inclusive dialogue and decision-making, problems can be resolved successfully."

Annex 9. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

CIDA provided a $1.2 million grant to the World Bank for the Kosovo Community
Development Fund project to improve the quality, access, and availability of community
infrastructure and promote institutional capacity building at the community and
municipal levels.

Under the provisions of the grant agreement, CIDA did not directly monitor the activities
or outcomes of the KCDF project. As Canada does not maintain an official presence in
Kosovo, the project was primarily monitored through reports to CIDA and visits to the
field.

CIDA notes that the KCDF has achieved results in the improvement of the quality and
availability of community services and improved capacity of local communities (civil
society and governments) to identify priorities, manage and maintain local investments
and improve service delivery.

CIDA is pleased to note that three beneficiary assessments indicate a high level of
satisfaction with the project and positive attitude towards the level of dedication in
project implementation.

The Project confirmed that social fund activities can provide a better quality of life for
the poor, can be efficient mechanisms for constructing small-scale infrastructure, and can
build social capital. The activities it supported responded to immediate needs within a
broader framework.

Annex 10: Poverty Targeting Strategy and Regional Allocation of Funds

In accordance with the poverty targeting strategy, project funds were targeted on the basis of a
two-stage process as follows to ensure equity across all regions and all ethnic groups, and to
facilitate the planning and disbursement of these funds by the CDF.

Stage 1: Regional Targeting. The total amount of CDF II project funds available for regional
allocation was estimated at US$2.60 million for community infrastructure (works) projects. It
was agreed that: (i) US$ 0.26 million would be allocated to the Serbian communities; and that (ii)
a total of US$0.26 would be allocated to a special fund for mixed and minority communities and
for resettlement of returnees. The balance (US$ 2.08 million) would be allocated to the regions.

The regional allocations were based on two broad factors: (a) the population size of each region;
and (b) a composite poverty index computed from three poverty indicators. The three poverty
indicators were: (i) the poverty incidence (head count index) or the proportion of the population
living below official poverty line ­ representing the extent of poverty; (ii) extreme poverty,
representing the proportion of the population living below the Food Poverty Line; and (iii) the
severity index representing the intensity of poverty which captured the extent to which people
were below the poverty line, weighted by their respective distances from the poverty line. At the
time of project preparation, the latest available estimates for these indicators for the period 2000-
2001 were obtained from the December 2001 KPA. The five regions are North-East (Prishtine),
South-West (Prizren), West (Peje), North (Mitrovice), and South-East (Gjilan).

Table 1 below shows the allocation of CDF II Funds by region and actual expenditures. As
shown therein, actual funds for CDF II projects closely correspond to the planned allocations.
This is confirmed by the high value of the coefficient of correlation between the allocation of
funds and actual disbursements which is calculated to be 98.6 percent. Another notable feature is
that the overall level of expenditure has exceeded the targets in US dollar terms. This is
attributable to the strengthening of the Euro vis-à-vis the US dollar during the past few years
(CDF accounting is done in Euros) and a real increase in the volume of work induced by a recent
decline in the price of construction materials due to competition.

In the case of the Serbian and minority communities, the allocations at the time of the design of
the project were US$260,000 each. The target for minorities has been clearly exceeded. In
regard to the Serbian communities, although a sum of US$264,516 had been committed to
projects, the actual disbursement to 5 out of a total of 39 projects was 9 percent lower due to
significantly lower average costs of projects in the Serbian communities. These projects, such as
sewerage or road rehabilitation projects, were lower in cost compared to schools in other regions
which had much higher average costs. The CDF initiated work on a sixth project in a Serbian
community, the cost of which would have helped exceed the target of US$260,000.
Unfortunately, a dispute arose between two Serbian groups, and construction had to be stopped.

It should be noted that the 5 projects in the Serbian communities represent a significant
achievement considering the ethnic tensions that were prevalent in these communities. It took two
to three times as long to implement projects in Serbian communities as elsewhere. Their residents
were said to be mistrustful of projects, even reluctant to submit proposals despite the special
incentives offered for projects in minority or mixed communities. Activities in these areas also
required extra coordination arrangements. For example, Albanian contractors were hesitant to
work there because of security concerns (which still obstruct CDF site visits to these areas).
Therefore, the CDF contracted a Serbian engineer to work in these communities, and Albanian
contractors selected on a competitive basis had to carry out construction activities through
Serbian subcontractors.

Stage 2: Community Level Targeting. Within each region, its allocation was then targeted at the
poorer communities using the following criteria: (a) the perceived level of priority indicated by
the municipality; (b) the demand driven approach reflected in proposals received from
communities based on the outreach and promotional activities carried out by the CDF; and (c) a
rigorous project appraisal system which takes into account the detailed second level targeting
criteria set out in the Operational Manual. The criteria in the project appraisal system include: the
number of families in the community; the ethnic composition; the number of persons receiving
welfare; the number of pensioners; percentage of employment; agricultural production; the state
of social and physical infrastructure; distance to markets; access to a town; distance to a town;
priorities as perceived by the community; type and number of projects already implemented with
municipal or community financing; the local institutional framework; participation by women and
youth in the local councils; and commitment of the community to participate in the project (see
table 2).

The community (second) level targeting carried out under CDF II is broadly consistent with the
poverty profiles for 2003/04 and 2005/06 presented in the Bank's Kosovo Poverty Assessment
(KPA) Report of October 2007. This report draws much of its content from the Household
Budget Surveys (HSB), which is a core survey conducted by the Statistical Office of Kosovo
(SOK).     Although the HSB provides a useful start for monitoring poverty and inequality,
uncertainties remain regarding the representativeness of the samples. The surveys still use the
1981 population frame (from the last census) for selecting areas, and therefore households, to
include in the sample. Much has changed since then; some areas which were highly populated
may not be so now, and vice versa. Furthermore, the sample size of 2400 was noted in the KPA
to be rather small. Thus, the results of the KPA are not representative at the community level.
Nevertheless, at more aggregated levels (administrative regions, or rural-urban divides) the
results of the KPA provide some useful insights.

According to the KPA, more than two thirds of the population lived in the rural areas, and on the
basis of non-income measures of poverty, rural populations were worse off than urban
populations. For example, only 60 percent of the poorest quintile in rural areas have indoor water


                                                48

supply compared to 80 percent in the highest quintile, and these rates were much lower than those
in urban areas. As regards school enrollments, the gap in secondary enrollment rates between
rural and urban areas was about 20 percentage points in 2003/04, but had fallen to about 10
percentage points in 2005/06. In retrospect, it should be noted that the second level targeting
criteria used by the CDF has, in fact, guided the infrastructure projects in the rural areas. Out of a
total of 39 infrastructure microprojects, 36 were implemented in the rural areas. However, in the
case of the 68 social service projects, the rural-urban split was somewhat even, considering that
vulnerable segments of the population with special needs live both in rural and urban areas.

The second level targeting approach under the CDF Project has been further developed through a
Community Mapping and Social Needs Assessment that was completed in March 2007 in
anticipation of a possible follow-up project. One important outcome of this exercise is the
identification of severe pockets of poverty and isolation. The results of this exercise are being
shared with the PISG and other development agencies. The Ministry of Mining and Energy has
already begun to collaborate with the CDF because of their interest in the Sibovc community in
the Obiliq Municipality.

The main objectives of this exercise were to: (i) launch a process of consultation with the poorest
communities and vulnerable groups which would help identify their problems and needs; (ii)
collect data on a number of factors to identify diagnostic information about vulnerable and
neglected communities including ethnic minorities; (iii) inform decision makers at the central and
local government levels, NGOs and other donors about the current situation as possible inputs to
local strategic planning; and (iv) help the CDF to assist communities formulate proposals and
select appropriate microprojects for appraisal. The methodology used for this exercise consisted
of:

    · Quantitative face-to-face interviews
    · In-depth interviews
    · Focus group discussions
    · On-site observations and consultations with relevant stakeholders.

A total of 6 municipalities have been already selected from three regions: North-East
(Municipalities of Novoberde, Lipjan, Fushe Kosove, and Obiliq); North (Municipality of
Mitrovice); and South-West (Municipality of Dragash), based on a set of criteria. These criteria
consist of: (i) a high poverty ratio; (ii) a high presence of ethnic minorities; (iii) poor coverage of
donor-funded activities and projects; and (iv) severe social and economic isolation and
infrastructure deficiencies. The sources of data for the selection included the UNDP Kosovo
Human Development Report of 2004, the Municipal Profiles of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo,
and primary field data collected by Index Kosova (a local consultancy firm).                From each
municipality, 3 communities were selected, for a total of 18 communities. The selection of
communities was based on assessments and observations in the field by regional supervisors and
researchers involved in this project.

Research Design and Instruments. The research design included 900 general interviews, 54 in-
depth interviews, 36 focus group discussions, and 18 check-list questionnaires (1 per community).
The research instruments included structured questionnaires for the general interviews, semi-
structured questionnaires for the in-depth interviews, guides for focus groups discussions, and
check-list questionnaires for the communities.

Collaborative Approaches. The results of the poverty targeting exercise were used not only by
the CDF, but also by the PISG and other development agencies. As noted earlier, the Ministry of
Energy and Mining (MEM) is collaborating with the CDF, in view of their interest in the Sibovc
community in the Obiliq Municipality. The MEM has expressed its willingness to share its
assessment with the CDF so as to complement each others work.

Annex 11. Kosovo CDF Corporate Plan 2007-2012

Executive Summary

The Corporate Plan aims at articulating the objectives of CDF during 2007-2012, as well as its
planned strategies for achieving these objectives, in line with the evolving environment in
Kosovo and in support of the Government's priority policies and reforms relating to local
development activities. The Corporate Plan encompasses broad themes covering its strengths and
weaknesses, its external environment, and opportunities and challenges ahead. The Plan is the
result of a three-month process of active participation of CDF Board and staff, independent
experts on management and European integration, representatives from the governmental and
partner institutions, as well as other stakeholders. The CDF Corporate plan draws from relevant
documents on development programs in Kosovo, analysis of needs of communities, studies and
reports on impact of the CDF projects on communities, as well as the situational analysis
conducted by synthesizing varied points of view.

The Community Development Fund (CDF) is one of the first initiatives in post-conflict Kosovo,
designed to help communities in rebuilding their shattered infrastructure and improving
community services. The CDF operates as a non-governmental organization with Public Benefit
Status, since November 2000 to carry out community development projects through small-scale
community investments. With an overall budget of US$23.15 million during 2000-2006 funded
by the World Bank and other international and local donors, supported by a contribution of
US$ 3.63 million from benefiting communities, the CDF has implemented projects for the benefit
of over 40 percent of the Kosovo population.

In Kosovo and abroad, the CDF is well known as a development agency for its visible impact in
achieving its prime goal of poverty reduction and improving living conditions both in rural and
urban areas, including Serbian, minority communities, and returnees. The success of the CDF II
Project financed by the World Bank, CIDA and other donors is attributable to its implementation
of three types of high quality, and cost-effective projects which have made a tangible
development impact on the living conditions of the Kosovo population. These comprise:

    (i) infrastructure works, especially in poor, conflict-affected and mountainous communities,
         where the CDF has developed the capacity to penetrate and engage communities in
         formulating relevant project proposals;
    (ii) social service projects in response to priority needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged
         groups in Kosovo; and
    (iii)Institutional capacity building projects at the local level to ensure the sustainability of
         facilities constructed or rehabilitated, improve social service delivery, and support the
         Government's decentralization agenda.

As a result of these projects, beneficiary communities now enjoy potable water, new or
rehabilitated, cleaner environment, better and warmer classrooms, cleaner and safer sewerage
systems, and access roads to neighboring communities. The social and cultural standards of the
population have also benefited from a variety of social services projects that have responded to
the needs of the disabled, problems of youth and of vulnerable groups. Moreover, the work of
CDF has helped in strengthening the social interaction and providing incentives to the young to
remain in local areas, thus stemming the tendency for rural-urban migration.




                                                 52

Continuous progress has also been made in building the institutional capacity to ensure the
quality and sustainability of implemented projects. In recognition of the quality of capacity
building provided, the CDF was invited by the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the
Ministry of Administration and Local Government to coordinate a comprehensive training
program in financial management and budgeting for all budget units at the central and local
government levels in Kosovo.

The main strengths of the CDF are in broad terms, its technical and professional experience,
capacity to penetrate into remote and mountainous communities to carry out development
activities, recognition at the central government level of CDF's excellence in carrying out
capacity building programs, and its close relationships with government agencies in carrying out
work programs within the evolving framework of government policy and programs.              Over the
past eight years, the CDF has also established solid partnerships with local NGOs, development
agencies and a number of external donors.

As a development agency, the CDF has no major perceived weaknesses. However, there are
some obvious areas that require to be strengthened. These include: (i) monitoring and evaluation;
(ii) promotion and outreach particularly regarding participation and information dissemination at
the community level; and (iii) further training in environmental assessment for relevant officers to
update their knowledge regarding changes in environmental legislation. These areas are currently
being addressed.

The opportunities or the "market" for the CDF lie in the construction and rehabilitation of small
and medium-scale infrastructure, and in providing priority social services to selected poor,
vulnerable, and disadvantaged groups. Notwithstanding the considerable amount of community
development work has been accomplished by the CDF and other donors, the Beneficiary
Assessments revealed that a project or two in a community cannot fulfill all the community needs.
Although the need for small-scale water supply projects emerged as a top priority during the past
few years, with the construction of such projects under CDF I and CDF II, shifts in demand are
perceived. The emerging priorities as perceived by communities consist of access roads followed
by employment, electricity, water, and primary health centers. These perceptions are broadly
consistent with current assessments concerning the poor state of infrastructure in rural areas. For
example the "Agriculture and Rural Development Plan, 2007-2013" presents the fact in about
1496 villages in Kosovo, only 40 percent have access by asphalted roads, 41percent have public
or local water supply, only 10 percent are served by sewerage systems and 13% have organized
waste collection, etc

A main challenge likely to be faced by the CDF is the level of competition from the other
development agencies operating in Kosovo. These agencies may develop or strengthen their
capacity to carry out work programs in some areas where the CDF has been active. Nevertheless,
the CDF as an institution with high levels of professional skills and dedication, a proven track
record on quality of output, cost-effectiveness, beneficiary satisfaction, and the outreach, trust and
confidence established with the communities, has a strong likelihood of retaining its already
dominant market share. The demand for CDF services is very apparent from close to 500
archived projects i.e. a pipeline of projects not approved by the CDF Board.

As envisaged in the draft Kosovo Development Strategic Plan (KDSP), the evolving scenario is
an extensive workload of infrastructure construction, or rehabilitation of such a large magnitude
and of a varied typology and size that it requires the collective efforts of several agencies to carry
out the tasks involved. The work of the CDF would, in fact, complement those of other projects.
In water supply, for example, the CDF would largely focus on small isolated self-contained


                                                  53

systems in remote areas, complementing the work of other agencies that would deliver large
systems. Another key initiative of the KDSP is to develop and implement a strategy to build and
strengthen policy development and strategic management competencies at the national and local
government levels. The CDF would support this endeavor with particular emphasis on capacity
building at the local government level in support of the Government's decentralization program.

The CDF strives to build upon its solid track record of significant technical and professional
experience in implementing community projects, and with the capacity to penetrate and carry out
development work in isolated communities with immediate needs. The CDF also has a solid track
record of cooperation with governmental institutions and stakeholders, paying a special attention
to promoting the sense of ownership.         Through its projects, the CDF aims at building the
capacities of self development within the communities, so as to be able to articulate and fulfill
their development needs as a community in its whole, or as a certain group within one community.
The CDF will also support local governments, in their respective roles regarding community
development. While addressing the needs of the communities, the CDF is dedicated to offering
high quality services, not only in the field of infrastructure, but also in the fields of social services
and capacity building. These strengths augur well for carrying out a substantial volume of
development activity in the future. It is estimated that the CDF has the capacity to carry out
construction activities amounting to about US$6 million per year.

The CDF will fulfill its mission through an approach which requires analysis and articulation of
the needs by the communities themselves and at the same time help the communities and local
governments in taking charge of their respective roles in compliance with the development plans
of the governmental institutions, focusing especially in the decentralization process. The path for
fulfilling the CDF mission is tracked by strategic objectives. For each objective set, special
activities are foreseen, including the dynamics of implementation, as well as respective roles and
responsibilities.  Special attention will be focused on organizational capacity of CDF, with the
goal of becoming a "learning and doing organization", based on the lessons learned from its own
experience as well as the experience of others. The benefits of these lessons will be shared with
the communities so as to enable them to chart their future on a path of sustainable development.
