The war, however, severely disrupted economic\n            activity. In the 1999 conflict, most of Decan\u0092s inhabitants\n            fled and almost three fifths of all houses were totally\n            destroyed. Most of the Agro- Kombinat, the collective\n            farming infrastructure, was severely damaged and a lot of\n            private farming equipment disappeared. Poverty increased and\n            unemployment, particularly among youth, rose dramatically.\n            Basic infrastructure was lacking. The breakdown of social\n            services worsened conditions. In these trying circumstances,\n            the most vulnerable social groups - particularly the\n            disabled - suffered the most. The case of Decan is\n            representative of the challenges the World Bank faces in\n            helping people rebuild their lives in Kosovo. Post-war\n            reconstruction tends to focus primarily on emergency\n            assistance. Yet a strong commitment to long-term,\n            sustainable development is crucial for assistance to bear fruit."}, "docdt": "2006-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
