The people of\n            Podujev\u00eb were busy pulling their lives together from the\n            ravages of conflict and the complications of Kosovo\u2019s\n            uncertain reality. The most immediate problem was the stench\n            from the open-sewers and the diseases that brought with\n            them. So the towns people got together and drew up plans to\n            lay a sewage line along the main street. All villagers with\n            cash to spare contributed to the project. For each small\n            project, their partner was the Community Development Fund\n            (CDF). The fund was set up in 1999 by the World Bank. So far\n            it has provided grants to 320 projects all over Kosovo.\n            Village committees pass project ideas to the municipal\n            councils which must agree to provide their share before a\n            proposal is submitted to the CDF. The CDF staff manage the\n            finances of each project and train local civil servants to\n            improve their performance. Contractors like it too because\n            they are more likely to get paid in full and on time. A\n            major strength of the fund, which focuses on local\n            infrastructure, schools, and social services is the special\n            relationship it has fostered between citizens and municipal\n            authorities. Its success has attracted additional support\n            from several governments like Austrians, Canadians, Dutch,\n            and Swiss."}, "docdt": "2006-09-01T03:29:03Z"}
