DEVELOPMENT FUND II PROJE-", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Community\n            Development Fund Project for Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            project confirmed that social fund activities can provide a\n            better quality of life for the poor, can be efficient\n            mechanisms for constructing small-scale infrastructure, can\n            build social capital, and have a visible, inclusive\n            development impact. Indeed, these operations can serve as\n            catalysts for a process in which citizens in targeted\n            communities, especially in mixed and minority communities,\n            gradually came together over time and participate in the\n            design, implementation and monitoring of projects which\n            respond to the common good of the community. An important\n            lesson of this project is that the sustainability of\n            community investments has significantly improved through the\n            financial management training which resulted in\n            municipalities preparing five-year financial plans which now\n            provide line items for maintenance expenditures of public\n            facilities. In addition, training in the areas of monitoring\n            and supervision of micro-projects is equally critical. A\n            critical aspect in this type of operation is the development\n            of a comprehensive framework for stakeholder involvement and\n            participation, in addition to strong institutional support\n            from the project team, effective systems and procedures.\n            Outreach and promotion, a community mapping and profiling\n            exercise, and needs assessments are important elements to\n            the success of this operation. Indeed, better communication\n            between project committees, municipality authorities and\n            beneficiaries also underline the importance of including an\n            awareness raising component in this type of operation. The\n            targeting of young people in this type of project, and\n            particularly give the sensitive political situation in\n            Kosovo, was of considerable importance because among\n            conflict-affected areas, youth risks are the highest due to\n            the combined conditions of conflict, poverty, and high\n            levels of youth unemployment."}, "docdt": "2008-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
