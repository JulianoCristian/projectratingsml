To minimize soil erosion and\n            contamination due to construction, and/or medical waste\n            materials, regular control and cleaning of construction\n            sites should be enforced, including the provision of\n            adequate waste disposal services.

Construction should be restricted to daytime\n            hours, to prevent noise disturbances, and in addition, prior\n            to construction, special attention should be given to site\n            selection, to mitigate loss of natural vegetation (to be\n            followed by re-vegetation practices), or sensitive species.\n            Protection of historical/cultural sites, call for the\n            immediate notification to the relevant authorities should\n            archaeological finds occur.
