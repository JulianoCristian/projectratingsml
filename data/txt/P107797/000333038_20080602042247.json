Policy\n            Credit Project for Governments of Bangladesh (GOB) supported\n            by the credit cover the areas of: (i) financial stability\n            and restructuring, (ii) private investment in generation;\n            (iii) regulatory reform and institutional strengthening,\n            (iv) corporate governance of state-owned enterprises in the\n            sector, and (v) transparent and accountable\n            commercialization of energy services; and (vi) rural\n            electrification strategy and institutional development. The\n            development objective is the enhancement of governance and\n            accountability, and of financial stability, in the sector\n            leading to better and more sustainable service provision.\n            The benefits of the project are follows: (i) enhanced\n            quality, transparency, and efficiency of power generation\n            contracting processes leading to increased private\n            investment on competitive terms; (ii) enhanced governance of\n            corporative service providers, including through improved\n            metering, billing and collection systems; (iii) accelerated\n            development of regulatory capacity by strengthening the\n            operations of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission;\n            and (iv) reduction of commercial losses. The risks under\n            this project are: (i) change in Government leading to change\n            in policy; (ii) macro-fiscal deterioration that complicates\n            energy pricing adjustments; (iii) inadequate investor\n            interest to meet Bangladesh's power sector needs on\n            affordable terms; (iv) labor strife that blocks governance\n            reform, especially in the context of the corporatization\n            process; and (v) service delivery problems, linked to both\n            inadequate generation and natural gas shortages, that damage\n            the credibility and legitimacy of the GOB reform program."}, "docdt": "2008-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
