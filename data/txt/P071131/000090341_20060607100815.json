institutional\n            development impact was high, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the project: The project\n            from the design to the implementation stage had highest\n            commitment from the Ministry of Finance, Monetary Board,\n            Governor and the staff of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\n            (CBSL). Utilization of external staff in project management\n            units usually results in delays in implementation due to\n            their steep learning curve. The modernization process was\n            considered one of the primary activities of the CBSL rather\n            than treating it an adjunct to their core functions. Each\n            component was led by a senior, technically qualified\n            professional and they could muster support from the rest of\n            the staff in the bank as well as the other stakeholders in\n            the financial sector. The CBSL always aspired to obtain the\n            best international expertise wherever necessary. The IDA\n            project team responded proactively and was flexible in the\n            project components and funding. The modernization process\n            was homegrown and spearheaded by the central bank and\n            therefore they were able to manage effectively the donor\n            interests and contributions to enhance the modernization\n            process. The core functions, the payment system, monetary\n            policy changes, bank supervision etc. were given a legal\n            basis in the relevant laws to ensure long term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2006-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
