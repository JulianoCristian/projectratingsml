moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: expectations for implementation of\n            reform projects in countries with changing political\n            environments should be realistic and potential\n            implementation delays should be anticipated and proactively\n            addressed, especially in the case of complex projects\n            covering a wide range of activities. This project\n            demonstrated that close work with oblast or rayon\n            authorities, communities, and population was critical for\n            building broad ownership and support to project activities\n            at lower levels. Coordination initiatives should be\n            initiated upstream among Development Partners (DPs')\n            headquarters offices at a program planning stage to avoid\n            constraints in coordination at the country level when\n            DPs' respective programs or projects have been\n            pre-defined at their headquarters. The right composition of\n            a task team, including specialized technical and strong task\n            management and operational skills, is required to supervise\n            complex projects in challenging environments. Streamlined\n            results framework and adequate monitoring arrangements are\n            essential to guide implementation and measure results. The\n            Bank teams should anticipate that construction on new sites\n            may become necessary even if not initially envisaged and,\n            therefore, ensure an appropriate mechanism is in place to\n            confirm the location and nature of works prior to initiation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
