                         (i) The Health Sector Masterplan which was developed with the support of the CBHP, was approved by the Government of Tajikistan on April 1st, 2011 in compliance with the
                         deadline for the Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG). The project will continue to support the Ministry of Health in the implementation of the per capita formula for the
                         allocation of all Primary Health Care (PHC) resources for 2 districts in Sogd Oblast to ensure the new health sector trigger under the PDPG 6 is met by March 2012; (ii) in April, 2011
                         the Bank was informed by the MOH of the resignation of the Director of the CBHP's Project Implementing Unit (PIU). The procedures to be followed in the selection of a replacement
                         were discussed with the MOH and it was agreed that the process of recruiting a new Director would be carried out expeditiously to prevent delays in project implementation; (iii)
                         confirmation of the allocation of IDA funds for a new health results based financing (RBF) project was received in April. The Bank team will submit an application to the Health Results
                         Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) for additional funds towards the project's RBF component in June 2011.
