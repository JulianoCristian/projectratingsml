     2. Project Status. The overall project implementation progress and development
objectives have been rated satisfactory since the start of the project. Project results show
that its impact thus far has been consistent with the expectations set out at the start of the project.
The Community and Basic Health Project (CBHP) has supported the Ministry of Health in: (a)
institutionalizing the Health Policy and Analysis Unit (HPAU) which conducts ongoing analysis
of reform progress; (b) developing and implementing health financing reforms at the primary
health care and hospital levels in two regions; renovation of 55 basic health facilities and building
health sector personnel capacity through family medicine re-training and health management
training. The Government remains committed to continued implementation of health sector
reforms supported under the project. As of August 2010, the total disbursement rate for this grant
reached 98 percent with the remaining amounts fully committed.

    3. The proposed reallocation is necessary to reflect more accurate funding needs by
category and to accommodate project savings in the Project Preparation Advance category.
This reallocation does not result in a change to the project activities, which are expected to reach
full completion by the closing date of December 31, 2010, for this original grant. It also does not
involve any changes to the project development objective or associated outcome targets.
