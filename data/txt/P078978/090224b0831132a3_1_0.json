Kurbonova treats a wide range of illnesses from\n            coughs and headaches to injuries and depression. Since 2006,\n            the World Bank- funded community and basic health project\n            has been training or retraining doctors and nurses in family\n            medicine, and building clinics in rural communities to\n            provide them with affordable, quality health care. In the\n            aftermath of the civil conflict and economic decline of the\n            1990s, the health sector was in a deep crisis as a result of\n            underfunding and outflow of qualified personnel. In\n            addition, excessive emphasis was placed on hospital care\n            provision over primary healthcare, and it received the bulk\n            of public sector health allocation. That contributed to\n            geographic divisions and underfunding, hampering the\n            efficient use of resources and posing a threat to access to\n            care for low-income groups, particularly in rural areas.\n            Through its healthcare project, the Ministry of Health, the\n            World Bank and other development partners worked to address\n            the imbalances by piloting family medical care, and\n            introducing per capita healthcare funding and a basic\n            benefits package in two large provinces, Khatlon and Soghd.\n            The project included upgrading physical infrastructure that\n            is vital to ensure good quality of services. Eighteen\n            primary healthcare facilities were rehabilitated, as were\n            two family medicine training centers. And 38 new primary\n            healthcare facilities were built in Khatlon and Soghd\n            provinces altogether."}, "docdt": "2012-04-16T08:06:04Z"}
