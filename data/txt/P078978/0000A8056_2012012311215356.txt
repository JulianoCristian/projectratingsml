                          (i) With one year left to the closure of the project, it is important that Ministry of Health closely monitorsthe progress on civil works to ensure that all five Primary Health Care center
                         rehabilitation works and equipping in Temur Malik rayon are completed on time; (ii) The Government recently approved Decree No. 536 on the Introduction of New Financing
                         Mechanisms for Public Health Facilities in the Republic of Tajikistan. The Bank, together with the other Development Partners (DPs), will support the Government in the
