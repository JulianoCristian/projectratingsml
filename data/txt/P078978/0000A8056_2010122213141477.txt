                         Key-issues:
                         The original and first additional financing grants have supported a number of key activities over the last several years including the rehabilitation and reconstruction of 60 primary
                         health care facilities, the retraining of over 800 nurses and doctors in family medicine and the development of a number of key health sector documents namely- a Health Sector
                         Masterplan, Health Human Resource Plan and first National Health Accounts (completed in September, 2010). The two plans are expected to be finalized and approved by the
                         Ministry of Health by the end of December, 2010. Government approval of the Health Sector Masterplan is expected in early 2011. A second additional financing to the project in the
                         amount of $3 million was approved by the Board in June 2010, and this will extend the project for two years until December 31st 2012. Activities that will be supported in this next
                         phase of the project include the scaling up of ongoing health financing reforms, retraining of family medicine practitioners, and the rehabilitation of primary health care facilities.
