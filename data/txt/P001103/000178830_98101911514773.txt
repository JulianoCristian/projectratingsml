IVORY COAST
FOURTH EIGSWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The transport system of the Ivory Coast consists of more than 14,000
km of all-weather roads, about 640 km of railroads, two deep-water seaports,
400 km of navigable lagoons along the Atlantic coast, and nine airports.
Roads are the predominant mode used for internal transport.
ii.       Previous Bank Group lending in the transport sector has totalled
about US$51.3 million which helped finance three projecto for road construc-
tion and for improvement of maintenance, and a fourth for acquisition of diesel
locomotives for the Abidjan-Ouagadougou railway. Since 1968, the Bank has also
assisted the Ivory Coast as executing agency for a Transport Survey financed
by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The present project has
evolved from this survey, and represents the next appropriate step in the
country's highway development.
iii.      The proposed project consists of:  (a) construction of the new road,
Yabayo-Gagnoa (79 km); (b) reconstruction of the N'Zi river bridge; and (c)
preparation of a feeder road program in cotton-growing areas. The total coet
of the project is estimated at US$12.3 million. The foreign cost of US$7.5
million is proposed for financing under the present Credit; the Government
will finance the local costs estimated at US$4.8 million equivalent.
iv.       The Directorate General of Public Works under the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport vill be responsible for execution of the project.  It will
be assisted by consultants employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association. Construction under the project vill be by contract let after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
v.        Construction of the Yabayo-Gagnoa road is expected to yield an eco-
nomic return of about 15%, and of the N'Zi river bridge a return of at least
14Z. The overall economic return is about 14Z.
vi.       The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$7.5
million to the Republic of Ivory Coast.






1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The proposed project is the fourth Bank Group operation for highways
in Ivory Coast. As were the two previous highway projects, it îs a result of
the findings of the Transport Survey begun in 1968 and financed by the UNDP
with the Bank as executing agency, and of engineering carried out by the con-
sultants SETEC (France) under the First Highway Project (Loan 542-IVC).
1.02      The UNDP Transport Survey was undertaken by SETEC in two phases.
Phase I, an averall survey of transport requirements, was executed in 1968/69,
and made general recommendations for investments in the various transport
modes. One of the principal recommendations of Phase I was that an exten-
sive program of primary road improvements should be undertaken and steps
taken to improve road maintenance. Phase II, completed in 1972, consisted
of (a) feasibility studies of roads selected on the basis of recommendations
made in Phase I; (b) detailed engineering of the Bouake-Katiola road; and (c)
a study of highway administration and maintenance. A road-user taxation study,
to be started soon, will conclude the Transport Survey.
1.03      The First Highway Project, financed by Loan 542-IVC (US$5.8 million)
in 1968, consisted of (a) construction of a paved road from Abengourou to
Abnibilekrou (60 km); and (b) feasibility studies for 700 km of primary roads,
to be followed by detailed engineering of 500 km. Construction under the
project was satisfactorily completed in July 1971, and the detailed engineer-
ing in 1972.
1.04      The Second Highway Project, financed by Loan 761-IVC (US$20.5 mil-
lion) in 1971, consisted of (a) construction of the Yabayo-Man road, including
a branch to Guiglo (238 km), (b) construction of the Bouake-Katiola road (49
km); and (c) detailed engineering of 300 km of roads.  The construction con-
tracts vere awarded in March/April 1972, and works started in mid-1972. How-
ever, due to the proposed construction of two dams on the Sassandra river,
the Government decided to change the alignment of the Yabayo-Man road and
adopt a new route via Issia. The necessary amendment to the Loan Agreement
vill be submitted to the Executive Directors for approval in due course.
Detailed engineering of the new alignment (120 km) forms part of the studies
provided under item (c) of the project. Another road selected for engineer-
ing is the Katiola-Badikaha road (137 km) parallel to the railway Abidjan-
Ouagadougou. This engineering, held back since November 1971 until completion
of a report on the realignment of the Dimbokro-Tafire railway section, will
begin soon. Review of this report has indicated that the potential traffic
to be diverted from the railway to the road is a maximum of 10%.
1.05      The Third Highway Project, financed by Loan 837-IVC (US$17.5 million)
in 1972, provided for: (a) implementation of a four-year highway maintenance
and betterment program; (b) strengthening of about 110 km of paved roads, in-
cluding partial realignnent and widening, (c) reconstruction of the bridge on
the Boubo river; and (d) a study of urban infrastructure development in Abidjan.
The consultant's contract for the maintenance program was signed on March 28,
1973. Contracta for the strengthening of paved roads have not yet been awarded



-2-
because bids exceeded estimated costs by 25%. After detailed analysis of the
bids, the Government decided to reject contractors' proposals and to call for
new bids; these are expected to be received in July 1973. Bids for the Boubo
bridge have already been receîved, along with proposals for construction of
the N'Zi bridge, included in the present project. Awards will be made soon
after approval of the project. DGPW has selected consultants BCEOM for car-
rying out the study on urban development.
1.06      The only other Bank Group lending to the transport sector of the
Ivory Coast was a 1954 railway Loan (100-FR) of US$7.5 million to the Office
Central des Chemins de Fer de la France d'Outre-Mer. This Loan helped finance
the acquisition of diesel locomotives for the Dakar (Senegal) - Bamako (Mali
and Abidjan-Ouagadougou (Upper Volta) railvays. The Loan has been fully
repaid.
1.07      The present project provides for:  (a) construction of a new road
between Yabayo and Gagnoa (79 km); (b) reconstruction of the N'Zl river
bridge located on the main north-south axis; (c) preparation of a feeder
road program in cotton-growing areas. As originally appraised, this project
was to have included construction of the new Abidian-Sikensi road (69 km)
following the recommendations of the Transport Survey and the detailed engi-
neering carried out by SETEC. However, during preparation of the present
report, the Ivorian Government informed the Association of its intention to
have this road financed, constructed, and operated as a toll road by a pri-
vate group. In accordance with the Government request, this project item
has been deleted. Total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.3 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$7.5 million proposed for IDA finan-
cing.
1.08      This report is based on the studies carried out by SETEC, and on
the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. C.R. Delapierre
(Engineer/Economist, PMWA) and E. Haker (Economist/Consultant) which visited
the country in January/February 1973.
2.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The Ivory Coast has a total land area of 322,000 km , and a 1971
population of 5.3 million which has grown at 3.5% p.a. over the past six
years. Immigrants from neighboring countries, attracted by job opportunities,
account for part of this high growth rate. Most of the country's population
is concentrated around Abidjan, the capital, and the Central Region. Twenty-
three percent of the population is urban, about half of which (600,000) lives
in Abidjan, the principal port and economic center of the country. The over-
all population is expected to grow at 3% p.a. and the urban sector at 10%
p.a. over the next five years.



- 3 -
2.02      The Ivory Coast h.d a per capita Cross Domestic Product (GDP) of
US$340 in 1970; it is surpassed by only a few countries on the African
continent in this respect. Agriculture accounts for 38% of GDP; two-thirds
of the agricultural production accounts for 82% of exports (cocoa, coffee,
and timber). Over the past ten years, GDP grew at a high rate of 7.5% p.a.
in real terns.  According to estimates prepared by the Bank Economic Mission
of March 1972, GDP growth is expected to slow down to about 5% p.a. over
1971-74, mostly due to a deterioration of terms of trade, and an inability
to further increase timber exports because of supply limitations. In order
to overcome this unfavorable situation, the Government's main investment
efforts for the coming years are being directed towards diversification in
agriculture and towards increasing industrial output; therefore, this rela-
tive slowdown in GDP growth is most likely to be temporary.
B.   The Transport System
General
2.03      The country's transport system is vell developed.  Its infra-
structure consists of more than 14,000 km of all-weather roads, about 640
km of railroads, two deep-water seaports, about 400 km of navigable lagoons
along the Atlantic coast, an international airport, and eight air-fields
served by regularly scheduled domestic flights. Road transport is the pre-
dominant mode withîn the country. The share of roads in inter-urban passen-
ger traffic [n terms of pass-km is about 75%, with the railway accounting
for most of the remainder; about 70% of inter-urban freight traffic in teris
of ton-km is carried by road, 25% by rail, and 5% by inland waterways.
Railways
2.04      The railway, the Regie du Chemin de Fer Abidjan-Niger (RAN) is
Jointly owned by the Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. It has a single-track
line extending 627 km from Abidjan to the Upper Volta border, and 518 km
from the border to Ouagadougou, the capital of Upper Volta. Passenger
traffic in 1971 amounted to 2.6 million, and during the 1960-70 period grew
at 3.7% p.a. in numbers, and at 8.3% in pass-km. Goods traffic remained
stable at 0.8 million tons, but increased 3% in ton-km. A recent study
carried out by OTAM forecast a growth of 6% for passenger traffic and 7%
for goods.
2.05      The railway is fully dieselized; locomotives and rolling stock are
renewed on a regular basis, mostly financed by the European Investment Bank,
the Caisse Autonome d'hmortissement, and the African Development Bank (ADB).
The technical characteristics of the line are not homogeneous due to its
having been built over a rather extended period (1904-54); a realignment
program is underway. The European Development Fund (FED) financed modern-
ization of the section between Agboville and Dimbokro; works are almost
completed. Completion of the realignment from Dimbokro to Tafire is now
envisaged during 1974-79, and RAN has submitted a project proposal to
various aid agencies, including the Bank. The Bank is reviewing the project.



- 4-
Ports and Waterways
2.06      The network of ports and inland waterways consists of two deep-
water ports, one in Abidjan and one in San Pedro opened to traffic in 1971,
and 400 km of waterways comprised of lagoons and canals along the coast.
Abidjan's principal installations consist of 15 general cargo berths, four
specialized berths, and facilities for handling bananas, timber, ore, and
oil. Total tonnages through the port grew at about 7% p.a. between 1964-71,
and amounted to 5.3 million tons, including 1.4 million tons of logs in 1971.
2.07      The port of San Pedro is situated about 300 km west of Abidjan.
At its present phase of development, San Pedro has two general cargo berths,
six mooting berths for loading logs, and a timber yard; traffic totalled
about 1.0 million tons in 1972, 97% of which was logs. By 1975, San Pedro
is expected to handle 1.5 million tons, consisting of 1.3 million tons of
logs and 0.2 million tons of general cargo. By comparison, Abidjan will be
handling 4.9 million tons in 1975, slightly lower than the 1971 volume of
traffie.
Air Transport
2.08      The network includes an international airport in Abidjan and 14
other airports capable of handling DC-3's; eight airports are regularly
served by Air Ivoire. International traffic at Abidjan airport reached
265,000 passengers and 9,800 tons in 1971; both types of traffic have grown
at about 12% p.a. since 1960.
C.  Transport Planning, Policy, and Coordination
Ceneral
2.09      The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) and the Ministry
of Planning are responsible for planning and coordination of public invest-
ments in the transport sector. However, the Ministry af Finance has the
power to change priorities that have been determined by the Minis try of
Planning. Transport regulation is the responsibility of MPWT advised by the
National Committee on Transport, a body composed of representatives of various
governmental departments and of the transport industry.
investment Planning at Sectoral Level
2.10      The SETEC Transport Survey was the fîrst attempt to give a rational
base to transport development in the country. On the basis of the recom-
mendations contained in Phase I (para. 1.02), the Covernment has proposed a
Five-Year Plan (FYP) for the period 1971-75, totalling CFAF 46 billion
(US$202 million equivalent) for the transport sector (Table 1). The FYP
foresees four principal areas of transport development:



- 5 -
(i)  construction of a deep-water port at San Pedro;
(ii) development of the road network leading to San Pedro;
(iiI) upgrading of the existing road network and the development
of feeder roads; and
(iv) modernization of the country's railway system.
The above four areas of development are sound.  The total investment for
highways is set at CFAF 25 billion (about US$110 million), representing
about 50% of all transport investments or 12% of total public investments;
of this, 80% is for main roads and the remaining 20% for feeder roads. How-
ever, as the Transport Survey did not cover feeder roads, it is not possible
to assesa whether or not this amount is appropriate. Under the present proj-
ect, the feeder road requirements ln the northern cotton-growing area, which
covers a substantial part of the country, will be investigated (para. 4.05).
2.11      Since Phase I of the Transport Survey vas completed in 1969, a
number of important developments have occurred which require its reassess-
ment:
(a)  highway traffic has increased over 50% more rapidly than
vas foreseen by SETEC;
(b)  log traffic at the port of San Pedro has grown faster than
foreseen; and
(c)  a substantial escalation occurred in highway construction
Costs.
The original plan has recently been revised vithin the context of a Three-
Year Investment Program for 1973-75. Investment outlays have been increased
by about 50%; some of the increases (roughly 15-20%) appear to be due to price
escalation. The principal project additions are:
(a) the cocoa highway circuit in the Central Province;
(b) substantial increases in railway rolling stock investments; and
(c) further investments in Abidjan port.
2.12      During negotiations, the Government agreed to take into account these
new developments in its re-assessment of priorities in the transport sector.
Such re-assessments are carried out on a yearly basis by the Ministry of
Planning, which is adequately staffed, with the assistance of HPWT. The
Government also agreed to discuss the findings of such re-assessments wîth
the Association.



-6-
Transport Coordination and Regulation
2.13      The various forms of transport in the Ivory Coast are complementary
rather than competitive. Origin and destination points that can be served
by both rail and road are few, and generate less than 10% of the traffic
presently carried by the railways.
2.14      The Directorate General of Transportation, within MWPT, is re-
sponsible for regulation of the road transport industry. It reviews annually
the industry's capacity to meet the requirements of transport demand and
allocates licenses accordingly. In addition to regulating the market entry,
the Government has recently introduced fixed rates and ranges of tariffs for
vehicles over 3.5 ton loading capacity, and for distances over 100 km. Dif-
ferent rates can be negotiated, however, for long-term and high-volume ship-
ping contracts.
2.15      The transport survey specifically recommended enforcement of trans-
port regulations, including price-fixing. The aim was to protect the small
truck operators who allegedly were in a weak bargaining position. In order
to support price-flxing regulations, freight offices vere to be established
which would have been the obligatory market places for commercial shipments.
One office was established in AbidJan, but its posted rates are being reviewed,
and compulsory use of the freight office ïs temnporarily suspended, due largely
to disagreements of users and shippers over existing tariff levels. In the
light of this development, the Government agreed to analyze the effects of
present transport regulations, and to give the Association an opportunity to
comment on proposed major changes of these regulations before they are imple-
mented.
2.16      The axle-load limit îs restricted to 10 tons; however, most imported
trucks have 13-ton permissible axle loads and are usually overloaded. The
Loan Agreement for the Second Highway Project stipulates that unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank, the present 10-ton axle load limit will be maintained
and enforced. The question of raising the existing legal limit to 13 tons
was examined by SETEC and it was concluded that, on economic grounds, the
change was not advisable. However, in the framework of the Conseil de
l'Entente, its member states (Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Dahomey, Togo, Niger)
are studying the question of instituting a legal axle load of 11 tons; this
modification is a result of the decision of the European Common Market countries
to use an 11-ton limit. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it
will seek the Association's concurrence to any change in axle-load limits.
2.17      Another area where changes might be advisable is road-user taxation.
The Transport Survey has tentatively concluded that heavy vehicles do not
pay enough even to offset theîr variable costs for road maintenance. In
order to clarify the related issues and to formulate a future policy on road-
user taxation, a study is being carried out with funds provided under the
Second Hlighway Project. Durîng negotiations, the Government has agreed to
implement the recommendations of the study after consultation with the
Association.

3. HIGHWAYS
A.  The Road Network
3.01      The classified road network (Table 2) consists of about 14,000 km
of all-weather roads of which 1,680 km are paved, and about 22,000 km of
unimproved tracks. Lumber companies and partly state-owned agricultural
development corporations have opened up an additional undetermined number
of tracks in forestry areas.
3.02      Although the highway network serves most parts of the country
adequately, development of the southwestern region and of the Port of San
Pedro require new roads linking them with each other and with the existing
road network. In addition, development and împrovement of feeder roads is
required to support the agricultural programs. The project will assist the
Government in meeting these needs.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.03      The Ivory Coast had 115,800 vehicles in 1971 (Table 3).  Statisties
provided by MPWT indicate that during the period 1965-71, the vehicle fleet
grew at a rate of 12.5% p.a. Passenger cars and truck-trailer combinations
accounted for most of the growth at 14% and 11.3% respectively. However,
these growth rates are somewhat overstated, since cars vithdrawn from circula-
tion are not immediately taken out of vehicle registration statistics. Since
1972, MPWT has taken systematic road traffic counts for a one-week period five
times a year.
3.04      According to forecasts prepared by SETEC in 1969, passenger trans-
port demand was expected to grow at about 5% p.a. between 1970-75, and cargo
transport demand at 3Z. The latter takes into account the fact that about
two-thirds of the log traffic will be diverted from Abidjan to San Pedro,
and therefore carried over a considerably shorter average distance. However,
these projections appear to have been conservative, and actual growth rates
have been about 50% more than forecast by SETEC for 1970-72. Fuel consumption
statistics (Table 4) indicate a growth rate of 6.3% between 1970-72, while
added value in the transport sector (an indicator which covers all modes)
grew at 8.5% p.a. between 1965-70. An average annual rate of 6-7% through
1977 may be considered as the best estimate for traffic growth.
C.   Administration
3.05      The Directorate-General of Public Works (DGPW> in MPWT is respon-
sible for construction and maintenance of the highway network, wÎth the
exception of roads in the immediate vicinity of the Kossou Dam and of the
port of San Pedro; these roads are under the jurisdiction of semi-autonomous
authorities controlled by the President's Office. DGPW headquarters at
Abidjan include central divisions for administration, accounting, and equip-
ment, as well as a division for new construction. Six regional divisions



-8-
are in charge of routine maintenance operations, and report directly to
DGPW. Under the Third Highway Project (para 1.05) the headquarters will
be reorganized to include divisions for planning and for highway mainte-
nance, and their staff supplemented by the assistance of experts provided
by a consulting firm.
3.06      DGPW employs more than 4,000 personnel, but faces serious staffing
shortages at the upper and middle echelons. The Director-General and most
of the Regional Directors are Ivorian, but DGPW relies heavily on foreîgn
personnel, mostly French, as engineers and technicians. The Government
--cognizes that its long-term staff needs can be met only through an exten-
sive education and training effort. Since 1961, MPWT has operated a school
in Abidjan to train civil engineers and technicians. The Ministry is enlarg-
ing its school facilities within the framework of the National Technical
Institute partly financed under Bank Loan 667-IVC (US$11 million, March 1970).
DGPW has been carrying out training programs for skilled personnel; mainten-
ance foremen are trained at Bouake, mechanics and equipment operators at the
central workshop in Abidjan, and workshop supervisors at a vocational train-
ing center in Lome (Togo). For the most part, these programs are adequate to
satisfy DCPW's future demand for skilled personnel.
D.   Financing and Planning
3.07      Total highway expenditures have averaged CFAF 4.5 billion (US$19.5
million) annually for the 1966-70 period (Table 5). Maintenance expenditures,
which average about CFAF 2.3 billion per year, are met by allocations from
the road fund financed by taxes on fuel and lubricants, and from the general
budget. New construction is financed by the investment budget, through con-
tractor financing, and by loans from the Bank (paras. 1.01 - 1.05), France,
Italy, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Mbre recently, the ADB and FED
have also contributed to the development of the network.
3.08      Road users contribute to Government revenues through annual vehi-
cle registration fees, through import duties and added value taxes on vehicles,
spare parts, fuel and lubricants, and through two particular taxes on fuel,
the "taxe speciale" and the "taxe specifique". Over the period 1966-70 re-
ceipts from the "taxe speciale" and "taxe specifique" alone (Table 6) amounted
to an average of CFAF 5.5 billion annually, which exceeds the average of total
road expenditures over the period (para. 3.07). It is doubtful whether truck
owners pay for the economic costs incurred in using the highway network. The
road user taxation study will assess the related issues and formulate future
policy (para. 2.17).
3.09      The planning mechanism described in Chapter 2 of this report also
applies to highways (para. 2.09). MPWT's planning function is weak, and many
past road investments were undertaken wîthout benefit of economic analysis.
As a first step in improving this situation, a planning unit is being es-
tablished in MPWT, supported by two planning experts provided for in the



- 9 -
Third Highway Project. During negotiations, the Government gave a3surances
that DGPW's planning functions vill be strengthened, and that It vill be pro-
vided vith staff and resources necessary to carry out these functions effec-
tively.
E.   Engineering and Construction
3.10      Engineering and supervision of major highway construction is
carried out by foreign consultants or by the semi-public firm, Bureau
National d'Etudes Techniques et de Developpement (BNETD) which was created
in 1964 to do engineering work for government agencies. Its activities
caver building design, urban planning and regional development and, to a
lesser extent, highway engineering.
3.11      Major construction works are carried out by contract.  Several
large foreign contractors have established branches locally. There is one
contractor with Ivorian majority ownership capable of undertaking major road
vorks, SONITRA (Societe Nationale Ivorienne de Travaux), which is owned
jointly by the Government and the Israeli contractor, Solel-Boneh. SONITRA
has recently completed construction of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road fi-
nanced under the First Highway Project, and is currently constructing the
BouakaB-Katiola road financed by the Second Highway Project; its performance
is adequate. In the recent past, the local construction industry has devel-
oped rapidly, and it is expected that in the coming years Ivorian contractors
who are now engaged in building construction and street improvement, will be-
gin to show interest In highway works.
3.12      With a view to training more Ivorian personnel in the management
and execution of construction works, the Government established a semi-
autonomous New Works Division in DGPW to carry out construction contracts
both for Government agencies and for the private sector. The Division will
undertake minor works that are not attractive to the existing contracting
industry; it will therefore fill a need, as well as permit training of local
staff and labor in construction activities, a prerequisite for further devel-
opment of a local contracting industry. In the same line, MPWT has assigned
engineers as counterparts to consultants and contractors under the Second
Highway Project.
F.   Maintenance
3.13      The DGPW divisions dîrectly involved in highway maintenance are the
regional divisions and the Equipment division. The firat are responsible for
the maintenance operations; the second, a semi-autonomous agency vîthin DGPW,
operates a pool of about 400 pieces of highway equipment and a central work-
shop in Abidjan. The equipment is rented to the regional divisions and other
government agencies as well as to the private sector. Rental rates cover
maintenance, repair, and renewal of the equipment.



- 10 -
3.14      A comprehensive study of the DPW maintenance organization has been
carried out by SETEC under Phase II of the Transport Survey. This study iden-
tified the main deficiences of this organization as (i) lack of proper pro-
granining and control from headquarters, and (ii) shortage of funds to keep pace
with the maintenance requirements. The Third Highway Project (para. 1.05)
is aimed at correcting part of these deficiencies through:
-    technical assistance to DGPW
-    creation of a Maintenance and
Betterment division wîthin DGPW
-    purchase of highway maintenance equipment
-    construction of local repair facilities under jurisdiction
of the Equipment Division
-    training of DGPW personnel.
Under the Loan Agreement for the Third Highway Project (June 1972) and during
negotiation of the present project, the Government has given assurances that
it will increase its highway maintenance allocations.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(a) construction of the new road Yabayo - Gagnoa (79 km);
(b) reconstruction of the N'Zi river bridge; and
(c) a feeder road study in cotton-growing areas.
Construction of the Yabayo-Gagnoa Road (79 km)
4.02      The proposed road constitutes a segment in the link between
Abidjan and San Pedro. The Abidjan-Gagnoa section is already paved, and
paving of the Yabayo-San Pedro road will start soon with FED financing as
part of the San Pedro development project. At present, traffic between San
Pedro and Gagnoa or Abidjan must travel 245 km of gravel roads via Sassandra.
4.03      Under the project, a new two-lane paved road will be constructed
between Yabayo and the junction of the Issia-Gagnoa-Sassandra roads, and the
pavement on the 7 km between the junction and Gagnoa will be resurfaced.
The pavement will be 6 m wide upon a roadway of 11 m. A design speed cf
80 km/h has been adopted, and is consistent with traffic requirements
(Table 7).



- il -
Reconstruction of the N'Zi Bridge
4.04      The N'Zi bridge is located about 20 km north of N'Douci on the
main trunk road to the north. The present bridge is a one-lane cased girder
structure built in 1934.  It is composed of 13 spans totalling about 180 m.
Due to structural failure, the existing slabs have been temporarily rein-
forced with I-beams covered with planking. The allowed load is limited to
one truck at a time which must cross the bridge at low speed. As the bridge
is unsafe and cannot be repaired economically, and as heavy traffic cannot
be easily diverted, it is proposed that under the project a 179 m long,
6-span two-lane bridge and approaches (2,600 m) be constructed near the ex-
isting one.
Preparation of a Feeder Road Program
4.05      A cotton development program in the northern part of the country
now under consideration for Bank Group financing has raised the question of
the adequacy of the feeder road network serving the area. The project makes
provisions for a survey to establish priorities for improvement and exten-
sion of this network; the survey should begin as soon as possible so that it
can proceed concurrently vith the ongoing feasibility study on cotton develop-
ment. During negotiations, the Government has agreed to coordinate the pre-
paration of the road program with the ongoing feasibility study on cotton
development and with other agricultural development programe affecting the
hinterland of feeder roads. The survey is estimated to involve a total of
10 man-months of consulting services (Annex 1).
B.   Execution
4.06      DGPW will be responsible for execution of the project.  Specifica-
tions and bidding documents for construction works have been prepared by
DGPW with the assistance of consultants SETEC. Consultants acceptable to
the Association will supervise the construction.
4.07      Construction of the Yabayo-Gagnoa road will be carried out under
unit price contract awarded on the basls of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. In order to stîmulate competition
between contractors of different capacity, the Goverament has agreed at nego-
tiations to consider dividing the work into two contracts, and bîds vill be
called simultaneously. Construction is expected to begin early in 1974 and
to be completed in 1-1/2 years. Bide for construction of the N'Zi bridge have
already been received, and the contract wlll be awarded after consultation
wîth the Association. The feeder road survey vlll be carried out by consult-
ants to be appointed by the Government and acceptable to the Association. The
survey will be completed vithin five months according to terms of reference
outlined in Annex 1.
4.08      Design standards are consistent with the country's strategy to
develop an efficient highway infrastructure meeting the requirements of
modern motor vehicle transport. Although part of the works will require



- 12 -
the use of heavy equipment, there remains ample room for the use of labor.
Contractors will be free to rely on the market mechanism to choose the relative
amounts of equipment and labor used. As a large percentage of manpower comes
from neighboring countries (para 2.01), and as there is a 33.3% tax on highway
equipment and fuel, market prices closely reflectkeconomic costs. Relying on
the market mechanism is thus expected to produce efficient allocations between
equipment and labor. The project is expected to create direct employment for
about 600-700 laborers during its implementation.
C.   Cost Estimates
4.09      The estimated cost of the project as of the expected date of
receipt of bids is as follows:

4.19      The cost estimates for construction of the Yabayo-Gagnoa road are
based on detailed engineering carried out by consultants SETEC (France) in
1972. Estimates for reconstruction of the N'Zi Bridge are based on results
of international competitive bidding carried out in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Detailed engineering and bidding documents were prepared by
consultants SETEC.  Contractors were called at the same time to bid for
reconstruction of the Boubo Bridge financed under the Third Highway Prôject.
The costs of consulting services for construction supervision and for pre-
paration of the feeder road program are based on previous Bank experience in



- 13 -
Ivory Coast and in Western Africa generally. Taxes and duties represent about
25% of estimated construction costs, and account for about 60% of the local
component. The total project cost estimate includes contingency allowances
on the construction items of about 10% to allow for possible increases in
physical quantities. About 6% has been added for price variations to cover
price increases resulting from application of contractual escalation clauses
in construction works and consulting services during the period of implemen-
tation.
D.   Financing and Disbursements
4.11      The Association will finance the foreign exchange costs estimated
at US$7.5 million; this represente 60% of total project costs or 80% of coste
excluding taxes. During negotiations, the Government has confirmed that it
will meet all local costs, estimated at US$4.8 million. No difficulties are
foreseen concerning local cost financing; the Government has met its finan-
cial obligations under the First and the Second Righvay Projects.
4.12      Funds from the Credit account will be disbursed on the following
basis:
(a)  60% of total expenditures for construction contracts,
representing the foreign component.
(b)  the foreign cost of consulting services for construction
supervision and for preparation of the feeder road program,
estimated at 80% of total costs.
The estimated schedule of disbursement is shown in Table 8.
E.   Project Monitoring
4.13      Including the present project, the Bank Group would have financed
four highway projects in the Ivory Coast over the past five years. It is
desirable at this time that some critical elements in these projects be
monitored so that an evaluation of their impact and effectiveness can be
made. As the Government has agreed during negotiations, the principal ele-
ments -to be monitored will be: (a) analysis of actual construction costs
and reasons for cost increases and delays in construction; (b)   traffic
structure and growth; (c) changes in trucking rates and associated cost
savings; (d) behavior of pavements recently built or strengthened; and (e)
impact on rural development.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The purpose of the proposed project is to ensure that economic growth
in the Ivory Coast is based on reliable and efficient transport links in the
country's primary road network. The project supports one principal objectives
of the national transport lnvestment plan, development of the road network
connected with San Pedro, with a view to assisting economic development in the
western and north-western regions. The overall economic return for the proj-
ect îs about 14%. Detailed information on the economlc analysis is presented
in Annex 2; the following paragraphs summarize the most salient aspects.
B.   Yabayo-Gagnoa Road
5.02      The port of San Pedro was opened to traffic in May 1971, and during
its first year of full operation, handled 982,000 tons of traffic, 97% of
which was timber. A large upsurge of traffic (30-60% p.a.) was registered
during 1971-72 on roads leading to the port. This increase is not confined
to truck and trailer combinations which carry the timber traffic diverted
from Abidjan, but includes general cargo trucks and passenger traffie.
5.03      The main trunk road connecting San Pedro with its hinterland in the
north is a gravel road which will soon be paved; pavement completion will
substantially reduce land transportation costs for timber exports. However,
the port is still not adequately linked with the country's national highway
network; the present connection is circuitous and of low standard. The pro-
posed project will close this gap, by building an adequate link to the central
regions and by helping to provide an all-paved connection between Abidjan and
San Pedro. Transport demand for the project road is expected to build up at
a high rate over the coming years, since development of the hinterland in
response to the port has only begun.
5.04      The proposed new road is expected to reduce transportation costs
between San Pedro and Gagnoa by 30%, and to generate substantial amounts of
new traffic.  Traffîc in the opening year (1977) is estimated to be about
230 vpd, and an additional 70 vpd is expected to be generated over a subse-
quent three-year period. These traffic figures are substantially less than
those that would have prevailed had an eastward shift of the alignment of the
San Pedro-Man road not occurred (see para. 1.04 and Map). However, even with
this much lower traffic estimate, a best estimate economic return of 15% has
been arrived at for the project, 10% on a lowest estimate basis, and a first
year benefit to investment ratio of 11.2%. The combination of assumptions
leading to the lowest estimate has a low probability. Considerable areas
will be opened up by the new road in line with the Government's strategy for
developing the western region.



- 15 -
C.   The N'Zi Bridge
5.05      This is a one-lane bridge located on the main north-south axis;
it carried 1,000 vpd in 1970, and traffic is expected to reach about 1,300
vpd by 1974. Average speeds on the bridge do not exceed 45 km/h compared
with an average of 75 km/h on the highway. The present bridge is not ade-
quate for current traffic flows, and there is a substantial risk of its
collapse within the next five to ten years, unless substantial amounts are
expended for repairing and strengthening the existing structure.
5.06      The economic analysis for reconstructing the bridge is based on
comparing the following two alternatives:
(i)  constructing a new two-lane bridge in 1974; or
(ii)  repairing and strengthening the existing bridge at frequent
intervals, and reconstructing a new bridge in ten years
(which is the expected technical life of the existing
structure).
Construction of a two-lane bridge in 1974 instead of in ten years would yield
the following benefits:
(i)  avoidance of heavy repair and strengthening costs;
(ii)  elimination of waiting time on the one-lane bridge for
present and projected traffic;
(iii)  acceleration of actual crossing;
(iv)  elimination of deceleration and acceleration costs;
(v)  elimination of traffic control costs; and
(vi)  reduced accidents.
5.07      On this basis, the immediate construction of a new bridge is ex-
pected to yield an economic return of 14% and a first year return of about
9.1%, and is therefore the most economic alternative (Details are given in
Annex 2).
6.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During Credit negotiations, the following principal items were dis-
cussed and agreed:



- 16 -
(i)  reassessment by the Government of priorities in the trans-
port sector, the findings of which vill be discussed between
the Association and the Government (para. 2.12);
(ii)  analysis by the Government of the affects of present trans-
port regulations, and possibility for the Association to
comment on any proposed major changes in these regulations
(para. 2.15);
(iii)  coordination of the feeder road study with that of cotton
development (para. 4.05).
6.02      The project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$7.5 million to the
Government of Ivory Coast.

ANNEX 1
IVORY COAST
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Preparation of a Feeder Road Program
1.        A cotton production expansion program, likely to be undertaken
with Bank assistance, is under preparation in Ivory Coast. The feeder road
network related to this program is in poor condition, and makes transporting
cotton-seed difficult and expensive. Of a total of 7,650 km (CFDT 1/ report)
needing improvement, about 4,000 km are under the jurisdiction of the Public
Works Department; the ongoing Third Highway Project (Loan 837-IVC) which in-
cludes betterment works on the more important earth and gravel roads of the
national highway system, does not cover that feeder road network. The remain-
ing 3,650 km under the responsibility of village communities are inadequately
maintained. Because of the very large area concerned, the improvement of
these rural roads is a national problem which deserves special attention.
2.        Development of the rural areas is hampered by the poor condition
of the feeder road network. To permit an efficient distribution of supplies
and collection of products, among which cotton is the most important, rural
tracks have to be brought up to adequate standards. To define a comprehen-
sive program of feeder road development, it is therefore necessary to con-
sider the whole volume of traffic involved on these rural roads - whether
it originates from a cotton scheme, from other agricultural development
programs, or from passenger traffic.
3.        The proposed Fourth Highway Project will provide funds to prepare
the road development program. Such a study would require an engineer and a
transport economist for about five months each, including report-writing.
It would cost roughly US$60,000. The team would review traffic projections
on the whole network, determine which sections carry enough tonnage to
justify upgrading, and estimate their costs and benefits. Traffic projec-
tions will take into account construction of two new ginneries and of the
Bouake oilmill, and expected output increases. The study would indicate how
proposed improvements and maintenance should be carried out, for example by
contract or by creating a special unit under CFDT authority. For sections
with low tonnage, it would review the problems involved and make proposals
for inexpensive methods of temporarily overcoming communication problems
and for lowering transportation costs as far as possible.
