 road program in cotton-growing areas.

However, during preparation of the\n            present report, the Ivorian Government informed the\n            association of its intention to have this road financed,\n            constructed, and operated as a toll road by a private group."}, "docdt": "1973-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
