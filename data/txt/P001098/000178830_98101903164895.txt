REPORT AND RECOE20TDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
1.   I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$11.0 million
to the Republic of the Ivory Coast, to assist in financing an
education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.   Following a Bank/UNZSC0/FAO reconnaissance mission in January
1967 and a Bank/UNESCO identification mission in May 1968, the Govern-
ment of the Ivory Coast asked the Bank for assistance in financing an
Education Project, which was appraised in February/March 1969. The
project was modified during appraisal to (a) accord better with estimated
manpower needs, (b) take account of revised estimates of primary
education enrollments, (c) introduce improved curricula in general
secondary education, and (d) achieve a better utilization of teachers
and classroom space.
3.   Negotiations were held from September 30 to October 7, 1969.   The
Government delegation was led by Mr. Andre Hovine, Director of the
Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (Autonomous Amortization Fund).
4.   This would be the Bankts third lending operation in the Ivory
Coast. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to the Ivory
Coast as at February 28, 1970:

The US$è.8 million road loan was made in September 1968 for a road
construction project wlhich included financing for two road feasibility
studies. The start of the project has been very lc-te, due to delays
by Government in approving contracts for the construction and the
studies. The project is now one year behind schedule. However, the
necessary action was taken-in December 1969 and the project is expected
to progress satisfactorily.  The three loans totalling US$17.1 million
for an oil palm and coconut development project were made effective
on December 31, 1969. In 1965, IFC took a participation equivalent
to US$204,000 in the capital of the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement
Industriel, Abidjan.
5.   Bankc projects in an advanced stage of preparation include a cocoa
rehabilitation and planting project. Feasibility studies being con-
ducted under the existing road loan are expected to lead to suhrission of
a second road project to the Executive Directors during rfx 1971.
PArLT II - DESC-LIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOA-N
6.   Borrower:       Republic of the Ivory Coast.
Purpose:        to assist in financing the construction and
equipment of 11 schools; construction of a pro-
duction center and of a central ITV maintenance
center; consultant services for design of school
buildings and supervision of construction; manage-
ment consultant services for ITV; specialist
services; fellowlships abroad; and a project
implementation unit.
Amount:         a loan in various currencies equivalent to
US$11.0 million.
Amortization:   in 30 years, including a 10-year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments beginning
December 15, 1979 and ending December 15, 1999.
Interest rate:  7% per annum.
Comnitment
charge:     3/4 of 1% .er annun.
P12T III - THE PROJECT
7.   An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project
in the Ivory Coast" (PE-7a), dated November 14, 1969, is attached.
8.   The proposed project would be a part of the 1971-75 educational
development program of the Ivory Coast. This program aims at developing
and improving human resources to meet more effectively the additional
manpower requirements of the economy and to help reduce the present
heavy reliance on expatriates. These objectives would be achieved



-3-
through improvement of the efficiency of the education system at all
levels, which is a prerequisite for e:pansion of the education system
if undue financial strains are to be avoided after 1975. During 1969-74,
which is the implementation period of the project, the total capital
cost of the program would be about US$60 million. Total cost of the
project is estiraated at US119.1 million equivalent, or about 30 per
cent of this program.
9- The project consists of:
(a) construction and equipment of 11 schools with an enrollment
capacity of 6500 plaecs of which 6050 would be new, as follows:
- 3 primary teacher training colleges
- 3 general secondary schools
- 2 secondary technical schools
- 1 vocational school for adult accelerated training
- 2 post-secondary technical schools, one for agriculture
and one for industry and commerce;
(b) consultant services for design of school buildings and
supervision of construction;
(c) technical assistance for a study to improve utilization
of existing and future secondary schools and to introduce
modern curricula;
(d) provision of about 29 man-years of fellowships;
(e) construction and furnishing of an Instructional Television
(ITV) production center and of a central maintenance building;
(f) management and evaluation consultant services for ITV.
10.  The ITV component of the proposed project constitutes the initial
stage of a larger scheme to be implemented over a period of 10 years
or more. This scheme aims at improving primary education and teacher
training throughout the country by providing (a) direct instruction
to primary pupils of 4 periods of 15 minutes each per day, (b) daily
tele-lessons to teachers. The total cost of the ITV component is
about US$1.4 million, of which the proposed loan would cover the
foreign exchange requirement of about US$800,000. Several bilateral
and multilateral aid agencies,including FAC (Fonds dtAide et de
Cooperation - France), UIDP, UNESCO and UNICEF, have provided or are
expected to provide financial and/or technical assistance equivalent
to about US$5.7 million for other parts of the ITV scheme.
11.  Although the Bank has already financed education projects which
included facilities for primary teacher training, this would be the
Bank's first direct involvement in the field of primary education.
Primary education in Ivory Coast is in urgent need of improvement.
After 6 years, the pupils have usually acquired few basic skills and
little understanding of simple concepts. If account is taken of re-



- 4 -
peaters and drop-outs, it takes about 16.5 pupil-years to produce one
primary school leaver.
12.   The Ivory Coast ITV scheme represents an international effort,
with strong backing by UNESC0, to seek new ways of improving the
efficiency of primary education. Its concept and implementation are
based on experience in several countries,especially Niger where a FAC-
financed pilot project has been underway for the last 4 years. The
Ivory Coast scheme would, however, be staged on a country-wide basis.
During the initial years, the ITV system would be continuously evaluated
by experts, some of whom would be provided under the proposed loan.
The rate at which ITV coverage would be expanded would depend upon
their assessment of the effectiveness of the program as it develops.
Consequently, the number of primary school pupils who would be provided
with instructional television at the end of the first ten-year period
might vary from 125,000 to 700,000.
13.   To ensure efficient execution of the proposed project, a Project
Implementation Unit would be established in the Ministry of Education.
The Director of this Unit and the Project Architect have been appointed
by the Government and are acceptable to the Bank. The Director of
the Unit will have the services of consultant-architects and management-
consultants, both acceptable to the Bank, to supervise construction
and to assist the manager of the ITV scheme.
14.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.8 million.
The proposed loan of US$11.0 million equivalent, would cover the
estimated foreign exchange component of the project and interest and
other charges during construction. In view of the devaluation in
August 1969 of the French and CFA francs, the cost of the project may
be slightly less, but it is not possible to estimate the effects of
the devaluation with any accuracy until its impact on the price level
becomes apparent. The result of the devaluation will be for the
percentage foreign exchange component to rise slightly and for the total
cost in dollars to be reduced, but in view of the uncertain and
relatively minor nature of the changes that would be involved, I propose
that the project should be financed on the basis of the pre-devaluation
cost estimate.
15.   Contracts for civil works and equipment and furniture supplies
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding;
bids would be grouped so as to encourage such competition. It is like-
ly that the local construction industry, which is almost entirely
foreign-based, would win most of the civil works contracts. For the
evaluation of bids on furniture, the preferential margin on the c.i.f.
landed cost of competing imports allowed to the local furniture
manufacturers would be limited to 15%.
16.   Disbursements for civil works, for locally manufactured furniture
and professional services would be on the basis of agreed percentages
representing the estimated foreign exchange component. Disbursements
for imported equipment and furniture would cover the actual c.i.f. landed



costs. Any savings made on the loan, when the project is completed,
would be cancelled or used to finance minor extensions to the project,
subject to the agreement of the Bank. INo retroactive financing is
contemplated.
PART IV - IEGAL fIJSTRUIENTS ANID AUTHORITY
17. The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article II,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
18. The draft Loan Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of
agreements for education projects, with the exception of Section 2.03 (b)
which is designed to ensure that no withdrawals are made from the Loan
Account for the cost of the ITV s heme, until the Bank has received
satisfactory assurances
(i) that the additional financing and technical assistance
necessary for implementation of the ITV scheme have been
obtained on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank;
and
(ii)  that suitable arrangements have been made to ensure that the
ITV scheme obtains the required national television network
time.
PART V - THE ECONOf0
19. A ilemorandum on the Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory
Coast, dated July 3, 1968 (AF-76a) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on July 15, 1968. The preliminary findings of the economic
mission which visited the Ivory Coast in November-December 1969 con-
firm the excellent growth performance of the economy. Over the three
years 1966-68, GDP increased by 33 per cent at current prices including
a record 16 per cent in 1968. As price increases have been moderate,
the annual average rate of growth in real terms over the period may
be estimated at over 7 per cent, in line withl the trend observed since
independence (1960).
20. Exports - of which coffee, cocoa and timber still form 80 per cent -
have remained the main moving force in the economy. Thus in 1968
they increased by a record 30 per cent as a result of increased supply
and favorable demand conditions for the three main products. The
trade surplus which had fluctuated slightly around CFAF 10 billion per
year since 1960 exceeded CFAF 25 billion, and the balance on goods
and services, which had showm a very small surplus up to 1964 and a
growing deficit in the following years, became positive by CFAF 9 billion
($36.5 million) in 1968. The balance of payments position has remained
strong despite the growing outflow of factor payments and private transfers



-6-
whose n.t ccrnbinod arount reached about CFAF 18.7 billion in 1968, or
twice the volume of 1963. The Ivory Coast now holds over half the total
net foreign assets of the seven-memnber. W;est African Monetary Union, re-
presenting three months of imports.
21. On the basis of its past capabilities, the economic prospects of
the Ivory Coast can be viewed with optimism.  However, prospects for
the main export commodities, notably cof-fee, cocoa and timber point
to slower grothrl.  Eportable timber of the best qualities is becoming
less abundant; world coffee demand is groawing slowly.  Maintenance of
a high rate of economic development will consequently depend to a
large extent upon further diversification of agriculture and the develop-
ment of non-agricultural sectors.   In part this will result from recent
and conternlated investments in the production of palm oil, copra,
bananas, pineapple, rubber and cotton, and the continued success in
raising production of "superior" foodstuffs, notably rice and fish.
Industry and construction still account for only 20 per cent of GDP
but they have shown the fastest growrth. Gross sales by industrial firms
have increased fivefold between 1960 and 1968.
22.  The rapid expansion of the economy has been accompanied by rising
public investment.  The latter has risen more rapidly than public
savings, despite a continued increase in government revenues. Thus,
the share of public investment financed by puublic savings has declined
from over 70 per cent over the years 1960-66 to an estimated 52 per
cent in the following period, including the budget forecast for the
current year (1970). Current budget surpluses have been adversely
affected by a rise of 63 per cent in current expenditures since 1965.
Iluch of this is accounted for by a 77 per cent increase in current
outlays on public hea Lh ahtI education.  Such expenditures are linked
to the needs of a young and rapidly growing population and to the desire
of the CGovernment to hasten "Ivorization" ir all sectors of the economr.
To some extent the insufficient growth in budget savings has been
offset by rising surpluses of the agricultural price stabilization fund
and larger profits of public enterprises.
23. Under these circumstances the Government has increasingly resorted
to foreign borrowing. At the end of 1968 total foreign public debt
amounted to $341 million - nearly 75 per cent higher than two years
earlier. The bulk zf theincrease took place in 1968, mainly as a
result of borrowing about US$100 million for the two largest projects
ever undertaken in the country and currently under constracTion, the
Kossou (Bandama) dam and the port and associated development of the
San Pedro area in the SouthWdest.  New external borrowing in 1969,
however,was only US$17 million. Provided the Government refrains from
contracting debts which would entail significant repayments in the
early seventies, debt service will remain within reasonable limits.
It has been quite low in the past, not exceeding 5-6 per cent of ex-
ports of goods and services, and Tith the proviso indicated above, would
remain below 10 per cent in 1972 wyhen repayments on existing debt reach
a peak, even assuming a growth of exports markedly lower than in the
past.



24. The possible repercussions of the August 1969 devaluation of
the CFA franc by 11.1 per cent, in line with the devaluation of the
French franc, cannot yet be estimated with accuracy. In view of the
past performance of the agricultural export sector, it seems likely
that agricultural exports to countries outside the franc zone would
be boosted by the devaluation. Production may also be stimulated by
some increases in producers' prices which have been made possible by
devaluation. There rnay also be a slight deceleration in the growth
of imports as the result of higher prices and some increased ability
of local industries to meet import competition despite their high
degree of dependence on imported components. On the whole, the
balance of payments and general economic growth should benefit some-
what from the devaluation. In addition, devaluation has already
enabled the Government to raise some export taxes wkhich will,
together with higher yields from import taxes, result in higher budget
revenue in 1970.
25.   A major problem for the next few years will be to carry out the
large Kossou and San Pedro projects together with other development
programs, without creating undue strain on financial and managerial
resources. Other important programs are those connected with the
rehabilitation and expansion of cocoa plantations, reforestation,
agricultural diversification, some improvement if the road network,
the development of urban infrastructure in the face of the rapid
growth of population in the cities and the implementation of the
education program. Aw-areness of this problem has already led the
Government to undertake a thorough revision of the draft plan for
1971-75. In the light of the conclusions of the forthcoming
economic report, we intend to discuss this plan with the Government
with a view to assessing its feasibility and determine the volume,
pattern and conditions of the Bank Group contribution for the next
five years. Meanw^lhile, during discussions in the Ivory Coast, the
economic mission has stressed the necessity for the Government to
limit the growth of general current expenditure below that of revenues
and to refrain from further short-term borrowing of any significant
size for the financing of capital projects. These are the two most
important elenents for preserving- the countrV's creditworthiness.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
