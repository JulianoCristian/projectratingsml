It is too early\n            at this stage to attempt a full evaluation of project\n            outcomes as the various institutions have been in operation\n            for too short a time and a later review of these outcomes is\n            needed. Even so, a few lessons can be learned from the\n            project at this time. First, severe problems in project\n            implementation arose because the views of user ministries\n            were insufficiently taken into account during project\n            generation and appraisal. Second, the Borrower's\n            reluctance to adapt to the Bank's accommodation\n            standards has resulted in school enrollment targets not\n            being reached. Third, closer coordination between RMWA and\n            Bank headquarters was needed in the supervision of the\n            project. Fourth, a cheap source of power for television\n            receivers is needed for the establishment of an economical\n            ETV system. Finally, changes in curricula are difficult to\n            effect and need close attention by Bank missions."}, "docdt": "1980-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
