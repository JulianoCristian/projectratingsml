The project has two noteworthy features.\n            The first time the Bank will be directly involved in the\n            field of primary education and also, for the first time, the\n            Bank will participate in the financing of instructional\n            television. The Ivory Coast provides particularly justified\n            grounds for these innovations. The reason is that the\n            country has achieved remarkable economic performance since\n            independence in 1960. Primary education has continued to\n            prepare primary school leavers exclusively for secondary\n            school entrance and for white collar jobs. In so doing it\n            has failed to respond to the real needs of the economy. The\n            Government is aware of these shortcomings and has drawn up a\n            long-term educational program based on a new policy. The\n            main objectives of this policy are to improve the efficiency\n            of the system and to expand the output of technical,\n            vocational, agricultural education; and at the secondary and\n            post-secondary levels."}, "docdt": "1970-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
