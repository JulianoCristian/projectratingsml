PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
IVORY COAST - FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 667-IVC)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit of the First Education Project in
the Ivory Coast for which a loan of US$11.0 million was approved in March
1970 and a supplementary loan of US$2.2 million in January 1975.  The total
loan of US$13.2 million had been disbursed by September 6, 1977.
A two-member Operations Evaluation Mission visited the Ivory Coast
from January 14-28, 1979 and held discussions on the experience of this
project with officials of the Ministries of Education, Primary and Television
Education, and Technical Education, and officials of the Higher National
Technical Education Institute and the Radio-Television Authority. The mission
also visited Paris for discussions on the project with representatives of the
French Ministry of Cooperation.  The cooperation extended by these officials
is gratefully acknowledged.   The audit memorandum is based on these discus-
sions as well as a review of the Appraisal Report No. PE-7a dated November 14,
1969; the President's Report of March 12, 1970; the record of the Board dis-
cussion of March 24, 1970; the Loan Agreement dated April 27, 1970; the
Agreement Amending the Loan Agreement dated January 17, 1975; the Project
Completion Report (PCR) dated May 31, 1978 and revised August 10, 1979 pre-
oared by the Western Africa Regional Office; material in the Bank's files in
,vpshington and Abidjan relating to this project and to the Second Education
Project; and on discussions held with Bank staff and consultants currently and
formerly associated with the project.
In accordance with normal OED practice the draft audit report (in
a French translation) was sent to the Borrower for comment. An English
translation of comments received from the Borrower is reproduced on page 18.
These comments have been taken into account in this final version of the
report.
The PCR generally gives a balanced account of project experience
although the audit memorandum expresses a contrary view in several places.
The audit memorandum provides supplementary information especially on the
Educational Television Scheme, and also examines project generation, design
and supervision more critically than the PCR.  Lessons are drawn from expe-
rience with this project which may have relevance to future Bank operations.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
IVORY COAST - FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 667-IVC)
1HIGHLIGHTS
A Loan Agreement in the sum of US$11.0 million was signed in respect
of this project on April 27, 1970, and a supplementary loan of US$2.2 million
was approved in January 1975 to take account of currency realignments.  The
project represented the first Bank involvement in financing educational tele-
vision, and also assisted the Borrower in primary teacher training, secon-
dary general and technical education, vocational training, a -Y post-secondary
agricultural and technical education.  At the time of approvel of the supple-
mentary loan agreement in 1975 the project was experiencing cost overruns
and a general secondary school was deleted from it.  The project as revised
has been physically completed and the total loan of US$13.2 million was fully
disbursed by September 6, 1977.
The experience with the project has been mixed, and in several
respects it is too early to come to final conclusions about the success of
some of the project items.   One of its main aims - the reduction of unit
costs by the more efficient utilization of resources - has not been fully
achieved (PPAM, paras. 32 and 33; PCR, paras. 3.09, 3.16), although improve-
ments are expected by the Borrower.  The technical and vocational schools and
the general secondary schools are being used as originally envisaged and are
the most successful part of the project.   The agricultural school is being
used for training technologists - rather than technicians as originally
envisaged - a situation which needs to be reviewed in about five years'
time (PPAM, para. 33).   Both the Borrower and the Regional Office consider
that the institution is responding to the country's present needs.   One of
the three primary teacher training institutions provided under the project is
being used for primary teacher training; the other two, in the educational
television complex at Bouake, are being used to give refresher courses to
inspectors, regional advisors, training college teachers and specialists in
educational technology.  The premises are underutilized (PCR, para. 3.38) and
this situation also needs to be reviewed over the longer term.  In this case
also the Borrower and the Regional Office consider the present usage to be
justified (PPAM, para. 35).   The educational television project element has
had only limited success.  The broadcast programs are of shorter duration and
of lower quality than originally expected: the physical ETV facilities,
completed only after programs for all primary classes had already been made
in makeshift premises, are presently underutilized, being used only to remake
existing programs (PPAM, para. 23; PCR, para. 3.24).
The physical implementation of the project was satisfactory,
although there was a cost overrun of over 70% (actual costs US$33 million
against appraisal estimates of US$19 million) and the project took more than
twice as long to implement as had been expected.






- vii -
The project experience holds several lessons for the Bank.  Severe
problems in project implementation arose because the views of user Ministries
were insufficiently taken into account during project generation and appraisal
(PPAM, paras. 10-11). The Borrower's reluctance to adapt to the Bank's
accommodation standards has resulted in school enrollment targets not being
reached  (PPAM,  para. 12).   Closer coordination between RMWA and the Bank
headquarters was needed in the supervision of the project and the supervision
effort lacked continuity (PPAM, paras. 19-20).   The project has indicated
that a cheap source of power for television receivers is needed for the
establishment of an economical ETV system (PPAM, para. 28).  As in several
education projects the experience has highlighted the difficulties of effec-
ting changes in curricula and the need in such cases for close attention
by Bank Staff (PPAM, para. 37).
Other points of special interest are the following:
(i)   difficulties in program coordination were caused by the location of
a national educational television center in a town far away from the
Ministry of Education (PPAM, para. 14);
(ii)   the effects on the secondary education system of increasing the
throughput of the primary education system were insufficiently taken
into account during project generation (PPAM, para. 15); and
(iii)   the success of the project in piloting new approaches to technical
education in the Ivory Coast (PCR, paras. 3.02-3.10).






PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
IVORY COAST - FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 667-IVC)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
1.        A Bank/UNESCO/FAO reconnaissance mission visited  the Ivory Coast
by invitation of the Government in early 1967.   It proposed assistance for
agricultural, general secondary, and technical education as well as vocational
and primary teacher training.   Action on the mission's proposals was held
up because the Government was then undertaking a substantial review of its
educational system.   Another reconnaissance mission went to the Ivory Coast
in May 1968; it substantially corroborated the findings of the previous mis-
sion and mentioned the possibilities of aid for educational television (ETV).
In October/November 1968, the Government, assisted by a UNESCO mission,
prepared a project request which was received in the Bank in January 1969.
The next month a Bank/FAO mission began appraisal of the project.  There was
considerable discussion in the Bank following the return of the appraisal team
as to whether the Bank should finance the ETV Center, and if so, whether the
Center should be located in Abidjan, as the Bank thought, or in Bouake, which
the Government strongly preferred.   Educational  television was new to the
Bank's educational lending.   The highest levels of the Government and UNESCO
sought a positive response from the Bank, and after extensive discussion the
Bank agreed to finance an ETV Center at Bouake as a part of the project.
2.        The project as described in the April 1970 Loan Agreement comprised:
(a) the construction, furnishing and equipment of the following institutions,

(b) 20 man-years technical assistance for the ETV Scheme and 29 man-years
of fellowships abroad for training Ivorians as technical teachers and
school administrators;
(c) establishment of a Project Unit;
(d) construction and furnishing of an ETV Center and a Central Maintenance
Center.  The ETV Center was to be part of a complex which would include
the Senior Primary Teacher Training College and one of the Primary
Teacher Training Centers mentioned above.  Equipment for the ETV Center
and the Central Maintenance Center was to be provided by the Government
of France.  The ETV Center represented only a small part of the project
in terms of Bank financing, amounting only to 7% in terms of capital
costs estimated at appraisal and to about 12% of actual Bank-financed
capital costs.
3.        In the Loan Agreement and in a supplementary letter to the Loan
Agreement, the Government confirmed that, in order to meet its objectives
of increasing the quality and efficiency of its educational system, it
intended, in relation to curricula and the training of teachers, to:
(a) review first cycle secondary curricula and introduce modern curricula,
beginning with the project general secondary schools;
(b) increase the output of first cycle secondary teachers to at least 110
from 1973 onwards so as to allow transfer of the more expensive expa-
triate teachers to the second cycle of secondary education;
(c) provide qualified staff for all the project schools;
(d) appoint two supervisors, one for building courses and one for com-
mercial courses, to ensure improvement in the teaching of practical
and of technical subjects.   In addition,  two supervisors provided
under the Loan for the teaching of (i) sciences and (ii) mechanics,
electricity and industrial arts would advise all secondary general
and technical schools on the teaching of these subjects;
(e) appoint a coordinator for the complex at Bouake not later than October
31, 1972;
(f) appoint, not later than one year from the date of the Loan Agreement,
qualified and experienced specialists for the pedagogical and technical
evaluation of ETV.
4.        In regard to resource utilization the Government  stated that in
view of the high costs of education, it would investigate the possibility
of reducing unit costs by the better utilization of resources, including



the consideration of whether the objectives of vocational education could
be attained through a more economical structure of training institutions.
The Government also said that it would study the results of a secondary school
survey included in the project and would then propose (i) reformed criteria
for school location and size to minimize the need for boarding and staff
housing; (ii) new guidelines for the allocation of scholarships; (iii) eco-
nomic teacher-student ratios, and (iv) improvement of the training of school
principals.
5.      In regard to ETV, a Managing Director was to be appointed to be
responsible for:
(a) ensuring appropriate network time and maintenance for ETV, together
with formal arrangements for external aid for this project component
to ensure its implementation;
(b) liaison with the Bank and other external aid or technical assistance
agencies;
(c) selection of management consultants and of specialists for pedagogical
and technical evaluation of the ETV Scheme;
(d) administration of agreements with consultants and specialists, together
with arrangements for the review by the appropriate authorities of the
material prepared by the consultants and specialists.
6.        The project encountered various problems during implementation and
there have been important changes in the educational use of the project
facilities. These problems caused delays and cost increases and the Bank was
not prepared to increase the loan amount.   Following the visit of a 16-man
delegation from the Ivory Coast to the Bank in October 1971, the Bank agreed
in November 1971 to delete one of the secondary general schools from the
project and considerably reduce the category of expenditure for interest and
other charges without reducing the loan.  In January 1975, the Bank agreed to
a US$2.2 million supplementary loan to compensate for currency realignments,
the US$ then being worth 225 CFAF by comparison with 278 at appraisal.   The
project as revised has been physically completed and the total loan of US$13.2
million was fully disbursed by September 6, 1977.
II. PRINCIPAL ISSUES
1.    Project Design
(a) Time Overruns
7.        The project as appraised involved  the construction of eleven
institutions for general, agricultural and technical education of varying
levels -- fields traditional for the Bank -- along with ETV.  The conditions



- 4 -
and assurances mentioned in the Loan Agreement and the supplementary letter
(paras. 3, 5) addressed some evidently anticipated problem areas.   Measures
were taken to expedite implementation by, for instance, requesting that the
architectural  consultants  selected  by the Government should be present at
negotiations.  In an effort to advance preparation to some degree before loan
approval, it was expected that consultant architects would be appointed before
approval.  However, a six month delay occurred in concluding a contract with
the architects -- a common cause of start up delays in education projects.l/
Further delay arose in fulfilling conditions of effectiveness -- i.e. the
establishment of the Project Unit plus the retention of management consultants
for the ETV scheme -- hence loan effectiveness was not achieved until late
November 1970, some four months later than originally envisaged.  Some of the
delays were not foreseeable at the time of appraisal but undoubtedly the
appraisal schedule of project processing was unrealistic in that it allowed
inadequate time for meeting conditions of Board presentation and loan effec-
tiveness.   It was drawn up at a time when Bank education staff were asked to
base their schedules on the assumption that all would go well, the argument
being that an ambitious implementation schedule would induce the Borrower to
achieve it.  This has not proven to be the case and the policy, which created
other problems (for example, in the underestimation of contingencies) has
tended to be abandoned in favor of a "most likely estimate" of actual imple-
mentation times.
8.        The implementation schedule envisaged the completion of the cons-
truction of the physical facilities, some 45 months after the appointment of
consultant architects.   This schedule was also somewhat unrealistic.   The
project suffered a 'time overrun' of over 100%, being completed nearly
seven years after the signature of the Loan Agreement.  This delay occurring
during a period of strong inflation caused considerable cost overruns and the
uncertainty as to how these overruns would be met compounded the delay.
(b) Standards and Cost Estimates
9.        The appraisal mission sought to reduce unit capital costs in the
project institutions, as these were very high in the West African countries
generally, and especially high in the Ivory Coast, by (a) using austere
standards of finish, and (b) by allowing lesser areas per student than those
usual in the Ivory Coast.  The leader of the UNESCO project preparation mis-
sion commented in July 1969 that the appraisal mission had further reduced
the already austere standards used by the project preparation mission and said
that "to what extent this expectation (i.e. that considerably reduced costs
would be possible with strict technical control) is realistic remains to be
proven."
1/  A recent study of 55 education projects in 17 countries noted lengthy
delay in appointing architectural consultants in 13 cases (Report No.
2321,   Review of Bank Operations in the Education Sector,  December  29,
1978, Table 19 on page 154).   More moderate delays occurred in several
other projects.



10.      The views of the Ministries which would ultimately use the buildings
were not sufficiently taken into account during project preparation and
appraisal and before schedules of accommodation and costs had been drawn up,
and the standards applied caused much correspondence and delay in the months
following loan signature.  This project was appraised at a time when the Bank
was extremely reluctant to finance housing, boarding and refectory facilities
in schools.  Assembly halls or multipurpose rooms were designed to serve as
refectories, and the Bank argued the use of double bunking in the boarding
facilities.   While this drive for economy was a worthy aim and a feature of
Bank policy, there is reason to believe  that it was pushed  too far:   the
boarding facilities ultimately provided in the project schools are generally
cramped and inadequately ventilated, granted the hot and humid climate of the
Ivory Coast.
11.        Essentially the problem was one of the depth of Government agreement
to the project proposals.  None of the appraisal mission members had visited
the Ivory Coast before; they were thus at a disadvantage in assessing this.
The project director wrote shortly before the project was declared effective
saying that the Bank norms were 50% lower than those used under French bi-
lateral aid.  Following loan effectiveness in November 1970, the Minister of
Finance set up an Interministerial Committee in early 1971 to advise him on
the problem; in its report of mid-1971, the Committee referred to the unyiel-
ding position of the technical ministries and said that "Without doubt the
problem is the most serious to affect the Ivory Coast and the World Bank up to
the present."   However, the  proposals of the Committee itself would have
involved a 100% increase in costs; they were rejected by the Minister who was
prepared  to accept a 50% increase only.   In October 1971, a large Ivorian
delegation visited  the Bank and a compromise solution was worked out.  The
Bank accepted certain increased unit areas but the loan amount remained un-
changed; one of the proposed project general secondary schools was eliminated.
Many of these problems could have been avoided by more thorough discussions
with the user Ministries during the project generation period.
12.      At the technical secondary school at Bouake, an order from the
Minister suppressing double-bunking reduced boarding capacity from 900 to 450
students. The school authorities expressed to the OED mission their view that
the refectory could not be used as a study area by boarders because it took
too long to clear up after meals.  For this reason, and also because ground
floors are not considered fully suitable for boarding by the school autho-
rities because of lack of privacy, the ground floor of the boarding facilities
is now being used for study rooms.!! Thus, in 1979, although this school had
1/   The Regional Office contests the view that to clean up after meals in
a refectory takes up to two hours and that ground floors are not suitable
for boarding because of lack of privacy.



- 6 -
320 day students instead of 200 originally envisaged it had only 340 boarders
instead of the original target of 900 and it appears that this school may have
difficulty in reaching its target enrollment. The Regional Office observed in
April 1980 that the standards applied by the Borrower are costly and that a
continuing Bank/country dialogue is being maintained on accommodation stand-
ards in a search for greater economy.
(c) The ETV Center - financing and location
13.      Representations at  the highest levels both of the Government and
UNESCO were made seeking Bank financing  for the ETV Center.   It was said
in early 1969, for instance, that the Ford Foundation would continue to
evaluate the ETV program -- but only if the Bank became involved in finan-
cing ETV.   The Bank ultimately agreed to finance the Center, but with some
trepidation which was reflected in the lengthy provisions in the supplemen-
tary letter regarding management and evaluation (paras. 3, 5).   One month
before project approval the Ford Foundation withdrew from the evaluation of
the scheme despite the Bank's willingness to be involved in financing the
ETV component.   The loan included US$100,000 for evaluative work which had
been included to 'top up' the Ford Foundation efforts; it was a quite inade-
quate amount for any thorough evaluative work.  However, the Bank, depending
on the Government's commitment to evaluation, did not increase the amount.
A considerable amount of evaluative work financed by bilateral agencies has,
in fact, been done but its objectives have not been clearly defined; it has
been fragmented both among specialists and agencies and a coherent picture
is lacking even now.    In retrospect,  it is clear that the Bank's greater
involvement in financing evaluation was particularly necessary not only to
help ensure the successful completion of evaluation but also because of the
importance of the lessons that its first major investment in ETV would have
held for future investments of this kind.
14.      The location of the ETV Center was the subject of considerable
discussion between the Government and the Bank in the early months of 1969.
The Government request was for the Center with its attached teacher training
schools to be built at Bouake in the center of the country so as not to
reinforce the existing concentration of facilities in the capital, Abidjan.
FAC11 strongly supported the Government in this, and as FAC was providing
much of the expert technical assistance and equipment required, this support
was very important.   The Bank urged unsuccessfully that the Center should be
built in Abidjan where capital costs would be lower and where the Center would
be able to use the existing facilities and staff of the Ivorian television and
broadcast authority and maintain close and essential contact with Ministry of
Education headquarters.   The Center was built in Bouake.  In retrospect, it
appears that the Bank's view was the correct one.  The present Bouake complex
is functioning in rather a vacuum, and the production of non-formal programs,

originally established in Bouake in 1973, was moved to Abidjan the next year
when it was found that the close connection with the various Itinistries
involved was impossible to achieve with program production remaining in
Bouake. This separation of out-of-school and school programs is unfortunate
as their interaction would be beneficial to both. Further, at the time of the
OED mission visit, only two of the six studios built under the project were
being used, and even these were being used intermittently; construction in
Abidjan would have economised the need for new studios and would have given a
greater measure of flexibility in their use.
(d) The lower leaving age from TV schools
15.      As stated in the PCR (para.  3.27), one of the major shortcomings
of the appraisal report was its unrealistic expectations of lowering repe-
tition rates in primary schools and increasing learning rates to such an
extent as to reduce (from 16.5 pupil-years to 5.5 pupil-years) the input to
bring a TV school child to the academic level of a child then completing his
6 primary grades.   The extent to which these expectations have been realized
is not known; however, the students leaving TV primary schools are younger
than those leaving the traditional schools.   This has caused increased pres-
sure on the secondary school system, and the Government is now concerned by
the problem of the more than 100,000 primary school leavers who unsuccess-
fully seek a place in secondary schools each year.  The project, of course,
did not create this problem, which is acute in many countries in addition
to the Ivory Coast./   It did however bring the problem forward in time,
and in retrospect, it is clear that its implications warranted more attention
during project preparation.
2. Physical Implementation
16.      The PCR  (paras.  2.05-2.12)  deals  thoroughly with the procurement
of buildings,  furniture and equipment under the project.   Physical  imple-
mentation of the project was generally satisfactory once the problems of
design standards and costs had been cleared up.   For instance, the general
secondary school buildings are functional and the kitchen/refectory facilities
are well conceived.  The boarding facilities in some schools (e.g. the girls'
lycee at Bingerville) are obviously inadequate; as a cost-cutting measure
during implementation they were reduced in area to such an extent that it is
now almost impossible even with double-bunking to accommodate the number of
1/ The Borrower has stated that the aim of the generalization of primary
education is to give basic education to those who do not go on to secon-
dary education, and that the application of the reform will permit the
extension of this basic education to the first cycle of secondary edu-
cation.   Coordinated measures will be taken to avoid the rural exodus.



- 8 -
beds required. Further, only one exit from the dormitory blocks was provided,
representing a potential fire hazard.l/  The Bingerville lycee also suffered
from flooding until the Government constructed further drainage works at its
own expense (see PCR para. 2.09).
3. Bank Supervision
17.      As the PCR states (para.  2.03),  Bank supervision of this project
could have been improved.  Educators participated in 13 of the 21 supervision
missions -- a proportion which is not lower than the Bank average.2/ Further,
the mix of educator specialities -- general, technical, agricultural and
audio-visual -- was reasonable.   The missions visited on the average once
every four months -- much more frequently than the average of once every 6.3
months shown in a recent survey of Bank-financed education projects. However,
the staff time devoted to individual missions -- an average of 1.6 man-weeks
-- was inadequate to address properly the educational problems the project was
facing and the missions were frequently combined with missions to other
countries. Several of these problems were mentioned for the first time in the
PCR.   In retrospect, it seems that the supervision mission strategy should
have been designed more around in-depth annual reviews.
18.       A second  issue  relates  to continuity of the supervision effort.
For example, in June 1975, a one-man mission visited Abidjan for a brief
period.  This mission was followed by a three-man mission in July, a two-man
mission in September and a Bank/UNESCO mission in November 1975.   In the
1/ The Regional Office has drawn attention to an April 1976 supervision
report which stated that, despite a Bank recommendation during the
design period, no fire escape measures were included, and that the super-
vision mission had explained the risks involved and again strongly
recommended the construction of fire escape ladders wherever needed;
in his letter of May 21, 1976 the Project Director had stated that
the project architect would examine, within a month, the work needed
to ensure security against fire.   On January 10, 1979, the Government
issued a decree (No.  79-12)  requiring - inter alia -   adequate access
to and exits from, plus provision of emergency equipment for, all public
buildings. A Bank supervision mission looked into the matter in June 1979
and it was agreed with the Project Unit that for all First Education
Project institutions, it would be necessary to provide supplementary
exits, fire extinguishers, and alarms.   The Government was requested to
expedite action on the necessary studies and the subsequent implementation
of the needed improvements.   The Project Director indicated in December
1979 that funds had been requested to bring these establishments into
conformity with the new Ivorian standards of security.
2/ The PCR expresses the view that few educators participated in supervision
missions (para. 2.03).



-9 -
meantime, a Bank architect stationed in RMWA visited project institutions from
October through December 1975.  None of the mission members took part in more
than one of these five missions from June through December 1975.
19.       Some responsibility for supervision was passed to the Bank RMWA
office in Abidjan in 1974 when an architect was added to the agricultural
education specialist already based there.   This afforded opportunities for
direct contact in Abidjan outside Qf normal field visits by Washington or RMWA
staff.   However, the assistance of RMWA staff did not significantly improve
matters because of their other commitments and the limits of their authority
to take decisions (PCR, para. 2.03). Government officials observed to the OED
mission that RMWA staff had generally been very useful in helping project
implementation along but observed that RMWA staff had little authority to take
decisions and that the necessity to route correspondence via the RMWA office
en route to Washington had, therefore, at times contributed to delays.
20.       One  significant  problem was  that  of  coordinating  the effort of
the headquarters based staff with that of the RMWA staff.  The definition of
responsibilities of RMWA needed better clarification and was reviewed period-
ically, particularly in 1975 when the full responsibility for architectural
supervision was retained by Headquarters.   The RMWA office was limited by
the staff resources available to it. The change in the training to be offered
in the Bouake Agricultural Institute (para. 33) was approved by the Bank
office in Abidjan without any reference to Headquarters as there was an
agricultural education specialist based there.   On the other hand, the Bank
office simply passed on to Headquarters for decision the Government request to
change the usage of the teacher training schools in the Bouake complex with a
recommendation that it should be approved, largely on the grounds that it was
a 'fait accompli'.
21.       Supervision  reports were generally written only by Headquarters
staff following their own visits.   RHWA staff prepared monthly reports which
were sent to Headquarters.   However, the files on this project are nowhere
complete: some reports exist only on Headquarters files, not always in
the recognized record centers; other documents exist only in Abidjan files in
which all education projects materials are filed together (and occasionally
papers from other projects too).   These circumstances made it difficult for
either office to keep fully abreast of project developments, and also hindered
the audit process.   As an example of the inadequacy of the present filing
system, it may be mentioned that of the 21 supervision missions undertaken,
the PCR in its first version listed just six.
III. EDUCATIONAL IMPACT
(a) Educational Television
22.       This aspect of the project, as stated in the PCR (para. 3.18)
has attracted international attention, and more words have been written on



- 10 -
it than any other -- a recent very selective bibliography lists 14 reports
in French or English on this ETV project.   The comments in the PCR (paras.
3.18 through 3.32) are in general pertinent and well-considered and the fol-
lowing paragraphs are intended to complement the material in the PCR.  While
this project item has experienced several problems, it should be recognized
that in the world sense this was a pilot effort.  Few ETV undertakings on this
scale had been attempted prior to this project and some shortcomings were only
to be expected in the difficult conditions of the Ivory Coast.
23.      During  the  project  generation  period  the  Government  was  anxious
to institute teaching by television as soon as possible, and some of the
problems the program has encountered can be traced to this haste.  The Bank-
financed ETV complex did not become operational until all the initial programs
had been produced for the whole primary cycle, and the programs were produced
in temporary facilities (PCR, para. 3.25).   The program producers were cons-
tantly working against deadlines.   Sometimes individual programs were being
produced only a week or so before they were to be broadcast.  Partly because
of this the quality of the recorded television programs is low both technical-
ly and educationally, the programs are much shorter than had originally been
intended, and there is inadequate connection between them and the supporting
supplementary written materials for students and teachers.
24.       The scheduling  of programs  is not  fixed well  in advance.   Each
day when broadcasting begins, a still image on the screen gives the timings
of the forthcoming programs for each of the six primary classes.   This
dissolves when the first of the programs comes on and reappears, suitably
changed,  after the program has ended.   The appraisal report (para. 3.14),
envisaged four lessons of fifteen minutes each day for the first four grades
and two per day for each of grades five and six.  The actual programs trans-
mitted are much shorter: of twelve lessons viewed at random by the OED mission
in early 1979, one lasted nine minutes, and none of the others lasted more
than five minutes.  The 1976/77 figures for television production indicate an
average lesson length of eight minutes, but this relates to a period when
production was mainly for the higher grades where programs are on the average
longer.   A 1976 accountl/ of the system said that television viewing was
scheduled to average from 3 to 3-1/2 hours a week for children in grades one
through three and somewhat more for grades four through six.  A 1978 paperk!
however stated that in 1974-75 only about 80 hours were broadcast to each

grade. Based on the 1979 OED mission observations, made of course over a very
limited period, the impression is that even the figure in the 1978 paper
exaggerates the television viewing time.   It is clear in any case that the
appraisal mission estimates, both of total viewing time and of the length of
individual lessons, are far from having been achieved.  Many of the lessons
attempt to cover too much material in the time available.
25.      Because of the short time spent in actually viewing televised les-
sons, the major influences on student achievement within the schools are the
quality of the teachers and of the printed support material.l/ This printed
material was provided free to the Ivory Coast Government by Canadian aid in
the first years of the project and it is of high quality though lacking some-
what in student exercise material.   A fully-equipped printshop,  paper and
expert services were supplied.   During the course of the project there was
some discussion between the Canadian experts, who considered that the tele-
vision programs should support the printed material, and the French television
experts, whose view was that the printed materials were an adjunct to the
television programs. All save one of the Canadian experts have now left the
country, and the printshop is working at only 10% of its capacity, in part
because of a lack of spare parts.   Printed materials to be used with the TV
programs are now being imported from France and sold to the students to
economise on government recurrent expenditures.   Some needy students do not
have the books and are at a disadvantage in comparison with others who do have
them.2/
26.      No systematic or large-scale efforts have been made to compare
the achievements of the students in the ETV-assisted classes with those of
students  in the  other  traditional  classes.    Borrower officials  expressed
the view that the products of the two systems should not be compared as
the aims of the new ETV assisted program were to produce a primary school
leaver different in kind from the primary school leavers produced by the
traditional  system.   In accordance with this view, the secondary entrance
examinations for the two groups are different. The results are inconclusive.
In 1977, 25% of the candidates from ETV-assisted primary schools were admitted
to secondary education against only 15% from traditional schools. However, in
1978 the traditional schools, with a 16% success rate, did better than the
ETV-assisted  schools with 13%.   The most important  factors in success in
competition for entry to secondary schools are not ETV but those of age --
with younger students having a much greater chance of success -- and gender --
with boys generally doing better than girls.
1/ Commenting on this report in December 1979, the Borrower agreed with
this view saying that the television programs merely constituted a sup-
plement to the main educational program.
2/ The Borrower stated in December 1979 that accompanying learning materials
are provided free for needy pupils.



- 12 -
27.      ETV is not used in secondary education in the Ivory Coast.  Secondary
school teachers say that pupils from ETV primary schools rapidly readjust to
the lack to a TV set in the secondary school classroom, and that they are much
livelier  and more  fluent  in French.   The majority of traditional  primary
school classes observed by the OED mission were composed of repeaters; their
students were much less lively than the TV class students but this may be more
a function  of  their  being  less able  students  than of different attitudes
brought about by ETV.
28.      One of the major achievements connected with the project was the
establishment of a school television receiver distribution and maintenance
system.  ThIs was originally intended to be financed under the project (para.
2 (d)) but was ultimately withdrawn when a private firm undertook this func-
tion (PCR, para. 3.21(b)).   The maintenance system that has been established
is efficient but costly. The costs for servicing each television receiver for
a year, though still high, have dropped from CFAF 124,000 (US$620) in 1971 to
CFAF 53,000 (US$265) in 1979. The receivers are of a special type supplied by
a French company, and cost CFAF 100,000 (US$500) each -- about three times the
cost of a regular receiver.   However, their energy consumption is only about
one-third that of ordinary receivers (30 watts as against 90 watts), and their
modular construction simplifies servicing problems.   The lower power consump-
tion is critical, as a group of 32 batteries costing CFAF 14,000 each (US$70)
or over USS2,000 per group is required to operate the 80-85% of receivers
which do not have a mains supply.  One group of batteries will furnish power
for up to three receivers.   The batteries not only cost more initially than
the television receivers, but even when carefully utilized, with the receivers
being turned off after each transmission, last only two years and are then
discarded.   Rechargeable accumulators would be much heavier and more bulky
and the only alternative being considered to the present system is that of
solar energy batteries. Solar batteries in 1975 cost $30 per watt of output;
in 1979 this cost is expected to be reduced to $10 per watt and to $1 per watt
in 1985.   The long-term future of the ETV scheme appears to be critically
dependent on whether these expectations are realized.
29.      The  Appraisal  Report  estimated  that  in 1980,  ETV programs would
cost some USS4 million per year and reach 710,000 primary pupils at a recur-
rent cost per pupil of US$6 in 1968 prices.l/ These ETV cost estimates
have been exceeded: two major studies have indicated annual per student ETV
costs of about US$25 including printed materials and US$19 excluding these
materials.   Another estimate placed total ETV costs in 1977 (when the system
was reaching some 420,000 pupils) at about 2.7 billion CFAF (US$13.5 million)
or $32 per pupil, even with the much lower than planned ETV viewing time
(para. 24). In view of the high cost of batteries increasing the viewing time
would have important repercussions on costs.
1/ The Regional Office has indicated that US$6 in 1968 Ivory Coast prices is
equivalent to US$16.6 in 1978 prices.

30.       The achievements of the Ivory Coast ETV Scheme must be set in the
context of the considerable difficulties which had to be overcome. The
positive aspects of the scheme appear to be (i) a more lively and enquiring
attitude on the part of the students; (ii) improvement in spoken French
language abilities; (iii) successful implementation of delivery and main-
tenance of receivers; (iv) greater teacher discipline because of the neces-
sity for the teacher to follow the TV lesson schedules and (v) greater
uniformity of teaching standards, and hence greater equality of opportunity
amongst pupils of different regions.         Government authorities and outside
observers stress the utility that ETV has had in the introduction of new
curricula; both imply that with better-trained teachers the need for TV is
lessened.   The negative aspects, however, are serious and include (i) poor
quality programs which are often too short to be effective, (ii) curriculum
material which is still insufficiently relevant to the pupil's background and
to his likely future, (iii) insufficient exercises in reading and writing with
a consequent decline in standards and (iv) high costs, especially taking into
account the brevity of the programs - according to figures supplied by the
Regional Office the annual cost per ETV pupil was US$160 in 1978 by comparison
with US$120 per primary pupil outside the ETV system.
31.      The future of the ETV scheme is presently unclear: at the time of the
OED mission, a moratorium had been declared on the production of new program
material and the facilities were being used solely to remake programs which
had been found to be inadequate either technically or pedagogically. The
facilities were considerably underutilized, and this is likely to continue
until 1981. In late 1978 a high level Government advisory council visited the
Bouake complex; it is expected that decisions will be made on the future use
and development of ETV on the basis of its findings.  The need for a further
evaluation of the ETV scheme in about five years' time is indicated.
(b) Technical and Vocational Education
32.      The technical and vocational project elements are the most success-
ful part of the project.   This is because the institutions concerned had
sufficiently well-defined objectives which have not substantially changed
during the life of the project and they are in general well staffed.   The
PCR (paras. 3.02-3.10), describes well the achievements and problems of the
technical institutions included in the project, particularly their extremely
high recurrent costs  (para.  3.09).   These costs are attributable to three
main factors (i) high staff costs because the majority of the teachers are
expatriates -- costs which are expected by the Borrower to decline as local
instructors are trained; (ii) low student/teacher ratios -- at the time of the
OED visit in 1979 the university level Higher National Institute for Technical
Education and the Accelerated Vocational Training Center alike had student-
teacher ratios of only 6 to 1; and (iii) generous bursaries,   especially at
the university level.   While secondary technical education has an essential
place to fill in the Government's successful development plans, its high unit
costs warrant critical review of the possibility of developing alternative



- 14 -
approaches to technician training such as on-the-job programs following a
general secondary education with a strong mathematical/scientific bias.
(c) Agricultural Training
33.      The  PCR  describes  well  (paras.  3.11-3.17),  the  original  project
aims and the changes which have been made in the programs and which were
approved by the Bank.   The Bouake Agricultural Institute provides a concen-
trated 33 month program -- roughly equivalent to grades 14 through 17 --
instead of the two year Grades 14-15 program originally envisaged.  There are
two main problems: (i) the recurrent cost aspect, treated in the PCR (para.
3.16) and (ii) the long-run demand for post-secondary trained agricultural
technologists, which is not dealt with in the PCR.  The appraisal report (in
its para. 2.03) estimated the annual long-run needs for agronomists at 40,
agricultural technologists at 50, both to be trained in a university-level
institution, and 120 technicians, to be trained in the project school at
Bouake. The audit has been informed that the first three intakes of trainee
technologists at the IAB have each exceeded the appraisal estimate of 50 and
that all trainees have been sponsored by employers, thus indicating the very
real need being catered for by the institute. The Borrower, in his comments of
December 1979,  indicated that the training being given corresponds  to the
needs, notably in the parastatal agriculture sector.  However, the long-term
need for an additional institution of this type and level in Ivory Coast
needed clarification prior to the Bank's agreement to the change in function
of the IAB; that longer-term need is by no means clear at this time and should
be assessed in above five years'  time.   Changes in the programs would be
possible at a later stage without significant change in the physical plant.
33.      The PCR states  (para.  3.16)  that the major teaching role in the
Bouake Agricultural Institute is taken by part-time staff who hold posts
in agricultural industry and in the Ministries concerned with agriculture.
Their mastery of their subject matter is usually good and their involvement
in the training program was rightly enthusiastically welcomed by the Bank.
However, they generally lack pedagogical training and their capacity to
teach is sometimes less assured, with the result that the material sometimes
needs repetition by the regular staff who have had pedagogical training.
Nevertheless, the potential benefits of this relatively innovative approach
appear to outweigh the difficulties being experienced.
(d) Primary Teacher Training
35.      As stated in the PCR (para. 3.36) the two primary teacher training
colleges included in the Bouake educational complex are not being used for
pre-service teacher training as was originally intended but for the in-service
training of inspectors, regional advisors, training college teachers, and
specialists in educational technology.   The PCR notes (para. 3.38) that the
buildings as designed are not entirely suitable for their new functions.  The
introduction of ETV clearly accentuated the need for continuous reorientation
or upgrading of administrators, teacher trainers and teachers; to a limited



- 15 -
extent the Bouake complex was expected to assist in the in-service training of
administrators.   Despite the fact that the Borrower regards the two colleges
as responding to the needs for pre-service and in-service teacher training,
this change of purpose was a major one which the Bank seems never to have
officially approved, although RMWA in late 1976 had recommended approval.
The buildings are at present underutilized (PCR, para. 3.38) and in the light
of the comparatively small number of the cadre of people involved it is
doubtful whether this usage will be justified over the long term. Additional
primary teacher training colleges have been included in the Third Education
Project (approved in November 1979) with a view, inter alia, to improving the
regional  distribution of such opportunities.   It appears important  that a
review of the need for and utilization of Bank financed teacher training
facilities be undertaken in about five years' time.
36.      The teacher training school at Man is functioning as it was origin-
ally intended; the PCR has stated (para. 3.35) that there is some debate as to
whether such a large college is appropriate because of the difficulties in
arranging enough demonstration classes and practice training in neighboring
primary schools.   This potential problem had been highlighted by UNESCO in
1967, when it inquired why the Bank was proposing two large training colleges
instead of the five smaller ones proposed by the government.  The Bank at this
time was however concerned to 'optimise school sizes' (see e.g. PCR, para.
3.42) and was of the opinion that larger teacher training schools were more
economical to build and operate than smaller ones.   Officials stated to the
OED mission that no problem with practice teaching has developed -- in fact,
space originally intended for storage has been converted to classrooms in the
new PTTC building in order to maintain the total enrollment at 270 while
providing instruction to smaller groups of 22 instead of 30 as originally
envisaged, so as to improve the quality of training offered.    The Principal
of the teacher training school has requested that the Government build addi-
tional classrooms because this converted accommodation is inadequate for
classroom purposes.
(e) General Secondary Education
37.      In the two project general secondary schools (see paras. 2, 6), the
new emphasis on science and technology in the first cycle that was originally
envisaged has not been achieved (PCR, para. 3.41).!'   It appears that the
difficulties in introducing changes in curricula were insufficiently appre-
ciated during project identification, preparation and appraisal. Furthermore,
supervision missions for this project were generally pre-occupied with other
aspects of the project and did not devote sufficient time to this one.
1/ The Borrower reported in December 1979 that new measures have been taken
by the Government to introduce the study of the physical sciences, chemis-
try, technology and industrial design from the beginning of secondary
education, and that 200 million CFA francs had been appropriated to equip
the first schools for this purpose.



- 16 -
(f)  Achievement of General Educational Objectives
38.      The experience with the achievement of the broad educational objec-
tives summarized in paras. 3-5 above has been mixed.   High level staff and
experts to assist the government were appointed, though often with some delays
from the original schedules, and the project institutions are, in general,
well-staffed,  However, the educational objectives to be addressed were ambi-
tious and have not been fully achieved.   While some progress has been made
in the introduction of more modern secondary curricula (PCR, para. 3.01), the
curricula do not yet have a sufficiently broad and practical base (PCR, para.
3.41). Further work is being done on this important question under the Second
Education Project.  The objectives of reducing unit recurrent costs (para. 4)
have not been achieved especially in technical (PCR, para. 3.09), and in
agricultural education,/ (PCR, para. 3.16) and the study of general secondary
education included in the project (para. 4) has proved of limited value (PCR,
paras. 3.42-3.45). The problems of high educational costs in the Ivory Coast
have been compounded by the Government's decision in 1975 to increase primary
school teachers' salaries (PCR, para. 3.26).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
39.      It is too early at this stage to attempt a full evaluation of proj-
ject outcomes as the various institutions have been in operation for too
short a time and a later review of these outcomes is needed (paras. 31, 33
and 35).   It is evident that experience with this project has been mixed.
After the original problems regarding building standards were overcome, the
physical implementation was generally good although there are design faults
-- such as the cramped and inadequately ventilated boarding facilities and
insufficient sound insulation in the television studios (paras. 9-12; PCR,
paras. 2.05-2.12, 3.04, 3.15, 3.24).
40.       The technical education and vocational training objectives are being
met reasonably well; innovative programs focussed rather on training for
employment than for the next level of education have been developed; the
experience gained under this project has been useful in designing similar
programs in subsequent projects (para. 32; PCR, paras. 3.02-3.10).  The pri-
mary teacher training college at Man and the general secondary schools built
under the project are functioning efficiently but the hoped-for emphasis on
science and technology has not been achieved (paras. 36, 37; PCR, paras.
3.01, 3.16, 3.35, 3.41-3.47).
41.       The original objectives of the project have been changed in regard
to two primary teacher training colleges and one agricultural training
institution; two of the intended primary teacher training colleges have been
used instead for in-service training of education administrators and of
1/ The Regional Office has stated that the unit recurrent costs given in the
PCR were based on low enrollment ratios; and that as these enrollment
ratios have increased since the PCR was first compiled these unit costs
have been reduced.

teacher trainers while, with mutual Bank/Borrower agreement the intended mid-
dle level agricultural training institution has been used instead for profes-
sional level training (paras. 33, 35; PCR, paras. 3.12-3.13, 3.34-3.39).
42.       The ETV component  has been the least  successful  element  of the
project. While the introduction of the ETV system has assisted in stimulating
students and in bringing about a more disciplined approach to teaching, its
impact has been far less than originally expected.  Its implementation was so
delayed that television programs for all the primary school grades had already
been produced and were being broadcast before it became operational. The most
successful part of the ETV component -- the system for installation and repair
of TV receivers -- was ultimately not financed under the project.  The Bank's
involvement in the ETV component was, however, critical in ensuring its
launching, and the Ivory Coast experience with ETV has attracted worldwide
attention and has been particularly valuable to other countries contemplating
such a system; an international seminar on the use of ETV was held in December
1978 in the Ivory Coast (paras. 13, 14, 22-31; PCR, paras. 3.18-3.32).
43.       In retrospect, it is clear that some elements of the project needed
more thorough study during the project design and implementation stages and
experience with this project has shown that:
(i)  the importance of Bank/country agreement on accommodation
standards prior to project implementation was not fully appre-
ciated in this case (paras. 9-12);
(ii) reduced boarding facilities have had a negative impact on the
attainment of target enrollments (para. 12);
(iii) the location of the national educational television center in
a town far away from the head office of the Ministry of Edu-
cation, instead of near to the head office as the Bank had
wished, caused difficulties in program coordination (para. 14);
(iv) the impact of the expected improvement in the primary education
throughput on the demand for secondary school places needed to
be taken into account (para. 15);
(v)  close  coordination  of the supervision efforts  of the field
office in Abidjan and Headquarters was needed (paras. 19, 20);
(vi) a cheap source of electric power for television receivers in
an ETV system is needed (para. 28);
(vii) changes in curricula are difficult to effect and need close
attention by Bank missions (para. 37).

Proiect Oblectives
i.        The principal objective of the Ivory Coast first education project
was to provide facilities to train manpower needed to cope with the country's
rapid economic growth; in 1966, 90% of the professionals and technicians and
60% of the supervisory staff in 2,000 of the most important private enter-
prises were expatriates. To achieve this objective, the project provided
assistance for expansion and improvement of most of the different levels of
education in the country, including specific programs for training skilled
workers and technicians in industry, commerce and agriculture. The project
supported an innovative reform of the primary education system through educa-
tional television and contributed toward the development of new school build-
ing standards.



- 21 -
Project Content
ii.       The project was modified 18 months after signature of the Loan
Agreement and thereafter comprised the following:
(a)  construction and equipping of one vocational school for
adult training, two secondary technical schools, one post-
secondary technical institution, two general secondary
schools and one primary teacher training center;
(b)  construction of an educational television production center
with facilities for primary teacher training; and
(c)  related studies, technical assistance and fellowships.
Costs
iii.      The total project cost was estimated at appraisal at US$19.1 mil-
lion (at an exchange rate of CFAF 278 to the US dollar), of which the loan
of US$11.0 million was intended to finance 58% of the total cost. A supple-
mentary loan signed in 1975 provided an additional US$2.2 million. However,
total costs reached US$33.05 million due to changes in currency values,
inflation and alterations and additions to certain project components; the
Bank contribution eventually represented about 40% of total project costs.
The project was to have been implemented within four years, but in fact took
slightly over seven.
Conclusions
iv.       The principal objective of the project--to provide facilities for an
increased output of trained manpower for industry, commerce and agriculture--
has been achieved. The project has been less successful in bringing about
qualitative improvement in the primary and secondary education systems, al-
though some 1,500 secondary and 270 primary teacher training places have been
provided in well-equipped and functional institutions. The educational tele-
vision component was so much delayed in implementation that much of its
intended value was lost.
v.        Physical execution.  The project took almost twice as long to
complete and cost almost twice as much as had been estimated at appraisal, for
a variety of reasons (para. 2.02), including delays in reaching agreement
between the Government and the Bank at various stages in the project cycle,
cumbersome administrative procedures, the complexity of certain components,
inexperience on the part of many of the people involved in project implementa-
tion, and higher than expected inflation.



*~ ~ ~ 2  -k
vi.       Suitability of buildings and equipment.  The buildings and equipment
provided for all project institutions, except the ETV complex, are generally
suitable for the purposes for which they were designed (para. 2.09).
vii.      Technical education and vocational training.  The technical educa-
tion and vocational training components have been the most successful. A
higher technical institute, two well-equipped secondary technical schools, and
one urban vocational training center have been built (para. 3.02) and a small
but effective technical assistance component provided training for the teaching
staff (para. 3.08). The project has been a catalyst in the development of a
major reform of the technical education system in the Ivory Coast which
emphasizes training for employment with active employer participation and
flexible programs adapted to individual and employing agency needs (para.
3.10).
viii.     Agricultural training.  The appraisal report envisaged expansion and
improvement in middle-level agricultural training, but it was not until the
buildings for the new agricultural training institute had been constructed
that Government policies for agricultural training were firmed up. The fact
that the project had provided a new institution, however, enabled the Govern-
ment to introduce, in 1975, a major reform of agricultural training (para.
3.13). The reform required modifications to be made in the buildings of the
institute; these were financed by the Caisse Centrale, which took over the
major responsibility for assistance to the Government in implementing the
reform.
ix.       Primary education.  The project has made a modest contribution,
through the construction of a teacher training center (CAFOP); this assistance
was subsequently augmented through the construction of two additional CAFOPs
under the second project (Loan 1125-IVC). The other element of assistance to
primary education--the construction of an educational TV complex--was less
successful. Problems in conception, management and implementation proved so
serious that this component was not completed until after the principal task
for which it was to have been built (the production of programs for the third
to sixth years of the primary cycle) had been completed (para. 3.32). The
Government had to construct other facilities for this purpose, parts of which
many users considered to be more functional than the Bank-financed complex. A
more positive contribution of the project was the assistance provided for the
creation of an effective, largely Ivorian-staffed ETV evaluation unit, which
is now beginning to produce valuable materials likely to aid in improving the
future effectiveness of ETV (para. 3.29). The project has also provided
facilities at the complex which are being used for the in-service training of
senior primary education staff and ETV technicians.
x.        Secondary education.  In this area the project's contribution was
modest, but the two pilot secondary schools which have been built are func-
tional and may become models on which any future reform of the system can be
based. The technical assistance component of this part of the project,
designed to improve the efficiency of secondary education, was perhaps pre-
mature as the Government was not ready at the time the project was implemented



- 23 -
to make changes directed at greater efficiency (para. 3.44). As recurrent
financial constraints become more serious, however, it is likely that the
Government will become more aware of the need to introduce such changes.
xi.       Institution building.  One of the most valuable aspects of the
project has been the development, within the Ministry of Na:ional Education,
of a fund of experience in project implementation (para. 2.04).
Lessons Learned and Principal Recommendations
xii.      Because of its diversity and because this project represented (a)
Ivory Coast's first experience with Bank education project implementation and
(b) one of the Bank's earliest investments in primary education and in educa-
tional television, project implementation has been a learning experience of
great value. Many of the lessons derived from the experience have already
influenced changes in Government and Bank policies. The major recommendations
are set out below.
Relative to Government
(a) Since recurrent costs per student in Ivory Coast are among the
highest for all African countries, the Government should review
its standard for scholarships, student teacher ratios, and use
of existing facilities (paras. 3.09, 3.16 and 3.17).
(b) Where educational innovations, similar to ETV, are introduced
in the future, comparative evaluation studies should be de-
signed from the start so that the advantages and disadvantages
of the innovation can be determined (para. 3.31).
(c) For the introduction of new training programs, such as in the
case of the training institute at Bouake where integration
between agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry training
should be emphasized, close liaison should be established among
the appropriate ministries and agencies from the outset of
project preparation.
(d) Technical ministries should make available competent staff to
advise the architects during the crucial design phase of projects
(para. 3.04).
(e) Government procedures for procurement and approval of contracts
should be simplified to eliminate costly delays and reduce the
burden on project implementation staff (para. 2.02).
(f) Architectural studies and terms of reference should include:
(i) capital and recurrent cost implications at an early design
stage (para. 2.12); (ii) site feasibility studies in advance
of site selection (para. 2.06); (iii) maintenance strategy
for each institution (para. 2.12); (iv) proposals for mainte-
nance (para. 2.12); and (v) a completion report on the basis
of an agreed model (para. 2.08).



- 24 -
(g) Equipment procurement contracts should include a requirement
that manufacturers will install major equipment components
(para. 3.04).
Relative to the Bank
(a) There should be a common understanding on project objectives
and a commitment to this on the part of Government and co-
donors (paras. 1.09, 2.02, 3.13 and 3.32).
(b) Where there are complex and innovative components in a project,
Bank supervision should be carried out by appropriately qualified
staff (para. 2.03).
Linkage with Subsequent Projects
xiii.      The first project laid foundations on which it has proved possible
to make further investments under the second project (Loan 1125-IVC), partic-
ularly in the areas of primary teacher training where two additional CAFOPs
were financed, and vocational training where improvements were made to four
urban vocational training centers. In other cases, efforts initiated under
the first project were continued under the second in order to help meet first
project objectives,such as assistance to educational television by the pro-
vision of technical assistance for management and operation and completion
of the secondary school inventories. The first project also laid the ground-
work for several of the largest third project institutions: the two secondary
technical schools financed under the first project are serving as prototypes
for three or four "lycees professionnels" proposed for third project financ-
ing, and two CAFOPs to be financed under the project will be based upon
designs used in the first project.

I. THE SETTING AND THE PROJECT
Sector Setting
1.01      At appraisal in 1969, the structure of the education system in the
Ivory Coast followed very closely the French pattern and provided for a six-
year primary course, a secondary course consisting of a four-year lower cycle
and a three-year diversified upper cycle, and a tertiary level of university
and non-university courses.
1.02      The primary system was described in the appraisal report as inade-
quate and inefficient; school work and the curricula taught were not relevant
to Ivorian life and environment, and teaching methods relied heavily on
memorizing rather than comprehension. Other weaknesses included a high pro-
portion of repeaters (up to 41% in the sixth grade), a dropout rate of 43%, a
10-year age scatter in half of the classes, large class sizes (often in the
60's) and large numbers of unqualified teachers.
1.03      Secondary education was expanding rapidly (there had been a six-fold
increase in 9 years) but again there were heavy rates of dropout: 40% in the
lower cycle and 30% in the upper cycle. The curriculum, the syllabus and the
examination standards were very similar to those of France and, at the time of
appraisal, less than 10% of the teachers were Ivorians.
1.04      At the University of Abidjan, then still in its infancy, Ivorians
represented only about a third of the total enrollment and the main enroll-
ments were in the traditional faculties of Law and Arts and Letters.
1.05      The Ivory Coast was in the midst of very rapid economic growth, but
this was largely being directed by expatriate staff. A survey of 2,000 of the
most important private enterprises in 1966 indicated that 90% of the profes-
sionals and technicians, 60% of the supervisory staff and 27% of the clerical
workers were non-Africans, mainly French nationals.
1.06      Education expenditures were beginning to increase rapidly.  In 1967
they reached 4.2% of GDP, largely because of very high recurrent costs at all
levels.
Project Identification
1.07      Following a Bank/Unesco/FAO reconnaissance mission in January 1967
and a Bank/Unesco identification mission in May 1968, the Government approached
the Bank in December 1968 with a request, prepared with the help of Unesco, for
the financing of general, vocational, technical and teacher-training institu-
tions and an instructional television production center. An appraisal mission
visited the Ivory Coast in February/March 1969 and appraised a project with an
estimated total cost of US$19.1 million and a foreign exchange component of
US$11.0 million.



- 26 -
Project Content
1.08      The project as appraised included:
(a) the construction and equipping of:
one vocational school for adult accelerated training; this
later became known as a "Centre technique urbain" (CTU)
and, later still, a "Centre de perfectionement";
two secondary technical schools or "lycees techniques";
two post-secondary technical schools, one for agriculture
and one for industry and commerce; the former became the
"Institut agricole de Bouake" (IAB) and the latter the
"Institut national superieur de l'enseignement technique"
(INSET);
three general secondary schools; when the project was rede-
signed in 1971 one of these was omitted;
three primary teacher training colleges; one was built at
Man; the other two were included as part of the educational
television component of the project; they were subsequently
changed into a combined "Centre de spe'cialisation en tech-
nologie educative" (CSTE) and "Centre national de formation
permanente" (CNFP) designed for the in-service training of
senior staff, pedagogical advisers and ETV technicians;
(b) construction of an instructional television production center
which later became known as the Educational television complex;
and
(c) related studies, technical assistance, fellowships and the
establishment of a project unit.
Amendments to the Project
1.09      Little progress was made in project implementation immediately
after signing of the Loan Agreement in April 1970. The Government selected
a firm of consultants before Board presentation, but subcontracts between
the consultants and architectural firms were not completed until the middle
of 1971. Reaching agreement with the Government on educational specifica-
tions, curricula, teaching methods, space and construction standards, and
equipment lists took a great deal longer and in some cases agreement on
standards could not be reached.
1.10      Eventually, an interministerial commission was set up to reconcile
differences within the Government and between the Government and the Bank and
to propose changes in project content to get over the impasse on standards
and cope with cost overruns which had resulted from the delays. At a meeting
in Washington in October 1971, the Bank and the Government agreed to amend



the Loan Agreement by (a) reducing the number of institutions to be con-
structed from 11 to 10 (omission of the proposed lycee of Yaimoussoukro because
the Government insisted on construction standards far higher than Bank norms);
(b) reducing the number of general secondary places from 2,370 to 1,430 of general
secondary boarding places from 1,690 to 1,090 and of staff houses from 11 to 7;
and (c) reallocating the funds thus freed to cope with the considerable cost
increase then being faced for the other parts of the project.
The Supplementary Loan
1.11      During these re-negotiations the Government requested supplementary
financing because, even with the reduction in project content, the Govern-
ment's contribution to total project cost was expected to rise. The Bank
indicated that it could not make a supplementary loan at that time but would
review periodically the project's financial situation. By June 1974 the
financial status of the project had deteriorated substantially due to infla-
tion and a change in the exchange rate of the US dollar from CFAF 278 to
CFAF 243, and in January 1975 the Bank finally agreed to a supplementary loan
of US$2.2 million to compensate for devaluation. The exchange rate was then
CFAF 225 to the US dollar.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The Project Unit
2.01      The Loan Agreement required the Government to establish a project
unit and appoint a coordinator (who became the Project Director) and an
architect. It did not specify the need for an accountant and this proved
to be a weakness. The Ivorian staff selected for the two project unit posts
were recent graduates who tackled their tasks with enthusiasm and dedication
but were handicapped by additional heavy workloads. However, they remained
in their posts throughout project implementation and subsequently took re-
sponsibility for further work on the second and third projects, thus providing
a continuity of effort and direction which has proved valuable. Because of
the inexperience of Ivorian staff, the Government recruited a firm of manage-
ment consultants (para. 2.05) to assist in project implementation. However,
delays and difficulties experienced during implementation were due to the fact
that the consultants were themselves inexperienced with Bank projects.
2.02      Some of the major difficulties confronted by the project unit were
beyond its control and included:
(a)  indecision between Government agencies, particularly in approval
of building plans and equipment specifications (paras. 1.09
and 3.24);
(b)  a complex Government system of procurement involving some 12
different steps and at least nine different agencies before
any contract could be finally approved;



- 28 -
(c) insufficient technical support (particularly for the ETV com-
ponent) to advise on complex implementation issues (para. 3.32);
C(d) unexpected difficulties after loan signature concerning building
standards at the proposed secondary school at Yamoussoukro (the
school was subsequently deleted from the project) and the loca-
tion of the INSET, which eventually required a presidential
decisior (para. 1.10); and
(e)  - _ertain rigidity of approach and reluctance to compromise
between the Bank (concerned about escalating costs) and the
Government (preoccupied with evolving educational policies),
exemplified in the differences, throughout much of the imple-
mentation period, between the Government and the Bank on the
appropriate spaces for student accommodation (para. 2.09).
Bank Implementation Assistance
2.03      There was fairly close involvement by Bank staff in preparing for
implementation up to the date of signing of the Loan Agreement, but there-
after Bank implementation assistance decreased. For three years, supervision
was conducted through brief missions at intervals of about seven months,
mostly conducted by one Bank architect; regrettably few educators participated.
The Bank's only expert in educational TV, who had been active at the appraisal
stage, did not visit the Ivory Coast for 21 months after Loan signa-
ture. In 1974, RMWA staff were requested to assist in project supervision but
this did not significantly improve matters, as they were heavily burdened with
work on other projects and initially were not authorized to act without reference
to headquarters. Bank supervision of greater frequency and depth might have helped
to resolve differences between the Government and the Bank more quickly and, in
the case of the ETV component, it is likely that the Bank could have had a
much more useful impact in policy making, in inter-donor relations and in
gaining experience itself in the use of modern educational technology.
Institution Building
2.04      The project has helped the Ministry of Education to develop a proj-
ect implementation capacity. In particular, project unit staff have learned
a lot about project planning, costing, international and local procurement
procedures, school building techniques, and the preparation of furniture and
equipment specifications. They are now applying this knowledge in other Bank-
assisted projects and the much larger Government capital investment program in
education, now underway, for which they retain a major responsibility.



- 29 -
The Management Consultants
2.05      The contracts for the consultants required them to provide (a) tech-
nical assistance to the Ministry of National Education, (b) preliminary studies,
(c) design and preparation of construction, furniture and equipment contract
documents, (d) control and observation of the work, and (e) tabulating of final
construction costs. They retained architects, designated by the Ministry, to
provide, under their direct authority, the appropriate professional services.
The consultants' performance varied from institution to institution, depending
on the strength of the architects selected for individual project components;
poor detailing of joining of materials (e.g., at roof fascia), warping
of hung ceilings due to failure of the contractors to provide cured plywood,
and peeling of paint on fascia due either to poor workmanship or incorrect
specifications are elements which should have been better supervised. Design and
control of building systems were generally satisfactory, and in the case of
the design and specifications of electrical systems the consultants appear to
have made a significant contribution to the Ivorian construction industry.
2.06      Site improvement works proved costly because of the nature of the
sites selected, and varied from 11% to 38% of construction costs.   The
project architects subcontracted by the consultants should have been required
to carry out feasibility studies on alternative sites; seven out of nine sites
were acquired before the architects were retained. The siting of buildings
and respect for climatic conditions were satisfactory, but not enough atten-
tion was paid to protection of workshops against wind-driven rain while main-
taining effective natural ventilation.
2.07      The consultants were efficient in controlling the design and con-
struction time schedules. The lengthy delays were mainly due to finalization
of the educational specifications, subsequent review of plans by the Govern-
ment and the Bank, and the complex Government procedures concerning contract
approval.
2.08      The Loan Agreement did not require the Government to evaluate the
performance of the consultants, nor were their terms of reference detailed
enough in specifying the content of the required completion report. The
report they did present was available in draft form at the time of the Bank's
completion mission, but the information it provided was not well focused.
Design
2.09      Buildings were generally well planned and are functional and, in
most cases, have satisfied the present users. The main difficulties were in
(a) space norms for some dormitories, and (b) multipurpose rooms (whose func-
tions were to include dining and which were provided with cafeteria-type serv-
ing counters linked with the kitchens) recommended by the Bank with Government
concurrence. The multipurpose and self-service objectives were not accepted by
the users as they required modifications in school timetables and organization
of feeding arrangements which school staff were not prepared to carry out. The

plans did not provide space for storage of maintenance equipment. There was
some misjudgment in the routing of paths between buildings, complicated by the
addition of deep open-drainage ditches. The problems of drainage were grossly
underestimated; drainage work was subsequently reduced for cost reasons and
then had to be reintroduced at much greater cost to avoid flooding after con-
struction had been completed. The problem of enclosure of sites was not
satisfactorily resolved, and all landscaping was deleted as a cost-saving
measure.
The Contractors
2.10      The contractors were generally satisfactory and their work was
mostly completed on schedule. Contractors suffered from an initial shortage of
mobilization funds and the unnecessarily long Government payment processes.
Construction work was uneven in quality; it was good at the INSET and the
Lycee technique in Abidjan, it was less good at the Lyce'e technique in Bouake',
the Lycee des jeunes filles in Bingerville and at the ETV complex.
Furniture and Equipment
2.11      Furniture was procured at very reasonable prices but its quality was
poor. Drafting tables were not functional and many of the classroom tables
were too small for older students. There were some delays in equipment pro-
curement, but most users are very satisfied with what was achieved. Some
criticism has been made that the equipment for industrial training is too
sophisticated for the level of training for which it is intended.
Maintenance
2.12      The consultants were asked to prepare users' maintenance manuals,
which they did. They were not asked to draft an overall maintenance strategy;
If this had been done, early in design, it might have revealed weaknesses in
the specifications and prevented the deterioration being experienced with
plumbing fixtures, lighting fixtures and air-conditioning equipment. The
trade-offs between capital cost investment (quality of equipment and finishes)
and recurrent costs (cleaning, replacing) are best defined early in the design
process.
III. EDUCATIONAL RESULTS
General
3.01      The outcome of the Bank's first education project in the Ivory Coast
has been mixed. As regards technical education and vocational and agricultural
training, the project has permitted the Ivorian Government with assistance
from other donor agencies, particularly the UNDP and France, to introduce some
valuable and innovative reforms, whose major elements are (a) the focus on
training for employment rather than for the next level of education, (b) the



introduction of flexible modular-type training programs, and (c) the in-
volvement of employers in the operation and financing of the training process.
In the area of primary education, the provision of additional teacher train-
ing facilities has responded, although modestly, to urgent needs and
the project has provided functional facilities in which the new methods which
have been introduced can be practiced. The project's contribution to the
Ivory Coast's bold experiment in educational TV has been controversial; the
delays and errors in construction were such that (a) the Government had to
finance costly parallel facilities, many of which the users find more func-
tional than the Bank-financed complex, and (b) all the initial TV programs had
been completed before the complex came into use. The project has had a posi-
tive effect in helping to launch comprehensive evaluation studies which are
now beginning to provide information of value in determining the future develop-
ment of the ETV scheme. The general secondary component, which was designed
as a pilot scheme intended to lead to further investment in subsequent projects,
has only had a small impact in a quantitative sense. More importantly, it has
not had the influence that had been hoped for on improvement in efficiency of
school operation and hence a reduction in the rapidly increasing recurrent
costs. However, it has provided a standard for schools and the equipment needed
to provide the diversified curriculum which the recently approved National
Education Reform aims to introduce into Ivorian secondary education.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
3.02      Project Content and Objectives.  The project provided for the con-
struction and equipping of two secondary technical schools ("lyce'es tech-
niques") in Abidjan and Bouake', a vocational training center (Centre de
formation professionnelle") in Yopougon, a suburb of Abidjan, and a semi-
autonomous higher technical institute ("Institut national supe'rieur de
l'enseignement technique" -INSET) associated with the University of Abidjan.
The main objectives of these project elements were to increase the country's
capacity for the training of skilled workers, technicians and engineers, and
to help establish mechanisms of cooperation between employers and the tech-
nical education system.
3.03      Enrollments and Output.  At the secondary technical schools, the
project has provided the number of places planned at appraisal (2,145), con-
centrating technical training at Bouake' and commercial training at Abidjan.
Because greater demand was anticipated for the output from the technical
education courses, the capacity of the technical school at Bouake' was raised
to 1,255 and the capacity of the commercial school at Abidjan was reduced to
890. Present enrollments are 600 at Bouake and 550 at Abidjan, but these will
increase each year until the full capacity is used. Present enrollment at the
vocational training center in Yopougon is only 75 and is expected to build up
to about 120, representing half of the appraisal estimates. This reduction is
mainly caused by a change in training methods introduced after appraisal; it
was decided to establish two- and three-year full-time skill training programs



- 32 -
rather than the original short-duration accelerated training, and the avail-
able workshop equipment was not sufficient to cope with this change in program
structure. Enrollment at the INSET totalled about 400 in 1977: 230 in two-year
technician programs, 50 in five-year engineering programs, and 120 in various
upgrading courses, The SOCOTEC report indicates construction for 810. Enroll-
ments are expected to reach the appraisal estimate in 1980/81, when the 5-year
engineering programs will be fully enrolled.
3.04      Suitability and use of buildings and equipment.  The buildings are
generally well adapted to the requirements of technical/vocational training,
but there is a shortage of office space for teaching staff.  The INSET work-
shops and laboratories are particularly well designed and provide a great
deal of flexibility. Laboratory and workshop equipment is generally appro-
priate to Ivorian conditions, illustrating the importance of having competent
staff able to advise the architects at the crucial design phase -- a policy
being followed in the preparation of the technical education component of the
proposed third Bank project. At the Yopougon vocational center, certain
essential equipment could not be provided due to project cost overruns, thereby
reducing the training capecity in some workshops, while at the F7SET the
Government financed some additional euqipment. In som'e cases, equipment was
insufficiently specified for procurement and as a result certain machines
remained inoperative for long periods of time for lack of an accessory or
minor but essential parts. Problems also arose in the installation and test-
ing of major equipment; manufacturers should always be required to install
major equipment and train local staff in its use.
3.05      Programs.  Instructional timetables at the secondary technical
schools indicate a good balance between general education and professional
training; about two-thirds of the weekly schedule of 40 hours is spent on
technical training, of which about 15 hours comprise practical instruction in
workshop and laboratory. The traditional program structure is being modified
by the introduction of the "modular" training concept and the credit system
of examinations, both of which permit students a certain degree of flexibility
in entering the job market after only one or two years of training, and later
returning to school to complete a diploma course or obtain additional special-
ized training. The concepts introduced at these two schools on an experi-
mental basis will be applied more fully at the new "Lycees professionnels" to
be introduced throughout the Ivory Coast.
3.06      The training courses at the vocational center in Yopougon are de-
signed to train skilled workers in pre-employment programs and contain about
90% of practical instruction. Despite certain shortages of equipment and
training materials, graduates are well qualified: the first batch have had
no difficulty in finding suitable employment.
3.07      At the INSET, both the five-year degree courses and the two-year
diploma courses contain considerable amounts of practical work: up to 35%
for technical students and about 10% for commercial students.  Attachments to
industry or commerce during summer recess are obligatory; students are also
required to spend up to one year in practical work after graduation before



- 33 -
being awarded a diploma or degree. Employers maintain adequate contact with
the institute through their membership in the Board of Governors. The INSET
has had some difficulty recruiting secondary school leavers with adequate
background in mathematics and science for its engineering section and, as a
temporary measure, is offering one-year preparatory courses in these subjects.
3.08      Technical assistance - fellowships.  The project included funds for
17 fellowships of about 18 months each, to train lvorian teachers for the
urban vocational center. These funds were in fact sufficient to award 31
fellowships in technical education and vocational training; of these, 30 have
returned to the Ivory Coast and 29 are now employed in tasks directly relevant
to the training received. Twenty-two are in vocational training centers,
eight in secondary technical schools, and one is the director of an industrial
training center. Training of good quality was provided in the Ivory Coast at
the ANFPA_/ for 26 fellows, and at the "Cooperative artisanale" for two fellows.
In addition, three fellowship holders pursued higher level technical studies
and/or technical teacher training in France. The half man-year of technical
assistance provided for a planning study of vocational education was not needed,
as a UNDP/ILO project provided the necessary funds.
3.09      Internal efficiency and recurrent costs.  Student/teacher ratios
for the two secondary technical schools are about 14:1, slightly better than
the appraisal estimate of 12:1. The ratio at the vocational center in
Yopougon is only 8:1--which is below the appraisal figure of 12:1. This
low ratio could be improved by the purchase of additional workshop equipment,
which would allow a substantial increase in student intake without increasing
the teaching staff. Exact staffing figures for the INSET are not available
since many professors are part-time from industry, while full-time staff
generally have additional teaching responsibilities in other departments of
the university. Recurrent costs for technical/vocational training are high:
at the secondary level they vary from US$765 to US$1,750 per student per
year (excluding the cost of boarding and student allowances) and at the INSET
the cost is about US$3,900 per student per year. Generous student allowances
(as much as US$200 per month for post-secondary students) and boarding costs
(about US$600 per student per year) further contribute to the high recurrent
costs of technical education in the Ivory Coast.
3.10      Conclusions.  The first education project has acted as a catalyst
in the process of reform and development of technical education and vocational
training that has taken place in the Ivory Coast over the past five or six
years, and has helped to bring about two major structural changes: (a) in
vocational training, the involvement of employers in the operation and finan-
cing of the training process and the reorientation of the role of vocational
training centers in terms of specific job training or upgrading for workers
already employed in industry; and (b) in technical education, the introduction

- 34 -
of a new type of secondary technical school, called "lycees professionnels",
that focuses on training for employment rather than preparing students for
the next level of education. In this, there may be a lesson to be learned
of relevance to other West African countries. The Ivorian experience seems
to indicate a clear need for a formal structure (either within or separate
from existing Ministries of Education) in which technical education is closely
integrated with arrangements made for employer-supported vocational training.
Agricultural Training
3.11      Project content and objectives.  The appraisal report estimated annual
needs for agriculturally qualified personnel at about 40 professionals (to be
trained at an ENSA to be constructed with assistance from an European Develop-
ment Fund)l/, 50 agricultural technologists (who were also intended to be trained
at the ENSA) and 120 technicians. At that time the only training facility in the
Ivory Coast was the "Lycee agricole" in Bingerville, which was training about 50
technicians per annum.
3.12      The project was originally designed to allow for a progressive
transfer of the technician-level training to a more appropriate location at
Bouake (in terms of soil, climate and availability of farming land) and to
upgrade its curriculum to two years at the post-secondary level (compared
with the then existing training program of five years at post-BEPC level).
The pedagogical objectives were spelled out only briefly: students would
devote 90% of their time to courses directly related to agriculture; special-
ized training would be provided in agricultural, animal and forestry produc-
tion; slightly more than half the weekly schedule would be devoted to practi-
cal classes. A direct relationship would be established between the proposed
institute and the ENSA, and close collaboration would be maintained with
research stations and similar organizations in the area.
3.13      Programs.  There is some doubt as to the degree to which the Gov-
ernment had accepted these objectives at the time project implementation
began. In late 1974, however, the Ministry of Agriculture after lengthy
deliberations and consideration of two technical reports prepared by BDPA 2/
decided, with Bank approval and technical assistance from Caisse Centrale,
to create an Agricultural Technical Institute (IAB), using the buildings which
had just been completed at Bouake, for a training program, many features of
which were new to agricultural education in the Ivory Coast. They include
the following interesting elements:
(a)  Instruction is given in modules by practicing professionals
employed in development agencies; over 100 have already taken
part in the training, each passing on, through lectures and
field studies, his own experience. Resident staff at the
Institute organize the lectures and practical work, recruit
and brief the visiting instructors, animate the student groups
(remaining with their own group throughout its training period)
and provide overall pedagogical control and regular evaluation.

- 35 -
(b) Students are recruited either after being employed for five
years as APVA 1/ after professional competitive examination,
or from holders of the Baccalaureat who have undertaken theore-
tical and practical aptitude tests before entry.
(c) Training is directed toward specific needs and is largely
under the control of the employers, who attend regular seminars
to plan the following stage of the training program. Each
student is attached to the agency which will employ him, has
specific training objectives relating to his future work, and
spends much of his time during the training working for it.
(d) The training period totals 33 months: a 17-month integrated
program for all students, a one-month interval for orientation
into specialized training which lasts for 13 months, and a
final period of two months of adaptation to the work situation.
3.14      Enrollments and output.  Enrollment reached 198 in 1977 and is
scheduled to total 300 (100 per year) as soon as additional buildings, now
under construction, are completed. Enrollment will then exceed the appraisal
estimates by about 50, although the appraisal report envisaged an additional
30 places for in-service students who are not provided for under the present
program.
3.15      Suitability and use of buildings and equipment.  The buildings,
having been designed for the more traditional type of agricultural education,
had to be considerably modified for the new programs. Farm buildings were
temporarily converted into large classrooms, various adaptations were made to
create space for group instruction, other buildings were converted to provide
additional offices for resident and visiting teaching staff, and an audio-
visual center had to be equipped. Under the new program of construction, addi-
tional teaching accommodation designed for group learning is being provided.
3.16      Internal efficiency and recurrent costs.  It is too early to eval-
uate the internal efficiency of the Institute, as full enrollment has not
yet been achieved and the instructional methods do not lend themselves to
traditional estimations based on student/teacher ratios. Similarly, as
virtually all the resident teaching staff are expatriate and the major
teaching role is taken by part-time "intervenants" who occupy other posts,
calculation of recurrent costs proves difficult. However, the training is
expensive and in the year 1976 unit costs, excluding allowances to students
but including heavy expatriate teaching costs and based on an enrollment of
only 89, totalled some US$10,000 per student. As enrollments increase the
unit costs will be considerably reduced.
3.17      Conclusions.  This project component can be described as having been
partially successful. The existence of the buildings enabled the Government,
with other donor assistance, to implement a program for the training of
1/   Assistants des productions vegetale et animale.

"ingenieurs de travaux agricoles" badly needed by the agricultural industry
and without undue delay. It would have been more efficient to have obtained
Government support for such a program before rather than after construction
and thus saved expenditure in modifying the original buildings and then sub-
sequently having to add additional elements. Lessons for the future are to
be found in the difficulties subsequently encountered by the Institute in
(a) making user agencies separated from the Ministry of Agriculture aware of
the new pedagogic approaches and the importance of their full support, (b)
establishing the legal structure (eventually achieved 18 months after the
first student intake), (c) arranging the recruitment and training of Ivorian
staff, and (d) establishing agreements covering the financial participation
of user agencies. It shows that the introduction of educational innovations,
which break away from existing practice, is a time-consuming process which
requires maximum coordination between all interested parties. It can often
only be achieved, however, by the kind of positive action, the construction
of an institute, represents.
Primary Education
Educational Television
3.18      Project content and objectives.  The educational TV component of the
project has offered the biggest challenge. It has attracted international
attention and has produced the greatest difficulties in planning and implemen-
tation. It has been subject to the longest delays; the first discussions on
the introduction of educational TV took place in 1967, but the Bank's major
contribution--the ETV complex--did not become operational until 10 years
later.
3.19      Television was introduced as an educational medium in the Ivory
Coast as a result of the Government's dissatisfaction with its existing
primary education system (para. 1.02). It required considerable courage on
the part of the Government and even greater determination, as the problems
increased, to push forward what has become one of the world's most ambitious
educational reforms, involving a change in the content, teaching methods,
medium of instruction and classroom organization of the entire primary educa-
tion system. Few educational reforms have been developed with such strong
emphasis on integration of all the different elements; i.e., the television
transmissions, the printed supporting materials, and the initial and con-
tinuous in-service training of the teachers.
3.20      Progress in physical terms has been spectacular and can be measured
by reference to the following data:

Number of personnel employed
at the ETV complex                         58              over 500
3.21      At the beginning of the scheme, the Bank's role was decisive and its
contribution was expected to represent a major part of the total costs. Both
FAC (which eventually contributed the major part of the international assis-
tance) and the Ford Foundation (which originally intended to finance evaluation
but later withdrew) made their support for the scheme conditional on Bank par-
ticipation. A great deal of Bank manpower was invested in frequent missions
and planning meetings during the early stages of the scheme, and it was even-
tually agreed that the Bank would finance:
(a) a production center which became known as the Television Complex
at Bouake, including a senior primary teacher training college
(ENI) 1/ and a primary teaching training center (CAFOP) 2/;
(b)  a central maintenance building at Abidjan; this was subsequently
withdrawn from the project, as a private enterprise (CATEL) 3/
undertook this function;
(c) an additional primary teacher training center at Man (CAFOP);
(d) forty man-months of technical assistance for management; and
(e) four man-years of technical assistance for evaluation.
3.22      Initial identification by various Bank and Unesco missions accur-
ately determined the nature of the problems likely to be faced: management
and financing, staff training, quality of reception, and maintenance. But
the full extent of the difficulties which were to be faced could not be
appreciated at the time.

- 38 -
3.23      A scheme of such size and complexity (18 separate activities vary-
ing from data collection to teacher training) required management of a very
high caliber. Although the lesson has been learned, in many projects, that
rigid civil service structures are not appropriate for innovative development
schemes, the ETV program has been controlled throughout largely by educators
in the civil service, many of whom are not in total sympathy with the scheme.
The consultants selected for project technical assistance in management do
not appear to have been very successful, for reasons which are not clear;
their services were perhaps provided for too short a time to enable them to
make a major contribution. Pressure from the Bank for the appointment of a
director for the whole TV scheme was constant at the beginning; the Govern-
ment's reluctance was based on its belief that ETV represented only one aspect
of primary education and it did not wish to separate it from the rest. It was
not until 1972 that a Secretary of State in the Ministry of National Education
was appointed to be responsible for primary education and educational TV.
3.24      Suitability and use of the building and equipment.  Delays in con-
struction of the complex were so serious and eventual completion of construc-
tion so late that the principal objective, i.e., to provide facilities for
program production after the second year, was never achieved and the complex
did not become operational until all the initial programs had been produced
for the whole six-year primary cycle. There appears to have been an all-
around lack of technical know-how because of the innovative nature of the
project, typified by constant changes in planning as new, short-term consult-
ants gave conflicting advice as to the best way in which to resolve problems;
deciding on the routing of the cables in the complex took many months of
difficult study. Because of the delays the Government was forced to incur
substantial capital expenditure in expanding the existing television produc-
tion center before the new complex was ready.
3.25      Many of the users are critical of the complex.  Recording studios
are not properly soundproofed, there are major acoustical problems including
an air-conditioning system which gives off vibrations and noises that are
proving difficult to control, and storage facilities, for decor, were built
too close to other working areas and not secured against the entry of rain-
water. The teacher training facilities provided for the proposed ENI-CAFOP
are not well adapted to the needs of the other institutions (CNFP and CSTE -
para. 3.36) which have now been established there instead. The classrooms
are too large and the dormitories, one block of which has been converted
into offices (largely for ETV personnel), are not designed for the age group
using them.
3.26      Internal efficiency and recurrent costs.  The justification of
financing the complex was based on the reduced costs per primary school leaver
expected from improvements in internal efficiency resulting from televised
instruction. Although it is too early to judge the impact on student years
per completer, it is likely that savings projected in 1969 were over-
optimistic. Capital expenditures have been far higher than expected; the
recurrent unit costs of television production have dropped as coverage has
increased to a larger number of units, but increases in teacher salaries after



- 39 -
1975 are expected to more than offset reductions in television production
costs. The cost per student year of instruction assisted by television was
about CFAF 36,000 in 1975 versus CFAF 26,400 in traditional instruction (in
1975 prices). The appraisal report projected that total cost per student year
in 1980 would be CFAF 30,000 per student (all figures adjusted to 1975 prices)
and that the cost of ETV would represent CFAF 2,400, or 8% of the total cost.
Current projections indicate that the cost will be CFAF 44,200 (1975 prices)
with ETV costs representing CFAF 5,800, or 13% of the total cost. Total
recurrent costs of the ETV scheme are expected to be CFAF 4.1 billion in
1980 versus CFAF 1.4 billion estimated at the time of appraisal.
3.27      The major shortcoming of the projections was their assumption that
ETV, coupled with other institutional and curricula reforms, would dramatic-
ally reduce the number of student-years per primary school completer. The
appraisal projected a reduction from 16.5 to 5.5 student-years required per
completer (i.e., students would be expected to reach academic standards re-
quired for the primary school-leaving certificate in five years, instead of
the prevailing six plus an additional 10.5 student years of repeaters and
dropouts). The appraisal overlooked the fact that the high repeater rate in
the 6th grade operates as a safety valve to reduce social pressures for entry
in secondary school. Hence lowering it will be more the result of a policy
decision than of improved educational quality. In fact, however, some 93%
of pupils entering the ETV system now reach the 6th grade (1976-77), compared
with 86% for the primary system as a whole.
3.28      Other assumptions regarding savings in teacher costs have not been
borne out. The projections assumed that unqualified teachers would be up-
graded, but they have tended to be phased out, and that the major reliance
would be on less costly "instituteurs adjoints" rather than "instituteurs".
However, training programs have resulted in a doubling of the proportion of
"instituteurs" from 15 to 32% of the primary teaching force.
3.29      Evaluation.  The Bank's contribution to the evaluation of ETV has
been valuable. The project provided four man-years of technical assistance,
which allowed for the appointment of two evaluation coordinators; one assisted
in the conception of the program during a one-year stay in the Ivory Coast
from 1972 to 1973 and the other succeeded him for two years and took a major
part in the assembly of an international team and the organization of their
work. In one aspect his work was particularly successful. The evaluation
unit recruited and trained in evaluation techniques several Ivorian experts
and a network of some 120 "conseillers pe'dagogiques" able to participate com-
petently in the field surveys which the various evaluation studies required.
No other unit of the ETV program has such a high proportion of Ivorian staff.
International assistance came principally from three external sources: (a)
Belgium for pedagogical evaluation, (b) the Federal Republic of Germany for
technical and economic evaluation and for evaluation of management, and (c)
the United States for certain aspects of the pedagogical evaluation, economic
evaluation and evaluation of the out-of-school TV programs for adults.



- 40 -
3.30      Much difficulty was incurred in undertaking certain elements of the
technical evaluation because of the lack of scientific tools with which to
judge the effectiveness of ETV transmissions and the support materials as
separate aids to education. A study is being carried out at present, however,
on the readability of the support materials. Management evaluation proved
difficult from the beginning. Experts found themselves either having to take
part in management to fill existing gaps and thus have no time for evaluation,
or attempt to stay at a distance from the day-to-day management problems and
thus lose touch with the real issues. The main work in this area was carried
out by the "Unite de traitement d'information"-IUT (which later became known
as the DOGE 1/ and then the SCOGE 2/) by doing the first analysis of the
accounts and organizing budgeting and procurement. On the basis of this work
a number of useful economic evaluation studies have been completed (Annex 16).
3.31      The first results of the pedagogical evaluation were produced re-
cently, but suffer from not including comparisons between traditional and
ETV learning systems. If such studies had been carried out, lessons would
have been learned which would have been of great value not only to the Ivory
Coast but also to many other countries contemplating the launching of similar
schemes. If the evaluation had shown clear benefits from ETV, much of the
criticism presently directed at it by parents could have been rebutted. As
it is, the first results have been described as "not what had been hoped for".
It has become apparent that, among the causes of this situation, it is the
inadequacy of the training of teachers which is by far the most important.
Much greater individual initiative will be required by teachers in the future
in adapting their methods to the new medium. The results indicate that at
least half of the pupils are reaching a reasonable standard in the main sub-
jects covered.
3.32      Conclusions.  The Bank's contribution to ETV building complex has
been of questionable value, but the Bank-financed evaluation work has been
useful. In the early stages, when the Bank's participation in ETV was con-
sidered as crucial, a great deal of Bank manpower was invested in frequent
missions and planning meetings. After signature of the Loan Agreement, how-
ever, its involvement became much less; the Bank's only technically qualified
expert undertook only six missions during the seven-year implementation
period. The "Club d'Abidjan", to which all donors belonged and which meets
annually, became virtually a "Board of Directors" for the scheme. The Bank
participated only as an observer at some meetings of the Club since it felt that
the Loan Agreement with the Government had defined its position on this com-
ponent and it could use its limited resources better to maintain a direct
dialogue with the Government through supervision missions. However, at each
step in the implementation of the ETV program it proved necessary to hold
lengthy discussions with all the interested parties, which contributed to

delays in implementation of the Bank project component. The Bank might have
had a more effective role as a full member of the "Club d'Abidjan". Moreover,
the size of the Bank's investment in relation to the total cost declined; by
1976 its contribution represented only some 2% of the total costs incurred on
ETV. It would therefore seem advisable, when an investment is made in an
innovative project component of this degree of complexity and risk. that (a)
the Bank commitment should be large enough and continue for long enough to
give the Bank the opportunity of participating actively in implementation
(b) supervision should be carried out regularly by personnel with the appro-
priate specialized qualifications needed and (c) before implementation begins,
there should be agreement on policy between all parties including the Govern-
ment and co-donors.
Primary Teacher Training
3.33      In 1967, only 55% of the 8,800 primary teachers in the Ivory Coast
had received training. There were then seven primary teacher colleges with
an annual output of 700 teachers ("instituteurs adjoints"). It was estimated
that it would be necessary to increase output to about 980 by 1975 and the
project therefore included provision for construction of a new college at
Man 1/ with an enrollment of 240 pre-service students (plus 30 places for
in-service training). An existing college would be replaced by inclusion of
new facilities for a teacher training complex at Bouake linked with the pro-
posed ETV production center. This complex was to include a college with 150
places and a senior college with places for 210 students to be trained as
senior primary teachers ("instituteurs") and 30 places for the upgrading of
this cadre of staff, some of whom would become headmasters and pedagogic
advisers. This complex was also to undertake research and act as the focal
point for the new television teaching techniques.
3.34      Over the years of project implementation, however, the demand
became much greater than the proposed increased supply and there were changes
in the teacher training policy of the Government and in the use to which the
facilities provided under the project were put.
3.35      The college at Man is now open and is making its contribution to
the total demand, but there is some debate as to whether such a large college
with an enrollment of 270 students is appropriate because of difficulties in
arranging enough demonstration classes without totally disrupting the work
of the primary schools in the surrounding area.
3.36      Furthermore, by the time the new combined ETV complex and teacher
training center at Bouake' had been completed, the Government had become so
concerned about the problem of in-service training and support of teachers
already in the field to help them use the new medium correctly (para. 3.31),
that it had created two new institutions: (a) the "Centre national de
formation permanente" (CNFP), which is designed to train and provide in-service
1/   The normal CAFOP has an enrollment of 140 to 150.



- 42 -
courses for inspectors, regional advisers and college teachers, and is con-
centrating on distance training through television transmissions, in-service
training programs and the publication of an educational journal; (b) the
"Centre de spe'cialisation en technologie educative" (CSTE), which is for the
training of technicians, for both educational TV and the general use of audio-
visual aids in the educational system. No provision had been made, however,
for their accommodation and the Ministry of Primary Education and Educational
TV decided to use the facilities of the complex for this purpose rather than
for the senior college originally envisaged.
3.37      There is a certain amount of justification for this action in view
of the importance of in-service training for the cadres of staff concerned
and doubts as to the wisdom of the original decision to site a college at
the ETV complex. Because of the uniqueness of this situation, such a college
could not be duplicated in other parts of the Ivory Coast. Similarly, the
original plans for the senior college included the training of pedagogical
advisers and other senior primary school staff in three-year program (after
BEPC); but these plans had to be changed because of opposition from the
teachers' union, and an interim program to enable "instituteurs adjoints"
to be promoted to "instituteurs" posts was introduced but only for the
relatively insignificant number of 70 per year.
3.38      Plans drawn up for the first year of the CSTE-CNFP training programs
indicated that the facilities at the complex would be underutilized (Annex 12)
and would need modification. The classrooms are too large, certain dormitory
accommodation has had to be changed into offices, and the remaining dormito-
ries are not designed for the age group using them. However, the use of the
facilities is increasing and it is likely that a satisfactory rate of utiliza-
tion will be reached.
3.39      Conclusions.  This project component has made a small contribution
to the need for increased numbers of trained primary teachers by providing
facilities for their training at Man. The facilities at Bouake provide a
home for two equally important institutions, CSTE and CNFP. The latter
is carrying out certain of the research functions which were envisaged at
appraisal.
Secondary Education
3.40      The Government originally requested the Bank to finance the con-
struction of a number of secondary schools, but the appraisal mission found
these too difficult to justify on manpower grounds and expressed reservations
about the relevance of the curricula. It recommended changes in the first
cycle of secondary education to provide (a) a broad practical and scientific
base to prepare students for further training in industry, agriculture and
services (specific reference was made to the need for inclusion of a substan-
tial element of practical science and workshop practice); (b) close coopera-
tion with the UNDP-financed pedagogical research center on curricula and
teaching methods; and (c) enrollments carefully planned for optimum utiliza-
tion of teachers and spaces. As a pilot scheme in which these new approaches



- 43 -
could be introduced, the project included construction of two secondary
schools:  a "College d'enseignement general" at Tiassale (490 places, includ-
ing 240 boarders) and a Lyce'e de jeunes filles" at Bingerville (940 places
of which 850 boarding). A third school, at Yamoussoukro, was later omitted
from the project. The two schools are now in operation with enrollments of
630 (240 boarders) and 820 (420 boarders), respectively. The school buildings
(with the exception of the dormitory facilities) are functional and among the
best equipped in the country; they are appreciated by the users. Difficulty
has been encountered in recruiting certain specialized staff and in finding
funds for the equipping of the language laboratories and the purchase of
consumable materials.
3.41      Programs.  During the lengthy implementation period, the Pedagogical
Research Institute 1/ has been strengthened and discussion has taken place in
connection with the preparation of a national education reform (approved in
mid-1977), but no action has been taken so far to amend the secondary curric-
ulum to give it the broad practical and scientific base considered necessary
to prepare students for further training in industry and agriculture. The
four man-years of technical assistance provided for improvement in the super-
vision of the teaching of sciences, mechanics, electricity and industrial
arts were not used; but the additional inspectorate staff which the Government
agreed to recruit were appointed, using Government funds. Action was also
taken by the Government on the recruitment for the teaching of commercial
studies and building construction.
3.42      The project included four man-years of technical assistance for a
survey of methods to improve the utilization of existing schools and to advise
on future school locations; it was hoped to optimize school sizes, thus maxi-
mizing the utilization of specialized staff and spaces and minimizing the need
for boarding and staff housing. The two experts recruited for these tasks
were not familiar with the Ivorian education system and often found themselves
called upon to undertake other tasks; they were handicapped by their inability
to obtain Ivorian counterparts and the limited availability of funds for field
travel.
3.43      The architect employed to advise on future school locations, how-
ever, laid the foundations for the preparation of detailed secondary school
inventories which were completed under the second project.
3.44      The expert selected to advise on improvements in the efficiency of
the system produced a report which highlighted some of the weaknesses but made
few recommendations for improvement. He noted how little time was spent by
students in secondary education; most schools operated for only five hours a
day and there was a considerable difference in the number of hours between
the different levels. He estimated that, taking into account the late start
and early finish of the academic year and the numerous public and other holi-
days, a secondary-level student in the Ivory Coast received about 100 hours
1/   Now known as the "Sous-direction pour l'animation et la recherche
pedagogique".



- 44 -
less mathematics per annum than his counterpart in France. The report under-
lined the relative neglect of science and the inadequacy of science laboratory
facilities. The teaching of technology was handicapped by a shortage of
teachers and facilities.
3.45      Provision was also made for fellowships for the headmasters of
secondary-level institutions being financed under the project, to help them
increase the efficiency of their administration, but these funds were not used
because the administrators and teaching staff were hostile to some of the ad-
ministrative changes under consideration.
3.46      Teacher supply. The Government undertook, at appraisal, to step
up the output of trained secondary school teachers for the first cycle to at
least 110 per annum from 1973; this rate of output was not achieved, however,
until 1976.
3.47      Conclusions.  The two new schools are functional and appreciated.
Their design corresponds to the needs of a recently approved education reform.
The Bank has had limited success in persuading the Government to bring about
reforms at the secondary level to stem the rapidly increasing recurrent cost
burden of education.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
4.01      The total project cost was estimated at appraisal at US$19.1 mil-
lion (at an exchange rate of CFAF 278 to the US dollar), of which the loan
of US$11.0 million was intended to finance 58%. In October 1971, when the
loan was renegotiated, the funds saved by the withdrawal of one of the general
secondary schools were used to help finance cost overruns and the Government also
agreed to the cancellation of the amount remaining in the category for the payment
of interest and other charges on the loan. The supplementary loan signed in 1975
provided an additional US$2.2 million. However, total costs reached US$33.o0 million
(at an exchange rate of CFAF 240 to the US dollar) when the costs of altera-
tions and additional works carried out on several project institutions were
included. Therefore, the Bank contribution of US$13.2 million eventually
represented only about 40% of the total project costs. The costs of the
project during the various stages of its evolution are detailed by category in
Annex 3.
4.02      The causes of the very large cost increases (2-1/2 times above
the appraisal estimates when expressed in CFAF terms) have been outlined in
earlier chapters of this report. The principal causes relate to the lengthy
delays in project implementation during a period of rapid inflation, exacer-
bated by earlier indecision concerning educational specifications and the
subsequent need to carry out substantial supplementary work (amounting in the
case of the secondary school in Bingerville to 40% of costs) to compensate
for earlier cost-cutting or to remedy design deficiencies. Price escalation
averaged 35% and supplementary work 17% of construction contracts by the time
the project was completed.



- 45 -
4.03      The cost of civil works exceeded appraisal estimates by 140%; that
for furniture and equipment by 112%.
4.04      The construction costs (building plus site work) per square meter
varied from US$204 at the "Lycee technique" in Bouake' to US$404 at the ETV
complex; these unit construction costs in general compare favorably wit1 a
typical CEG 1/ built for the Ministry of Education in 1977 for US$248/m
(which included minimum site improvements).
4.05      Construction (buildings and site) cost per student place made avail-
able ranged from a low of US$1,980 (CEG in Tiassale) to a high of US$5,155
(CAFOP in Man). However, because of under-utilization of dormitories, the
construction cost per enrolled student rises to a high of US$8,167 (INSET).
4.06      The record of disbursements on the project (Annex 9) reflects the
delays in project implementation and also delays on the part of Government
in claiming reimbursement after completion of work. By mid-1974 when the
project should have been fully disbursed, only 10% of the funds had been
claimed. The major expenditures did not take place until late 1975.

The appraisal report forecast that the design phase would begin late 1969 to early 1970.  In fact, design did not start until
18 months later; causes of this important initial delay were (a) procedures and negotiations with SOCOTEC and between SOCOTEC
and the design architects (b) lengthy discussions regarding the architectural concept of the educational TV center and (c)
changed user requirements.  The calendar spans the period from start of sketches to completion of construction.
