boilers (IB) designs; b) the mass production and\n            marketing of the improved boiler models; and c) the broad\n            dissemination of more energy efficient and clearer IB\n            technologies. The project will be composed of the following\n            components: a) upgrading of existing Chinese boiler models;\n            b) adoption of new high efficiency boiler models; c)\n            technical assistance and training for boiler producers and\n            consumers; and d) monitoring, evaluation and project management."}, "docdt": "1996-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
