The\n            project has been designed to: (a) increase MWSS's water\n            production capacity; (b) provide 15 cubic meters per second\n            of water for an additional population of 3 million persons;\n            (c) expand the distribution system to increase service\n            coverage to 75 percent by 1994, particularly in poor\n            neighborhoods; (d) improve the efficiency of MWSS's\n            operations; and (e) strengthen MWSS's finances as well\n            as its planning and management information systems. The\n            project would be cofinanced by the Asian Development Bank\n            (ADB) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF)."}, "docdt": "1989-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
