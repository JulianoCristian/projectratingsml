Optimization Project\n            in the Philippines. The main objective of the project was to\n            provide water supply in the National Capital Region to\n            fulfil the expected demand until the year 2000. Bank's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (a) the Bank should carefully evaluate the\n            institution's capabilities to undertake programs that\n            have a direct bearing on the achievement of project\n            objectives; (b) while the borrower may agree during\n            negotiations to increase tariffs, the decision can be\n            affected by public resistance due to poor levels of service,\n            as well as political issues outside the agency's\n            control; (c) administrative problems including the failure\n            to reduce distribution losses, caused Metropolitan\n            Waterworks and Sewerage System's( MWSS) debt burden to\n            substantially increase during the past five years; (d) as an\n            alternative to using the rate of return covenant to measure\n            satisfactory financial performance of a water supply and\n            sewerage utility where assets are mainly underground, out of\n            sight and difficult to value, an acceptable measure is the\n            agency's contribution to investment from internal\n            resources; and (e) close monitoring yielded early warning of\n            potential problems and appropriate sector work supported by\n            the highest level of Bank management enabled significant and\n            timely institutional reform to ensure sustainability of\n            project benefits."}, "docdt": "1996-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
