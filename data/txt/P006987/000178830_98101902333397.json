Project will\n            improve the operational efficiency and the financial\n            situation of CEA, and would enable the Dominican Republic to\n            sustain its present level of exports while meeting the\n            projected increase of domestic sugar consumption. The\n            project includes four components: (a) rehabilitation of the\n            sugar mills at Ozama, Rio Haina, Boca Chica, Consuelo,\n            Quisqueya and Barahona; (b) rehabilitation of a total of\n            about 540 km of railway track at the above mills, except for\n            Barahona and the purchase of 150 hauling cars, three\n            locomotives, telecommunications equipment, an initial stock\n            of spare parts and a fully-equipped railcar repair shop; (c)\n            carrying out of irrigation and drainage studies at Barahona\n            estate, a cane area reduction program concurrent with the\n            increase of yields in the cane areas, two pilot research\n            programs, one for the mechanization of land preparation and\n            harvesting and one for payment to outgrowers based on\n            grading cane according to its sucrose content, and (d)\n            provision of technical services to assist CEA in improving\n            its management information system, operational and\n            administrative planning, and personnel administration and\n            training and its overall organization."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
