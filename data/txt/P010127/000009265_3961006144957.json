The\n            Bank's performance remained excellent throughout the\n            project implementation period. The performance of the\n            International Development Association (IDA) was generally\n            satisfactory throughout the implementation of the project.\n            Problems with local and international contractors and\n            paucity of local funds caused further major delays. As\n            regards the Bank, the main lessons to be learned are that:\n            (a) efficient agricultural support services should be\n            provided to make investment in irrigation and drainage\n            effective; (b) meaningful agro-economic evaluation is\n            possible only if the baseline survey carried out prior to\n            project start is supplemented by regular follow-up surveys.\n            Even though the project was the first in the subsector\n            assisted by IDA in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP),\n            the chief implementing agency had already established a good\n            working relationship with IDA under other projects. This\n            relationship continued throughout implementation.\n            Documentation on file indicates the frustration shared by\n            senior management of the Water and Power Development\n            Authority (WAPDA) and IDA regarding the poor performance of\n            contractors. IDA, the Canadian International Development\n            Agency (CIDA) and the consultants worked in good harmony to\n            eventually resolve most of the problems occurred."}, "docdt": "1994-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
