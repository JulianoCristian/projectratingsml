The Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, partly due to the high turnover of project\n            coordinators; mostly, because of failure to correct major\n            deficiencies in financial, and institutional management.\n            Most significant, were the supervision deficiencies in\n            procurement, revealing non-compliance with procurement\n            practices, and inadequate contract management, and awards.\n            Similarly, the lack of critical attention by the Borrower,\n            in monitoring financial management, coupled with poor\n            inter-governmental communication, was conducive to an\n            unsatisfactory performance. The lessons highlight the fact\n            that major deficiencies in performance regarding financial\n            management, and procurement, stem from the lack of rigorous\n            selection practices, indicating it is imperative to appoint\n            staff with excellent track record in financial management,\n            and procurement. Likewise, the deficient performance of the\n            financial consultant - who also performed as the\n            implementing agency project manager - indicate not only the\n            need to ensure financial management capability, but identify\n            the function as uniquely one. Furthermore, the premature\n            lack of counterpart funds, suggest the need for long-term\n            resource mobilization, and allocation strategies for\n            agricultural research, and development projects, including\n            as well, diversification of funding sources."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
