                         The development objective of the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project (PSFMRS) is to enhance governance, particularly in the public
                         financial management domain, through: i) strengthening the institutional capacity of key agencies to more effectively and efficiently use public resources; and
                         ii) improving accountability in the use of public resources.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Most of the activities planned for 2010 under the budget management and public accountability and oversight components have progressed well.

                         A new format was developed for the 2011-2014 BDD cycle, 2011 program budgets were prepared by the six pilot ministries, new forms and methodology to produce budget execution
                         reports were elaborated, public awareness events and study tours were undertaken. The BDD document establishes the Medium-term budget framework with allocating multi-year
                         ministerial budget ceilings based on Government priorities formulated in the ministerial Medium Term Action Plans.

                         The Chamber of Control developed and endorsed its new financial audit methodology - a significant step forward consistent with international best practice including INTOSAI
                         auditing standards and represents a solid foundation for the CCG's future audit activities. The CCG's recent recruitment of 25 or so staff from international audit international audit
                         networks who are familiar with audit methodologies such as the CCG's new financial audit methodology will greatly increase the chances of its successful implementation. With
                         assistance from the Swedish National Audit Office, the Chamber also launched a detailed feasibility study to define its ICT infrastructure and software development needs. The study
                         will be the basis for the development of proper ICT infrastructure and building technical capacity to ensure successful operation of auditing and work-flow management software
                         solutions.

                         Implementation of the treasury and budget execution component has been slower than planned. The modified cash-based public sector accounting standards were finalized, albeit
                         with some delays, and provided to the pilot organizations that are expected to produce FY10 financial statements in modified cash IPSAS. The Treasury has launched mobilization of
                         international consultancy to assist with preparation of IPSAS training methodology and planning for the roll-out trainings on the above standards for all central spending units.

                         The Financial Analytical Service (FAS), established by the Ministry in April, 2010 to ensure proper support for existing/new information systems, and strengthen the information and
                         communication technology, have been developing several application software solutions that are currently operational (fully or partially) to automate existing/new PFM practices.
                         These include: improving existing Treasury information system to support new functional requirements which emerged after the restructuring of Treasury in late 2009; developing a
                         new web-based e-Treasury software has been developed to support the operations of spending units; developing a new interface with the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
                         system of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) for automation of payments in local currency; introducing a web-based e-Budget software for the preparation of state budget at the
                         central level (around 30 ministries/agencies are connected). 2011 budget has been consolidated through this system; developing e-Auction module to support government property
                         management, HRMIS to support staff registry and personnel management functions, e-Document to support work-flow management for the MoF.

                         As of April 25, 2011 total of USD 8.95 million has been disbursed by all development partners against the project of which IDA's share is USD 360,000 (4%).
