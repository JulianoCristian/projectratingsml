                         ii) improving accountability in the use of public resources.

                         The activities planned for 2011 under project have progressed well.

                         2012 State Budget was prepared in the new program budget based format as per the Program Budget Methodology endorsed by the Ministerial Decree. Trainings and consultations
                         on the new methodology were offered to the line ministries throughout the budget preparation process. The Law on 2012 State Budget was approved by the Parliament on

                         December 9, 2011. The new program based structure provides for more flexibility to the spending units in terms of managing their respective resource allocations. At the same time,
                         the new format allows for more transparency as the State Budget is accompanied by several information annexes, including: Basic Data and Directions for 2012-2015, expected
                         results and performance indicators as per the programs defined, information on capital projects included in 2012 budget, and information on budget entities in charge of administering
                         programs and sub-programs, and respective resource allocations.

                         The Academy of the MoF was established to offer continuous professional development and training opportunities to the MoF and other government staff in the areas of budgeting,
                         taxation, accounting, financial management, public and municipal management and finance. Investments are underway to furnish and equip the Academy classes and purchase
                         literature and subscriptions for its library.

                         Implementation of the treasury and budget execution component has picked up the pace over the past six months. International consultancy was mobilized to assist with preparation
                         of IPSAS training methodology and planning for the roll-out trainings on the above standards for all central spending units. The training of trainers program has been launched.

                         Following the independent assessment of the MoF's current application software solutions supporting financial management practices, the Ministry decided to cancel the ICB process
                         for the implementation of an integrated PFMIS solution and benefit from the application software solutions to be developed and integrated by the Financial Analytical Service (FAS)
                         of the Ministry. Project funds have been reallocated to support capacity building of the FAS staff and necessary investments in their ICT infrastructure. Respective procurements are
                         underway.

                         Contracts for supplying IT equipment for the State Procurement Agency are ongoing.

                         The Chamber of Control mobilized consulting firm to assist with building the capacity and improve performance of its audit staff in applying the new Financial Audit Manual. The
                         training program for the CCG auditors was delivered and the certification of the successful trainees conducted.
                         Contract for supplying IT equipment to the CCG is underway, building on the ICT infrastructure and software development needs study carried out with assistance from Swedish
                         National Audit Office.

                         As of December, 2011 total of USD 8.95 million has been disbursed by all development partners against the project of which IDA's share is USD 360,000 (4%). Significant portion of
                         these funds have already been utilized and/or committed with only about 17.8 % remaining uncommitted.
