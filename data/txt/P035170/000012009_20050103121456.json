The following are some lessons\n            of experience. While strong ownership was demonstrated early\n            on, demonstrated by the implementation of major reforms,\n            commitments however, particularly to the sector financial\n            health, waned as the project progressed, resulting in an\n            incomplete reform program. Tariff reform must recognize\n            political economy realities, and must incorporate a\n            sensible, financeable transition subsidy scheme so that full\n            cost recovery, and therefore sustainability of\n            restructuring, can be achieved. Furthermore, reforms need to\n            be institutionalized, putting a burden on capacity building\n            for successor operating entities, and new agencies like the\n            regulatory commission. Regulatory effectiveness is critical,\n            as is independence - in analysis, funding, decision-making -\n            important in building legitimacy among stakeholders. Power\n            sector reforms have important links to broader state fiscal\n            policy initiatives, and each should support the other, while\n            investment programs need to be well prepared and implemented\n            in a way that integrates good financial, and contractor\n            management with social and environmental safeguards."}, "docdt": "2004-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
