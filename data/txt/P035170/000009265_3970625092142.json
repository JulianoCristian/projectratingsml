Issues that have been addressed during the\n            conceptual design of the project are: 1) resettlement and\n            rehabilitation; 2) transmission line rights of way and\n            substation site impacts on land use (agriculture, forest\n            areas, wetlands, wildlands); 3) access roads in remote\n            areas, increase in hunting, exploitation of forest\n            resources, induced development due to new access corridors,\n            human settlement and more extensive clearing; 4) clearing\n            (erosion, loss of habitat) and control of vegetation in\n            rights of ways, including mechanical and chemical clearing\n            operations; 5) erosion during construction, and along access\n            roads, substation and transmission tower sites; 6) potential\n            electromagnetic frequency radiation effects, radio noise and\n            television interference; and &) public access to\n            substations, towers and electrocution hazards, proximity to airports."}, "docdt": "1995-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
