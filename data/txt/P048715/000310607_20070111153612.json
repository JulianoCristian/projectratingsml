This is especially\n            important for new agencies implementing the Bank's\n            project for the first time; 4) from the Science and\n            Technology Network of the Agency for the Assessment and\n            Application of Technology (IPTEKnet)'s recent efforts\n            to expand into the provinces, it became ever clearer that\n            the Government of Indonesia (GOI) needs connectivity\n            throughout the country, not just Jakarta. ; 5) continuity in\n            the Bank's project team and the Coordinating Project\n            Management Implementation Unit (CPMIU) can be critical for\n            satisfactory project implementation; 6) pilot projects\n            should have a clear methodology in place for scaling up and\n            assessing viability for replication, and be backed by\n            effective implementation and enforcement of policies and\n            laws; 7) increasingly, the convergence of ICT services and\n            markets necessitates a corresponding convergence of\n            institutional authority to deal with the sector and to make\n            most effective use of limited supply of high-caliber\n            regulatory professionals; and 8) a systematic set of\n            indicators should be agreed upon and established to monitor\n            and evaluate both implementation of e-development projects\n            and their impact on sector development."}, "docdt": "2004-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
