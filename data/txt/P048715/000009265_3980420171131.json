There are five\n            components. The The first involves improving the legal and\n            regulatory framework by providing advisory services,\n            training, and equipment to prepare laws and regulations on\n            intellectual property rights; carries out policy studies,\n            trains staff, and strengthens the policy or institutional\n            capacities of the state secretariat; improves the copyright,\n            patent, and trademark directorate, as well as the national\n            development planning agency. The second component enhances\n            the efficiency and effectiveness of researchers by expanding\n            the science and technology network. The third component,\n            having two sub-components, strengthens the legal and\n            regulatory framework to promote private sector participation\n            in postal services; and extends tourist information services\n            to the regions by developing the business model and pilot\n            projects for an electronic tourism information system. The\n            fourth and fifth components provide technical assistance and\n            training to promote private participation and IT service\n            delivery, and project management assistance, respectively."}, "docdt": "1997-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
