I. ENERGY SECTOR!,
Introduction
1.01      China is well endowed in primary energy.  It is the fourth largest
producer of commercial energy after the United States, the Soviet Union and
Saudi Arabia. Output of commercial energy is one-fifth of US and one-third of
USSR. Coal and lignite reserves are estimated at over 600 billion tons. At
the present rate of consumption these reserves are adequate for more than a
thousand years. Annual hydro potential is estimated at 1,900 billion kWh,
against the present hydro generation of 58 billion kWh and overall power
generation potential of 300 billion kWh. Official estimates of oil and gas
reserves are not available. Unofficial estimates, however, place the
recoverable reserves of oil at 1.8-2.5 billion tons, and of natural gas, both
associated and non-associated, at about 130 billion cubic meters (equivalent
to over 110 million tons of oil). From the review of the sedimentary basins,
the ultimate recoverable reserves of oil are estimated to be in the range of
12 to 20 billion tons. In addition, the reserves of oil shales are reported
to be of the order of about 400 billion tons. For a number of reasons,
including logistics, substantial investment requirements and long gestation
period needed for developing coal and hydro potential, the relative share of
coal and hydro power in the overall energy balance is not anticipated to
increase significantly over the next ten years.
1.02      China's achievement in developing its energy resources, over the last
three decades has been impressive. Production of coal has increased from
little over 60 million tons in 1952 to 620 million tons in 1981. During the
same period, power generating capacity increased from a little less than 2000
MW to 67,000 MW. Oil production increased from about 0.1 million tons in 1950
to 106 million tons by 1979. Output of oil fell marginally to about 101
million tons in 1981. This rapid pace of development has pushed China into
the rank of the third largest consumer of commercial energy in the world,
behind USA and the Soviet Union, but ahead of Japan.
1.03      China's global pre-eminence as a producer and consumer of commercial
energy notwithstanding, its consumption pattern is more analogous to a
developing country where a large proportion of the population continues to
rely upon non-commercial sources (plant residue and animal power) for meeting
its energy requirements. Consumption per capita is about 650 kilograms of
coal equivalent (kgce), which is slightly above the average for developing

countries (620 kgce). In fact, China's energy sector is a curious amalgam of
the traditional and the modern and of advanced technologies and inefficient
practices. The future prospects remain uncertain, and while the probability
for retaining self-sufficiency in energy remains high throughout the eighties,
it is doubtful if China would be able to sustain the rate of growth it
achieved over the last two decades. Major oilfields have peaked and entered
into a declining phase. No new discoveries have been made in a magnitude to
offset this decline. Rapid expansion of coal industry faces intractable
problems in terms of investment, location and transportation. Remoteness of
major hydro potential sites from the centers of consumption and the long
gestation period, precludes hydropower share from increasing significantly
beyond its present level within the first half of the 1980's.

Resource Endowment
1.05     The major existing and potential sources of primary energy are
indicated below:
(a) Coal
1.06     Coal is China's traditional source of energy and at present caters to
nearly 70% of its demand for commercial energy. The output of raw coal in
1981 was about 620 million tons, a level surpassed only by USA and IJSSR. The
coal and lignite reserves are concentrated largely in the north and northeast,
and represent about 70% of the total recoverable reserves in China (600
billion tons). In terms of production also, the north and northeast account
for 70% of the total national output and the south, with production level of
15%, remains coal deficient. About 75% of coal production comes from large
mines with more than 0.6 million tons annual capacity. The small mines (1000-
100,000 tons annual capacity), over 20,000 in number, are rudimentary
underground operations and the productivity is extremely poor. The output of
the small mines goes essentially for meeting local commercial and domestic
needs. While there are some modern collieries in China, most of the mines are
only partly mechanized. Future plans call for increased mechanization in both
old and new mines, and for domestic manufacture of underground mining
equipment. The Government expects the output to reach 700 million tons by
1985. However, in increasing coal output, transport, essentially railroad
capacity, appears to be a major constraint.
(b) Power
1.07     China increased its generating capacity from little less than 2000 MW
in 1952 to over 67,000 MW by 1981 - an average growth rate of about 14% per
annum. Of this, 70% of the generating capacity is thermal (46,200 MW) and 30%
is hydro (21,000 MW). In 1980, 309 billion kWh of power was generated, of
which about 80% was thermal and the balance 20% hydro. China's hydro power
potential is among the largest in the world, and is estimated at 1900 billion
kWh per year against the present hydro generation of about 60 billion kWh. The
ChAng Jiang (Yangtze River), which flows through the southwestern portion of
China and eastern Xizang (Tibet), holds the largest hydro potential. On
account of the terrain through which it flows, only limited efforts have been
made to develop this potential. Major hydropower development has, however,
taken place on the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Han Shiu (Han River) which
flow through northeastern part of China. Liujiaxia is the largest hydropower
station in China and is constructed in Gansu on the Huang He. It has a
designed capacity of 1,225 MW and is annually capable of delivering about 5.7
billion kWh. Danjiangkou is the second largest power station in China, is
located on Han Shiu and has a generating capacity of 900 MW. This hydro
station meets the power requirements of the province of Hubei. Presently,
China has about eleven hydroelectric stations with a capacity of 290 MW or
greater. The other Chinese rivers which have major hydroelectric systems are
the Songhuajiang (590 MW), the Dadu River (508 MW), the Fuchun River and
tributaries (1330 MW) and the Yalu River (1100 MW).
1.08     Over the last decade, the mini hydrostations got a tremendous impetus
and grew from about 15,000 to about 90,000 in number. Typically, these
stations are about 50 kW in generating capacity, and are designed to meet the
needs of the rural areas. Besides providing power to the local communes,



reservoirs built for this purpose meet irrigation requirements, prevent floods
and are being used for pisciculture. The potential is indeed immense, and it
can be harnessed with local materials and the construction period is short.
However, seasonality appears to be a major constraint.
(c) Oil and Gas
1.09     Growth in the hydrocarbon sector, over the last two decades, has been
equally remarkable. While oil was discovered in China in 1897, annual oil
production up to 1950 was no more than 120,000 tons of which about 50,000 tons
was from oil shale. During the fifties, exploratory effort was confined to
northwest China which resulted in small discoveries. However, from 1957,
exploration was undertaken in the northeast and northern China, leading to the
discovery of the 'super giant' oilfield in Daqing in 1959. This was followed
by discoveries in Shengli and Dagang in 1964. In 1965 petroleum production
reached 11.3 million tons and with that China became self-sufficient. During
the sixties, increase in oil production was relatively moderate; the major
spurt came in the seventies with production increasing from 30 million tons in
1970 to 106 million tons in 1979. This increase came largely from the
development of the Daqing oilfield, and to a lesser extent, from the
development of the Shengli and Renqiu oilfields.
1.10     Official estimates of oil and gas reserves are not available.  The
magnitude of China's proven and probable reserves is the subject of
considerable speculation and study outside the country. Varying estimates
relating to the proven recoverable reserves have been made by different
geologists/bodies; the opinion, however, is now converging to a range which
varies from 1.8 to 2.5 billion tons. Estimates regarding possible and
probable reserves, both offshore and onshore, are by nature somewhat
speculative. The current estimates range from 5-10 billion tons in the
onshore region and 4-8 billion tons in the offshore area.
1.11     Currently, the major non-associated gas fields are located in the
Sichuan Province and the recoverable reserves are estimated at 70 billion
cubic meters. In addition, there are some minor natural gas fields in the
northwestern part of China. Over and above this, the recoverable reserves of
associated gas are estimated at about 50 billion cubic meters. The cumulative
recoverable gas reserves are thus about 130 billion cubic meters, equivalent
to over 110 million tons of oil. There is, however, a view that gas reserves
have not been adequately explored and the presently known recoverable reserves
are a mere fraction of the full potential. According to some estimates, the
ultimate recoverable reserves of natural gas, both offshore and onshore, could
be as high as 3,000 billion cubic meters.
(d) Oil Shale
1.12     Reserves of oil shale in China are reported unofficially to be of the
order of 400 billion tons and may be much larger, since geological environment
is favorable for their formation in many of the sedimentary basins. Deposits
of 100 billion tons or more, containing 5-10 billion tons of oil, are reported
in Heilongjiang and Hebei. The grade of most of oil shales is fairly low
(less than 10%), but a few deposits have 10-20% of oil by weight. Before
1958, oil shale accounted for almost half of Chinese oil production, but the
proportion declined rapidly as normal crude oil production increased after the
discovery of the Daqing oilfield. Currently, from the Liaoning and Guangdong



-6-
mines, about 300,000 tons of shale oil is being produced.
(e) Geothermal
1.13     China's geological conditions are such as to give rise to abundant
geothermal phenomena, especially in the Tibetan Plateau. Most occurrences
seem to be relatively low temperature ground water suitable for space heating;
high temperature manifestation suitable for power generation seems to be more
frequent in the mountainous southwestern part of the country, such as Yunnan
Province and Xizang Autonomous Region (Tibet). The Ministry of Geology, which
has the responsibility for developing geothermal resources, has identified and
developed two projects. The first is a geothermal power station in the
Yangbajian geothermal field of Xizang, some 50 km from Lhasa and the other is
an urban heating system developed in the southeastern part of Beijing.
Geothermal energy has not been developed to a significant extent in China.
Furthermore, its role is likely to be limited to urban heating systems in the
colder regions of the country and possibly to power generation in Xizang.
(f) Non-commercial Energy
1.14     Although no data base exists for quantifying the extent of non-
commercial energy used in China, it is apparent that this form of energy
constitutes a significant proportion of the total energy used, especially in
the rural areas. Fuel wood from loppings and grass, animal and crop residue,
and especially rice straw, are the principal sources of non-commercial
energy. Unofficial estimate places the energy extracted from these sources at
250 million tons of coal equivalent or about one-third of the total energy
used. If this estimate is correct, then the traditional fuels play a smaller
role in China than in most other countries with similar per capita levels.
This is partially explained by a high population density and low availability
of forest resources.
1.15     For maximizing the benefits from non-commercial sources of energy,
China has pioneered and is now the leader in producing biogas. Biogas, which
contains methane up to 65%, is produced by the fermentation of animal and
human waste, vegetation, household garbage and waste water. Originating in
the Province of Sichuan, biogas digesters are now all over China with the
exception of the colder reiions of the country, and currently exceed 6 million
in number. A typical 10 m digester, costs about 50 Yuans (US$30), and can
meet the composite energy needs of a family of five. In addition to the
ecological benefits, through lower deforestation and the saving of fossil
fuels, biogas digesters produce organic fertilizer, an essential ingredient
for Chinese agriculture.
Distribution of Energy Resources
1.16     China's energy resources are not evenly distributed.  The northeast
and the north, with nearly 30% of China's population and more than 45% of the
gross industrial output, have as much as 75% of the known commercial energy in
terms of coal and oil. These reserves currently account for the bulk of the
country's production and are being extracted at a relatively fast pace. The
east, with one-fifth of the total population and 30% of the industrial output,
is almost devoid of any energy resource. The central south and southwest
China, except for hydropower potential, is equally bereft of other forms of
energy. It is the northwest China, with possibly half of China's probable



-7-
reserves of coal and oil,-and with major hydro potential in Xizang, which
would need to be developed for meeting China's growing energy needs. Some of
these areas, however, have a hostile environment, are inaccessible and very
sparsely populated and, therefore, developing energy resources here would
neither be cheap nor quick. It is for this reason that China is increasingly
considering its oil potential in the offshore area, especially in the
southeastern continental shelf.
Scale of Development
1.17     One of the basic tenets of Chinese developmental philosophy has been
going small on a big scale. This guiding principle has had a significant
impact on its energy policy and manifested itself in a large number of small
coal mines, about 90,000 mini hydropower plants, and innumerable biogas
units. True, the productivity of the small coal mines is low and the working
environment is hazardous, and the cost of power generation in mini hydro
plants is generally higher than in major hydropower stations. Yet, these
units rely on local initiatives, skills, materials and capital, and have been
brought onstream with commenDPABle speed. Most of the small coal mines have
been developed in the energy deficient southern China and now provide the much
needed fuel for local industries and households. Similarly mini hydro
stations have a significant impact on the local economy by providing flood
control, irrigation, and power, without creating a draft on the major power
stations and on the under-developed transmission system. These stations have
made rural electrification possible on an extensive scale.
1.18     However, this policy has not been an unqualified success.  Its
indiscriminate application to all facets of industrial activity spawned a
large number of small scale refineries, fertilizer units, cement, and iron and
steel platts. This led to dissipation of resources where economies of scale
were given up in deference to a developmental philosophy. 'Teakettle' refine-
ries are inefficient and make product standardization impossible. Backyard
fertilizer plants for synthesis of ammonia, besides requiring investment per
unit of nutrient output which is two to three times higher than modern plants,
produce product which is unstable and relatively ineffective in use. Small
scale iron and steel works are equally inefficient in terms of capital use and
the quality of product. This is not to suggest that this policy should be
abandoned; it is merely to argue for a more rigorous economic scrutiny.
Efficiency of Energy Use
1.19     From the limited data available, it appears that China's level of
commercial energy consumption is very high in relation to its economic
activity. Although global comparisons of commercial energy consumption per
unit of GDP show China with an energy intensity level more than double that of
most other developing countries and industrialized market economies, this is a
very crude index of energy efficiency, and is subject to considerable
variation due to differences in economic structure (China has a relatively
larger heavy industrial sector than many other countries) and problems
associated with the valuation of output. Nevertheless, micro-level energy
intensity comparisons on a physical basis, particularly in industry, indicate
substantial potential for improvement in industrial energy efficiency in
China. For example, in the steel industry, China's largest industrial energy
consumer (12% of total commercial energy), energy consumption per ton of crude
steel, even in large integrated plants, is approximately double the level



-8-
achieved in best international practice, and energy consumption per ton in the
small and medium plants is about 25% higher than in the larger plants. In the
nitrogenous fertilizer industry, average energy consumption per ton of ammonia
is roughly double that of best international practice, due partly to the
outmoded technology used in these smaller plants, and to different raw
materials. The smaller scale plants, which produce over half the ammonia,
have about one-half the energy efficiency of the newer larger plants in
China. The problem of small inefficient plants is also true in the brick
industry. Smaller brick plants, which produce 2/3 of the country's bricks,
consume 50% more energy per ton of bricks than the larger plants.
1.20     The problem of energy efficiency in China is, therefore, due not only
to certain managerial/operational inefficiencies, which might be corrected in
the relatively short term with little or no investment, but is also related to
the use of older-fashioned technology, inadequate facilities to capture waste
heat, the scale of industrial plants, and the raw materials used. Many of
these problems will take longer to solve, and require substantial capital
investment and some industrial restructuring. The Government is well aware of
and highly concerned about these problems, and is promulgating a number of
policy measures to address them, while according energy conservation equal
priority with increasing energy production. These measures include plans to
establish a number of energy conservation technical assistance centers to
assist industrial enterprises in evaluating and improving their energy
efficiency, enterprise-level quota systems with accompanying bonus and pricing
systems for energy conservatin below or above quota, industrial restructuring
(including decreased relative emphasis on heavy industry), and increased
taxation on petroleum fuels to encourage both conservation and fuel
substitution.
II. OIL AND GAS SECTOR
Background
2.01     China is perhaps the oldest user of hydrocarbons; the Zulujing field
was developed over 2000 years ago, producing gas through bamboo pipes and oil
from dug pits. In the modern times, the first oilfield was discovered in 1897
at Dushanzi in the Junggar basin, followed by another discovery in 1907 at
Yanchang in the Shaanxi Province. Over the next forty years, exploratory
efforts were minimal, relied largely on the initiative of the private
companies and the total number of wells drilled was less than 170. This
drilling activity led to the discovery of three oil and two gas fields. The
size of the discoveries and the production level was modest and an important
constituent of the output was shale oil. Production averaged about 70,000
tons per year and reached 120,000 tons by 1950. Of this, shale oil accounted
for 50,000 tons.
2.02     It was only after 1950 that a concerted effort was made to increase
oil production. The older oilfields (Jiuquan, Yanchang and Dushanzi) were
expanded to increase oil production. Separately, exploratory effort was
stepped up in northwest China leading to the discovery of the Karamay oilfield
in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The scale and the size of the discoveries



- 9 -
were small, and China had to rely on imported oil to meet its requirements.
As of 1957, the focus of exploration shifted to the north and northeast China
leading to the discovery of the super giant oilfield in the Songliao basin in
1959. Called 'the great celebration', the Daqing oilfield, since its
discovery, has accounted for more than 50% of China's total oil production.
Petroleum Geology
2.03     The petroleum geology of China is unusual in that most of the known
petroleum accumulations are found in the sedimentary rocks of lacustrine
rather than marine origin, laid down in ancient lakes or inland seas which
occupied depressions in the Chinese landmass. These sediments now underlie
large areas of the North China Plain and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the
northwest. Oil and gas were formed in rocks of Mesozoic and earlier Tertiary
age and accumulated in sand beds intercolated with the shaly source rocks.
The reservoirs are block faulted quite intensely and their origin tend to be
thin and poorly sorted, but so numerous that the aggregate oil bearing
thickness in the section is appreciable. Nine petroliferous basins have been
identified onshore China; the Songliao and the North China Plain basins in the
north and northeast China, Sichuan and Guangxi basins in southern China,
Shaanxi and Qin-Chuan basins in central China and the Qaidam, Tarim and
Junggar basins in the northwest China. Presently the Songliao and the North
China Plain basins are the most prolific producers of oil, accounting for more
than 90% of its production; but the basins in the remote and inhospitable
northwest are estimated to contain the largest oil potential. Substantial oil
accumulations have been proved in China and an aggregate daily production
level of 2 million barrels places China among the largest oil producing
countries of the world.
Institutions
2.04     The Ministry of Petroleum Industry (MOPI) oversees all aspects of oil
and natural gas activities which include policy making and overall planning,
exploration, production, distribution, transportation, research/design and
training.  Created as a Bureau in the Ministry of Fuel Industry in October,
1949, it became a full ministry in 1955 and oversaw the opening of the Daqing
oilfield in 1959 and the various discoveries thereafter. In 1970 it was
merged with the Ministry of Coal and the Ministry of Chemical Industry. In
1978, the ministries were split and MOPI once again became an independent
entity. The organization chart of MOPI is in annex 2.01. The petroleum
industry in China has been in a state of continuous change; this has blurred
the lines of responsibility and created its own anomalies. The Ministry of
Geology (MOG), in addition to being in charge of petroleum related geological
work, separately and independently undertakes offshore exploration. Export of
oil and procurement of foreign technology and equipment relating to the oil
industry is the responsibility of several corporations under the charge of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Similarly, fragmentation of
responsibility exists in refining; some refineries are managed by MOPI while
others are managed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry. There is also a
considerable overlap in technical training and research; its administrative
responsibility is shared/divided betweeen MOPI, Ministry of Education and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
2.05     For securing foreign technology and undertaking external liason, the
Petroleum Corporation of the People's Republic of China (PCPRC) was created in



- 10 -
1977. The principal objective of PCPRC and its affiliate, the China Oil and
Natural Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CONGEDC), was to enter
into agreements with foreign oil companies, especially in regard to offshore
geophysical and seismic work. As of February 16, 1982, the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) was created. This Corporation will take over
all the offshore functions and contractual rights and obligations of PCPRC and
CONGEDC. CNOOC will be responsible for inviting and evaluating bids and
entering into offshore petroleum agreements with foreign oil companies. For
implementing petroleum contracts and contracts for the construction of
offshore installation and facilities, CNOOC will set up regional subsidiary
corporations, namely, the Bohai Bay Oil Company, the South Yellow Sea Oil
Company, the Eastern South China Sea Oil Company and the Western South China
Sea Oil Company. In addition, CNOOC is considering establishing other
specialized companies.
Exploration Policy
(a) Onshore
2.06     In exploration, as in other sectors, China, till the late seventies,
followed the policy of total self reliance and met with remarkable success.
Exploration is done by about 300 seismic crews and 500 drilling rigs, which
annually drill 2000 to 3000 wells. The rate of discovery has, however, been
declining (Renqiu was the last major discovery) and, faced with the prospect
of falling oil production, China has modulated its exploration policy.
Firstly, it proposes to undertake detailed seismic survey around existing
oilfields. This will help identify peripheral sands which could partially
offset the anticipated decline.   Secondly, it proposes to shift the focus of
exploration from north and northeast to Tarim, Qaidam, Junggar and Ordos
basins in the north and northwest. This shift will not be easy; all these
basins are located in the remote northwestern China, are only tenuously linked
with the rest of the country, have extremely hostile weather and difficult
drilling conditions. Pay zones are at considerable depths (5,000 to 9,000
meters) and the formation pressure and temperature is high. Developing this
area would therefore require a quantum jump both in investment and
technology. Thirdly, and recognizing the above, China has secured, on a
limited scale, assistance of foreign companies for undertaking seismic surveys
and exploratory drilling in specially difficult areas. As these basins are
estimated to hold about 50% of China's onshore recoverable reserves, GOC
intends, over the next five years, to concentrate its exploratory efforts in
this area. Finally, China is seriously considering inviting foreign oil
companies to participate in exploration and production, specially in these
difficult areas.
(b) Offshore
2.07     Prior to 1979, China had on its own undertaken seismic work and
developed offshore structures in the Bohai area, and in doing so recognized
the limitation of its offshore technology. Thereafter, in a major policy
change, China sought the active cooperation of foreign oil companies in
identifying and developing its offshore structures. 48 foreign oil companies,
from 12 countries, were invited to undertake geophysical and seismic work over
420,000 square kilometers of China's offshore sedimentary basins. These
surveys identified six prospective basins, namely, the Bohai, the South Yellow
Sea, the East China Sea, the Pearl River, the Southwest Hainan Islands, and



- 11 -
the Tonkin Bay basins. More than 475 prospective oil structures have been
identified in these basins. Present evidence indicates that the Zhujiang
(Pearl River) estuary is the most prospective.
2.08     In order to enable the participation of foreign oil companies in
exploring its offshore basins, GOC on January 30, 1982, promulgated
"Regulations on the Exploitation of Offshore Petroleum Resources in
Cooperation with Foreign Enterprises." These regulations enable GOC to enter
into petroleum contract with foreign oil companies whereunder and in terms of
the contract, these companies will bear the cost of all exploration investment
and accompanying risks. Once a commercial oil and/or gas field is discovered,
both the foreign contractor and the CNOOC will invest jointly in its
development. Whereas initially the foreign contractor will be the operator
responsible for developing and operating the field, under these regulations,
CNOOC has the right to take over as the operator whenever it deems fit. The
foreign contracting party may recover its investment and expenses and receive
remunerations out of the petroleum produced according to the provisions of the
petroleum contract. Further, the foreign contracting parties are at liberty
to deliver abroad their share of petroleum which is produced under this
agreement. The first round of bidding will take place in two phases. The
first phase relates to the northern part of the South Yellow Sea, and the
Zhujiang estuary in the South China Sea; the second phase concerns the
southern part of the South Yellow Sea, the Beibu Wan basin in the South China
Sea and the Yinggehai basin. The total area offered is about 150,000 square
kilometers. Bids for the first round were invited from foreign oil companies
on February 16, 1982, and for the second phase in April 1982. Considerable
interest has been evinced by foreign oil companies to these offerings.
Hydrocarbon Bearing Structures
Onshore
2.09     The oil and gas bearing structures are spread out over the entire
China land mass and can be split up geographically into six regions. Oil
production from each region along with the salient features of important
oilfields are discussed.
Northeast China
2.10     This region contains the prolific Sungliao basin with the oilfields
of Daqing, Liaohe, Banshan and Fuyu. These oilfields account for about 60% of
China's current oil production.
2.11     Daqing Oilfield.  This oilfield is situated in the central portion of
the Songliao basin, which is a large Mesozoic/Cenozoic inland sedimentary
basin covering approximately 25,000 square km. The Daqing oilfield measures
140 km in the north-south direction and about 15-30 km in the east-west
direction. The oil reservoir lies at 700-1200 meters below the surface.
Throughout its history, oil has been produced using water flood methods, the
field has now reached its maturity, oil production is declining while water
injected in the reservoirs is increasing. Infill drilling, producing new
reservoirs and enhanced oil recovery methods can be used to partially offset
the decline.



- 12 -
North China
2.12     This region contains Dagang oilfield in the Bohai basin and the
Renqiu oilfield in the Baoding basin. In addition, recent discoveries have
been made in Nei-Monggol, which is considered to be an extension of the
Songliao basin.
2.13     Renqiu Oilfield.  Located in Hebei Province, Renqiu is the first
discovery of a Precambrian reservoir in China. Rock characteristics make for
irregular porosity and varying oil output. Over the last two years the output
from this field has declined sharply (30%), from 16 million tons to about 12
million tons. However, new wells are being drilled at Renqiu; they tend to be
prolific and may, therefore, offset the decline partially and add to the
output.
2.14     Dagang Oilfield.  This field is entirely Tertiary and consists of
about 13 oil sands, totalling 37 meters of net pay. It is again a highly
faulted and a fractured structure, making the development and the production
from the field complex and unpredictable. The pay zones are between 2000 -
3000 meters in depth. The oil bearing strata appears and disappears
irregularly and the output at producing wells often fluctuates widely. The
oil is relatively light (340 API) and is reported to be sulphur free.
Eastern China
2.15     Shengli is the only major oilfield in this region.  This field, which
comprises about 40 small fields, totalling about 600 km , is scattered on both
sides of the Huang He near the Bohai basin. This oilfield was discovered in
1962, production is from Miocene-Pliocene and Upper Tertiary strata, where a
wide variety of stratigraphic traps are situated. Oil sands are found in
small reservoirs, spread out in unpredictable patterns over a widely scattered
area. Underground permeability and pressure conditions vary, warranting water
injection in most of the cases. The quality of oil produced from this field
is of poor quality, having a gravity of 220 API, with fuel oil and other heavy
ends accounting for 75% of the product yield. Recently another discovery has
been made in Chezhen in the Shandong province. Size of this discovery is to
be determined.
Central-South China
2.16     Major production from this region comes from two new discoveries,
namely, the Nanyang field and the Zhong Yuan field, both located in the
province of Henan.  The Nanyang field is reported to be producing about one
million tons of oil per annum. The Zhong Yuan oil basin lies about 500 km
south of Beijing in the basin of the Huang He.  Exploration in this area
started in 1977 and has led to the discovery of six small oilfields, namely,
Wenliu, Fucheng, Wenmingzhai, Weicheng, Guoyunji and Qiaokou. Since its
discovery, 1900 line kilometers of seismic survey have been done and 280 wells
have been drilled. The current production level in these oilfields is 1.6
million tons per annum.
Northwest China
2.17     This area was the scene of the country's first commercial discovery
at Dushanzi in 1897, an oilfield which still produces 0.5 million tons. In



- 13 -
the same basin (Junggar), the Karamay oilfield was developed in the early
fifties and continues to produce about 3.5 million tons per annum. The Lenghu
oilfield in the Qinghai Province and the Yumen and Jiuquan oilfield in the
Gansu province are the other oilfields in this region. W4hile cumulatively the
northwest region produces about 6 million tons of oil, it has basins which are
considered to hold the largest petroleum potential. Of special significance
is the Tarim basin where three important discoveries are reported to have been
made. Similarly, the Qaidam basin in northwestern Qinghai and the Ordos basin
in the Shaanxi Province are considered extremely prospective. Taking into
account the potential of this area and the difficulties involved in drilling,
MOPI has entered into service contracts with a number of foreign companies to
undertake seismic work, data processing and exploratory drilling.
Southwest China
2.18     The Sichuan basin is the only hydrocarbon bearing structure
discovered in this region. Natural gas has been produced from gas fields in
this structure for over a hundred years. The oil production is nominal and
does not exceed 0.1 million tons.
Offshore
2.19     Currently the Bohai gulf is the only source of offshore oil in
China. This gulf is relatively sheltered with a maximum water depth of 60
meters; it has two producing oilfields; namely, Heise and Chengbei. These
structures were discovered in 1970 and 1973. Over 130 wells have been drilled
in the Heise, but only six are currently producing. Eighteen wells are
producing in the Chengbei oilfield and cumulative oil production from the
offshore areas is less than half million tons per annum.
Current and Anticipated Level of Oil Production
2.20     The table below indicates the crude oil production by region and
major fields.

2.21     Over the last one year oil output has fallen by about 3%.  However,
of greater significance is the fact that the major oilfields, which together
account for 90% of China's oil production, have peaked; water cut (proportion
of water to oil produced) is increasing exponentially; and consequently
decline production has set in. With no major discovery to offset this fall,
China would need to rely increasingly on infill drilling, enhanced oil
recovery (EOR) methods, exploring for and developing peripheral reservoirs and
rapidly developing small discoveries. MOPI has initiated action in these
areas and efforts are under way for expanding oilfields such as Fuyu, Liaohe,
Karamay, Zhong Yuan, Daqing (Gaotaizi reservoir), etc. In view of these
efforts, it is estimated that China will be able to temporarily stem the
decline and oil output up to 1985 may be in the range of 100-95 million tons.
2.22     The prognosis between 1985 and 1990 is less encouraging.  By this
time, oil output from Daqing, Shengli, Renqiu and Dagang would be declining at
a rapid pace. Furthermore, while prospects for offshore discoveries are rated
/a   Source:  Ministry of Petroleum Industry

as very good, oil from the offshore areas is unlikely to augment China's oil
production significantly prior to 1990. Similarly, even if major discoveries
are made in the northwest, intractable logistics make the field development
and oil transportation an extremely complex and time consuming proposition.
Thus, between 1985 and 1990 there is a distinct possibility of oil production
falling to 90 million tons. Prospects beyond 1990 depend upon the success
attending the current initiative to develop offshore structure with the
assistance of foreign oil companies.
Quality of Crude Oil
2.23     Almost all Chinese crude oil has a high wax content and a high pour
point, so that it is solid at ambient temperatures most of the year. These
characteristics lead to severe problems in transportation and refining.
Transportation
2.24     Oil and petroleum products are transported by a variety of modes,
including pipelines, waterways, railways and road transport. The first crude
oil pipeline was built in 1970. Two major pipelines link the Daqing oilfield
with the Qinhuangdao refinery and the Dalian port. From this port the oil is
either exported or transported to other provinces. Another major pipeline
network links Dagang, Shengli, Renqiu and the Zhong Yuan oilfields with the
Nanjing city. Currently, the crude oil pipeline network extends over 70,000
kilometers and the natural gas pipeline over 2,500 kilometers. Some 64% of
the crude oil is transported by pipelines, 26% by waterways and the balance by
railways. Presently there are no product pipelines and the petroleum products
are moved largely by roads, water ways and railways. MOPI is, however,
considering, plans to build multiproduct pipelines. All pipeline networks,
outside the oil/gas fields, are built, operated and maintained by the Pipeline
Administrative Bureau which is answerable to MOPI.
Refineries
2.25     The total refining capacity in China is 94 million tons, although
throughput in 1981 was limited to 73 million tons. Refining capacities vary
significantly - from 6 million tons per annum (MTPA) in Daqing and Beijing, to
5 MTPA in Nanjing, Shanghai, Shengli, Maoming and to a host of teakettle
refineries of less than 0.5 MTPA capacity. The main refinery products are
fuel oil (41%) diesel oil (27%), gasoline (16%) and kerosene (6%). In
addition, they produce industrial solvents and chemical feedstocks. The
refineries located in the oilfields or those undertaking only the refining of
crude oil are under the admininstrative control of MOPI. However, refineries
which also produce petrochemicals or undertake catalytic or hydro cracking are
under the Ministry of Chemical Industry. Overall refinery product yield is
indicated below:

Consumption Pattern
2.26     Rising oil production led to an increased role of hydrocarbons in the
Chinese economy. Coal has been the traditional source of commercial energy
supplying 90% of total energy as recently as 1965. The relative share of oil
and natural gas increased from about 2% in 1965 to 22.5% in 1981, with coal
(72.5%) and hydro (5%) providing the balance. The major consumer of oil is
the industry and commerce sector (43%) followed by transport (25%) and power
(20%). Similarly, natural gas is used by industry to the extent of 88% and
the balance by power. Household consumption for illumination, heating and
transportation is minimal and accounts for less than 2%. An unusual feature
in the consumption pattern is the direct use of crude, to the extent of 8
million tons, as fuel oil. Non availability of refining facilities close to
the producing field, transportation constraints and poor quality of crude, in
part explain this wasteful practice.
2.27     While oil production during the last 16 years grew at about 15% per
annum, consumption has kept pace. The table below indicates the overall
production, consumption and export levels.

2.28     Consumption has been growing at an annual rate of about 13%.
However, faced with a situation of falling oil and gas production, efforts are
being made to decelerate the growth; as a matter of fact consumption in 1981
is reported to be about 82 million tons against the peak of 90 million tons
attained in 1978. However, it is moot if further reduction in consumption can



- 17 -
be secured without adversely affecting the rate of growth. True there is
considerable wastage of energy and the scope for replacing oil by coal is
substantial. However, bringing this about is not going to be easy or quick.
Replacement of oil by coal would require substantial investment in terms of
transportation and extensive retrofitting. Similarly, once a production mode
has been determined, the energy efficiency factor is locked in and major
improvement in energy use cannot be secured without discarding the
investment.
2.29     Forecasts relating to future demand of petroleum products are not
available. Further, in the absence of detailed macroeconomic and sectoral
data, it is not possible to make any scientific forecast. However, working on
the growth rates assumed by the Bank's 1980 Econ omic Mission under the
scenario of moderate growth and moderate saving,_ but applying them to the
reduced consumption base for 1981, the demand for petroleum products in 1985
is estimated to be about 92 million tons. Implications of such a scenario are
fairly grave. China has so far been able to maintain the export level; in
fact stepped it up even in a situation of declining production. In 1980
China's earnings from the export of oil are estimated at $4.75 billion and
represented 26.5% of its total foreign exchange earnings. Consumption level
of 92 million tons would imply that as of 1985 oil would cease to be a
significant source of foreign exchange earnings.
Natural Gas
2.30     China produces gas in significant quantities; in 1981 production, of
gas (associated and non-associated) amounted to 12.5 billion cubic meters,
equivalent to about 10.5 million tons of oil. Of this, gas produced in
association with oil amounted to 6.2 billion cubic meters. The balance of 6.3
billion cubic meters, is non-associated gas, which is produced essentially in
the Sichuan Province, although marginal quantities are also being produced in
the Qaidam basin in the northwest. The gas industry is not new to Sichuan as
the current gas fields were discovered and developed over hundred years ago.
There are more than 200 gas bearing structures in the Sichuan Province and the
current production is around 5.6 billion cubic meters per annum. Weiyuan is
the largest gas field in Sichuan, producing about a billion cubic meters a
year, followed by Wulonghou, Shiyougou, Zigong, etc. The table below
indicates the production of gas by region.

2.31     Presently about 30% of the natural gas is used for fertilizers, about
10% for petrochemicals and synthetic fibers and the balance of 60% is used as
fuel, of which about 12% was used for thermal power plants. Non-associated
gas fields in the Sichuan Province, which have been producing for over 100
years, have now entered a declining phase. Similarly, with the decline in oil
production in the Daqing, Shengli and Dagang oilfields, production of
associated gas would also decline. As a matter of fact, gas production in
1981 in relation to 1980, registered a decline of about 13%, equivalent to 1.8
million tons of oil. Fall in gas production would inevitably stimulate demand
for liquid hydrocarbons. It is, therefore, necessary that efforts are
initiated to explore for and develop non-associated gas prospects.
Prices
2.32     Prices of petroleum products, like other essential commodities in
China, are fixed by the National Price Administrative Bureau. This Bureau

functions as an independent entity, and works under the supervision and
guidance of the State Council. The oilfields sell crude oil to the refineries
at a well-head price of Y100 ($56) per ton, with the exception of northwest
China and Zhong Yuan oilfield (a new field discovered in 1977) which sell
crude at Y130 ($72) per ton. Refineries in turn sell petroleum products to
the Ministry of Commerce which is responsible for marketing the products.
There is a price differential at every point, with the oilfields, the
refineries, and the Ministry of Commerce, acting as profit centers for the
State. The table below indicates the price of various petroleum products, ex-
refinery and at the pump head.

2.33     Whereas products like motor gasoline, kerosene and diesel are priced
near the international level, the average price of the reconstituted barrel
works out to Y39 ($22), which is below the international price. This is
largely because fuel oil is priced at a fraction of the international price
(29%). Prices of petroleum products have now remained unchanged for the last
20 years; while the Pricing Bureau is presently considering increasing the
price of crude oil sold to the refineries from Y100 and Y130 per ton to Y170
per ton, it is not clear that this increase would be reflected in the end
prices. The maximum it may, therefore, achieve is redistribute surplus from
the refineries/Commerce Ministry to MOPI. The present pricing structure,
especially that of fuel oil, runs counter to GOC'c avowed objective of
replacing liquid hydrocarbon with coal, especially as boiler fuel. No
financial incentives now exist in China to switch from oil to coal, since fuel
oil in terms of calorific value, is cheaper than coal. However, the
government has sought during the past two years to encourage energy
conservation and substitution of coal for oil through energy consumption
targets for individual enterprises and other administrative means (see para.
1.20). These appear to have had some success. The government estimates that
these measures saved about 6 million tons of coal equivalent in 1981. In the
present Chinese system, administrative measures probably still have more

influence on energy use and production than prices do. But it will be
increasingly important as decision-making is decentralized to ensure that
price incentives reinforce rather than contradict administrative regulations.
Planning and Investment
2.34     The major economic instrument is the annual plan, which consists of
several parts, including a production plan, a material allocation plan, a
labour plan, etc. The core of this document is a set of Interlocking material
balance matrices, specifying sources (production, import, drawdown on
inventory, etc.) and uses (intermediate input, investment, consumption,
exports, etc.). The State Planning Commission (SPC) prepares the plan, with
overall responsibility for supervision resting primarily with the State
Economic Commission. MOPI, like other line ministries, operates under the
overall supervision of these commisions. While SPC is the final arbiter for
the annual plan, its finalization is a result of a series of iterative
consultations between SPC, MOPI and its constituent units, In the absence of
long term planning, there is an understandable preoccupation with the current
instead of the future, a preference for short-run expedients over measures
which aim at fostering productivity over the long run. This has at times led
to uneconomic extraction, rapidly rising production reserve ratio and
relatively inadequate investment in exploration or new technology.
2.35     The average investment in the oil and gas sector over the last five
years has been about Y2.8 billion ($1.55 billion). In the absence of a long
term plan, the future investment program for the sector is uncertain. The
annual plan for 1982 is being assumed to remain at the same level as 1981.
Even during the past, investment has varied from year to year and the
investment in 1978 was 50% higher than 1981 or what is programmed for the
current year. The major share of investment (50%) has gone into exploration,
with oilfield development securing only 30%. The present investment
development works out to $0.6 per barrel - a figure which is not only
indicative of relatively low cost levels obtaining in China, but more
importantly, could be symptomatic of inadequate investment being made in the
oil industry. So as to stem the anticipated decline in oil production, China
would need to step up investment substantially; for producing oil from peaking
fields, development of peripheral sands and exploration in the northwestern
part, would require outlays which are quantitatively and qualitatively
higher. Offshore development would create a further draft on resources, as
under the proposed participation agreement; even though the cost of
exploration is to be borne by the foreign oil companies, GOC would share the
development costs to the extent of 51%. The table below indicates the
investment made in exploration, development and refining during the last five
years.

Role of the Bank
2.36     China has so far been extremely successful in developing its oil
resources. However, its major oilfields, which together account for 90% of
its oil production, have peaked. Inspite of relatively high outlays for
exploration, Renqiu was the last major oil discovery. From available evidence
it is clear that China at least in the medium term faces the prospect of
declining oil production. There are also various constraints, including
transportation bottlenecks, to the rate at which coal supply can be
expanded. The Government's energy strategy involves addressing the problem of
moderating energy demand as well as expanding supply. Various measurs to
control demand are being implemented in the short term, including quota
systems, technical assistance to enterprises, and some industrial
restructuring (para. 1.20). Sector strategy over the longer term would
require China taking step to increase its exploratory efforts, especially in
the offshore areas where private industry investment is being actively sought,
and the northwest onshore areas, undertaking fuller development of coal and
hydro potential and making structural adjustment in industry to improve the
efficiency of energy use and permit the replacement of oil by coal. Coal
mines would have to be modernized and transportation constraint resolved;
while prospects of offshore oil discoveries are rated as high, oil in
significant amounts would be secured only after an extensive period of
exploration and development; similarly projects for developing hydro potential
have a long lead time. In industry, which consumes over 70% of total
commercial energy, major investments to improve and alter processes and
modernize older facilities will also take a few years to have substantial
impact, although significant savings should be achievable with little or no
investment in the shorter term. Investment in many of these areas, however,
is unlikely to yield significant results during the eighties. It is,
therefore, critical that steps be taken to stem the anticipated decline in oil
production and to obtain maximum impact from energy conservation. In the
petroleum sector, China would need to develop rapidly the small oilfields
which have already been discovered, undertake seismic surveys around existing
oilfields in order to discover and identify peripheral sands, initiate a
program for EOR, etc.
2.37     China is now facing problems typical to all oil producers, that is,



-22 -
being required to undertake exploration and production under increasingly
difficult and complex conditions. Achievement of the above mentioned medium
term objectives would thus require, not only increased investment in the oil
and gas sector, but also a major infusion of modern technology and
equipment. Bank lending in the petroleum sector will have three basic
objectives: Firstly to develop known hydrocarbon bearing structures in order
to partially offset the anticipated decline; secondly in providing a vehicle
for the induction of modern technology to the Chinese oil industry; thirdly
training and upgrading the skills of China's oil industry personnel in current
oilfield practices. On account of an extended period of technological
isolation during the development of oil industry, China has not been
successful in discovering petroleum in complex geological environments nor has
it developed the technological capability to increase the recovery of oil from
existing fields. COC is seeking the assistance of foreign oil companies in
exploring and developing its offshore areas. This would, over a period of
time, also result in the transfer of offshore technology. In the onshore
area, especially in regard to the discovered and developed oilfields, the GOC
expects the Bank to act as a similar conduit for transferring technolgoy.
During project preparation, substantial staff input was required for
identifying areas where technology needed to be upgraded. Much of the
equipment used in the fields such as Daqing is obsolescent; there is
relatively limited familiarity in the techniques relating to deep drilling and
field practices such as drilling, cementing, casing, and formation logging
require an indepth evaluation. The attention of the Chinese authorities has
been drawn to the need to upgrade field practices; the current project would
address itself directly to these issues by helping finance the import of
modern equipment and technology. Further work will be needed in preparing
terms of reference for technical studies, selection of consultants,
supervision of studies, evaluation of findings, and finalizing and
implementing a plan of action based on these results, etc. GOC has sought
Bank's assistance in this area which would be provided during the
implementation of the proposed project--and this is the primary rationale for
Bank's participation.
2.39     An important objective under the proposed loan is the training of
Chinese technical staff and strengthening of their capabilities. Not only
would engineers and technicians be trained in the use of new equipment and in
modern petroleum engineering practices, but a well equipped training center
would be established together with operational laboratories to supplement the
operational work in the field. The loan will also assist in shaping the
future investment program by helping finance important pre-investment
studies. In the medium term the Bank's involvement in the sector would be
aimed at developing rapidly the small oilfields which have already been
discovered, undertaking seismic surveys in the vicinity of existing producing
fields, and identifying and initiating enhanced oil recovery programs. Bank
assistance would, therefore, be directed to further consolidate China's
production capabilities and subsequently assisting its exploration investment
program.

III. BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01     The Daqing oilfield was discovered in 1959 and for developing this
field, the Songliao Directorate was created in 1960. This Directorate was
established by the order of the State Council, and initially consisted of
experienced personnel drawn from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry (MOPI) and
other oilfields. By 1964, the magnitude of the discovery had become apparent
and the city govetnment was created and vested with all functions relating to
the development of the oilfield, downstream activities like fertilizers and
petrochemicals, and the civil administration of the city including
agriculture, education and other social welfare activities. This
administration was responsible to MOPI for its oil related functions, and to
the provincial government for its remaining functions. In the seventies, the
management of Daqing was placed under the Revolutionary Council with the
provincial government taking major decisions. However, as of 1978 functions
relating to the oilfield and downstream industrial activities were separated
and placed under the Daqing Petroleum Administrative Bureau (DPAB), a state
owned enterprise independent from the municipal functions which continue to be
performed by the city government and the provincial government.
Functions
3.02     DPAB oversees all oilfield and downstream industrial activity.  Its
current functions encompass:
-exploration and seismic work.
-oilfield development.
-refining of petroleum products.
-petrochemicals and fertilizers.
-research and design.
Capital Structure
3.03     The development of the Daqing oilfield has been financed exclusively
by contributions from the Central Government and DPAB's internally generated
funds. Government contribution is allocated yearly to DPAB according to the
investment plan and is channelled to it through the Construction Bank, the
disbursing agency for the planning system. Total equity as of December 1980
was $1.2 billion. DPAB has no outstanding long term debt.
Organization and Management
3.04     DPAB management vests in a president, who is assisted by a senior
vice-president (operations) and six vice-presidents in charge of
petrochemicals, capital construction, drilling and exploration, oil
production, administration, and scientific research respectively. The
President of DPAB is also the mayor of Daqing and in that capacity heads the
civil administration and oversees all other socioeconomic activities including



- 24 -
health, housing, agriculture, education, etc. Earlier, DPAB was answerable
both to the provincial government and MOPI; as of 1980, MOPI is almost fully
responsible for overseeing the performance of DPAB. The president of DPAB
reports to MOPI through a vice-minister who is exclusively in charge of all
matters relating to Daqing.
3.05     DPAB functions are essentially managerial, with specialized companies
being responsible for various oilfield activities. The entire field is
divided into seven regions, and a regional oil production company has the
responsibility for developing and producing oil from that area. The oil
production company carries out drilling through one of the two drilling
companies in Daqing. These drilling companies in turn secure specialized
services like logging, cementation, and other downhole services from DPAB's
specialized companies, established specifically for this purpose. Surface
construction is carried out by the Surface Construction Company and all
material is secured and provided to various companies by the Material Supplies
Company. The responsibility for research, design and provision of scientific
and engineering support is with the Research and Design Institute. The
Organization Chart for DPAB is at Annex 3.01. The companies follow the
standard Chinese organizational pattern, namely, they are divided into
brigades and brigades in turn into teams. The brigade consists of 10 to 15
specialists, who function as staff officers to the brigade leader. The
brigade leader is responsible for the fulfillment of the stipulated targets by
the teams under its command. The brigade leader and its staff are usually
professionals with managerial responsibilities, while skilled workers man the
teams. A team typically consists of 50 - 100 persons, with the team leader
who is an experienced skilled worker.
3.06     Production targets are annually established for Daqing by MOPI.
These targets are derived from the annual planned targets for the entire
economy. These targets, initially framed in broad outlines, are passed down
to DPAB, which spells out the details, evaluates the feasibility and works out
its financial implications. Consequently, through a series of iterations, the
annual plan is agreed upon. Following a similar process, DPAB in turn evolves
a work program for various companies, their respective brigades and teams.
Once this exercise has been completed, DPAB enjoys considerable operational
autonomy and is answerable to MOPI only for results. Its financial autonomy
is, however, far more constrained; DPAB must secure inputs from designated
sources at predetermined prices; similarly it must sell its output to
specified agencies at prices which are set by the Government. Its investment
plan must conform to the national priorities and even within the framework of
the approved plan, it must seek the clearance of the Central Government for
any foreign exchange expenditure or material inputs designated as essential.
3.07     Daqing, for long, has been considered the technological capital of
China, a model of industrial growth for the rest of the country to emulate.
This has been for good and valid reasons. Without external assistance and
with outdated technology, Daqing was developed into one of the largest
oilfields in the world and a major industrial complex. Management at all
levels is dedicated, competent, innovative and remarkably able in pursuing and
achieving assigned tasks. Its personnel is hardworking, talented and
disciplined, which makes DPAB an extremely effective organization, capable of
carrying out ambitious programs within the framework of severe constraints and
limitations. Its managers appeared perceptive about their technical problems,



- 25 -
both in research and production. The major deficiencies arise on account of
the oilfield having been developed in an environment of technological
isolation, with methods adopted and decisions taken on the basis of extremely
limited information. As a result, mistakes and inefficient choices have at
times been made. The project, as designed, takes these limitations into
account. The major emphasis is on inducting new technology, refurbishing
research facilities, modifying and improving field practices, and upgrading
the level of training. Given the organizational strength of DPAB, there is
little doubt that the proposed project will be implemented with competence and
speed. (See para. 4.09-4.10)
Project Implementation
(a) Production Company
3.08     Production Company No. 1 (PCNl) will be responsible for the
development of the Gaotaizi (G) reservoir. This company operates the Sa'ertu
field and is responsible for operations over an area of 160 square
kilometers. Its crude oil production for 1981 was about 10 million tons. It
has a work force of about 9,770 workers, including 600 university and junior
college graduates. This company is headed by a director, who is assisted by
six vice-directors responsible for technical management, engineering, geology,
capital construction, oil production and finance. The company operates
through oil production brigades (5), each of each oversees oil production
teams (85), which have the direct responsibility for operating and maintaining
oil and water injection wells. The oil production brigades/teams are
supported by similarly organized brigades/teams which are responsible for well
servicing, maintenance and repairs, geological and technical services,
transportation, etc. The organization chart of PCN1 is at annex 3.02. PCN1
is a well-managed company. It has developed the Sa'ertu oilfields, currently
operates and maintains all the oil wells, water injection wells, and ancillary
production and services facilities.
(b) Drilling Company and Other Auxiliary Services Companies.
3.09     Drilling Company No. 2 will be responsible for drilling the oil and
water injection wells for the proposed project. The company's work force is
about 5,500, of which about 350 are university or junior college graduates.
It is headed by a Director who is assisted by five deputy directors, each in
charge of production, equipment, administration and finance, engineering and
general services. The actual drilling is carried out through two production
brigades which are in turn subdivided into 22 drilling teams. Each drilling
team has 50-60 skilled workers, is headed by a team leader and operates in
shifts, 24 hours a day. Production teams are assisted by similarly
constituted units, namely, installation and moving unit (one brigade with nine
teams), transporation unit (one brigade with seven teams) and equipment and
supply unit (one brigade with four teams). The Organization Chart of the
Drilling Company No. 2 is at Annex 3.03. The company owns and operates 22
rigs. In 1981 it drilled 474 oil and water injection wells. Judged against
petroleum industry standards, this company operates with considerable
efficiency; inspite of extremely difficult drilling conditions for four months
in a year, each rig on an average logged operating hours of 4,900/per annum of
which drilling activity accounted for 2,940 hours. On an average each rig
drilled 21 wells per annum, involving a cumulative drilling of about 27,500
meters.



- 26 -
3.10     Auxiliary companies will provide specialized services to the Drilling
Company. The Drilling Service Company will log the wells, and be responsible
for mud engineering and cementation. The Testing Company will carry out
various oil tests and also perforating jobs. The Downhole Company will be
responsible for fracturing and other downhole services. PCNI will enter into
agreement with Drilling Company No. 2 for undertaking all work relating to
development drilling and the Drilling Company No. 2 will enter into similar
arrangement with auxiliary companies for providing various well services. For
surface construction, separate agreement would be entered into between PCN1
and the Surface Construction Company. Besides these four main service
companies, the services of about ten companies will be secured on an "as
needed" basis (communication, transporation, repairs, etc.).
(c)   Project Unit
3.11     PCNI, Drilling Company No. 2 and auxiliary companies relating to
drilling operation and maintenance of wells are capable of implementing the
project in a satisfactory manner. However, for coordinating and monitoring
development program relating to the G reservoir, it would be desirable to
establish a special project team in PCN1. During negotiations DPAB agreed to
establish by March 31, 1983 such a team in PCNI, which would be headed by a
Deputy-Director (see para. 4.12).
Accounting
3.12     DPAB follows the "Accounting System for State Run Enterprises"
enacted by GOC in 1953 and subsequently revised in 1960 and 1981. While the
accounting arrangements are satisfactory in the context of the GOC financial
setup, there are fundamental differences between some of DPAB's practices and
the generally accepted accounting practices of commercially oriented petroleum
enterprises. Special features of DPAB's financial and accounting practices
are:
(a)  DPAB maintains two separate sets of accounts for its oilfield
activities--one set for capital construction and the other for
production. Since these two sets of accounts are not being
consolidated, DPAB's balance sheet for production does not include
construction work-in-progress.
(b)  DPAB reports all exploration costs under the capital construction
account. MOPI finances the approved costs for exploration. Tn the
event that exploratory wells are turned into production wells, the
latter are reported by DPAB in its balance sheet for production and
are valued at the standard cost in production wells.
(c)  MOPI allows DPAB to classify investment expenditure for oilfield
uphold as operating expenses. DPAB's oilfield maintenance and
repairs are financed from overhaul fund allocations which are charged
as operating expenses; unused overhaul funds budgetted for the
current year can be carried forward to future years (para. 5.05). In
essence, while DPAB's oilfield uphold and overhaul provisions are
reported as "cost" items on the income statement for the purpose of
computing net income, they are actually sources of internal funds
retained for oilfield maintenance, repairs and new investment.



- 27 -
(d) While heavy emphasis is placed on the budget as a controlling tool,
DPAB generally does not undertake financial planning beyond one year.
3.13     Given the uncertain range of recovery from the reservoirs and the
related costs of oil extraction, it would seem prudent for MOPI to extend the
horizon of financial planning in the industry as a tool for management
decision-making. As a first step towards this direction, it is recommended
that DPAB be used as a model, given its satisfactory record of short-run
financial management. DPAB should reformulate its financial planning based
either within the existing financial set-up or on the development of a new
financial planning unit with the objective of producing financial plans for
five years for its oilfield investment and operations. As a part of this
process, DPAB would be expected to re-evaluate its costing techniques to
ensure they are responsive to the planning needs. The financial statements
hased on the five year plans would be forwarded annually to the Bank. In
addition, DPAB would be expected to consolidate its accounts for oilfield
capital construction and production [see sub para. (a) above] in submitting
its financial statements to the Bank in order to provide an overall view of
DPAB's financial performance and position.
Costing
3.14     Financial accountability at DPAB is organized under three levels of
cost centers--the bureau, the company and the brigade. DPAB's cost accounting
system is comprehensive and satisfactory. For budgeting purposes, standard
costing is applied. Standard unit costs for DPAB are based on the prevailing
prices except in the case of imported casing and tubing which are subsidized
by MOPI. Intercompany transactions are priced at standard quantities and
costs, while actual quantities are reported by the cost centers which incur
the expenges. Actual costs are calculated at the bureau level and the
variance between the actual and standard costs are allocated to the various
cost centers. Budgeted cost is a major yardstick against which the
performance of the cost centers is being measured, and achievement of cost
targets is one of the basis for bonus reward (para. 3.19). During
negotiations DPAB agreed that separate project accounts would be maintained
for the proposed project, whereby all the expenditures actually incurred for
the project are consolidated at the bureau level.
Financial Reporting
3.15     The financial reporting system at DPAB is satisfactory; reports on
operations and capital development are prepared at the brigade level,
consolidated at the company level and then again at the bureau level. These
include balance sheets and income statements, as well as budget variance
analysis. All statements are prepared on a routine basis each month and are
cumulated quarterly and yearly. The monthly reports are gathered by the
bureau within three days after the end of each month and consolidated to be
transmitted to MOF within 7 days after the end of the month. Annual
statements are furnished to the bureau within 25 days after the end of the
fiscal year and from the bureau to MOPI within 55 days.
Internal Control System
3.16     Procedures used by DPAB demonstrate a high level of internal control;



- 28 -
the segregation of functions is generally satisfactory; many checks and
controls exist to prevent fraud and errors; physical inventories are regularly
undertaken (once a month in each warehouse); inventory of fixed assets is
carried out at least once a year. In addition, DPAB undertakes a regular
review of actual cost against standard/budgeted cost and a detailed variance
analysis is performed.
3.17     While these procedures are generally adequate, DPAB does not have at
present an independent, comprehensive and systematic centralized internal
audit function. Control of fixed assets is performed by the fixed assets
section in the finance department; physical inventory of material is carried
out by the materials company in its numerous warehouses. A financial
discipline group, within the finance department at the bureau level, is in
charge of checking that the financial/accounting practices at DPAB are in line
with the prescribed system of GOC. Such reviews are, however, achieved on an
ad-hoc basis, without a predetermined program and systematic audit
procedures. The financial discipline group is in part constrained by the
limited number of staff (presently only about ten in total) and, for large
reviews, the group has to be supplemented by drawing upon the financial staff
from other units. Under the existing system, there is no provision for an
independent assessment of the effectiveness of DPAB's internal control
system. The need for setting up a centralized and comprehensive internal
audit system was discussed both with DPAB and MOF and MOF will review the
internal audit process in the context of the overall audit policies of GOC
(para. 3.18). This will be followed up during the supervision of the proposed
project.
External Audit
3.18     The GOC's present financial practice does not provide for external
auditing whose scope and depth are in conformity with internationally accepted
auditing standards. The responsibility of reviewing the accounts of state
enterprises in China is currently divided among the line ministry (MOPI), MOF,
the Construction Bank and the People's Bank. A general review of the entity's
financial performance is undertaken on a yearly basis by MOPI; the scope of
the review is mainly limited to the analysis of its achievement in relation to
its targets. Review of specific accounts are performed by the Construction
Bank and the People's Bank. Some periodic checking of limited scope is
performed by the Ministry of Finance. In specific cases, an inquiry can be
instituted by the representatives of the National People's Congress. These
controls, however, do not constitute an independent audit of DPAB's financial
statements.
3.19     The Ministry of Finance is currently addressing this issue and is
setting up an independent audit group within the Ministry to review and
certify the financial statements of state enterprises. Regulations on
auditing will be formulated and the independent audit group may, within two
years, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the State Council. Technical
assistance will be provided for this purpose by several organizations,
including UN and specific bilateral assistance. In the context of this
project, during negotiations GOC and DPAB agreed to have the project account
and PCN1's accounts independently audited and transmitted to the Bank within
six months after the end of each fiscal year.



- 29 -
Incentive System
3.20     Bonus is distributed monthly when the monthly targets for production,
cost, quality and safety, etc. are reached. Bonus amount varies with the
number of targets reached by individual sub-units, the lowest level of which
is a team. The maximum annual bonus for overall DPAB is set by MOPI at 2.7
months of DPAB's average worker salary. For purposes of bonus distribution,
DPAB-s staff is divided into three categories: (i) production workers; (ii)
service workers; and (iii) office staff. Workers directly involved with
production receive the largest amount of bonus while the office staff are at
the lowest end of the bonus scale. However, much more than the monetary
incentives, it is the extensively disseminated work ethics, carefully nurtured
discipline coupled with not an insignificant peer pressure, which accounts for
the very high motivation level in the DPAB petroleum worker.
Insurance
3.21     DPAB insures all its assets with the People&s Insurance Company of
China. Insurance covers all major risks, including explosion and blowouts.
The People's Insurance Company is in turn reinsured with international
insurance companies. These arrangements are satisfactory.
IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01     When the third well in Daqing struck oil in September 1959, China
discovered its largest oilfield. This oilfield located in a geological basin
known as the Songliao basin, which lies mainly in the Heilongjiang province,
has been a prolific producer and its current production level of about 51
million tons of oil per annum accounts for one half of China's total
hydrocarbon production. Since its discovery, this oilfield has produced more
than 530 million tons of oil. The original oil-in-place in the Daqing
reservoirs has been estimated at 3,000 million tons, of which 30% or about 900
million tons is likely to be recoverable by the production technique presently
adopted in the field. Higher recovery efficiency may be achieved if the
reservoir responds favorably to one of the many enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
methods and if this method or methods are economically viable.
4.02     In September 1981 the Government invited a Bank mission to visit the
Daqing area, during the course of which Daqing oilfield development project
was proposed which, inter alia, involved the development of the Gaotaizi (G)
reservoir in Sa½ertu, one of the seven oilfields in Daqing. No oil production
has been obtained from the G reservoir sands in Sa½ertu except for the oil
produced under the two pilot tests setup in 1979 to identify the optimum well
spacing patterns for the reservoir development.
Geology
4.03     The Daqing oilfield is situated in the central portion of the
Songliao basin which is a large sedimentary basin of Mesozoic/Cenozoic age,
covering approximately 25,000 square kilometers. Three distinct and
independent reservoirs; namely, the Sa ertu (S), the Putaohu (P), and the



- 30 -
deepest Gaotaizi (G) can be discerned, each consisting of series of
interbedding layers of sand and mudstones. Separately there are seven high
culminations, sometimes termed as oilfields, in Daqing. While the G reservoir
has been exploited in most of these "fields", it has yet to be developed in
the Sa'ertu oilfield.
4.04     During the development of the Daqing field from 1960-1981, more than
1,000 wells penetrated the G reservoir in the Sa'ertu oilfield. Data
collected from these wells were used in defining the parameters of the G
reservoir. The Gaotaizi formation underlying this area has a gross thickness
of some 300 meters and lies at a depth of 900 to 1,200 meters; its aerial
extent is 99 square kilometers (about 24,500 acres). The formation consists
of dark coloured shales interbedded with numerous thin fine-grained
sandstones. The shales have acted as oil source rocks and oil and gas have
accumulated in the sands. The G reservoir has been divided into four sub-
zones, designated G-I through G-IV. As much as 93 sand beds have been
identified in these sub zones of the project area, but, due to their
discontinous nature, only about half of this number is likely to be
intersected in any one well. The thickness of individual sand beds varies
from a few centimeters up to six meters, but the average thickness is only
about 60 centimeters. Both sands and shales are deposited in a lacustrine
delta and are of lower Cretaceous age. The average sand porosity ranges from
24.2 to 27.2% and the average permeability ranges from 60 to 161 millidarcy.
It is possible that a greater deal of reservoir heterogeneity has been hidden
by the averaging of the data within the sub-zones.
Quality of Oil
4.05     The oil of the G reservoir has a specific gravity of 0.865 (about 32o
API), a high wax content of 24.4% and a very high pour pointl/ of 300 C. Thus
while the oil is fluid in the reservoir (at temperatures ranging from 500 to
550C), it is solid at the ambient surface temperatures most of the year. The
oil, under reservoir conditions, is slightly undersaturated with natural gas
and the solution gas oil ratio is around 44 standard cubic meters per ton
(equivalent to about 200 cubic feet per barrel).
Production Potential and Project Design
4.06     Two small field pilot tests were set up in 1979 in the G reservoir to
test the production potential and select the optimum spacing of the wells.
The first pilot test used a spacing of 150 x 150 meters and the second one
used 250 x 350 meters spacing. Based on the performance of these pilot tests
and a study carried out by the Daqing Research and Design Institute (RDI),
DPAB prepared, in 1981, the feasibility study for the development of the G
reservoir in the Sa'ertu field. RDI estimated the original oil-in-place in
the G reservoir at 137 million tons of which about 51 million tons, amounting
to about 37% of the oil-in-place, would be recovered over a 20-year period.
According to the projections made by RDI, peak production level of 3.8 million
tons per year will be reached after full development and maintained thereafter
1/       The pour point is the temperature at which the oil solidifies, or
conversely, it is the temperature at which a solidified plug of oil
could be "poured" from a tube.



- 31 -
for eight years.  Further, well spacing of 250 x 350 meters was determined to
be more cost effective. In addition, DPAB prepared, in January 1982, an
eight-volume "Plan for Development and Construction of the Gaotaizi Oil
Reservoir in the Sa½ertu Field". This study covers in detail all aspects of
drilling, construction and production engineering as well as proposals for
effective improvements over the entire oilfield including training centers,
EOR methods, studies, etc.
4.07     The above studies were reviewed by the Bank's identification and
appraisal missions. In addition, a technical review of the development plan
relating to the G reservoir, was undertaken by Bank-financed consultants (Core
Laboratories). These reviews and the appraisal of the entity resulted in the
following modification/conclusions. With these changes, the proposed design
will represent the least cost method of developing the Daqing oilfield.
(a)  It was confirmed that on the basis of the existing data, the
most suitable method of developing the G resevoir was by water
flooding, using an inverted nine-spoti/ pattern with a well
spacing of approximately 300 meters. It would, however, be
necessary to monitor the reservoir performance (using the modern
equipment to be financed under the loan) and, if the data so
secured results in a different understanding of the oil
production mechanism, appropriately modify the development plan
and production practices (well spacing, oil withdrawal rates,
water injection pressure and rates, etc.);
(b)  The recoverable reserves and projections relating to the annual
production as estimated by RDI appeared optimistic. According
to the Bank consultants, the most probable scenario was of a
cumulative recovery of 32 million tons, out of an estimated 148
million tons of oil-in-place, resulting in a recovery factor of
about 22%. Further it may not be possible to sustain production
of 3.8 million tons per annum for more than a few years (for
possible production profiles see Annex 4.01). Given the
heterogeneous nature of the G reservoir and the discontinuity of
individual oil sands, it is not surprising that there are
considerable variations in estimates of recovery and production
rates;
(c)  Surface construction facilities as proposed by DPAB, need to be
modified. Consequent to the review of the proposals made by the
consultant, appropriate modifications have been incorporated in
the design. Future detailed studies on improving process flow
of oil, gas and water and on metering of production will be
initiated and their results would be embodied in the project
implementation. There is also a need to study the drilling and
production practices and EOR methods applicable to the Daqing
field (paras. 4.14 to 4.17).
1/       Producing wells are drilled on the corners of a square and halfway
its sides, the ninth well is the water injection well placed at the
center of the square. The distance between any neighboring producers
is 300 meters.

Project Objectives
4.08     The proposed project has three objectives:  firstly, to develop the G
reservoir in the Sa ertu oilfield by drilling and completing about 615 oil
wells and about 206 water injection wells using up-to-date techniques and
modern equipment. The exploitation of the G reservoir will add at least some
32 million tons of oil to the recoverable reserves of the Daqing field over a
period of 20 years. The production of the G reservoir, expected to reach a
peak of 3.8 million tons per annum, would partially offset the overall
production decline to Daqing. In addition, seismic equipment will be provided
to assist in identifying smaller reservoirs around the periphery of the great
Daqing field.
4.09     Secondly, (and more importantly) to use this project as a vehicle for
inducting modern technology into Chinese petroleum industry. This is sought
to be achieved through various complementary modes. Modern drilling and
production equipment will be imported. New operationally oriented research
laboratories will be set up. A computer center will be established which will
assist the oilfield in gathering and processing data and undertaking oilfield
monitoring. Thirdly, to make adequate provisions for the training of Chinese
nationals. Two training centers with an annual capacity of 500 professionals
and 2000 skilled workers will be established. Besides formal training in the
centres and overseas training, on-the-job training will be effected through
service contracts which will be concluded along with the purchase of
sophisticated equipment.
4.10     Furthermore, several studies will be financed under the project with
a view to improving well drilling and completion techniques and optimizing the
design and layout of the surface production facilities. Separately, and in
order to maximize the oil recovery, studies for the G reservoir and the
application of enhanced oil recovery technology will be launched with the
possibility of setting up a field pilot. Further, the loan will finance pre-
investment studies relating to the Zhong Yuan oilfield development project and
other projects in the petroleum sector.

Wenliu oilfield of Zhong Yuan and interpretation of its
results and commissioning feasibility and design study
of an LPG plant in Zhong Yuan. In addition, undertaking
preinvestment studies which may be required for the
preparation of other petroleum projects in China.
Project Implementation
4.12     DPAB will have the overall responsibility for implementing the
project components related to Daqing; MOPI will be responsible for the small
component of Zhong Yuan Oilfield and other studies. Under DPAB's supervision,
PCN1 will be responsible for implementing the portion of the project which
relates to the development of the G reservoir. The development design has
been evolved by RDI which will modify it and update it in accordance with the
results obtained from the reservoir study (para 4.14). Development drilling
will be carried out by the Drilling Company No. 2 and surface facilities will
be installed by a specialized construction company. Drilling and completion
services will be sub-contracted by the Drilling Company No. 2 to the Drilling



- 35 -
Services Company and the Down Hole Services Company respectively. PCN1 is a
well-managed company. Its normal annual work program relating to the drilling
of new wells is in excess of the program stipulated under the proposed
project. Similarly, the relevant drilling services and surface construction
companies have the requisite experience and management capabilities to carry
out effectively their respective tasks under the project. However, for
coordinating and monitoring the development program relating to the G
reservoir, it would be necessary to establish a special project team in
PCN1. During negotiations assurances were obtained that DPAB will establish
such a team in PCN1 by March 31, 1983, which would be headed by a Deputy
Director. DPAB will be directly responsible for implementing the remaining
components of the project, with the exception of preinvestment studies,
including preparation of the Zhong Yuan project. For greater detail see para.
3.04 to 3.11.
Drilling and Production Practices
4.13     Further, during appraisal it appeared that some of the drilling and
production practices currently being applied at Daqing are suboptimal. The
present evidence suggest the need for closer evaluation of field practices and
the desirability of modifying some of them; more so as the need for Daqing are
changing on account of it having reached a mature stage of development. These
issues are dealt with in the ensuing paragraphs.
4.14     Reservoir Study.  The Daqing oilfield is characterized by the absence
of a large acquifer, hence there is no appreciable water drive to supplement
the natural energy.  In addition, the reservoir oil is unsaturated with gas by
about 20 atmospheres and the compressibility of the reservoir system (oil,
water and rock) is quite low in view of the shallow depth. Hence, the
production methods at Daqing throughout its 20-year history have involved
injecting water in the reservoir, keeping the reservoir pressure at or above
the original level, in an attempt to improve the recovery efficiency. It is
estimated, however, that more than 70% of the oil will be left in the ground
if only the water flooding is applied. In order to increase the recovery
efficiency of Daqing, it is necessary to fully understand, monitor and control
the reservoir behaviour. A reservoir engineering study is needed whereby the
geological characteristics of the many oil sand beds are investigated, their
continuity or discontinuity between wells established, and their conductivity
to oil and water measured in the laboratories and the field. Data collected
in the field on individual wells behaviour and production patterns over time
will supplement mathematical models and laboratory measurements. The result
of the reservoir study should help optimize production and injection rates,
suggest the most economical well spacing, and propose remedial measures to be
taken to-minimize the by-passing of oil by water. The loan contains financial
provision for undertaking this study with the assistance of qualified
expatriate consultants. Its results and consequent impact on the project
design will be reviewed with the Bank; the study will be completed by December
31, 1983.
4.15     Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).  Daqing oilfield has reached a mature
stage in its life, the water cut is increasing and the overall production
level is anticipated to decline. It is, therefore, necessary to evaluate the
relevance and applicability of various EOR methods. However, application of
these methods to a large reservoir such as Gaotaizi involves substantial



- 36 -
financial outlays and carries considerable technical risk, particularly in
view of the characteristics and uncertainties of many EOR processes. Before
considering any field application, it would be necessary to undertake a staged
feasibility study which would follow the classical approach of: (a) screening
the various processes; (b) conducting a feasibility study; (c) running
laboratory experiments; and (d) applying one or more processes on a pilot
scale. The data collected from the reservoir study would constitute an
important input for the EOR pilot design. The first three stages of the study
would be completed within one year of its initiation (by December 31, 1983);
the EOR pilot design and its application would be carried out over the next
two years. The results of all four stages and further course of action would
be reviewed with the Bank; the study will be completed by December 31, 1985.
4.16     Review of Process Flow Design and Optimization of Surface Facilities.
The Daqing crude oil has a wax content of 24% and a pour point of 3OoC. The
handling of the oil is particularly difficult in view of the severe winter
conditions in the area. Moreover, the water cut of the produced fluid in
Daqing is averaging 60% and it is increasing. Oil-water emulsion is treated
with heat, chemicals and high electric voltage. The oily water separated from
the produced fluid is cleaned and mixed with additional water from nearby
sources and the resulting mixture (in excess of one million barrels per day)
is reinjected in various oil reservoirs to sustain their pressures. The
volume of the fluids (oil, water and gas) is indeed immense and the amount of
energy spent in heating and moving them is quite high. Besides, the accuracy
and frequency of the metering of the individual production/injection wells is
essential for reservoir monitoring and performance prediction. Further,
reservoir damage could result from injecting water incompatible with the
reservoir fluids or at a temperature low enough to adversely affect fluid flow
in the reservoir. However, prior to ordering equipment and material, it is
necessary to carry out a detailed design study relevant to the production
problems of Daqing. A proto-type station could be assembled thereafter and if
found cost effective, similar improvements could be replicated in other
production centers. The proposed loan contains a provision for the design
study, and for metering, separation, dehydration and pumping equipment and
instrumentation for at least one station. DPAB has agreed to undertake such a
study through qualified consultants. The results of the said study will be
reviewed with the Bank and the consequent plan of action will be agreed upon;
the study will be completed by July 31, 1983.
4.17     Drilling and Completion Practices.  High density mud is used in
drilling the Daqing wells in an attempt to control high pressure in relatively
shallow zones. The mud weight used in Daqing appears too high for the
formation pressure; likewise, cement slurry density needs to be lowered.
Further, the drilling rigs should be equipped with mud tanks to ensure proper
monitoring of fluids going into and out of the wells. The drilling and
completion practices adopted in Daqing may lead to formation damage and may
also necessitate resorting to fracturing of the reservoir which may otherwise
be unnecessary. DPAB has agreed to appoint consultants to review the above
aspects with a view to evolving by May 31, 1983, a package of field practices
consistent with the needs of Daqing and modern petroleum technology. The
proposed study would be financed out of the proceeds of the loan and its
findings will be reviewed with the Bank and further course of action will be
agreed upon.



- 37 -
Implementation Schedule
4.18     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4.02.  Because
of the severe weather conditions in the area, the drilling of wells is done
between the middle of April and early November and surface construction must
cease by December. Drilling of the wells will start during 1982 and the total
of 821 wells will be drilled by the end of 1985. The implementation plan was
reviewed with DPAB so as to reduce the time gap between completion of the well
and production of oil. This would require accelerating the construction of
surface facilities. The revised implementation schedule would be reviewed
during negotiations. It is expected that the entire drilling and surface
construction program would be completed by the end of 1985 and the estimated
full production capacity of 3,800,000 tons could be reached by 1986.
Project Costs
4.19     The proposed project is estimated to cost an equivalent of US$674.3
million, including physical and price contingencies, of which US$228.4 million
or 34% represents the foreign exchange component. A physical contingency of
7% was applied to the cost of all imported equipment and materials and 15% was
applied to all local costs. A relatively low physical contingency rate was
applied to foreign costs in view of the fact that most of the imported
equipment provided under the project has already been identified. The basic
cost estimate is based on 1982 prices; price escalation both for local and
foreign costs have been assumed at 8% for FY 82 and 83, 7.5% for FY 84, 7% for
FY 85 and 6% for FY 86.
4.20     The overall project cost is much lower than similar projects in other
developing countries due to: (a) the long experience and good planning in
constructing similar projects in Daqing; (b) the utilization of local
equipment with relatively low level of depreciation allocated by DPAB as
compared with international drilling and construction contractors; and (c) the
extremely low level of salaries and wages in China (the salary of a toolpusher
is about one hundredth of his counterpart in U.S.A.). The cost of imported
equipment was estimated according to budget estimates provided by suppliers in
December 1981 and January 1982.
4.21     For estimating the cost of consultant services (466 man-months) for
special studies and technical asistance, a man-month rate of US$17,000 was
assumed for personnel based in the home office and US$20,000 (which is
inclusive of travel and subsistence) for staff assigned to China. These rates
are deemed to be both reasonable and in line with current charges prevailing
in the petroleum industry. The cost of laboratory analysis, specialized
equipment and services, and computer time was added to the straight man-month
costs wherever such services were required. The cost of service contracts for
highly specialized equipment such as formation and production logging,
cementing and fracturing equipment are included in equipment costs.
4.22     The estimated project cost is shown in the following table.  Annex
4.03 gives a detailed breakdown of the project cost.

Project Financing
4.23     It is proposed that the Bank loan of US$162.4 million equivalent be
made to the Government of China for a period of 20 years inclusive of a grace
period of five years, which are the standard country terms. GOC will onlend
$153.9 million to DPAB on the same terms and conditions under a subsidiary
loan agreement. Foreign exchange risk and variable interest risk will be
borne by DPAB.
4.24     The proposed Bank loan represents 71% of the foreign exchange cost of
the project and 24% of the total project costs. The uncovered gap of $66
million represents the cost of tubular goods and could be covered if DPAB
secures suppliers' credits for these items. In the event suppliers' credits
1! Includes import duties (estimated at 15% of the cost of foreign goods)
amounting to $28 million.



- 39 -
do not become available, GOC/DPAB will cover the foreign exchange gap from its
own resources. All local costs equivalent to US$445.9 million (Yuan 802.5
million) will be provided by GOC/DPAB.
Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
4.25     The proposed Bank loan of US$162.4 million would finance 100% of the
foreign expenditure for consultants' services and training programs, 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of imported goods with the exception of casing and
tubing for which no Bank financing will be provided, and 100% of the local
cost (ex-factory) of equipment which will be supplied from local sources under
ICB. Annex 4.04 provides a detailed breakdown of the allocation of Bank loan.
4.26     Disbursement of the Bank loan for:  (a) material, equipment, metering
and instrumentation for the production stations; and (b) EOR pilot test is
contingent upon the completion of the relevant feasibility studies and its
review by the Bank.
4.27     Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected as follows:
IBRD Fiscal Year                1983      1984        1985         1986

A high rate of disbursment is foreseen for FY 84 since most of the equipment
and services will be purchased in that year. Annex 4.05 provides a detailed
breakdown of the disbursement schedule.
Procurement,
4.28     Drilling and construction work would be carried out by force account
(DPAB's own force) with Bank financing only goods and services. This practice
has been shown to be cost effective (para. 4.20). Goods and services financed
under the proposed Bank loan would be procured by international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank guidelines or by limited
international tendering (LIT) or by direct purchase. ICB procedures would be
mostly suited to equipment produced by many manufacturers, such as drilling
and workover rigs, drilling tubulars and materials, oil-gas separators and
treaters. It will be appropriate to use limited international tendering for
highly specialized or proprietary equipment of formation and production
logging, cementing and hydraulic fracturing, seismic equipment and submersible
pumps; in each case quotations will be requested from qualified international
contractors known to provide such equipment. In view of the high percentage
of proprietory and specialized equipment provided under this project it is
foreseen that disbursement under ICB and LIT would represent about 40% and 50%
of the total loan respectively. In addition direct purchases for spares,
equipment and instrumentation costing less than US$150,000 equivalent may be
procured through direct purchase up to an aggregate amount of US$5 million (3%
of the Bank loan). All bid packages having value of US$500,000 or above would
be subject to Bank review prior to contract award; other packages would be
reviewed subsequently.

Training
4.29     The project covers the establishment of two training centers, one for
professionals and one for skilled workers with an initial annual capacity of
500 and 2,000 trainees respectively. The training centers would provide
and/or secure:
(i)   basic training for skilled workers and would offer courses in
drilling, production, well logging, cementing, mud,
instrumentation, pipe fitting, welding, laboratory, etc.;
(ii)  professional training in various areas of petroleum engineering
(except drilling engineering which is offered at Shengli),
petroleum economics, systems analysis, geology and geophysics;
(iii) periodic refresher courses for both professionals and skilled
workers to ensure that they keep abreast of the latest technology
and techniques;
(iv)  language courses, especially for professionals and specialists
selected for foreign training;
(v)   foreign training of selected professionals and inviting foreign
specialists to the Daqing training centers; and
(vi)  equipment, training aids, laboratories, teaching material and
other facilities necessary for imparting various categories of
training envisaged under the said centers.
4.30   In addition to formal training in the centers (for details see Annex
4.06), on-the-job training of professionals and technicians would be
accomplished through: (a) professinals working closely with consultants hired
to conduct various studies on reservoir engineering, EOR, drilling and
production practices and surface process engineering; and (b) technicians
working under the supervision of expatriates hired through service contracts
to operate and maintain equipment supplied under the proposed loan.
4.31   DPAB has agreed to build a training center for skilled workers in the
Daqing field with a covered area of approximately 2600 M before October 1,
1983. DPAB will also equip this center with a complete drilling rig, workover
rig, pumping units, welding sets, and other locally available relevant
material and equipment. The professionals' training center will be attached
to the existing Daqing petroleum Institute and enough space should be provided
for this purpose. Bank-financed consultants have undertaken a preliminary
study of the existing training program at DPAB and the recommended curricula
are outlined in Annex 4.06. Assurance were obtained from DPAB that it would
undertake a study by training experts to design the detailed training
curricula and teaching methods at DPAB. The study would be completed by
January 31, 1984 and findings would be reviewed with the Bank and the
consequent action plan agreed upon. Further, to ensure that this training
center has access to appropriate and modern teaching methods and materials,
DPAB intends to enter into collaboration with a foreign university for a
limited period of time.

Laboratories
4.32   DPAB-s need for refurbishing existing laboratories and/or establishing
new laboratories was reviewed by a Bank consultant (French Petroleum
Institute). It was considered necessary to distinguish between laboratories
which would carry out operationally-oriented research under RDI and the field
laboratories with various companies which perform purely operational
functions. For laboratories under RDI additional equipment will be provided
for: (i) pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) analysis for oil and gas; (ii)
special core analysis; (iii) core wettability and imbibition; and (iv)
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (para. 4.15). In so far as the field laboratories
are concerned, the equipment in the mud, cement and fracturing laboratories
were found adequate. The project, however, caters for establishing an oil,
gas and water analysis and evaluation laboratory with PCN1. The equipment for
the latter laboratory would be basic in nature which would permit the company
to undertake routine testing necessary for the execution and control of the
project.
Computer Facilities
4.33   The existing computer at Daqing is inadequate for the oilfield
requirements. However, before selecting new computer and anciliary software,
it would be necessary to determine the precise functions which need to be
computerized, the appropriate size and configuration of computer(s) required
to perform these functions and the availability and type of software
required. A Bank consultant joined in the post appraisal mission (mid-May,
1982) to help in assessing these needs and drawing up a requirement sheet to
be used as a basis for soliciting bids for hard and software. Summary of the
consultant-s report is shown in Annex 4.07.
Project Risks
4.34   The Gaotaizi resevoir has been penetrated by over 1,000 wells which
were drilled to exploit other reservoirs in the Sa'ertu field. Such a large
number of control points should normally provide enough assurance of the
recovery rate. However, the Gaotaizi oil sands are thin, tight and
discontinuous streaks dispersed in deltaic mud stone. Estimates of
recoverable reserves vary from over 50 million tons to 29 million tons and
less; but the project is highly profitable even with the lower, conservative
estimates (see para. 6.06). Further, the utilization of modern equipment
supplied under the Bank loan and the provision of technical assistance for
various studies would reduce operational risks, improve oil recovery
techniques and help increase the recovery efficiency to reach the higher level
estimate.
4.35   The project carries operational risks inherent to the petroleum
drilling and production industry. The low level of safety practices adapted
in the drilling operations and the absence of the blow out preventers from the
well head aggravates risks to human life and equipment. For attenuating these
risks a review of DPAB-s safety practices is envisaged under this project.



- 42 -
Ecology and Safety
4.36     The DPAB drilling and production operations pose a minimal threat to
the ecology. Oil and liquid wastes would be the major concern. However, all
such wastes are kept in closed systems and treated before disposal. Safety
measures, as currently practised in Daqing, appear inadequate. Drilling rigs
lack blowout preventors and explosion proof lights; there is inadequate care
and protection of electric power cables; and the derrick floors are dirty and
poorly organized. Fire prevention equipment is minimum and seems insufficient
to prevent or contain a major oil fire. Even such safety regulations as
exist, are seldom enforced in the field. The incidence of accidents is
relatively high.
4.37     The Bank has expressed its deep concern over the problem of safety in
Daqing. It was agreed that a Bank-financed safety expert well versed in the
petroleum industry standards would visit Daqing and report on his findings for
the improvement of safety in the oilfield operations. The study will be
completed by June 30, 1983; the Bank and DPAB would review the consultant's
recommendations and come to an agreement on a plan of action.
Reporting Requirements
4.38     Annual and quarterly project progress reports would cover:  (i)
technical progress; (ii) cost estimates, expenditures and disbursements; and
(iii) management and operations. The purpose of these reports is to provide
information on: (i) physical work accomplished during the reporting period;
(ii) comparison of the actual progress of construction and related costs with
the original estimates; (iii) the expected dates of completion of the
principal physical elements of the project, and (iv) improvements including
operating efficiency resulting from the implementation of the consultants-
recommendations emanating from the various studies. The format and content of
the progress reports were discussed and agreed at negotiations.
V. FINANCES
Introduction
5.01     Given DPAB-s diversed activities, the scope of project entity
appraisal has been limited to oilfield operations and this chapter covers the
related financial aspects.
5.02     DPAB performs a triple role for GOC; it is GOC-s largest producer of
crude oil; one of GOC's larger fiscal providers; and indirectly, a foreign
exchange provider. Since DPAB is operating in a centrally planned economy in
which all the factors of production are tightly controlled, two fundamental
aspects - financial autonomy and performance measurement - differentiate DPAB
from a similar enterprise in a market economy. While DPAB enjoys considerable
operational autonomy, it is far more constrained in financial autonomy.
Specifically, GOC (i) sets DPAB's annual production and net income targets;
(ii) approves DPAB-s operational and investment budgets; (iii) sets
regulations for the conduct of DPAB-s financial management; and (iv) sets
detailed reporting requirements with which DPAB has to comply. DPAB-s



- 43 -
performance is measured on the basis of product output under given budget
parameters, rather than on profitability. Fundamental differences exist
between some of the DPAB practices and the financial accounting practices of
commercially oriented petroleum enterprises (para. 3.12 and 5.05). Under
the'se circumstances, any assessment of DPAB's financial performance based on
financial norms usually applied to a similar enterprise in a market economy
would be of limited significance. Financial appraisal of DPAB has therefore
been concentrated on costs (para. 5.07) and cash generation (para. 5.08),
together with internal controls (para. 3.15), budgetary controls (para. 5.04)
and incentive system (para. 3.19).
5.03     The basis for DPAB's financial operations is the annual budgets and
in this respect:
(i)  DPAB is required to prepare an annual investment and field
maintenance budget to meet the production target set by MOPI. The
plan is subject to the approval of both MOPI and the State Planning
Commission.
(ii) DPAB is required to prepare an annual operating budget based on the
targets set by MOPI. The target parameters focus mainly on
production level, costs, and net income, on a monthly, quarterly, and
annual basis. The budget is prepared in detail down to the level of
brigade and is reviewed and consolidated at the operating company and
then at the bureau level. The consolidated budget of DPAB's overall
operation is subject to the approval of MOPI and review by MOF.
(iii) DPAB's level of working capital is set by MOPI who allocates the
funds to DPAB free of charge. In the event that requirements exceed
the approved levels, DPAB can borrow additional funds on a short term
basis from the People's Bank; the current interest rate for these
funds is 3.6% per annum.
5.04     Reflecting GOC's requirements, DPAB's financial and accounting
operations have special features, the principal of which are summarized below:
(i)   DPAB's production is marketed as directed, and at prices fixed by
GOC. No price distinction is made between crude sold for the
domestic market and crude sold for export. As regards the latter,
DPAB is required to sell crude to a GOC Agency, who in turn resells
it on the international market. Current price paid to DPAB for crude
is Y100 (US$55.6) per ton which is about 30% of current international
price of US$200 per ton for similar crude.
(ii) DPAB is permitted to charge as expense sums up to approved yearly
budget limits (under two main categories)- for field maintenance,
1/ Oil field uphold funds - based on a certain unit cost of planned
production: these funds may be used for new investment; unused funds may
not be carried forward to future years.
Oil field overhaul funds - based on a certain percentage of gross fixed
assets; these funds may be used for maintenance and repairs. Unused funds
can be carried forward to future years.

renewal and development before computing net income. Over the last
three years these expenses have on average amounted to about 11% of
net revenues. However, given the declining rate of production from
the Daqing field, such expenses are expected to increase
substantially in the future since they are DPAB's main sources for
field maintenance and development.
(iii) DPAB is required to transfer all net income and 50% of annual
depreciation to GOC. The balance of depreciation is retained by DPAB
for new oilfield investment; unused funds can be carried forward
beyond the budget year.
(iv)  GOC covers the approved cost of exploration, and also makes specific
contribution to development. Other development costs are met by
DPAB, as noted in sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii).
Past Finances
5.05     A summary of DPAB's financial performance for the three-year period
FYs78-80 is given below. These figures are based on the current accounting
practices of DPAB; further details are given in Annexes 5.01 and 5.02.

5.06.    Despite a modest growth in sales revenue over the period FYs78-80,
net income showed a slight decline; FY78--US$2,137 million, FY79--US$2,061
million and FY80--US$2,015 million. The stabilization of crude production at
about 50-51 million tons per year was only achieved at increasing cost. The
higher costs of extracting oil from a field which has been operating for over
20 years were reflected in a 37% increase from US$11.14 per ton in FY78 to
US$15.28 per ton in FY80. Since prices did not accompany the increased costs
of production, DPAB's margins on crude decreased from US$47.16 per ton in FY78
to US$43.52 per ton in FY80. Nevertheless, despite crude prices which were
well below international levels, and declining margins, DPAB-s transfers of
funds to GOC have been substantial.
5.07     DPAB's financing arrangements for field production facilities have
been sound. Over the period FY78-80, DPAB has financed from its own resources
82% of the outlay (US$1.1 billion) for the investment in and maintenance of
the production facilities of the Daqing field and over the same period has, in
addition, transferred to GOC US$6.4 billion from surpluses and depreciation
charges (see para. 5.05 (iii)). Taking into account GOCs direct contribution
of US$200 million to investment over the three year period FY78-80, the ratio
of Government take to overall outlay in the field was about 5.6:1. This ratio
would be much higher if the State sales tax (US$435 million) and the profit on
the export of DPAB's crude were to be taken into account. A statement of
actual funds flow between DPAB and GOC us given in Annex 5.06.
Capitalization
5.08     DPAB does not have any long term debt.  DPAB's capitalization is
represented entirely by GOC contributions and retained funds from internal
cash generation. As of end-FY80, DPAB's net worth in the oilfield totalled
US$1.2 billion representing US$1.1 billion in field production assets and
US$0.1 billion in working capital.
Investment and Field Maintenance Program FY81-85
5.09.    In an effort to arrest the production decline of the Daqing oilfield,
DPAB has prepared an investment and field maintenance program totalling about
US$4 billion covering the five-year period FY81 through FY85; this outlay,
which represents almost a threefold increase in the average annual outlay for
the period FY78-80, would include the drilling of about 5,000 wells and
construction of the related service facilities. The proposed G reservoir
project, which is estimated to cost US$674 million, would form part of the
program and would represent about 17% of the total program cost. The
tentative financing plan for the program, as provided by DPAB, is as follows:

DPAB's projections assume that with the proposed outlay, production levels of
the overall Daqing field will be maintained until at least 1986 at about 50
million tons per year which is slightly lower than current production (51.75
million tons). DPAB's estimated production figures are as follows:
Total
FY81-85      FY81    FY82    FY83    FY84    FY85

The reservoirs of the Daqing oilfield are complex and the producing sands are
heterogeneous. Only when the proposed program of assistance to DPAB is well
underway will it be possible to determine how the reservoirs have been
exploited or to predict how the field will respond to new practices and
particularly the new enhanced recovery methods which are being considered by
DPAB. DPAB's forecast of production could be quite realistic. However, for
the purpose of financial forecast, it has been assumed that the production of
crude from the existing field would decline by 7% per year after FY82, but as
from end-FY83 production would be supplemented by crude from the G reservoir.
Pricing
5.10     Crude at Daqing is presently priced by COC at US$56 per ton, which is
common to most of the oilfields in China (para. 2.32). On the basis of this
price, it is estimated that DPAB could continue to finance its operational and
maintenance costs, as well as a portion of its investments, and still provide
surpluses, although on an increasingly reduced scale to COC within this
decade. Based on the assumptions that production would continue to decline by
7% p.a. and production costs increased by 9% p.a. from FY86 on, DPAB's
contribution is projected to decline significantly from the present level of
US$2 billion annually to about US$440 million by FY90. Taking account of the



- 47 -
rising costs of oil extraction in the country, MOPI has recently proposed an
increase in the price of crude to US$97 per ton throughout China. The impact
of such a price increase on DPAB would be to significantly increase its fiscal
contribution to GOC. As an example, in 1985, this contribution could be about
US$2.8 billion compared to about US$1 billion based on the existing price.
DPAB's operating ratio in 1985 using the existing price would be about 54%
against about 31% should the above increased price be effective in that year.
5.11     Based on the conservative forecast of production and the increased
prices of crude from FY84, DPAB's estimated financial performance for the
period FY81-85 is expected to be as shown below. Detailed forecast financial
statements (Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Sources and Application of
Funds Statements) are given in Annexes 5.03, 5.04 and 5.05.

5.12.    The forecasts indicate that until the revised crude price is
introduced in FY84, DPAB-s annual net income would continue its decline: in
FY82 by 7% and in FY83 by 16%, over previous year's level. Following the
price increase, net income would increase by 115% in FY84 as compared with
FY83; however, a resumption of the annual decline would follow after FY84, as
a result of the continuing increased cost of extracting oil from the field.
Estimated unit costs of production of crude would be expected to increase by
64% from about US$16.5 per ton in FY81 to about US$27.3 per ton in FY85 (see
Annex 5.07). Margins per ton of crude would be as follows:

5.13.    Over the five-year period to FY85, DPAB would continue to cover the
bulk (82%) of its own investment and field maintenance requirements (see
para. 5.10) and continue to make large contributions (US$10.9 billion) to
GOC. However, taking into account GOC's proposed contribution to investment
of US$576 million, the ratio of GOC's take to total outlay would only be
2.7:1, almost one-half of the ratio for the three year period FYs78-80 (see
para. 5.08). A statement of estimated funds flow between DPAB and GOC is
given in Annex 5.06.
G Reservoir Development Project
5.14.    Production of crude from the G reservoir which is expected to
partially offset the decline in production from the overall Daqing field will
commence in late FY83, and reach a peak of about 3.8 million tons in FY87. At
that time, the G reservoir should be contributing about 9% of the production
of the overall Daqing field. DCF rate of return on the project is estimated
at 36% (in real terms) over the life of the project. Comparative production
figures for the G reservoir and the overall Daqing field for the period
FY81-85 are given below:

5.15.    Notwithstanding that depreciation charges per unit of production for
the G reservoir in its early production life will be substantially higher than
those for the overall field, the unit costs of production of the G reservoir
are expected to be lower; this is due to G reservoir's higher initial
productivity rate per well. Comparative unit costs of production for the
overall Daqing field and the G reservoir for the period FY84-85 are given

Performance Measurement
5.16     Within the context of financial arrangements in China, DPAB-s
finances are sound; DPAB has produced, and on present prices should continue
to produce, large surpluses. It has a very high self-financing ratio, a low
operating ratio, and as of now no long term debt. On present arrangements,
DPAB, by most standards, warrants a high credit rating. However, since DPAB
is not operated on a typical commercial basis, its financial performance
especially in regard to operating efficiency cannot be measured in the same
manner as a commercially oriented enterprise, and the application of the
Bank's normal financial covenants would be of limited significance.  For these
reasons, it would be difficult if not impossible to formulate meaningful
overall quantitative performance covenants.  The internal control system at
DPAB is satisfactory (para. 3.15) and bonus reward is being tied in with
performance (para. 3.19).  Nevertheless, the various studies provided by the
proposed project are directed at improving the operational efficiency of DPAB
and the implementation of the recommendations resulting from these studies
would be followed up during the supervision process (Chapter IV).
5.17     The overall benefits which will be brought to DPAB through the
proposed loan cannot be measured in terms of financial targets monitored
through financial covenants. The main benefits will not be seen during the
implementation period of the project but will accrue over a wider span of time
from a large number of improvements of a technical nature and at a micro level
in DPAB's operations. Eventually, however, they will accumulatively show
themselves, through higher production than would have been otherwise, a
lengthening of the production life of the Daqing field and lower costs of
individual technical operations.
5.18     DPAB is a large and complex organization.  PCN1, a sub-unit of DPAB,
has overall responsibility for developing the G reservoir from which all the
quantifiable benefits of the project are derived. PCNI is a large oil company

by any measure, with its current annual output in the order of 10 million
tons. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from DPAB that it would
review with the Bank by October 1 of each year, starting from 1983, the
current and projected finances of PCN1, focusing in particular on its trend of
production costs, budget variance analysis, as well as its future investment
program and related financing arrangements.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Background
6.01     The development of the G reservoir of the Daqing oilfield will
provide China with incremental supply of oil for domestic consumption and/or
export, and of gas for domestic use in a petrochemical plant. The project
will also upgrade the level of technology and skills in petroleum engineering
and geophysics. The Government has placed a high priority on this
development. While the project is the least cost method to develop the G
reservoir (see para. 4.07), lack of sufficient knowledge of the alternatives,
makes it impossible to prove or disprove that it represents the best available
alternative to increase petroleum production in China. Nonetheless, the
project is highly attractive according to all economic criteria (see para.
6.06).
Project Costs
6.02     The costs of the project include the capital expenditures (86% of
total project costs) and operating costs directly related to the development
of the G Reservoir, including: (i) the oil producing and water injection
wells; (ii) the oil gathering and transportation system; (iii) the gas
gathering and treatment facilities; (iv) the water injection system; (v)
utilities; and (vi) housing. For the purpose of economic analysis, the costs
of cement and steel, the two major inputs, have been shadow-priced at
international values with conversion factors of 1.1 and 1.7 respectively. In
addition, the power component of the operating costs has been shadow-priced at
YO.20/kwh to reflect the scarcity of electricity in China. However, domestic
labor (3% of total production costs) has not been shadow-priced in the light
that skilled workers wages are deemed to be representative of their values,
and unskilled labor costs constitute only a nominal portion of the total
production costs. The official exchange rate at the time of appraisal ($1 =
Y1.8) has been used for all conversions. All costs are expressed in constant
1982 dollars.
Project Benefits
6.03     The main quantifiable benefit from the project will be the production
of crude oil. For the purpose of economic evaluation, crude oil value has
been estimated at the current international price of $200/ton. This price is
assumed to increase thereafter by 3% per year in real terms. Freight costs
from Daqing to the closest port have been estimated at $5 per ton. The gas is
valued at the Btu equivalent of naphtha ($0.28/M3) which it replaces as a
petrochemical feedstock. The production profile for the base case has been



- 51 -
taken according to the consultant's most conservative estimate of production
from the reservoir; these estimates are summarized below:
Table 6.01: Base Case for Economic Analysis
1984  1988    1992    1996
Oil Production (000 metric  ton)               1122  3542    1790    1107
Gas Production (Million m )                      48   152      751       47
Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value of Project Benefits
6.04     Detailed economic analysis is shown in Annex 6.01.  Based on the
above assumptions, the economic rate of return would be 91%. The net present
value, at a 12% discount rate, is estimated at $2.4 billion over the life of
the project. These values are high partly because this is a petroleum
development project which benefits from the "sunk costs" of exploration in the
Daqing Oilfield.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.05     Due to several uncertainties in regard to the reservoir behavior, and
especially concerning the recovery ratio (see para. 4.07), sensitivity tests
were performed. These tests indicate that should the recovery be 70% of the
base case, the economic rate of return would be 67% and the present value of
the net economic benefits would be $1.5 billion. Should the project incur
cost overruns by 20%, the economic rate of return would be 79% and net present
value $2.3 billion; in the worst case, where the project is delayed by one
year, incurs 20% cost overruns, and where the recovery is only 70% of the
expectation under the base case, the economic rate of return would be 58% and
the net present value of economic benefits $1.4 billion, indicating the
attractiveness of the project even under pessimistic scenarios.
Other Benefits
6.06     The project will also benefit China in a number of ways.  The use of
modern equipment and laboratories, as well as the important training component
and other technical assistance will allow the transfer of petroleum technology
to China. It is estimated that, annually, about 500 professionals and 2,000
skilled workers will receive advanced training under this project in all
aspects of petroleum engineering and geophysics. These benefits are expected
to have a considerable induction effect throughout the country, as Daqing is
currently one of the prominent centers for theorectical and practical
education in petroleum industry in China.

- 53 -
(k) it would undertake through qualified consultants a study on
safety measures, review the findings and agree with the Bank a
plan of action; the study will be completed by June 30, 1983
(para. 4.37).
7.02     Conditions of disbursement would be:
(a)  the first three stages of the study on EOR be completed and the
findings reviewed with the Bank prior to any disbursement for
implementation of the field pilot (para. 4.15); and
(b)  the study on process flow design and optimization of surface
facilities be completed and the findings reviewed and agreed
upon with the Bank prior to any disbursement for the production
stations (para. 4.16).
7.03     A condition of effectiveness would be that a satisfactory onlending
arrangement be established between GOC and DPAB (para. 4.23).
7.04     Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $162.4 million to the People½s
Republic of China. The loan would be for a term of 20 years including a five-
year grace period.

Daging Oilfield Gaotaizi Reservoir Development Project
Gaotaizi Reservoir Performance 1/
and Expected Production Profile-
1.        The reservoir oil has a viscosity of 9.2 cp and is undersaturated
by about 20 atmospheres. The oil formation volume factor is 1.116 reservoir
volumes pe,r stock-tank volume. The pour point of the stock-tank oil is about
300C. Special handling procedures will be required to keep the produced oil
above this temperature. It is also likely that reservoir cooling will occur
near water injection wells. This could require injecting relatively warm
water initially to displace mobile oil around the injection wells.
2.        Parameters for picking net rock in the source document appeared
reasonable if somewhat conservative. Net isopach maps were presented in the
source document from Zones G-1 through G-1V. These maps were planimetered
and average rock and fluid properties were used to verify the oil in place
reported in the source document. The calculated oil in place was 171 MM m3
compared to 159 MM m3 reported in the source document.
3.        A water cut vs recovery curve presented in the source document
can be matched using a Dykstra-Parsons type calculation, the approximate
average properties of the 20 layers presented in the source document, and
a high sweep conformance factor. The averaging of properties within 20
layers in conjunction with the discontinous nature of the sands makes this
recovery curve an optimistic prediction. It should probably be viewed as
the upper limit of what might be achieved in the reservoir.
4.        In contrast to the above statements, the reported performance of
two pilot water injection projects in the field has been very good. Although
it is still early in the recovery life of these projects, the data available
indicate the pilots are performing better than would be predicted using the
water cut vs recovery curve that is considered to be optimistic.
5.        Additional water cut vs recovery curves were developed in this study
using the 20-layer data and less optimistic conformance estimates. Time-
rate projections were made for three of these cases.

ANNEX 4.01

A time rate projection was presented as an illustration in the source
document, and annual oil production rates were tabulated for the first
eight years of the projection. These projections were based on an inverted
nine-spot pattern, which does appear to be the best pattern for fieldwide
program. The total reservoir scheme requires 615 producing wells and 206
injection wells.
6.        The overall injection scheme for the reservoir is consistent with
the nature of the rerservoir and the parameters presented in the source
document. However, the time-rate performance presented for this scheme does
not appear to be consistent with the basic engineering parameters presented
in the report.   The time-rate performance indicates an oil rate of 3.8 MM
tons per year will be maintained for 8 years after a development period.
This rate is the maximum flowing capacity rate for the field based on an average
well rate of 20.6 tons/day, 300 producing days per year, and 615 producing wells.
Since water breakthrough is anticipated after only 2.5 percent of the oil in
place has been produced, this rate must decline. Even with pumping, it will
not be possible to maintain the plateau rate for 8 years. Using the pump per-
formance curves shown in the source document, our calculations indicate the
plateau rate will be maintained for only about 2 years.
7.        In addition to the time-rate forecast for the base performance case,
two additional cases were time rated. These cases incorporated lower confor-
mance values that are thought to be better estimates for the total reservoir.
Economic projections were made for all cases using the annual operating and
investment costs from the source document. The results are as follows:
Net
Areal Sweep    Vertical Sweep    Economic          Oil         Cash      Net PV at

1          80               100             18           36.2         4832         2344
7          80                80             15           29.4         3894         2006
9          60                80             12           22.0         2828         1568
The Base Case is the source document case, and Case 1 is Core Lab's time-
rate projection based on the same water cut vs recovery relationship. Our
forecast shows significantly less recoverable oil and consequently less
favorable economics; however, all of the cases show positive cash flows and
positive present values at a discount rate of 10 percent per year. A realis-
tic production profile (variation of case 7 above) is shown in the following
table. All production forecasts presented in this report do not take into
account probable positive future response of the reservoir to enhanced recovery
technology.

Most likely case
8.        Careful monitoring of production and injection operations in this
reservoir is very important. A supervisory control system should be con-
sidered in any planned monitoring system. The general features of such a
system are presented within the discussion section of this report. Surface
injection facilities should be designed to allow maintaining surface sepera-
tion of the produced water and supply (makeup) water. A gas blanket should be
maintained in each water storage tank to prevent bacteria formation and to
control corrosion. The proposed surface production facilities for the Gaotaizi
reservoir are inefficient because recycling of produced fluids would be exces-
sive, and the first-stage separation pressure would be too low. An alternate
plan presented in this report should allow more efficient handling of production
from an engineering standpoint. Economic and engineering feasibility of the
plan of operations cannot be compared in detail with any alternative plan due
to the lack of supporting data.

drilling, cementing, perforating, treating, production, and injection
operations.

Notes on Training for Workers
and Professionalsl/
A. Workers' Training
1.      The training center for Daqing should strive to provide the training
needed to assure that workers learn their particular jobs well, and perhaps the
jobs of those with whom they work closely. This means training drilling crew
personnel to do the various jobs on a drilling rig. The loggers and cementers
should be taught the information and procedures they will need to do logging
and cementing, including only the amount of science and mathematics needed to
get the job done.
2.      The training center for workers should be organized on the basis of
many short courses - one to eight weeks - designed to meet specific objectives.
A one-week course could cover the needs for refresher training of a worker
familiar with fishing tools and techniques, while an eight-week course will be
necessary to train a new production worker or welder. The training courses
recommended for the period of field development (1983 - 85) are designed with
the idea of teaching workers how to work efficiently and safely in their jobs,
how to properly care for the equipment with which they work or must maintain,
and to learn something of the jobs of others working in adjacent areas, for
examples, those jobs to which they might be promoted, or whose duties they
might have to perform in an emergency.
3.      It is not clear that the Technical High School and that part of
the training center to be devoted to worker training will be one and the same.
The sort of training needed for workers at Daqing does not call for three years
of schooling. However, the three-year program will remain useful. A person
completing its prepared program will be ready for a short course in instrumenta-
tion or communications to prepare him for a position requiring considerable skill
and knowledge of theory. On the other hand, a three-year course seems overskill
for the preparation of workover, production, and drilling crew personnel.

4.      The attached recommended training programs (Table 1) are intended
to cover the training needs for most workers during the three-year period of
intensive field development. The programs are also intended to be conducted
at the Daqing training center, although there is no good reason they cannot be
conducted at any location having satisfactory facilities. Some subjects are
not suggested as curricular items for the training center as they are not
specifically petroleum industry related. Such subjects include driver training
for trucks and tractors, diesel engineer mechanics and boiler men. Some of
these trades should be touched on during courses that pertain to jobs that
involve them - boiler men on a drilling rig location, for example.
B. Professionals Training
5.      The Petroleum Institute at Daqing which will house the facilities and
supply this faculty for professionals training is quite impressive. The curricu-
lum for petroleum engineers is reasonable, the student teacher ratio is quite
favorable, the library contains few hundred thousands of volumes and one thousand
journals, half of them in foreign languages.
6.      There is apparently little use being made of adult "refresher courses"
for professionals (engineers, geologists and geophysicists) among Daqing operating
people. The training center's proposal for professional level refresher courses
will be a new concept for almost all of these people. The overall level of compe-
tence at Daqing among the petroleum engineers needs improving, as indicated by
the operational practices followed (excessive mud weight, use of excessive pres-
sure when cementing, failure to run a common SP log for depth correlation when
running a series of open hole well logs and performing drilling and completion
operations without the use of blow out preventors). Lack of any training in
project economics and project evaluation undoubtedly handicaps the engineers.
7.      The training program proposed by Daqing Petroleum Bureau in Volume V
has been considerably modified. The length of a semester has been cut from 6
months to 3 months (to permit more people to be trained more rapidly), the number
of courses offered has been substantially increased, and the emphasis of the
training has been shifted from research to operational problems. Also, the scope
of the training center activity has been broadened to accommodate the training
needs of geologists and geophysicists, as well as petroleum engineers (detailed
program is shown in Table II). It is hoped that the facility will be large
enough to allow professionals to return for additional training about every
three years. (This would represent about 8% of their time devoted to training).
Note that no courses are offered for drilling engineers on the understanding that
these will be trained at the East China Petroleum Institute, at Shengli Oil Field,
in Shang DongProvince.
8.      Estimated cost for workers and professionals training is shown in
Tables III and IV.

CHINA
Daqing Oilfield Gaotaizi Reservoir Development Project
Design of Computer Network1/
Improved Petroleum Recovery Inc. (IPR) has been retained by the World
Bank to provide technical assistance to the Peoples Republic of China. The
purpose of the mission to China and subsequent work which has bee  conducted
was to survey existing computer facilities at Daqing and Dong-pu_2 oil fields
to discuss and evaluate computer needs with relevant personnel, and to gather
information necessary to develop a suitable detabase for each field.
Additionally, the mission included consultation with the Ministry of Petroleum
Industry, Daqing Bureau and the staff at Dong-pu on views concerning computer
requirements to provide support for petroleum exploration and production. The
following recommendations for computer hardware and software acquisition and
training of key technical personnel are being made as a result of site visits
and evaluation.
(i)       The existing computer facilities are inadequate tohandle
the problems involvved in modern exploratin, reservoir
engineering and reservoir management and the existing
equipment is not compatible with technology computing
requirements and should be reassigned elsewhere.
(ii)      A dedicated seismic processing facility for the Daqing
processing facility should be purchased. All support
software for the seismic package should be purchased to
allow the staff at the Daqing Research Centre to work on
complex reservoir modelling and control problems.
(iii)     The computer facilities at Daqing should be arranged in
another processor network with two computers located at the
research facility and two computers located at the
supervisory center.
(iv)      The Research Center should contain two identical
processors, each of which should be augmented by an array
processor to increase the effective computing capacity.
(v)       The four processors in the Daqing network should be
connected in a local area computer network. The minimum
transfer rate on this network should be 50 K baud. This
will require special line treatment between the research
and supervisory centers if both remain at their present
-/ Summary of Bank consultant study.
Dong-pu is the old name of Zhong Yuan.

locations.
(vi)      A single CPU system, of the same type used at the Daqing
Supervisory Center, should be adequate for the internal
computer installation at Dong-pu.
(vii)     Every output device in the system should be capable of
producing Chinese characters. This restricts line printer
output to be of dot matrix type with plotting capability.
(viii)    A universal terminal should be used so that volume purchase
techniques can be applied. A single terminal type improves
reconfiguration possibilities and simplifies maintenance.
(ix)      Environmental control (air conditioning, humidity and dust)
should be provided at each computer site - uninterruptible
power supplies should be used to minimize computer down
time due to power fluctuations.
(x)       The Daqing facility should keep an inventory of 95 percent
spares and the staff should be trained to perform routine
maintenance functions. A service contract for major
repairs should be obtained for all hardware (except
terminals) for a five-year period after installation.
(xi)      The operating system software for the Daqing network and
the Dong-pu network facility should be standardized.
(xii)     Application software recommended for the computer systems
must be capable of meeting the needs for sophisticated
field, reservoir and geological studies. To meet these
neets, the following software packages are recommended:
(a) Database Management System.
(b) Graphics Software.
(c) Petroleum Engineering Applications Library.
(d) Numerical Simulations Models.
(e) General Engineering Program Library.
(f) Statistical/Mathmetical Library.
(g) Economic Evaluation Programs.
(h) Geological-Petrophysical Routines.
(i) Seismic Data Processing.
(xiii)    The training of the engineering staff at Daqing and Dong-pu
in the use of the new computer equipment would be crucial
to obtain maximum benefit from the computer system. An



- 78 -                      ANNEX 4.07

extensive testing and training program is recommended.
A full scale facility should be constructed in this country of origin
of the applcation software prior to shipment of equipment to the Peoples
Republic of China. Training of hardware and software personnel should be
conducted on this site with a small group of engineers selected from both
sites. Trained individuals should then be able to assist in more
comprehensive training efforts when the system is installed in China.
The importance of developing a knowledgeable staff cannot be over-
emphasized. The hardware and software systems which have been recommended are
very modern and extremely powerful. If the system is not used to its capacity
or is improperly managed due to inadequate training, the sophistication built
into the system will not be realized. Figure 1 identifies the network layout
recommended for Daqing and Dong-pu.
A detailed cost estimate for the system described above including
training and maintenance is provided in the body of this document. The total
for this system (Daqing and Dong-pu) is 20.13 million U.S. dollars.
