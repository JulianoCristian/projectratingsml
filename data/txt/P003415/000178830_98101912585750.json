oilfield\n            practices to the Chinese oil industry. The project will do\n            this by drilling oil and water injection wells; installing\n            water injection stations and other surface utilities;\n            providing facilities for oil treating and transportation,\n            and gas gathering, treating and handling; and providing\n            laboratories, consultants (466 man-months) and staff\n            training to improve the efficiency of oilfield practices. An\n            important feature of the project is the series of studies\n            and surveys aimed at improving operations and planning of\n            future investments in the petroleum subsector. The main\n            quantifiable benefit of the project is the increased\n            production of oil and gas, but the project also aims to\n            achieve a significant transfer of modern technology to China."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
