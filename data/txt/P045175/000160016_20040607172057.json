There\n            is no change to the project description. The original\n            project development objectives are to: (1) improve\n            population health status and well being in three pilot\n            Governorates through universal coverage to a basic package\n            of primary health care and public health services; and (2)\n            improve access to efficiency and quality of primary health\n            care services in three pilot Governorates. It is proposed to\n            amend the project development objective by removing\n            \"universal coverage\" as an explicit development\n            objective as there have been delays in passing the universal\n            health insurance law, and to limit the coverage to two\n            Governorates instead of three. The proposed project\n            development objectives would thus read: \"The objectives\n            of the Project are to expand health coverage with a basic\n            package of primary health care and public health services to\n            the poor population in two pilot Governorates and improve\n            access and efficiency of primary health care services\n            through rationalization of health infrastructure in two\n            pilot Governorates.\""}, "docdt": "2004-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
