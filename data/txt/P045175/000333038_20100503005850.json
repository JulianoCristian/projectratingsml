Institutional and stakeholder\n            analyses are essential during the design of the reforms and\n            to inform decisions during implementation about when to\n            intervene and when not to. Stakeholder consultations can\n            help to flag possible resistance and solutions. Information\n            and outreach to all stakeholders and the public to explain\n            the reforms, the benefits of the reforms, and how the public\n            will be affected should be an integral part of the reform\n            process. The presence of a local reform team with the\n            willingness, technical capacity and political support to\n            lead the process is also important to ensure success. Since\n            health reform usually takes place over a long period, it is\n            important to assess fully the political economy of reform\n            and to prepare a proactive plan to address this issue,\n            including generating evidence that reforms work and\n            enlisting key stakeholders in the system that are vested in\n            the reforms and likely to remain on place. The piloting and\n            sequencing of reforms are important implementation\n            modalities to maximize the chances of success. Collaboration\n            between several ministries may be essential to develop an\n            effective tool to identify the poor. There is a need for\n            clear criteria to identify the poor and outreach/awareness\n            campaigns to inform people about the exemption policy and\n            the procedures to be followed."}, "docdt": "2010-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
