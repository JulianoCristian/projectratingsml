                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to progress satisfactorily towards meeting its development objective. Improvement in the timeliness and quality of services provided by the registration offices is
                         evident thus resulting in most of the project targets already achieved. The Land Administration and Coordination and Advisory Board provided the long term strategy in fulfillment of
                         the covenant that such a strategy be delivered to the Bank by June 30, 2011. The social and customer survey completed in 2010 showed that the users of the system report
                         significant progress. The President of the Union of the Real Estate Experts provided his professional view confirming the positive impact of the project and satisfaction with the
                         LARIS software providing on-line access to query land registration information. Examples were given of the Sarajevo land register serving real estate markets very well, facilitating

                         registration requests from all but two registration offices, Mostar and Banja Luka, where the aim is still to finish removal of the backlogs by the end of the project. However, recently
                         some backlogs have re-emerged in three offices, Visoko, Zenica and Tuzla, raising concerns over the operational sustainability of those offices. Work that was piloted to complete

                         Srpska. Following the slow start, due to delayed tendering process, a major extension of all contracts was requested and approved. Reason for extension was underestimation of
                         original number of properties in tenders.

                         The new law on the cadastre in the Republika Srpska, which came into force in June 2011, changed the institutional responsibilities for the registration of property rights and
                         maintaining the cadastre to be under one unified agency - the Geodetic Authority (GA). Shortly afterwards 16 of the 19 courts handed over their land books, staff and some resources
                         to the GA so that they could commence operations under the new law. However, challenges to the law have been made to the Constitutional Court and the remaining three courts are
                         awaiting the final result of the challenges before handing over their records. The RS government has developed a revised law to address the concerns of the Constitutional Court and
                         this revised law is currently being considered, and is scheduled to be adopted within the next month.
