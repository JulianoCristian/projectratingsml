The key results achieved were\n            as follows: (1) in 16 courts, including Sarajevo, 80 percent\n            of all transactions are resolved in five days or less and\n            mortgages are registered within a day; (2) 1.9 million\n            hectares of cadastre maps have been digitized, exceeding the\n            project target of 1.4 million hectares; (3) improvements in\n            service delivery and to the physical infrastructure of 37\n            offices, and corruption opportunities have been largely\n            eliminated; and (4) new legislation covering land\n            registration, spatial planning, cadastre, property taxation,\n            and regularization of informal developments had been drafted\n            and some enacted during the period of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T07:56:05Z"}
