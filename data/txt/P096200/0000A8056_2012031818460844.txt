                         Implementation Status Overview

                         majority of maps (covering 1,4 million ha in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH)) and land register records (a total 1,598,416 land registry folios) have been digitized. IT systems have been
                         introduced and WEB access to records will have been provided to clients by the end of the project. Nearly all the land registration offices (24 offices in FBH representing 104% of the
                         target and 16 in RS representing 100% of the target) have been renovated and reorganized according to new business plans and standards. As such, the timeliness and quality of

                         services provided by the land registration offices in both Entities have greatly improved. In the RS 53% of the registration offices register mortgages within a day and in the FBH 39%
                         of the offices register mortgages within a day. In the FBH 85% of the registration offices register mortgages within 5 days. This is a significant decrease from the average of 65 days
                         in the FBH in 2007. The client surveys commissioned in 2010 confirmed significant increase in user satisfaction with services provided.
