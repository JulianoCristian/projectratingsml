                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project continues to progress satisfactorily. As of December 9, 2010 56% of the funds have been disbursed. The backlog of registration cases have been substantially
                         reduced overall, and the most impressive progress has been achieved in large courts, such as Banja Luka, Tuzla and Mostar. Renovation works have helped to improve the working
                         conditions and service provision in land registration offices and to certain extent in cadastre offices. Digitizing of records has proceeded well, both for the digitizing of land book folios
                         and the cadastral maps. The expected outputs for the whole project are already over 90% achieved, and it is expected that all targets will be achieved before the end of the project
                         period. In the Republic Srbska (RS) the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) have coordinated the establishment of "Land Books on-line" and the public can now access any information about

                         The results of the Cadastral Survey work in the FBiH are found to be excellent. The work in pilot sites has helped the MoJ and GA to assess the best methodologies for completing
                         cadastral work and harmonization of the cadastre records with the legal records, and now they have a good approach for completing this work across the Entity. Unfortunately, similar
                         efforts in RS have been unsuccessful because of their inability to complete the tenders and this issue does cause serious concern. In both entities the GAs signed contracts for
                         further development of their Cadastre information systems. There is a significant delay in both entities in finalizing their ICT Strategies (with the exception of the RS GA).
                         The change in legislation in the RS which is currently underway, which will effectively give responsibility for the cadastre and registration of property rights to the GA as a single
                         agency, is delaying the development of concepts for the long term strategy, thus delaying the draft policy and strategy document for the land administration sector in BiH. This draft
                         policy and strategy document is a loan covenant, which was due by the end June 2010, and has still not been met.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As there is still some doubts over the long term strategy because of the imminent legal changes in the RS, it was agreed that the draft policy and strategy document be presented to
                         the Bank by June 30, 2011.
                         The possibility that the work on systematic registration in RS is not concluded during the course of the project has implications for agreement of the methodology for undertaking this
                         work in the second phase of work. The RS government is requested to address this issue as a matter of urgency.
