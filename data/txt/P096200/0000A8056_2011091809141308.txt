                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well and is on track for meeting the development objective. A recently completed social and customer survey shows a good level of customer statisfaction
                         and recognition of the improvements that have occurred over the last few years. Civil society groups confirmed this impression and customers interviewed during field visits were also
                         satisfied. The one exception was in the Banja Luka office, where there is still some complaints about the speed and quality of service. Backlogs at most offices have been removed,
                         with the exceptions of Mostar and Banja Luka, and for most offices registration requests are processed satisfactorily in a few days. Work that was piloted to complete cadastral work
                         and harmonize records between cadastre offices and land book offices has been successful in the federation and is underway in the Republic Srpska.

                         The recently approved law on the cadastre in the Republic Srpska will change the institutional responsibilities for the registration of property rights and maintaining the cadastre.
                         These will now be under one unified agency under the Geodetic Authority. The visiting team were satisfied that the Geodetic Authority were in a good position to undertake this very
                         challenging task. In both entities information system development is progressing well and good progress is being made to fully automate both land book and cadastre operations.
