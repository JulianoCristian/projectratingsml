           Land Registration Project are as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate and\n            both Bank and borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned were: (1) Focus in the early stages of\n            similar projects in land registration development should be\n            on establishing the functioning system rather than on the\n            covering data. (2) In a country with limited IT capacity, an\n            incremental, inclusive and compliant ICT development\n            approach is the best practice. (3) Locally based real estate\n            registration systems are no longer feasible in the 21st\n            century. (4) An extensive results framework can be a\n            positive factor in project implementation. (5) Focus on what\n            is achievable and build on successes."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
