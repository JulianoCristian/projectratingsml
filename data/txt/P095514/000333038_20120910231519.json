As of\n            August 15, 2012, the loan has disbursed nearly US$170\n            million or about 80 percent of total proceeds. Overall\n            progress in project implementation is good. The targets set\n            for some indicators such as the number of trained and\n            evaluated workers have already been exceeded. The\n            reallocation is necessary primarily to reflect some changes\n            in the administrative procedures associated with project\n            implementation. The method of contracting the orientation\n            and employability youth workshops was changed from\n            consultancy services to the use of a standard set of fees,\n            as used by other training courses. The Ministry hired fewer\n            consultants than planned because of a decision to\n            incorporate gradually temporary staff into its formal\n            structure. The Ministry also decided to finance some\n            expenditures envisaged under the project using national\n            resources in order to simplify internal procedures.\n            Moreover, the number of trained workers (financed under the\n            expenditure category of fees) has exceeded the project\n            target. In addition, the initial amount assigned to category\n            seven (youth stipends) was conservative as the youth\n            employment program was new and its pace of implementation\n            uncertain. In practice though coverage targets have been\n            exceeded. Finally, the Ministry has decided to focus its\n            efforts to promote the provision of second chance education\n            to workers and youth on supporting the provincial education\n            systems, instead of special projects."}, "docdt": "2012-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
