The\n            reallocation is necessary because the Borrower has claimed\n            reimbursements for almost 100 percent of category 7. The\n            initial amount assigned to category 7 was conservative as\n            the youth employment program was new and its pace of\n            implementation was uncertain. Progress on installation of\n            the program is in line with the expectations set out in the\n            project appraisal document (PAD). The reallocation requested\n            by the Borrower represents only 10 percent of total project\n            costs and will not affect the satisfactory performance on\n            the achievement of the project's development\n            objectives. The expenditure categories financing output\n            based activities are unchanged. Since the Ministry of Labor\n            is managing the project through its existing structure fewer\n            consultants have been hired than expected. In addition, in\n            the case of some expenditures (operating costs, equipment,\n            and educational materials), the Ministry of Labor has\n            decided to use local resources."}, "docdt": "2011-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
