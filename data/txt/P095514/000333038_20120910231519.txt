2.    As of August 15, 2012, the loan has disbursed nearly US$170 million or about
80% of total proceeds. Overall progress in project implementation is good. The targets

                                            3
set for some indicators such as the number of trained and evaluated workers have already
been exceeded. It is expected that most if not all targets set for the project will be met or
surpassed by the time of the closing date of December 31, 2013. Results on the outcome
indicators which measure the employment and/or salary gains achieved by participants in
the lifelong learning system of the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security
are also positive for trainees, certified workers, and youth. Equally important, the
Ministry has recently made periodic tracking of these results using robust and timely data
bases for registered employment and salaries a routine part of their internal procedures.
In response to difficulties in obtaining information on adult education certifications – an
important component of the lifelong learning system and the project – the Ministry
recently has decided to organize a special effort of school visits to obtain the data with
the objective of ensuring that the target and the disbursements related to this output are
realized by the closing date. For the youth employment program, the coverage targets set
out in the project have been surpassed, but efforts need to be stepped up to identify more
internship placements for the participants as well as to articulate better the contributions
of the various departments of the Ministry to provide the needed services, including
training and job search assistance and referrals to potential employers.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary primarily to reflect some changes in the
administrative procedures associated with project implementation. The method of
contracting the orientation and employability youth workshops was changed from
consultancy services to the use of a standard set of fees, as used by other training courses.
The Ministry hired fewer consultants than planned because of a decision to incorporate
gradually temporary staff into its formal structure. The Ministry also decided to finance
some expenditures envisaged under the project using national resources in order to
simplify internal procedures. Moreover, as mentioned above, the number of trained
workers (financed under the expenditure category of fees) has exceeded the project
target. In addition, the initial amount assigned to Category 7 (youth stipends) was
conservative as the youth employment program was new and its pace of implementation
uncertain. In practice though coverage targets have been exceeded. Finally, the Ministry
has decided to focus its efforts to promote the provision of second chance education to
workers and youth on supporting the provincial education systems, instead of special
projects. The expenditure category financing output based activities is unchanged.
