                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project aims at supporting the Government of Argentina to consolidate, strengthen, and increase the coverage of a lifelong learning and competency-
                         based training system for disadvantaged adults 18 years or older with the objectives for those who participate to: (i) enhance employability (for unemployed); and (ii)
                         improve career opportunities (for employed).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress on most key outcome and intermediate indicators is good and project targets seem likely to be met by the December 2013 closing date with only two exceptions. In the
                         case of education certifications for Component B, Adult Education, there is still a shortfall in performance relative to the target, believed to be due primarily to the problems in
                         accessing information on certifications, although there has been some improvement recently as a result of the special efforts being made by the Ministry of Labor to collect

                         program, the number of participants in internships to date is only about 40,000, less than a third of the 145,000 expected by the end of the Project. In spite of the significant shortfall
                         in internships, an analysis by the Ministry of Labor,comparing employment outcomes of the participants with a similar group in the employment survey, suggests that their results are
                         substantially better. The main priorities for the youth program are to improve the coordination with other parts of the Ministry(especially training and employment services),promote

                         the participation in high quality activities of the Program, and strengthen the identification of internships. In addition, the Bank team recommended that the exit strategy for youth be
                         reviewed in order to permit youth who complete the certification of their secondary school degree to continue for a limited time in the Program as long as they participate in activities
                         which would facilitate their labor insertion or improvements in job quality and to transmit key information on the program to the employment offices which are implementing the
                         program. During the March 2013 visit, the Ministry indicated that actions are being considered in several areas including improving the content of the initial workshop, modifying some
                         of the incentive payments to focus on results, instead of only attendance, particularly for adult education activities, and concluding an agreement with the Old-Age Health Program to
                         provide internships. The Ministry has advanced in the preparation of an analysis of the results of training courses by combining survey and administrative data.
