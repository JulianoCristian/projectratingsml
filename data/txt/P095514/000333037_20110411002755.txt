2. 
The Loan was declared effective on January 11, 2008. To date, nearly $90 million or 
about 45% of the total amount of the Project has been disbursed. Progress on most key 
outcome and intermediate indicators is consistent with the targets set out in the Project 
Appraisal Document. The competency-based training and certification system has been 
expanded to cover additional sectors and occupational categories. To date, 264 occupational 
norms have been registered, compared to the end- of- project target of 300. The number of 
workers who have received competency-based training courses has nearly reached the end-
of-project target, and the number of workers who have received certification is on track.  
Improvements in adult education are being supported in 7 provinces, slightly more than 
initially estimated, and certification of education level has been documented for 15,000 
adults, compared to the target of 25,000 set for end 2010. In the case of the Youth 
Employment Program, to date about 160,000 youth have registered for the Program in 150 
municipalities. Compared to targets, respectively, of 600,000 and 250 by the end of the 
Project.  Satisfactory progress has been achieved in organizing the basic workshops for the 
Program and in making referrals to services for those who want to complete their education.    
3. 
The proposed reallocation is necessary because the Borrower has claimed 
reimbursements for almost 100% of Category 7. The initial amount assigned to Category 7 
was conservative as the Youth Employment Program was new and its pace of 
implementation was uncertain. As noted above, progress on installation of the Program is in 
line with the expectations set out in the PAD. The reallocation requested by the Borrower 
represents only 10% of total Project costs and will not affect the satisfactory performance on 
the achievement of the Project’s Development Objectives. The expenditure categories 
financing output based activities are unchanged. Since the Ministry of Labor is managing the 
Project through its existing structure fewer consultants have been hired than expected. In

addition, in the case of some expenditures (operating costs, equipment, and educational 
materials), the Ministry of Labor has decided to use local resources.
