                         Progress on key outcome and intermediate indicators is good, except in Component B, Adult Education. Although the informationreceived on adult education certifications has
                         improved, it is still well below target. As a result, the Ministry of Labor hasdecided to organize a special effort to collect information on adult certifications through supervisor visits to
                         the schools in theprovinces which account for the largest share of adult students. The Bank will be updated on the organization of these efforts andtheir preliminary results in mid-

                         September 2012. In the case of the youth employment program, an analysis by the Ministry ofLabor,comparing employment outcomes of the participants with a similar group in the
                         employment survey, show that their results aresubstantially better. The main priorities for the youth program are to improve the coordination with other parts of theMinistry(especially
                         training and employment services), pace expansion in order to ensure high quality services, and to ensure thatthe program indeed reaches the most disadvantaged. The need to
                         identify more internships also remains a priority. Financialmanagement has improved in the project. A reallocation of loan proceeds was requested by the Government and agreed by
