                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project aims at supporting the Government of Argentina to consolidate, strengthen, and increase the coverage of a lifelong learning and competency-
                         based training system for disadvantaged adults 18 years or older with the objectives for those who participate to: (i) enhance employability (for unemployed); and (ii)
                         improve career opportunities (for employed).

                         The loan has been completely disbursed and the last remaining amount is being documented for the special account. Progress on most key outcome and intermediate indicators is
                         good and Project targets seem likely to be met by the December 2013 closing date. In the case of Component A (Competency-Based Training and Certification System) all targets
                         have been met with the exception of the number of certified training institutions. It is likely that the group of institutions which remain to be certified in order to reach the target will

                         reach that level by March/April 2014. In the case of education certifications for Component B, Adult Education, 70,000 certifications have been recorded compared to the target of
                         100,000. However, it is expected that once data for the 2013 school year is submitted (March/April), the target will be met. In the case of Component C, the youth employment
                         program, the number of participants in internships to date is about 70,000, only about half of the 145,000 expected by the end of the Project. In spite of the significant shortfall in
                         internships, an analysis by the Ministry of Labor comparing employment outcomes of the participants with a similar group in the employment survey, suggests that their results are

                         substantially better even if not all of them have participated in an internship. The main priorities for the youth program are to improve coordination with other parts of the Ministry
                         (especially training and employment services),promote participation in the high quality activities of the Program, and strengthen the identification of internships, particularly in the
                         private sector. In August 2013, the Ministry made some changes in the regulations relating to the Program which were consistent with Bank recommendations. These included
                         permitting youth who complete the certification of their secondary school degree to continue for a limited time in the Program as long as they participate in activities which would
                         facilitate their labor insertion or improvements in job quality and a modification of incentive payments to focus on results, instead of attendance, particularly for adult education
                         activities. The Ministry has completed the preparation of an analysis of the results of training courses by combining survey and administrative data. The study is particularly valuable
                         because it distinguishes impact by type of course.
