Project for Argentina were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: getting the system's\n            structure and technical content right was a process that\n            took time and involved some trial and error. The ministry of\n            labor's (MoL's) commitment to learning and\n            improving before scaling up was a key factor to success, and\n            contributed to the strong results for project activities.\n            Employment and training policy became a priority given the\n            resumption of economic growth, employment creation, and\n            improved fiscal performance after the decline of\n            competiveness during the 1990's and the economic crisis\n            of 2001-02. Without the recognition of the training program\n            as part of government's policy to improve the\n            employability and employment outcomes of low skilled and\n            unemployed workers, it is unlikely that an effort of the\n            current magnitude will have emerged (as is the case in most\n            countries where efforts to cover vulnerable populations tend\n            to resemble a patchwork of projects rather than a structured\n            program). To sustain the interest of industry and employers,\n            the MOL worked with sector councils to ensure they had\n            flexibility to tailor training programs to fit industry\n            needs (that is, course duration, training length, trainer\n            profile, training location, etc.) while meeting overall\n            competency-based training and certification standards.\n            Implementing a competency-based training and certification\n            system that truly reflects industry demands is a complex\n            task that requires working with a multiplicity of sectors\n            and many stakeholders within each sector. The output based\n            disbursement mechanism proved effective for financing agreed\n            outputs that the MoL decided to move the payments for\n            evaluation and certification services to disbursement modality."}, "docdt": "2014-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
