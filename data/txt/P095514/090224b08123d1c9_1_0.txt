Implementation Status Overview
Progress on key outcome and intermediate indicators is good, except in Component B, Adult Education. In addition, largely because of a significant shortfall in the identification of
work internships for the participants in the youth employment program, employment outcomes for this component are below target. There has been substantial improvement in the
>   management of procurement procedures. While there has also been some progress in strengthening financial management of the project, weaknesses persist.
