                         The higher-level objective of the Cear# SWAp II project is to contribute to expanding and consolidating the social advances and institutional modernization of the State
                         of Cear#. The project will achieve this by supporting nine key government investment programs in five sectors, selected to optimize development impact. A series of
                         disbursement-linked indicators (14) are mapped to the five sectors#public sector management, education, health, water & sanitation, and business environment &
                         innovation#to strengthen the incentives to achieve results.

                         Specifically, the project development objectives are to
                         # help the Government of Cear# to improve its fiscal situation;
                         # strengthen the state#s system of results-based management;
                         # promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and health;
                         # improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the government autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery; and
                         # reduce barriers to business investment.
