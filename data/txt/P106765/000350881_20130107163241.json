{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Ceara Second Sector Wide\n            Approach (SWAP) Inclusive Growth Project for Brazil were as\n            follows: overall outcome was satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, and both the Bank\n            and the Borrower performance were satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) Coordination is a challenge. The\n            project's success owed much to the strong role played\n            by Ceara Economic Research Institute (IPECE) in conducting\n            monthly project meetings and following up as problems arose.\n            Nevertheless, fifteen partners pushed the limits of what\n            could be managed effectively. (2) Beware the use of outcome\n            indicators that may readily escape government control. (3)\n            Secondary indicators proved to be a useful innovation of the\n            project to retain a focus on an important outcome metric\n            when attribution fidelity was lacking. (4) Coordination\n            between distinct levels of government can be particularly\n            fraught. This problem underscores the importance of\n            restricting indicators, so far as possible, to\n            actions/activities substantially controlled by the client.\n            (5) Extraordinary efforts are warranted during project\n            design to reduce information asymmetries. (6) How much\n            flexibility is too much? Some flexibility is warranted for\n            the World Bank to approve modifications or extensions to\n            meet performance targets. However, a high degree of\n            flexibility risks undermining the performance incentives of\n            the targets. The Bank should consider stipulating in the\n            project documentation that major accommodations must be\n            justified by factors fully beyond Government of Ceara control."}, "docdt": "2012-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
