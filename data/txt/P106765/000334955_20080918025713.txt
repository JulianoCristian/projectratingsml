The higher-level objective o f the Ceara SWAP I1 project i s to contribute to expanding and
consolidating the social advances and institutional modernization o f the State o f Ceara. The
project will achieve this by supporting nine key government investment programs infive sectors,
selected to optimize development impact. A series o f disbursement-linked indicators (14) are
mapped to the five sectors-public      sector management, education, health, water & sanitation,
and business environment & innovation-to       strengthen the incentives to achieve results.

Specifically, the project development objectives are to

     0 helpthe Government o fCeara to improve its fiscal situation;
     0 strengthen the state's system o f results-based management;
     0 promote better service quality ineducation (particularly early-childhood literacy) and
       health;
     0 improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency o f the
       government autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery; and
       reduce barriers to business investment.

OP/BP 4.01    -EnvironmentalAssessment.         The Project classification i s Environment Category
B, since no major infrastructure investments will be supported by the program. The
environmental assessment concluded that the project's main potential environmental impacts are
related to the improper handling, collection and disposal o f medical waste, and temporary
localized impacts related to basic infrastructure investments. A Health Waste Management
Strategy and an Environmental and Social Management Framework have been prepared to
address these impacts. Moreover, the SWAP I1 loan will continue strengthening the
environmental management departments inthe state o f Ceara.

OP/BP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement. The basic infrastructure services financed by the
project are focused on the expansion and connection o f existing households to water and
sewerage networks. These investments are not expected to cause physical displacement o f
people.   Still, a draft Resettlement Framework has been prepared by the Borrower. This
framework i s in line with the requirements o f OP4.12. This framework specifies the policy and
planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria that will be followed if the
need for resettlementkind acquisitions should arise. The framework specifies that affected
peoples will be properly informed o f their choices, regardless o f tenure status.

OP/BP 4.10 - Indigenous Peoples. The Project's Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP) in
health and education will include beneficiaries self-identified as indigenous peoples. Thus, a
separate Indigenous People's Framework was developed. A process o f consultation on this
framework was organized. The preliminary information considered in the Project design builds
upon the Plan Distrital de Saude Indigena 2008/2010 and the Secretaria de EducaGfio
2007/2010.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. COUNTRYAND SECTORISSUES

1.      Ceara, one o f the poorest states in Brazil, has made solid progress in improving both
economic and social indicators in recent years. Between 1985 and 2006, the State's GDP
(currently ranked 15th in Brazil) grew by an accumulated 95.1%, well above the Brazilian
average (71.0%). From 1992 to 2005, the average years o f schooling per adult in Ceara rose by
50.0%, out-performing the Northeastern growth rate (42.9%). Other social indicators, including
infantmortality and life expectancy, also have shown significant improvement over the last two
decades.'

2.      Notwithstanding this recent progress, the state faces significant challenges. Poverty levels
are still unacceptably high in Ceara, with more than half the population (53%) living below a
poverty line of % minimumwage, and more than a quarter (26%) below an extreme poverty line
(Vi minimumwage). It i s evident that sustaining social inclusion gains and obtaining a substantial
reduction in current poverty levels will require more rapid economic growth. Fittingly, the
present administration, inaugurated inJanuary 2007, has placed a greater emphasis on "inclusive
growth," while maintaining a commitment to develop further the good public sector management
practices adoptedby its recent predecessors.

3.      The Ceara Government has asked for the Bank's support to implement its Inclusive
Growth Strategy. This operation i s the second Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) loan of an APL, a
follow-up to the Ceara SWAP Iloan. The first SWAP supported implementation of the state's
development agenda, including numerous sectoral investments, from 2004 to 2007. The
innovative design of the project elevated the importance o f results-basedmanagement ("Gest6o
por Resultadd') and provided an important model for inter-sectoral and inter-institutional
management of key programs. The current operation will preserve many of the SWAP I
sectors-including     education, health, and water & sanitation-as            these are closely linked to the
policy priorities of the new State Government. Inaddition, the SWAP I1will expand beyond the
social sectors to address issues of growth and competitiveness.

4.       Policies to improve education and health have both a social inclusion and a growth
dimension. Ceara's Inclusive Growth Strategy builds upon the improvements in education and
health supported by the first SWAp. The Growth Strategy also maintains a focus on improving
the fiscal positionof the state, including steps for result-basedpublic sector efficiency gains. The
new elements of Ceara's Growth Strategy that are supported by the SWAP I1 include: (i)
strengtheningthe businessclimate through measures such as business-relatedone-stop shops and
streamlined business registration; and (ii)        promoting innovation, particularly though expanded
broadband internet access outside of the state capital, Fortaleza. The Government's growth



  According to IBGE, the infant mortality rate in the State of Cearh was 30.8 per 1,000 births in2006, down from
35.1 in 2002. The Northeast region showed similar improvement, from 41.4 to 36.9 over the same period. Life
expectancy in Ceara rose from 66.9 years in 2002 to 69.9 years in 2006, slightly better than the Northeast region
average, which increasedfrom 66.4 to 69.4 over the same period.

strategy aims to improve the state's human and physical capacity as a means to attract the
business community to locate inCeara, particularly to areas outside the capital regione2

5.        The state's policy priorities are reflected inits Multi-Year Budget Plan (Plum Plurianual
2008-2011 - PPA), approved by the legislature in December 2007. The PPA is a form o f multi-
year program budgeting, with corresponding results indicators. It aims to focus budgeting and
public administration on cross-cutting outcomes rather than sector-driven inputs. This operation
will support priority programs selected from the PPA, with loan disbursements linked to
performance-based indicators.

6.        Ceara's fiscal position i s sound. Fiscal accounts have improved in part through current
expenditure restraint---e.g., personnel expenditures (47% o f net revenues) have been kept well
below the limit imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (60%). In addition, the Government
has succeeded in raising revenues. The growth of revenues during 2003-2006 was 25 percent in
real terms, and tax revenues-the             most important revenue item-grew                   by 22 percent during the
same period. Ceara i s one o f the states inBrazil with a relatively low debthevenueratio (0.57 in
2006, tenth best out o f 27). However, significant debt service payments are projected through
2010. Debt service per year i s expected to remain near R$750 million (of which R$250 million i s
interest), and the authorities are seeking to boost public investment spending to a similar level as
part of the inclusive growth strategy. Enhancing economic growth is expected to lead to fiscal
strengtheningthrough relatively buoyant revenue collection.

7.        The present operation will continue to support the fiscal sustainability objective o f the
previous SWAp. The positive fiscal results obtained by the state over the last five years have
created an opportunity to redefine the fiscal indicators for the SWAP I1 to reflect the growth
orientation o f the new administration. Thus, instead o f the primary surplus, the project will use a
current fiscal balance indicator, which takes into account the need to preserve or even expand the
level o f public investmentwhile maintaining fiscal discipline.

8.        The direct fiscal measures are complemented by policies supported under the SWAP I1to
foster the spread and consolidation o f a results-based culture through the public sector, a process
that began during the SWAP Ioperation. Six prototype sector strategic studies, with indicators,
were developed under the SWAp I.The Government subsequently expanded this initiative,
producing strategic plans with indicators for all sectors as a foundation for the State development
agenda and 2006 budgeting exercise. The SWAp I1supports the further development o f a results-
based culture, including reporting against these strategic indicators in annual Secretary
Performance Reports, monitoring o f the SWAp I1disbursement-linked indicators that align with
sector performance objectives, and support for improved program reporting and evaluations for
results-based management.



 The Inclusive Growth Strategy is based on a regional approach that focuses on "growth poles." These are centers that will
attract business and private sector opportunities, linking neighboring rural and urban areas like a network of capillaries to
generate self-sustaining, robust economic growth in metropolitanareas outside the capital city. Thus, while the Inclusive Growth
Strategy aims to decentralize economic growth, it is not a "balanced growth" approach (treating all urban areas or regions
equally, regardless of economic and social conditions).

2. RATIONALE FORBANKINVOLVEMENT

9.     The Bank is uniquely positioned to support the State of Ceara's development strategy,
basedupon the Bank's long partnership with the State. Ceara has for many years beenone of the
Bank's primary sub-national borrowers. Cear6 investment loans over the last decade have
included education, health, rural poverty, water resource management and urban development.
As mentioned above, Ceara implementeda first-of-its-kind, results-based SWAp supporting six
sectors and nine strategic government programs. Another World Bank loan is under
development-the     $41m Cidades do Ceara Project-to       promote economic growth in identified
regional development poles, beginning with the Cariri region. In addition, the IFC TA Facility
and FIAS are supporting a technical assistance program of administrative simplification to
improve business processesinseveral Cearamunicipalities.

10.    This loan fits squarely within the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which
highlights the Bank's increasing role at the state level inBraziland the importance of addressing
complex development challenges in an integrated and multi-sector fashion. The Brazil CPS sets
out six "paradigmatic challenges," four of which are directly addressed by the SWAP 11, as
summarized in Table 1 below. In addition, it should be noted that the Ceard Inclusive Growth
Project SWAP II loansupports the achievementof five of the eight UNMillenniumDevelopment
goals: achieve universal primary education; reduce child mortality; improve maternal health;
combat HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases; and develop a global partnership for
development. The Government of Ceara, having achieved high levels of coverage in several of
these areas, has now chosen to place greater emphasis on improving quality. That emphasis i s
reflected in Eligible Expenditure Programs supported by the SWAP 11, and the corresponding
disbursement-linkedindicators.


3. HIGHER    LEVEL OBJECTIVESTO WHICH THE PROJECTCONTRIBUTES

11.    The higher level objective of the project is to expand the social advancements recently
achieved by the State of Ceara through supporting the Government's program of inclusive
economic growth. The project will do this by supporting investment programs critical to the
Government's development agenda, programs included in the PPA 2008-201 1. State programs
in the education, health, and water sectors were priorities of the SWAP Ioperation and remain
central to the SWAP I1 loan, as well. The current Government also has chosen to emphasize
increased growth and private sector development-in         particular for poorer areas outside the
Fortalezametropolitan region-and these priorities are also capturedinthe SWAp I1design.

12.     The loan type combines the Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) with an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL). This is the second SWAP loan o f an APL. The SWAP Iclosed in December 2007,
fully disbursingthe $150 million loan amount. Most o fthe triggers for APL 2 were met infull or
in part (see Table 17) and the overall results achieved, as reflected in the SWAP Iproject
indicators, were substantial. These accomplishments have laid an excellent foundation for
continued progress, and provide confidence to continue the State's partnership with the Bank.
Consequently, the Bank is satisfied that the Government of Cear6 has met the requirements for
undertaking a second APL operation.

13.     The Ceara SWAP model was sufficiently successful that it i s now being replicated in
Minas Gerais, the Distrito Federal, and Pernambuco. Each o f these operations follows essentially
the same SWAP structure, combining support to public sector management reforms with support
for selected sector programs. Inaddition, each one links disbursements to the Borrower's ability
to meet specific performance targets over the course o f the loan. The nature o f the indicators,


                                                 5

  however, may vary in accordance with the institutional development o f the Statelsector. For
  example, in Ceara, following the Government's excellent performance improving fiscal
  indicators under the SWAP I,two cc2nd           generation" fiscal indicators have been included in the
  SWAP I1(see below). Still, for the sector programs, many o f the disbursement indicators are
  output measures rather than outcome targets. In contrast, the Minas Gerais SWAP relies to a
  greater degree on outcome measures: appropriate "stretch goals" for one o f Brazil's most
  developed states, and a state that already advanced considerably with results-based management
  through its recent "Management Shock" (Choque de Gestiib) reform.

  14.      In response to the specific learning that has taken place under the Ceara SWAP I-by
  both the State and the World Bank-there            are several differences between the first SWAP and
  the second, as summarized inTable 2.

  15.      What are the key characteristics of the Ceard SWAP design? The essential characteristics
  o f the Ceard Inclusive Growth Project SWAP II mirror those o f the first SWAp, and can be
  summarized as follows:


     The SWAP Ienvironmental sector requirements were fully met. The State has chosen to focus attention on
  economic growththrough additionof a new sector: business environment & innovation. Inthis operation, technical
  assistance resources have been identified to continue to strengthen the State's ability to address environmental
  safeguardissues (e.g., disposal ofhospitalwaste).


                                                         6

        a. The loan is multi-sector.Six sectors were included inthe SWAPI,and there are five
            inthe SWAP11.
        b. The loan consists of: (i)      a SWAPcomponent disbursing against aggregated Eligible
            Expenditure Programs (EEP); and (ii)a technical assistance component disbursing
            against SOEs.
        c. Eligible Expenditure Programs are included as line items in the PPA and in the
            BudgetLaw, with proper identifyingnumbersinthe budget.
        d. Disbursement is to the State Treasury, not to an individual budget program or
            Secretaryresponsiblefor the program.
        e. A disbursement ratio i s agreed (30%), indicating the maximum share of EEP
            expenditures that may be disbursed from the SWAP component to the Treasury in
            each disbursement period. The maximum eligible disbursement during the period i s
            equal to "the disbursement ratio" multiplied by "Government EEP expenditures"
            duringthe period.
        f. Disbursementsareprogrammedtotakeplaceonceeverysix months.
        g. The first disbursement includes a 20% retroactive amount, which will be disbursed
            against executed Government EEP expenditures, vetted to ensure compliance with
            Bankprocurementandsafeguardsrequirements.
        h. EEP fund (directly and indirectly) the SWAP I1 sector objectives and institutional
            reforms. Disbursement is against EEP expenditures, subject to satisfying indicators
             aimed at supporting the Government's program and loan objectives. These include:
             (i)a"70% rule" thatdictateseachindividualEEPmustreceiveandexecuteatleast
             70% of its programmed budget in each calendar year;4 and (ii)individual

        j. The "value" ofeachDLIis calculatedby dividingthe maximumdisbursement-after
             applyingthe "70% rule"-by the numberofDLI(14).
        k. In the event a performance indicator is not achieved, a "request for reassessment"
             may be submitted by the Government, which must provide a justification and an
             Action Plan for meeting the indicator.At its discretion, the Bank will determine the
             amount and timing of the withheld disbursement, depending upon the explanation in
             the Governmentrequestandthe profferedactionplan.

2. PROGRAM       OBJECTIVES

17.     This operation is the second in a sequence of Adaptable Program Loans, supporting a
long-standingpartnershipbetweenthe World Bank andCearato promote social advancesfor the
state's citizens as well as the institutional modernizationof the state. As a follow-up to the Ceara
SWAPIloan, the SWAP I1offers continued support of the state's social development agenda,

  For the 2008 calendar year, 50% of each EEP budget must be executed to satisfy this rule.


                                                     7

including key sectoral investments in education, health, and WSS, as well as supporting the
gradual fiscal strengthening o f the GoC. (The APL triggers established under the SWAP Ifor a
follow-up operation were substantially met, as detailed inAnnex 1, Table 17.)

18.    The innovative design o f the first SWAP elevated the importance o f results-based
management ("GestGo por Resultados"), which receives still greater attention under the SWAp I1
inbuildingupon those earlier accomplishments. This second operation also will expandbeyond
the social sectors to address issues of growth andcompetitiveness inthe state.


3. PROJECTDEVELOPMENTOBJECTIVEAND KEY INDICATORS

19.     The higher-level objective o f the Ceara SWAP I1project is to contribute to expand and
consolidate the social advances and institutional modernization o f the State of Ceara. The project
will achieve this by supporting ten key government investment programs infive sectors, selected
to optimize development impact. A series o f disbursement-linked indicators (14) are mapped to
the five sectors-public      sector management, education, health, WSS/WRM, and business
environment & innovation-to      strengthen the incentives to achieve results.

20.     Specifically, the project development objectives are to:


        0   Helpthe Government o f Cearato improve its fiscal situation;
            Strengthen the State's system o f results-based management;
        0   Promote better service quality in education (particularly childhood literacy) and
            health;
        0   Improve access to WSS, increase cost recovery in the water sector and improve the
            efficiency o f the two government autarchies with responsibility for water supply and
            management; and
        0   Reduce barriers to businessinvestment.

21.     Success inmeeting the project development objectives will not be evaluated merely at the
close o f the project. Rather, the disbursement-linked indicators (DLI) applied during SWAP I1
implementation are simultaneously measures o f progress toward achieving these project
development objectives. The set o f "disbursement-linked"         and "secondary" indicators are
presented below inTable 3. The measurement protocols and target values for each DLIare found
inAnnex 3.

21.    There are two types o f indicator (or conditions) in the Ceara SWAP I1 that affect
disbursements.     First, there i s a threshold requirement applied to the individual budget
programs-termed      Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP)-supported         by the SWAp. Budget
execution for each EEP must reach at least 70% o f its budget in each 12-month period. Second,
there are disbursement-linked indicators (14 in all) assigned to each o f the five sectors supported
by the SWAp. Disbursement-linked indicators are the select performance indicators for the
sector, and meeting these results i s necessary to disburse loan proceeds, provided the EEP
expenditure thresholds have been met.



                                                 8

22.     "Secondary indicators" will be included in a Policy Letter that affirms their importance
and declares the GoC's intention to monitor and meet them. These secondary indicators will be

Sector 1: PublicSector Management ("Umbrella Sector")

23.     Public Sector Management (PSM) i s a sector that spans all the rest. While PSM Eligible
Expenditure Programs generally are not sufficiently large to justify inclusion in a SWAp,
strengthening fiscal and fiduciary oversight and institutionalizing results-based management
(RBM) in policy setting and public administration will have a positive impact upon the
efficiency and effectiveness o f the entire government, including the targeted sectors. The first
SWAPinitiated some preliminary, positive steps towardjudicious fiscal management and RBM.
Inthis second SWAp, fiscal indicators have been selected to reflect the emphasis on growth:
instead o f using the more commonly-adopted primary surplus indicator, the project will target
the current fiscal balance, which takes into account the need to preserve-a even expand-the
level o f public investment while maintaining fiscal discipline. In a similar way, the SWAP I1
includes an indicator o f tax concentration rather than simply tax revenue. The tax concentration
measure aims to reinforce the current policy o f the State to adopt a balanced level o f taxation
across sectors. (This contrasts with the tendency to overtax utilities such as energy, fuels and
communications, as has been done elsewhere in Brazil, with negative consequences for growth
as firms must bear most o fthe burden o f increased taxation.)

24.     Expanding and mainstreaming RBM is now identified as perhaps the single most
important activity supported by the SWAP 11. Consequently, while the broad objectives for
Public Sector Management remain the same, the activities and indicators have been adjusted
from the first APL to the second. During the SWAP Igovernment secretaries initiated sectoral
assessments to define strategic plans for their organizations. These plans include strategic
outcomes, performance indicators and annual performance targets. Building on that experience
the current project will support and monitor the preparation of annual Secretary Performance
Reports (SPR) against those pre-defined performance indicators. Each line secretary i s to present
a coherent portrayal o f its performance, both for accountability and for budget and planning
purposes.

25.     In addition to focused reports by line secretaries on their operations and performance,
results-based management requires monitoring and evaluation o f the impacts o f public policies.
Often called "spending reviews,"      these analyses measure the full costs and benefits o f
government programs, and are a powerful instrument for the rationalization o f public resource
allocations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f government expenditure, Recognizing
the typical complexity and cost of a "spending review," as well as the incipient stage of results-
based management in Ceara, the SWAP I1 will support the development and use o f Output-
Results Reports (Relatdrio Produto-Resultado) as a type o f "light spending review."          The
Output-Results Reports (ORR) will will have three essential elements: (i) consistency analysis
                                                                           a
o f the program(s) design (log frame); (ii)monitoring o f outputs in accordance with the log
frame; and (iii)a comparison o f actual outputs to expected outputs, examining the extent to
which the outputs generated promote the achievement o f the results desired, and the cost per unit
o fthe output produced.

26.     To ensure that the ORR are focused on programs that are a priority concern for the
Government, the selection o f programs to be assessed each year will be determined (and



                                                12

sanctioned) by the Committee for Fiscal and Results-Based Management, a type of
"supercabinet" in support of the Governor, composed of the four most powerful state
~ecretaries.~ SWAP I1"secondary indicator" will track to ensure that RBMreporting from the
               A
annual SPRs and ORRs i s reflected in the Government's annual budget proposal as well as the
Governor's annualAddress to the Assembly.

Sector2: Education

27.      The SWAP Iaddressedthe main sector challenges through support of the government's
program to: (i)  implement a student testing cycle; (ii)  improve literacy; (iii)
                                                                                upgrade expenditure
efficiency and quality; and (iv) improve State/municipal cooperation in delivering primary
education. Considerable progress has been made in each of these areas, sufficient for the new
administration to refine these priorities and add a focus on educational performance.

  Sector 3: Health

  28.      Health was also a priority sector under the first SWAp. World Bank staff, working with
  Ceara government counterparts, considers that healthcare coverage i s now relatively high, and
  that the most pressing problem in the sector concerns the quality and efficiency o f healthcare
  delivery. Hence, a new set o f priority issues are addressed inthe second operation.

  Sector 4: Water resource management & Water Supply and Sanitation

  29.      Water resources inthe very aridCeara are fundamental to the State's economic and social
  development. The programs and indicators selected for this sector are directed at strengthening
  the financial health o f the water companies responsible for providing bulk supplies (COGERH)
  and WSS services (CAGECE), and sending economic signals to consumers about the true cost o f
 water and the need to rationalize its use across competing demands. Inaddition, the provision o f


  tiDeveloped under the World Bank's PROESF project, AvaliaqBo para Melhoria da Qualidade de EstratCgia Saude
  da Familia (AMQ) is a quality certification system for Family Healthcare. Similar to the accreditation systems for
  healthcare facilities, A M Q is based on internationally recognized standards of care classified according to the
  Donabedian quality assessment model specifying structures, processes and results. Over 160 quality standards are
  distributedamong five sequential stages. AMQ contains assessment instruments and a scoring system to classify
  'healthteams by quality stage.
    The "alvara" is a permitthat certifies, through health surveillance, that health conditions, installations, technical
 and operational capacity o f health services work within the standards o f quality and security demanded by the
  existing legislation. Federal Law No6,437/1977 requires that health-related establishments hold health permits
  ("alvara sanitario"), issued by thejurisdictional health authority.

Sector 5: BusinessEnvironment& Innovation

30.     Both the World Bank and the Government are acutely aware of the need to mobilize
private sector resources and entrepreneurship in order to achieve sustainable growth. A 2006
World Bank Group report-Doing         Business in Brazil-ranked          Ceara last among 13 states in
terms of business-friendly environment. The State current administration strongly endorses
measures to mobilize private sector resources for economic growth, particularly in the interior.
Hence, these activities support the government's strategy to strengthen development poles:
dynamic municipal clusters outside of the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region. They also will support
programs designedto foster technology innovation, andresearchand scientific development.

                                         bestway to address chronic healthcareproblems ina
                                         sustainable way. The implementationof cost-accounting

5. LESSONS      LEARNEDAND REFLECTEDINTHE PROJECTDESIGN

31.     The Ceara SWAPI1draws directly uponthe design and implementation experience o fthe
Ceara Multi-Sector Social Inclusion Project, the first in Brazil to use a SWAP modality to
support a multi-sector program. Under the SWAP I the Bank reimbursed key Eligible
Expenditure Programs in accord with results based on key sectoral indicators. Critical lessons o f
that experience include the following:

        a. Indicators Selection. The most difficult challenge associated with the SWAp model
            i s the selection of good indicators-important,          measurable, unambiguous, and
            reasonable. Lessons learned, especially during SWAp Iimplementation, suggest the
            following types of indicators should be avoided:
            (i)Composite indicators, especially thosethatrelyonsequencedeventsasdelays
                    mayjeopardize compliance
            (ii)Indicatorsthatdependupontheactionsofnumerousentities(e.g., activitiesthat
                    must be carried out across many schools or municipalities), especially if
                    management capacity is questionable



                                                  18

            (iii)Indicatorsforwhichthe Statedoesnothavesufficientleverageintheformof
                 funding or highly-desirable technical assistance to ensure that implementing
                 agencies-including     municipalities-will    make a good faith effort to comply
            (iv) Mandates to implement recommendations or study results that lead to subjective
                 judgmentsas to whether or not performance canbe deemed "satisfactory"
        b. Client Ownership. Ifthe sectordsecretaries do not believe inthe merito fthe program,
            itwill be more difficultto achieve sector indicators andthe desired outcomes. Hence,
            senior officials and professionals inthe line departments should play a primary role in
            loan design and should be fully aware o f the benefits to the State, the Treasury, and to
            themselves (namely, support for key sectoral programs/objectives/targetsand assured
            Eligible Expenditure disbursement).
        c. Bank Ownership. For the loan to generate the best results, World Bank sector
            specialists need to be involved in supervision and maintain a regular dialogue with
            the client. The loan should be considered a vehicle for such multidisciplinary
            involvement. Supervision resources need to be made available to participating
            sectors, and the responsibilities o f sectoral specialists need to be clear.
        d. Capacity to Disburse Technical Assistance Resources:While the SWAP Iwas highly
            successful (e.g., strengthening financial management, encouraging sectors to identify
            the key results they were attempting to achieve, supporting sound sectoral
            implementation arrangements) the government was not able to implement much of
            the programmed TA activities. To a certain extent, the capacity o f the state to absorb
            the TA component was overestimated. This lesson is reflected inthe design ofthe TA
            component o f this second operation: technical assistance i s used to strengthen
            incentives for sector units with strong ownership and interest inthe outcomes, and i s
            highly selective.     The total amount allocated for technical assistance (US$ 3.67
            million) i s also less-in  absolute terms and particularly as a share o f overall project
            financing-than     under the SWAP I.


6. ALTERNATIVESCONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION

32.     Due to changes inthe size and scope o f the SWAP 11-in relation to operation prefigured
in the SWAP I-an       alternative loan instrument to this second APL would have been a stand-
alone SIL/SWAp. However, this alternative was rejected as the links and continuity with the
first APL operation-both         the sectors and objectives-are         readily apparent and clearly
significant.

33.     The design features that were rejected for the SWAP I1include the following:

        a. The environmental component and EEP.               It was determined that the SWAP I
            environmental sector requirements were fully met. Meanwhile, the State has chosen
            to focus attention on economic growth through addition o f a new sector: Business
            Environment & Innovation. Still, limited TA resources will be provided in this
            operation to continue to strengthen the State's ability to address environmental
            safeguard issues with a comprehensive, government-wide approach manner,
            irrespective o f any project-specific investment requirements.


                                                   19

        b. Global conditions. A portfolio condition was not considered necessary given that
            preparation is underway for an additional financing request for the Ceara Integrated
            Water Resource Management Project (PROGERIRH), and given "imminent closure"
            of the education loan. In light of the state's improved fiscal situation, the primary
            surplus condition has been replaced by an alternate fiscal indicator and tax
            concentration indicator. These have beenincluded as a disbursement-linkedindicators
            ratherthan as a global conditions.

36.     The GoC favors the SWAP modality rather than a DPL operation, as the Government
prefers the results focus embedded in the SWAP design as well as the greater engagement by
Banksector specialistsduring implementation, whichthe SWAp modality provides.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PARTNERSHIPARRANGEMENTS (IF APPLICABLE)

37.     There are no formal partnership arrangements related to this operation. Concerning
safeguards, the operation draws upon the safeguards framework for involuntary resettlement
already developed for the Projeto Sanear 11,a project that is partially supported by the Inter-
American Development Bank (IADB). That framework and resettlement practices under the
Sanear operation have beenreviewed and deemed acceptableby the Bank.


2. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTS
                     AND IMPLEMENTATION

38.     The Ceara SWAP I1will draw uponthe successful implementation arrangementsusedfor
the first operation. The Ceara Economic ResearchInstitute (IPECE), the research instituteunder
the Secretary of Planning, will be the responsible implementing agency.              The Project
Coordinator will be the head of IPECE, who will report to the Secretary of Planning. The
Coordinator is assisted by IPECE staff and 1-2 consultants who will divide their time between
the SWAP and other tasks. While IPECE is a research institute, it also has responsibilities for
planning and results-basedmanagement that cover all Secretaries. IPECE has proven ability to
act as the implementation and coordination unit.

39.     The GoC developed a very efficient means of managing and coordinating the diverse
sectors over the course o f the loan. Each secretary/sector is represented by a key technical staff
person on a SWAP Committee to ensure close and continuing monitoring and evaluation by all
sector stakeholders. The Committee meets monthly and each representative reports on progress
in achieving indicators, technical assistance, and EEP so that any problems that surface can be
identifiedand addressed promptly. Issues that require multi-sector responsescan be addressed in
these collaborative meetings.

40.     A "situation room" was established in IPECE and all of the indicators-EEP,

on a color-coded master chart. The Coordinator and his team are also constantly in touch with

the Secretaries, and when larger issues surface they are communicated to the Secretary o f
Planning and the Governor for resolution. This occurred on several occasions during the first
SWAp. In addition, supervision under the new operatioi will include regular interaction
betweenthe line secretaries and sector specialists.

41.    Project coordination responsibilities comprise the      activities normally undertaken by
project coordinatinghmplementation units including: (i)general government and Bank
coordination; (ii)monitoring and evaluation o f EEP, Disbursement-linked indicators, and TA to
ensure compliance; (iii)reporting o f results ina timely and comprehensive manner to ensure loan
disbursement and preparation o f any "requests for reassessment," as needed; (iv) ensuring Bank
fiduciary (financial reporting, procurement) and safeguards regulations and requirements are
followed; (v) disseminating results and strengthening the Government's reform constituency; (vi)
coordinating and leading activities within the Public Sector Management Sector and ensuring
they are successfully carried out; and (vii) coordinating the effort o f participating secretaries,
runningthe SWAp Committee, and identifying andresolving problems.

42.    The specific responsibilities to be carried out by the participating Secretaries include: (i)
implementing sector programs and meeting performance indicators; (ii)         participating in the
SWAP Committee and tracking and reporting on all activities for which the Secretary has
assumed responsibility; (iii)collaborating with the Project Coordinator/IPECE in preparing
specific TORS, processing procurement and overseeing implementation o f such activities; (iv)
taking the lead in municipal contacts essential to meeting loan objectives; and (v) providing
sectoral expertise as needed to optimize loan impact.

43.    The FMIS and reporting capability have been vetted and the Bank relies upon Ceara
systems for fiduciary oversight and reports. Sector units-the     direct beneficiaries o f TA-are
expected to prepare sector-specific Terms o f Reference for technical assistance support.


3. MONITORING      AND EVALUATIONOF OUTCOMES/RESULTS

44.    The Ceara SWAP I1has ten Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP) and 14 disbursement-
linked indicators, as well as a number o f "secondary" indicators that the GoC commits to
monitor. The SWAp Idemonstrated that management o f such a loan poses no greater supervision
challenge than a traditional SIL because Ceara government systems are used to monitor and
report on EEP projected and actual expenditures. Furthermore, responsibility for program
implementation and tracking and reporting on disbursement-linked indicators i s spread over six
Secretaries; and the SWAP Supervision Committee has shown itself fully capable o f monitoring
and evaluating progress. Since disbursements requireevidence of compliance to be presented by
the State to the Bank, the burden is squarely on the Government to provide the requisite
information attesting to performance in a timely and comprehensive manner. These features
simplify the monitoring and evaluation o f outcomes. Indeed, the GoC now posts voluminous
program monitoring data through the IPECE SWAP website.

45.    The Bank will rely upon the State's systems for monitoring and evaluation, while also
contributing through the Project to strengthen these systems. Technical assistance resources are


                                                21

identified to support implementation of priority reforms to financial management and
procurement systems, identified through application of the PEFA and OECD Indicators
diagnostic, respectively. Meanwhile, TA support is combined with strong incentivesto improve
the quality of government performance data, as results-based management reports by
secretariats, andprogram"output-results reports" are includedas indicatorsfor disbursement.

46.     The specific M&E tasks and SWAPmodus operandi are explainedbelow:

        a. The first 20% disbursement will be retroactive and will take place immediately
            following loansigning. The seconddisbursementwill bemade at the same time, as an
            advance against aggregated projected expenditures for the ten EEP. Future
            disbursementswill be made at roughly 6-monthintervals. The State will present each
            time its expenditureestimates, usingits own systemsvalidatedby the Bank, and inan
            FMIS format agreed with the Bank. For the third disbursement through the
            penultimate disbursement, the State will also present actual expenditure results from
            the previous 6-month period to prove that expenditures in that period were indeed
            sufficient to justify the disbursement made against estimates. Hence, for the third
            through the penultimate disbursement, the Government will present the actual
            disbursement for the previous 6-monthperiodand the estimated disbursement for the
            upcoming 6-month period-both             reports being necessary to authorize a new
            disbursementagainstthe 6-monthprojections.
        b. Authorizationof each disbursement directly following the end of the calendar year-
            normally in April-will be contingent upon satisfying the "70% rule" (describedin
            section B.1) for individualEEP budget expenditures, as well as Disbursement-Linked
            Indicators(DLI) pertainingto the prior calendar year.
        c. If the "70% rule" i s not met for an EEP, then the total amount eligible for
            disbursement in that period will be reduced by 10% (1 of 10 EEP).' That non-
            disbursed amount will be added to the next year's programmeddisbursement if the
            "70% rule" is satisfiedinthe subsequent year. No "roll-over" will bepermittedat the
            time ofthe final disbursementinApril 2012.
        d. After applying the "70% rule," the total eligible April disbursement will be divided
            by the number of DLI, which yields a monetary value for each DLI. If the DLI are
            met for all programs, thenthe entire disbursementis authorized.
        e. Ifthe Government fails to meet a DLI, then the April disbursement i s reducedby the
            DLI value. Iftwo DLI are not met, then the value of the two DLI is withheld. This
            disbursement modality provides a significant advantage over traditional adjustment-
            style loan tranches, where a single missed target can hold up the entire value of the
            disbursement.
        f. Wherea DLIrepresentsacumulativetarget (e.g.,percentof family healthteamswith
           AMQ quality certification or citizens in municipal centers with broadband internet
            access), then if the DLI is target is not met the value of that DLI disbursement is
           withheld until such time as the Government demonstrates it has met the numerical



 For the 2008 calendar year, 50% of each EEP budget must be executed to satisfy this rule.


                                                    22

           target. The withheld value i s then added to the next scheduled disbursement (April or
           October).
       g. Where a DLI is not a cumulative target, but rather an annual performance task (e.g.,
           carrying out student exams each year in 2nd, 5th, 9',      and 12`h grades), then the
           decision whether to disburse any part o f that DLI value for that year will be at the
           Bank's discretion.      An amount withheld due to a failure to meet an annual-
           performance DLI may be "rolled over" to a subsequent disbursement period at the
           Bank's sole discretion.
       h. Reports on the Government's progress in implementing the SWAP program and
           meeting EEP and DLI conditions will be reviewed during supervision missions. April
           disbursements will be authorized based on evidence presented by the client. The State
           provides comprehensive documentation online that can be reviewed by Bank
           specialists in each sector to determine whether conditions have been adequately
           documented and satisfied. It is also expected that sector specialists will travel to
           Ceara to supervise progress and maintain continuing contact with client counterparts
           intheir respective sectors.
       i.Monitoring of TA implementation progress will be verified by the Bank and
           documented inISRs and other supervisionreports (see Annex 8).

47.    Despite the number o f activities that must be monitored, the SWAP Idemonstrated that
M&E under this model is not overly burdensome. The information provided has proved
satisfactory to assess implementation progress and compliance. Indeed, the fact that loan
disbursement i s linked to provision o f satisfactory evidence o f compliance greatly facilitates
M&E.This is becausethe burdeno fproofresides squarely withthe client who has every interest
inproviding timely and satisfactory evidence. (See Annex 3 for information on data protocols
and providers.)

48.    World Bank sector specialists will be responsible for reviewing the performance reports
provided. If the credibility o f these data comes into question, then an independent verification
audit may be requested.


4. SUSTAINABILITY

49.    The DLI are linked to key problems and government programs/EEP. Each of these
programs i s included in the State's PPA and the Government's results-based management
framework-which      is reinforced through the SWAP I1 operation. An overarching objective o f
the SWAP I1 is to institutionalize key sector results as well as results-based management,
building on the progress achieved under the first SWAp.

50.    Government commitment to these sectors-and         government commitment to the SWAP
instrument as a tool to help realize these development goals-is    evidenced by the continuity o f
programs and objectives between the first and second SWAps, notwithstanding the change of
government that took place in Ceara in the period between the design o f these two loan
operations.

5. CRITICAL RISKSAND POSSIBLECONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS

51.     The overall risk rating for the Ceara SWAP I1 i s moderate. Risks have been discussed
extensively among Bank staff and Ceara officials, taking into consideration problems that
emerged during the SWAP Ioperation. Table 11 summarizes the key risks identified and
corresponding mitigation actions.

6. LOAN    CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS

52.    There is no portfolio conditionality for this operation. As a Condition of Effectiveness,
the Government must adopt through a Decree the Project Operational Manual in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank.

53.     The covenants will relate to the execution of the Project in accordance with the Health
Waste Management Strategy and the Environmental and Social Management Framework
together with the Indigenous People's Framework. Also, the loan makes use of a performance
framework explained above (and in detail in Annexes 3 & 4). The SWAP I1disburses against
aggregate, pooled EEP. The disbursement ratio is 30%, meaning that for every R$l million
spent by the GoC on Eligible Expenditure Programs, the US$equivalent of R$200,000 can be




                                                  26

disbursed from the loan. However, these disbursements are conditioned on meeting these
additional performance requirements:

            At least 70% ofthe annual budget o feachEEP actually must be spent.
            A share of the disbursement is tied to achieving the performance target for each of 14
            disbursement-linked indicators. Hence, meeting a DLI in a period authorizes the
            disbursementof that share ofthe programmed disbursement (Le,, total disbursement -
             14), provided that the aggregate EEP expenditure i s satisfactory.

52.     The purpose o f the "70% rule" i s to ensure that each o f the key EEP targeted by SWAP I1
benefit from Government expenditure. The purpose o f the DLI i s to ensure progress in meeting
the critical problems identified inthe sectors, and to reinforce results-based management.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. ECONOMIC FINANCIAL ANALYSES
                  AND

53.      The GoC fiscal situation is sound, especially relative to a number o f other Brazilian
states. This fiscal result i s the product o f the prudent fiscal management adopted inrecent years.
The state government achieved increasing and substantial positive current savings from 2003 to
2006 that allowed it to increase public investment and to reduce strongly its indebtedness.
Primary balances and net financing were also positive and increasing until 2005. In2006, given
its improved fiscal conditions, the state government promoted a strong expansion o f public
investments that ledto a reduced primary balance (albeit, still positive) and to a small borrowing
requirement.

54.      The state's Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) indicators improved as a consequence o f the
strong fiscal discipline. Net consolidated debt, used for compliance with the FRL, fell from 106
percent o f net current revenue in 2003 to 58 percent o f net current revenue in 2006, well below
the legal ceiling for state governments o f 200 percent. Personnel expenses as a share o f net
current revenue fell from 52 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2006, below the 60 percent FRL
ceiling. Given the high concentration o f debt service payments during the period 2003-2006
(which led to the first World Bank SWAP operation with the state), debt service payments to net
current revenues have exceeded 15 percent (against the FRL ceiling o f 11.5 percent o f net
current revenue). Given the disbursements o f the aforementioned Bank lending, credit operations
were higher than 5 percent o f net current revenues, but far below the FRL ceiling o f 16 percent.

55.      Inaddition to the Fiscal Responsibility Law requirements, the GoC achieved the targets
o f the Fiscal Adjustment Program (PAF) agreed with the National Treasury Secretariat (STN).
Giventhe good performance o f the last year and the reduction of its indebtedness ratio, the STN
authorizedthe state to contract new credit operations for the period 2007-09.

56.      Ceara, under its new administration, has defined a state development agenda that
prioritizes key sectors and launches institutional reforms. These priorities largely consolidate and
builduponadvances madeunder the SWAPI.Without SWAP11, funding for these efforts would


                                                     27

be substantially reduced and achievement of the results captured inthe project indicators would
be delayed.

57.     The support described above for critical programs in Ceara's development agenda will
provide an important growth and reform stimulus. However, despite significant recent progress,
the State is still saddled with an adverse debt repayment schedule, as can be seen in the graph
below. Despite the improvement brought about through the first SWAp, concentration of debt
repayments-specially       over the next three years-constitutes a significant impediment to
increasing state investments that are needed to implement the administration's development
agenda. Fortunately, Ceara's overall relatively low indebtednesslevel allows it to use the space
permittedunder the Fiscal Responsibility Law to obtain a second World Bank SWAP operation.
This, in turn, will enable the GoC to implement its development agenda, pursue structural and
institutional reforms, and at the same time meet its short term financial obligations.

58.     As shown in Figure 3 below, the World Bank funding, disbursed to the Treasury, will
allow the Government to better manage its debt obligations. Inorder to maintain its sound fiscal
position, Ceara also must maintain strict control of current expenditures and improve tax revenue
generation. The high dependence of state revenues on federal transfers (42% of total revenues in
2006) underlines the importance of improving its own revenue collection capacity.
Disbursement-linkedindicators addressing current fiscal balance and revenue collection have
consequently been included in the loan to tighten financial management. As revenue collection
depends upon state economic activity, the favorable fiscal trendswill also depend upon sustained
growth o f the state economy, which is targeted under the SWAP I1 through support of key
infrastructure andprivate sector programs and reforms.

59.      Sustaining social inclusion gains and obtaining a substantial reduction in current poverty
levels also require more rapid economic growth and improving the quality of social policies.
Poverty levels are still unacceptably high in Ceara, with more than half the population (53%)
living below a poverty line of ?4minimum wage, and more than a quarter (26%) below an
extremepoverty line (Vi minimumwage). The SWAP I1emphasis on education, health, WSS and
development, especially in the state's interior, should contribute significantly to poverty
mitigation.

60.     The present project, a $240 million loan using a SWAP modality, emphasizes "inclusive
growth," supporting programs and policies that address social goals together with others that
helpboost economic growth inthe state. Inaddition, the project supports Ceara's commitment to
develop further the good public sector management practices that have been adopted inthe state
inrecentyears, with special emphasisonmainstreaming results-basedmanagement.

61.     This is a multi-sectoral operation that supports programs and activities in different areas.
Some of the GoC's priority programs supported by the Bank's SWAP operation are better
evaluated by their cost-effectiveness, while others are amenable to more traditional cost-benefit
analysis. While a detailed economic assessment was not undertaken, Annex 9 summarizes some
of the available evidence on the impact of programs inthe areas of education, health, water and
sanitation and innovation.

2. TECHNICAL

62.      No technical problems are foreseen in implementing the SWAP 11. Project coordination
and supervision o f SWAPIwas well-managed through IPECE inthe Secretary o f Planning and
Management (SEPLAG). Regarding fiduciary oversight, there were no problems in the first
operation and none are anticipated for the second. Reporting FMIS estimates and actual
expenditure for EEP was handled satisfactorily. Provision of the reports and background
materials required for the 4* and 5* disbursements of the SWAP Iwas ably managed by the
GoC. Summary reports and the voluminous evidence required for each component were posted
on the IPECE website.

63,      Implementation o f sector EEP will, o f course, bring challenges. (Internal government
coordination is one o f them.) However, these challenges are mitigated by the following features:
(i) initiatives are firmly embedded in the State's own development agenda; (ii) EEP and   many
DLIare similar to those inthe first operation; and (iii) care has been exercised invetting
                                                              great
indicators to ensure they are well-founded.

64.      The failure to disburse a larger share o f the programmed TA hnds has been discussed
above, but this should be less o f a problem inthe SWAP I1operation because these activities will
be dispersed through the targeted sectors, providing stronger ownership to see themthrough.




                                                   29

65.     The greatest challenges are associated with two new programs linked to DLIthat involve
municipal collaboration. In the education sector a new early-childhood literacy program
(Alfabeticaqa"o nu Idade Certa) i s being launched throughout Ceara' s 184 municipalities.
Meanwhile, in the health sector, proposed initiatives linked to DLI will certify Family Health
Teams and large regional hospitals (hospitais polo), and implement hospital cost-accounting
systems. The concern i s that new programs often are beset by start-up problems, and
coordination with municipal governments adds a further challenge. However, it i s expected that
with the backing of the Governor and Secretaries, and with the added importance that comes
with incorporating these programs into the SWAp I1performance framework, these challenges
can be overcome.


3. FIDUCIARY

66.     Building on the Bank's experience in working with the Government o f Ceara, and the
positive results o f the first Cearh SWAP operation, the overall Financial Management
Assessment conclusion i s that the government's public financial management systems perform
well, and as such, meet Bank requirements. The financial management risk associated with the
project has been assessed as moderate. The government's financial management system will be
able to provide relevant and reliable financial information, ina timely manner, to support project
management in the control, planning, implementation and monitoring o f the project towards the
achievement o f the project objectives.

67.     Given the nature o f the SWAP program, funds flow directly to the Treasury (see Annex
7). Thus, it has been determined that no procurement plan will be required for the SWAP
program expenditures. Procurement under each EEP will continue to be done making use o f
local laws, procedures, systems and organizations, subject to the caveats mentioned below and
reiterated in the loan agreement. The Capacity Assessment, the State Procurement Assessment
Report and a series o f earlier Bank loans-including     the first SWAp-confirm that the GoC is
capable o f carrying out procurement satisfactorily for this operation. It is also worth noting that
the technical assistance component is supporting a significant procurement reform to strengthen
priority areas identified duringthe self-evaluation o f the state's procurement systems through the
application o f the OECD procurement indicators.

68.     A yearly external procurement audit, acceptable to the Bank, will be required to verify
compliance with the local law o f a sample o f procurement processes procured from the pool o f
EEP funds (see Annex 8).

69.     Procurement for the TA component o f the proposed project will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated May 2004 andrevised October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment
o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised October 2006, as well as
the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The various itemsunder different expenditure
categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed under the TA
component o f the Loan, the procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between


                                                 30

the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually, or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.


4. SOCIAL

70.      It is expectedthat most project activities under the different SWAP-supported programs
will have positive social impacts. The priority programs selectedfor inclusioninthe project will
continue the Government's policy of promoting social inclusion, particularly in terms of access
to quality services-education,    health, WSS-by      marginal groups. In pursuing those overall
goals, particular attention will be paid to indigenous peoples and resettlement issues, in
accordancewith Bank standards.

71.      Cearahas an indigenous population estimated at 21,015 habitants, or less that 0.5% of the
total state population (PNAD-IBGE). Nearly 95% of this population is settled in urban areas
(IPECE 2006). Notwithstanding the improvement in per capita income among indigenous
households over the last 10 years, nearly half of the indigenous population remains inthe lowest
income decile. Similarly, the State has improved access to education and health services among
the indigenous population, as reflected in increased school attendance and improved access to
health services. However, indigenous communities remain among the most vulnerable groups,
lagging interms of both access and quality of public service delivery.

72.      The Government's programs in health and education have been shaped by the health
sector's Indigenous Health Plan by District, 2008-2010 (Plano Distrital de Sazide Indigena
2008/2010), and reports by the Secretary of Education on indigenous issues in the sector. Both
were participatory processes, and both are deemed culturally appropriate. However, to minimize
and mitigate any potentially adverse social impact, a separate Indigenous People's Framework
(Marco Referenciao has been drafted by the Borrower to guide any project investments affecting
indigenous communities. The principles of the framework are as follows: (i)ensure informed
participation and consultation, observing indigenous rights and cultural traditions; (ii) assign a
budget to support capacity building aimed at improving access to the project activities; and (iii)
monitor and evaluate indicators to track benefitdimpacts for indigenous peoples. Regarding
WSS activities, the identity of indigenous groups in Ceara will not exclude them from the
benefits of WSS service connections.

73.      Only very limited involuntary resettlement is expected to occur under the water and
sanitation component. Ceara has years of experience in addressing resettlements under the
Sanear II project and has acquired and built institutional capacity to deal with resettlement and
land acquisition. The GoC's existing resettlement framework has been reviewed and deemed
acceptable by the Bank. The principles that guide the framework are: (i)to minimize and
mitigate potential negative social and economic impacts caused by the project; (ii) ensure that
                                                                                     to
affected peoples regardless of their tenure condition receive appropriate compensation and/or
assistance that provides for the equivalent or superior replacement of assets lost and restoration
of livelihoods; (iii)to ensure that affected people are informed about their options andrights, and
consulted on the offered choices; (iv) to ensure that a State mechanism is inplace for mediation,


                                                 31

conflict resolution and redress; and (v) to prepare a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), consistent
with the provisions of the Bank's policy on resettlement for each subproject that will involve
resettlement. Such a plan should be provided to the Bank for approval before subprojects are
accepted for Bank financing.

74.     The Government has undertaken a process of consultation regarding the programs
included in the SWAP I1as part of the participatory process for preparing Multi-Year Budget
Plan (PPA). Inpreparing the PPA, government consultations were held with a variety of groups
including municipal governments, the private sector, academic institutions, civil society and
NGOs, and citizens at large. Considerable information about the consultative forums,
participants,the views expressedand resulting content of the budget plansis available at:
http://www.seplag.ce.gov.br/content/aplicacao/SEAD/seplan/plano~Plurianual/gerados/2OO8~2O
11.asp

75.     The GoC has carried out consultations, as well, for the environmental and social
frameworks that have been prepared to address safeguards concerns in relation to resettlement
and indigenous peoples. The frameworks have been posted on the web with a feedback
mechanisminplace. The GoC also has heldtargeted consultations on these frameworks with key
stakeholder groups. The team leading the consultations for the Indigenous Process Framework is
headedby the Director of Social Studies of IPECE and the Coordinator of Indigenous Education
for SEDUC. Both IPECE and SEDUC will work in concert with FUNASA the methodology,
messages, and presentation of the project to indigenous participants. Following a consultation
among the KanindC Aratuba, observed by the World Bank in April 2008, it was agreed that
subsequent consultations will have two sessions: one devoted to the project presentation and
consultations, and a second session where SEDUC and FUNASA can respond to participants
concerning other matters of their public services delivery.


5. ENVIRONMENT

76.     The proposed project will strengthen public sector policies and improve the quality of
primary education, healthcare and sewerage services. For the most part, these investments will
not cause any direct or irreversible impact on society or the environment.

77.     The major potential environmental impact of this project is related to the improper
handling, collection and disposal of hazardouswaste produced by hospitals andpublic healthcare
units in Ceara. A state-wide strategy for Health Waste Management has been prepared with
support of the SWAP I.That strategy identifies necessary investments to improve waste
treatment and disposal, as well a strategy to build the capacity of health and environmental
agencies to develop and implement specific waste management plans, especially related to
hazardous waste streams. To follow up on the study recommendations, an inter-institutional
group has been formed to develop an Action Plan for proper collection and disposal of hospital
waste. That Group is led by COPAM, with the participation of other key stakeholders, including
the Health Secretariat. The SWAP I1will support the implementation of the state-wide Action
Plan, especially as it relates to the hospital certification programs directly financed by the loan
and helpdevelop a strategy for proper waste disposal.


                                                 32

78.    The SWAP 11 loan will continue supporting the "Projeto Sanear I.'to increase the
number of water and sewerage connectionsinthe state. These investments inbasic infrastructure
will have a positive long-term environmental impact, but might result in some localized and
temporary negatives impacts. The "Projeto Sanear IT', partially supported by the IADB, has an
environmental framework that was recently reviewed by the World Bank. This framework
applied by CAGECE and other involved stakeholders was found satisfactory in addressing the
Bank's environmental safeguard and resettlement issues. This framework will continue to be
applied under the SWAPI1loanfor all activities under the WSS EEP.

79.    World Bank safeguards policies apply to the EEP programs as a whole, though specific
focus is directed to the project activities in WSS and health, as these appear to present the
greatest safeguards risks. The project specifically triggers and addresses the following Bank
safeguardpolicies:

80.    OP/BP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment. The Project classification is Environment
Category B, since no major infrastructure investments will be supported by the program. The
environmental and social assessment concluded that the project's main potential environmental
impacts are related to the improper handling, collection and disposal of medical waste, and
temporary localized impacts related to basic infrastructure investments. A Health Waste
Management Strategy and an Environmental and Social Management Framework have been
prepared to address these impacts. In addition, the SWAP I1has set aside US$lOO,OOO with the
TA component contingency funds to define activities to strengthen the environmental
managementdepartments inthe state of Ceara.

81.    OP/BP 4.10 - IndigenousPeoples.The Project's Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEP)
will include beneficiaries self-identified as indigenous peoples. Thus, a separate Indigenous
People's Framework was developed. The preliminary information considered in the Project
design builds upon the Plan Distrital de Saude Indigena 2008/2010 and the Secretaria de
Educaqfio 2007/2010. In the EEP for WRM & WSS as well as Business Environment &



                                               33

Innovation, indigenous peoples may be beneficiaries like any other citizen. There i s nothing in
their indigenous identity that will exclude them.

82.     OP/BP 4.12   -InvoluntaryResettlement.Thebasic       infrastructure services financed by
the project are focused on the expansion and connection o f existing households to water and
sewerage networks. These investments are not expected to cause physical displacement o f
people. However, in the event that activities undertaken in the project lead to a need for
resettlement, it should be noted that the GoC developed a procedure for involuntary resettlement
for the Projeto Suneur 11,which has beendeemed satisfactory to the Bank. This framework will
apply under the SWAP 11. Inthe event that a need for involuntary resettlement i s identified, the
GoC will follow these principles, entitlements and eligibility criteria, arrangements for
monitoring and evaluation, and framework for participation.

                       ANNEX 1.STATE AND SECTOR BACKGROUND

1.       Ceara, one of the poorest states in Brazil, has made solid progress in improving both
economic and social indicators in recent years. Between 1985 and 2006, the state's GDP
(currently ranked 15th in Brazil) grew by an accumulated 95.1%, well above the Brazilian
average (71.0%). Between 1992 and 2005, the average number o f years of schooling per adult in
Ceara rose by 50.0%, reaching 5.1 compared to the initial 3.4 years in the beginning of the
period, outperforming Northeast's growth rate (42.9%) (see Figure 4). Other social indicators,
including infant mortality and life expectancy, also have shown significant improvement over the
last two decades."

2.      Notwithstanding this recent progress, the State faces significant challenges. Poverty
levels are still unacceptably high in Ceara, as documented above. It is evident that sustaining
social inclusion gains and obtaining a substantial reduction incurrent poverty levels will require
more rapid economic growth. Fittingly, the present administration, inaugurated in January 2007,
has placed a greater emphasis on "inclusive growth," while maintaining a commitment to
develop further the good public sector management practices adoptedby its recentpredecessors.


10 According to IBGE, the infant mortality rate inthe State of Ceara was 30.8 per 1,000 births in 2006, down from
35.1 in 2002. The Northeast region showed similar improvement, from 41.4 to 36.9 over the same period. Life
expectancy in Ceara rose from 66.9 years in 2002 to 69.9 years in 2006, slightly better than the Northeast region
average, which increased from 66.4 to 69.4 over the same period.

FISCALANALYSISOFTHEC E A dSTATEGOVERNMENT,                 2003-2007

3.      As a result o f prudent fiscal management from 2003 to 2007, the Ceara fiscal situation is
very healthy. The state government has achieved increasing and substantial positive current
savings that have permitted the state to increase public investment and to reduce significantly its
indebtedness. Primary balances and net financing were also positive and increasinguntil2005. In
2006, given its improved fiscal conditions, the state government promoted a strong expansion o f
public investment that led to a reduced primary balance (albeit, still positive) and to a small
borrowing requirement. In 2007, the new state administration adopted a very tight fiscal stance
that increased the operating and primary balances and accelerated the decline in Ceara
indebtedness.

4.      Ceara's good fiscal performance has resulted from the strong performance o f state
revenue and the control o f current expenses, generating increased operating balances and
enhanced fiscal space to recover its investment expenditures. The state's Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL) indicators improved as a consequence o f the strong fiscal discipline. Net
consolidated debt, used for compliance with the FRL, fell from 106 percent o f net current
revenue in 2003 to 41 percent o f net current revenue in 2007, well below the legal ceiling for
state governments o f 200 percent. Meanwhile, personnel expenses as a share o f net current
revenue fell from 52 percent in 2003 to 50 percent in 2007, below the 60 percent FRL ceiling.
Given the high concentration o f debt service payments during the period 2003-2006 (which led
to the first World Bank SWAP operation with the state), debt service payments to net current
revenues have exceeded 15 percent (against the FRL ceiling o f 11.5 percent o f net current
revenue). However, the period o f high concentration o f debt service flows has ended, and in
2007 this expenditure item fell to 10 percent. Given the disbursements o f the aforementioned
Bank lending, credit operations were higher than 5 percent o f net current revenues, but far below
the FRL ceiling o f 16 percent.

5.      In addition to the Fiscal Responsibility Law requirements, the Ceara government
achieved the targets o f the Fiscal Adjustment Program (PAF) agreed with the National Treasury
Secretariat (STN). Given the good performance o f the last year and the reduction o f its
indebtedness ratio, the S T N authorized the state to contract new credit operations for the period
2007-09.

6.      To maintain its sound fiscal position, Ceara will need to maintain the high performance
o f its own revenue collection and o f the federal transfers to the state. As revenue collection
depends on state economic activity, and transfers depend on national economic prospects, the
favorable fiscal trends will depend on the sustained growth o f the state and national economies.
The strong dependence o f state revenues on federal transfers suggests the need for further
improvements in the state's own revenue collection capacity. On the expenditure side, to
maintain positive fiscal balances while enhancing the state's fiscal space for investment, Ceara
will needto maintainthe strict control on personnel expenditures that could otherwise undermine
Ceara's financial situation.

7.      The fiscal analysis presented here is divided into three sections. The first describes the
evolution o f fiscal balances and fiscal revenues and expenditures for the period 2003-07. The
second analyzes the evolution and composition o f the State debt. The third section recounts the
evolution o f the main Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators in Ceara, and compliance with the
legal ceilings and targets o fthe PAF agreement with the STN.

A.1     FISCALBALANCES

8.      The Cearh state government has increased its current fiscal balance surpluses from 14
percent o f net current revenues in 2003 to 25 percent in2007 (see Figure 5). From 2003 to 2005
the State carried out a strong fiscal adjustment: primary balances were positive and robust and
borrowing requirements declined sharply (seeTable 12). The strong adjustment in 2003 to 2005
allowed the GoC to recover its capacity for investment expenditures, which explains the
reduction o f the primary balance and the increased borrowing requirements in2006. Since 2005
Ceara i s generating positive total balances, despite the increase o f debt amortization payments.
The recovery o f credit operations (the World Bank SWAPIloan was the most relevant lending
operation duringthe period) and the sale o f assets in2006 (including the state Bank) allowed the
State to pay down its debt while recovering its investment capacity. After the fiscal expansion o f
2006, in2007, the new state administration maintained a very sound fiscal policy which resulted
inrobust fiscal balances.

                      OF

9.      The revenue performance of Ceara has been critical for maintaining the state's prudent
fiscal stance. The accumulated growth of state revenues during 2003-2007 achieved 55 percent



                                             38

inrealterms (see Table 13). It is important to remark that in2007, state revenues experienced an
impressive growth led by the strong increase in federal transfers." Tax revenues, the most
important revenue item, grew 22 percent duringthe same period. The strong revenue growth was
helped by a recovery in the level o f economic activity, but it i s also attributable, in part, to
improvements in tax collection efficiency. Ceara adopted programs to enhance the efficiency o f
the state revenue service, with investment in infrastructure,                          software, logistics, and
modernization o f administrative process. These efforts have been successful, as the tax revenue
collection figures show.

10.       Current transfers from the federal government also grew robustly (70%) from 2003-2007.
The State Participation Fund(FPE -Fundo de Participaqfio Estadual) grew by 45 percent, while
the transfer correspondingto the Income Tax o f state public servants had an accumulated growth
o f 50 percent. Finally, other federal transfers grew by 160 percent. Most o f the increase resulted
from the CIDE transfer created in 200412. Meanwhile, Social Security contributions and other



  The inclusion o fthe social security fund o f state employees inthe state accounts also contributed to the increase in
state revenues in2007. On the other side o f the balance sheet, social security benefits and pensions paid by the fund
were also included inthe state expenditure accounts.
'' CIDE (Contribuiqgo de Intei-venq&o no Domini0 Econdmico) is an economic contribution charged on
commercialization and importation o f oil and its derivatives, natural gas and its derivatives, and alcohol. I t was
created in 2001 (Constitutional Amendment No. 33, 2001) and the revenue has been shared with states and
municipalities since 2004.

current revenues-which          include interest income, rents, service charges, and other miscellaneous
sources-grew       by 170percent duringthis period (see footnote 11).

11,      Overall, given the better performance o f federal transfers when compared to the growth
in own tax revenues and other current revenues, the state's financial dependence on transferred
resources has increased. In 2003, federal transfers represented39 percent o f state revenue while
in2006 they reached45 percent (see Table 13). Insummary, the composition of current revenues
continues to pose an important fiscal risk: reductions in intergovernmental transfers would have
a sizeable negative impact on Ceara's fiscal situation. The further enhancement of own tax
collection efficiency would play an important role in reducing the financial dependence on
federal transfers, and the associated fiscal risk.


A.3      EVOLUTION EXPENDITURES,
                        OF                       2003-2007

12.      Ceara's sound fiscal performance was also based on the control o f state expenditures.
From 2003 to 2007, total expenditures increased by 45 percent at constant prices. Personnel
expenditures (the most important expenditure category) represent 35 percent o f total state total
expenses, and had a real increase o f 87 percent over this period (see Figure 6). Personnel
expenditure includes wages and salaries for active personnel, social contributions, and pensions
to retired personnel. Wages and salaries increased by 21 percent while social contributions and
pensions grew by 120percent.l3The control o f active personnel expenditures allowed the state to
reduce the Fiscal Responsibility Law indicator o f personnel expenditure on net current
expenditures from 52 percent in 2003 to 50 percent in 2007, thus meeting the Fiscal
Responsibility Law requirement for this item.

13.      The second most important component o f current expenditures corresponds to operating
expenses, which include purchases o f goods and services, as well as operations and maintenance.
Incontrast to personnel expenses, the growth o fthese expenditures was significant (74 percent at
constant prices since 2003) and needs closer attention given their growth trend.

14.      Constitutional transfers to municipalities increased by 21 percent from 2003 to 2006.
The transfers to municipalities are determined by the Constitution in such a way that any tax
revenue increase translates into equivalent increases in transfers to municipal governments.
Therefore, the increase on transfers to municipalities reflects the good performance o f state tax
revenue. Interest payments on the state debt have been reduced inconstant prices by 36 percent.

15.      O n the capital expenditure side, after a sharp decrease in investment expenditure in 2004
and 2005, the GoC strongly increased its investment expenditure in 2006. That year, investment
expenses reached R$ 1.2 billion, equal to 20 percent o fthe state's net current revenue.




l3Again, it is important to not that the large increase in social contributions and pensions resulted from the inclusion
of the social security hnd of state employees inthe state accounts.

16.      Insummary, the evolution of the different expenditurecategories shows a very positive
evolution o f the level and composition o f Ceara's expenditures (see Table 14). The strict control
o f current expenditures and the strong revenue increase allowed the state to increase the space
for investment expenditures. The share o f investment in total expenditure increased from less
than 10 percent in 2004/05 to 17 percent in 2006. Over time, the increase in public investment

growth, and thus improve the state's debt sustainability.

17.     From 2003 to 2007 the GoC was able to reduce its indebtedness. As a result o f tight fiscal
policy during the period, Ceara's consolidated debt decreased by 35 percent at constant prices,
while the net consolidated debt-used             for compliance o f the Fiscal Responsibility Law-
decreased by more than 50 percent during this period14 (see Table 15). As net current revenue
grew by 22 percent from 2003 to 2006, net consolidated debt fell from 104 percent of net current
revenue in 2003 to 41 percent in 2007, well below the ceiling o f 200 percent established by the
Fiscal Responsibility Law. The fall o f net consolidated debt and the increase o f net current
revenue resulted ina strong expansion o fthe state's indebtedness capacity.


l4It is important to standout that during this periodthe federal government, through the National Monetary
Council, imposedcontrols for public sector credit supply, which restricted the space for new credit operations with
governmentowned banks, the most important source ofpublic sector credit supply.

18.     As for the composition of state debt, while domestic debt decreased by 32 percent,
external debt fell by 21 percent from 2003 to 2006. The reduction in domestic debt was brought
about primarily by a sharp decline inthe state's debt with the Federal Government. This decline
had two main causes. First, the index used to correct the debt stock, the General Price Index
(IGP), exhibited a modest increase since 2002, which limited the correction o f the state debt
stock. Second, and more si nificant, the state began to pay down its debt with the National
Treasury Secretariat (STN). 18

19.     Debt with other federal financial institutions also fell (17 percent), while unpaid
government financial obligations recognized by the courts (the so-called precatdrios) moved in
the opposite direction, increasing by 40 percent. Exchange rate appreciation and a few new
external credit operations were responsible for the 21 percent fall o f state external debt.

20.     The Government has been able to accumulate assets and maintain floating debt at low
levels, thus contributing to a significant reduction of state indebtedness.

c.   COMPLIANCE WITH THE FISCAL               RESPONSIBILITYLAW

21.       From 2003 to 2007 the GoC met most o f the key Fiscal Responsibility Law indicator
requirements (see Table 16). The good fiscal performance described inthe previous sections, and
the large increase o f net current revenue, led to a generalized improvement. The ratio o f
personnel expenditures to net current revenue-which                 under the Fiscal Responsibility Law
should be below 60 percent-declined from 52 percent in 2003 to 50 percent in 2007. Good
revenue performance and favorable debt dynamics led to a drop in the indebtedness indicator
from 106 percent to 41 percent, indicating ample borrowing capacity.

22.       Credit operations as a proportion o f net current revenue were well below the legally-
imposed limit o f 16 percent. The only FRL limit that Ceara failed to comply with i s the ratio o f
debt service payments to net current revenue (which varied around 15 percent during this
period). However, the period o f debt payment concentration has ended, and in 2007 Ceara debt
service flows represented 10 percent o f net current revenues, already below the FRL limit. The
positive implication o f the high debt service is that the state has accelerated its repayments, as
most o f the debt service corresponds to amortization.

23.       Inaddition to its FRLperformance, the State has been able to meet fiscal targets defined
in the rolling three-year Fiscal Adjustment Programs (PAFs) negotiated with the National
Treasury Secretariat (which are part o f the debt renegotiation contract signed in 1997).16 Insum,
the fiscal accounts o f Ceara are on a sustainable path, indicating a substantial capacity for debt
repayment.


16 The FAP agreed with 25 state governmentsunder the Debt Restructuring Programwas an additional tool usedby
the Federal Governmentto reinforce fiscal discipline for subnationalgovernments. The achievement of the targets
facilitates new credit operations by the states.

24.     Notwithstanding this progress, the State is still saddled with an adverse debt repayment
schedule, as can be seen inthe graph below. The concentration o f debt repayments--especially
over the next three years-constitutes a significant impediment to increasing state investments
necessary to implement the administration's development agenda. Ceara's overall relatively low
indebtedness level allows it to use the space permitted under the Fiscal Responsibility Law to
access credit. This, in turn, will enable the GoC to implement its development agenda, pursue
structural and institutional reforms, and at the same time meet its short-term financial obligations
(see Figure 3 above).

Below are three boxes with additional details relating to three indicators inthe results monitoring
matrix.


Box 1: Guidelines for preparation of Secretary Performance Reports (SPR)

Duringthe SWAP I,government secretaries initiated sectoral assessments to define strategic plans for
                 n, including strategic outcomes, performan           ators and annual performance targets.
                 that experience the SWAP I1                           monitor the preparation of annual
                 orts against those pre-defined pe                   ors. Each line secretary i s to present a
concise portrayal of its performance, both for accountability and for planning purposes. While these
reports shouldnot be constrained bymultiple requirements, they should satisfy six principles:

1- Focus on results, not products
The conceptual centerpiece o f the SPR i s the Strategic Outcome($ o f the Secretariat, that is, the critical
differences that the Secretariat is able and committed to achieving through its programs to bring long-
term benefits to Ceara's citizens. It is appropriate to identify and report against output/product and
efficiency indicators, but not absentthe context of the results these activities aim to achieve.

2- Putperformanceincontext
The SPR should briefly describe the context in which the           cretariat produces its results. This may
include a general description o f other Secretaries or agencie other levels of government, and private
sector actors-businesses,   NGOs-that     play a part in achieving strategic results in this area. Moreover,
often the final outcome desired (e.g., improved life expectancy) is well beyond the control o f a single
Secretariat. Performance frequently has to be measured against intermediate results or outputs that are
logically linkedto the desired outcome. The SPR should dr         these links. Finally, the report should also
identify the principal risks associated with the delivery         its agreed results targets, as effectively
managingrisk is an integral part o fthe Secretariat's performance.

3- Linkresourcesto results
Costs, and notjust accomplishments, should be reported in detail. The SPR should include measures of
productivity whenever possible. Changes in planned resource allocations are often reasonable and to be
expected. It is important to acknowledge these.

4- Be concise
The SPR should help citizens as well as policy makers to debate government priorities and performance,
as well as the allocation of resources, To be readily understood by its readers, the report should be direct,
and not exhaustive. (For additional detail, as appropriate, readers can be referred to other materials or
resources.)

5- Be credible
Whenever possible, the SPR should present data that can be independently corroborated in order to
support performance claims. The report should be transparent about areas where results can not be clearly
andunambiguouslydemonstrated.

6- Highlight lessonslearned
A key goal of the SPR is to contribute to improvements in government programs and productivity. For
this reason, these reports will include a section with "lessons learned" and recommendations as a producl
o f the SPR analysis. This should include recommendations for changes, ifany, in performance indicators
for the upcomingyear.




                                                     57

Box 2: Guidelines for preparationof "Output-ResultsReports"

Results-based management requires monitoring and evaluation o f the impacts of public policies,
including government projects and programs. "Spending reviews'' (the term used in several OECD
countries) measure the full costs and benefits of government programs and constitute a powerful
instrument to rationalize the allocation o f public resources, thereby improving the efficiency and
effectiveness o f Government expenditure with the ultimate goal o f improving the living conditions of the
population.

A comprehensive impact evaluation of a government program is very difficult to produce. It generally
demands large amounts of data covering a considerable length o f time in order to measure societal
changes in a target population and reliably attribute these changes-ven         if only partially-to   the
implementationo f specific public policies or programs.

As evaluations o fthis kindare methodologically complex, usually take considerable time to produce, and
are often very expensive, the Output-Results Report (Relutdrio Produto-Resultudo) aims to fill a space
between an annual report such as the SPR and a full-fledged impact analysis. The Output-Results Report
(ORR) hasthree essential elements:

1. Consistency analysis o f the program(s) design (log frame)
2. Monitoringof outputs inaccordancewith the log frame.
3. Comparison of actual outputs to expected outputs, examining the extent to which the outputs generated
promote the achievement of the results desired, andthe cost per unit ofthe output produced.

The logicalpublic sector "production sequence" that structures the ORR is depicted below.

                     ANNEX 4. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION


1.      The Ceara SWAP I1has two components: a SWAP component o f $235.4 million and a
Technical Assistance component o f US$3.67 million. The SWAP component i s further
subdivided into five sectors: Public Sector Management, Education, Health, Water & Sanitation,
and Business Environment & Innovation.

2.      Except for Business Environment & Innovation, each o f these sectors was included inthe
SWAP I. However, the interventions have evolved and with them the disbursement-linked
indicators. Similar to the first loan, Bank specialists visited Ceara to diagnose and design sector
components together with State counterparts. Hence, there has been total collaboration inproject
design from the selection o f participating sectors to the choice o f indicators and identification o f
the technical assistance agenda.


A. THESWAPCOMPONENT

Sector 1: Public Sector Management("Umbrella Sector")

3.      Public Sector Management (PSM) is a "sector" whose reach spans all the others. Eligible
Expenditure Programs (EEP) related to PSM seldom are sufficiently large to justify inclusion in
a SWAp, but strengthening fiscal and fiduciary oversight and instilling results-based
management are activities that impact the entire government. Mainstreaming RBMi s perhaps the
single most important undertaking addressedinSWAP11.

4.      On the fiscal side, as a result o f a prudent fiscal management in recent years, Ceara's
fiscal situation is very healthy and the state has created the necessary fiscal space for needed
investment expenditures (see Annex 1).

5.      Giventhis good performance and the reduction o f the state's indebtedness ratio, the STN
authorized the state to contract new credit operations for the period 2007-2009. To maintain its
sound fiscal position, Ceara will need to maintain the high performance o f its own revenue
collection and o f the federal transfers to the state. The strong dependence o f state revenues on
federal transfers suggests the need for further improvements in its own revenue collection
capacity.

6.      With regard to Results-based management (RBM), during the SWAP Ithe GoC
developed an initial set o f sector strategic plans, with accompanying indicators. However, these
instrumentshave not yet been integrated into the culture and practice o fpublic management and
resource allocation process in Ceara. The SWAP I1 supports the further development o f RBM
through mandated annual reporting by Secretariats against pre-determined performance targets
and select "spending reviews" o f key programs. The aim is to introduce critical data into the
policy making process for resource allocations, thereby generating improvements in the
accountability and productivity o f government expenditure.

7.      The fiscal indicators have been chosen to reflect the growth orientation o f the new
administration. Instead o f using the primary surplus, the project will use as a performance


                                                 60

indicator the current fiscal balance, which i s defined as non-financial current revenues less non-
financial current expenditures. Since this indicator does not include expenditures on investment,
it avoids the "easy" way for government to generate favorable fiscal results, namely through
investment compression. It thus takes into account the need to preserve or even expandthe level
o f public investment while maintaining fiscal discipline. It i s important to note that the use o f
this indicator is only possiblebecauseofthe past andcurrent positive fiscal stance ofthe State.

8.      The second fiscal indicator i s the Herfindahl Index o f tax concentration. This addresses
the issue o f sectoral concentration o f revenues. Inthe efforts to collect more revenues, states in
Brazil often have focused their attention, not surprisingly, on sectors with higher concentrations
o f large firms. In many states, the proportion o f taxes collected in utilities sector-nergy,
communication and fuel-has         been increasing, with potential negative impacts on economic
efficiency. The selected indicator measures the participation o f different core sectors in overall
tax revenue, and the target restricts tax concentrationbeyondthe state's revenue profile in2007.

9.      There are two RBM disbursement-linked indicators. The DLI will demand systematic
annual reporting (within government and to the public) by Secretariats with respect to their
resources and outputs/results achieved, and each o f these against their previously agreed
performance targets. In addition, as a critical input into the budget process, a second DLI will
track the completion o f more sophisticated reviews o f the outcomes achieved by key government
programs.

Sector 2: Education

10.      The SWAP Ioperation performed satisfactorily and substantially met or exceeded the
elements in the education sector program framework including DLI, triggers and additional
indicators eventually incorporated into the sector's results-based management exercise. The
SWAp Iaddressedthe main sector challenges comprising a broad spectrum o f interventions:

           Implementation o f a testing cycle and improving literacy
           Upgrading institutions, expenditure efficiency and quality
           Improving State/municipal cooperation

         0 Successful implementation o f the Bank's education loan

11.     Considerable progress was made in each o f these areas, sufficient for the new
administration to consider a new set o f priorities. For testing, the GoC has now committed to
extending the coverage o f annual exams to rural and small schools that were not reached by the
earlier testing schemes. Inaddition, SEDUC i s committed to reportingthese testing results at the
level o f individual schools so the data can be usedto inform school development plans to address
the weaknesses identified.

12.     The new GoC and SEDUC administrators have manifested a desire to focus, as well, on
two high-impact issues:


        0  Children in the early primary school years (grades 1-4) are still not achieving
           satisfactory literacy levels which prejudices their subsequent academic life; and,




                                                  61

          Youth conclude middle school and are unable to enter Universities or find jobs owing
          to their academic deficiencies plus other, exogenousfactors.

13.    To address early primary school literacy, SEDUC is proposing to launch a program for
"Literacy at the Right Age" (Alfabetizacaonu Idade Certa).The program wilI include: (i)   special
pedagogical material; (ii) teacher training; (iii)
                                                 special salas de reforqo (special subject-matter
rooms); (iv) annual external evaluations of all students in the second year of primary school to
establish a program baseline and measure progress; (v) prizes for students and teachers for good
performance; and (vi) pedagogical interventions to address evaluation findings.

14.    The program will also receive assistance from UNDIME (an organization for municipal
education secretaries) and UNICEF which will support literacy agents and consultants to
strengthen municipal program capacity. Inaddition, pre-school education will also be addressed
through expanding coverage and development of a pedagogic curriculum for day care centers.
All 184 municipalities are participating in these activities, which will be centrally managed by
SEDUC.

15.    The object of this program i s to expand literacy among children inthe second grade (6-8
years of age). Literacy rates are not included as indicators as there is no baseline and the
program is to be launched in 2007-08. However, process indicators measuring program
implementation will be used, including the appointment of municipal "directors" to run the
program and evaluation of program effectiveness.

16.     Regarding the second major concern, namely, improving middle-school education to
prepare students for university or jobs, the task is even more difficult. The Government's
signature program, CE-Jovem, proposes to address the problem through computer training,
English, science and math training and after school study opportunities. This program has not
been launched, as yet, and its acceptance and impact are uncertain. Consequently, the program
design will be evaluatedwith loanfunding.

Sector 3: Health

17.     Health i s one of the original SWAP Ipriority sectors. Bank staff working with Ceara
counterparts determined that the quality of healthcare is, at this point, a more critical concern
thancoverage(whichhas improved considerably).

18.     Although health indicators in Ceara are below national averages, the state compares well
to others in the northeast. In 2004, Ceara had the lowest infant mortality rate (29.4 per 1,000
births) among Northeastern states (NE average: 33.9). Infant mortality related to diarrhea and
respiratory infections, as well as the incidence of most infectious diseases (measles, mumps,
tetanus, leprosy, and tuberculosis), continue to decline. The incidence of HIV/AIDS is leveling
off as it is throughout Brazil. Dengue remains endemic in Ceara, as it i s elsewhere in the
Northeast,North, and Southeastregions of Brazil.

19.     More worrisome are indicators related to neo-natal mortality and maternal mortality. As
infant mortality from childhood diseases decline, neo-natal mortality comes to the fore. This is
especially the case in Ceara where over 90 percent of births occur in hospitals. Currently, two-


                                                62

thirds of infant mortality cases occur at the neo-natal stage of life (first 28 days). Of equal
concern are the continued high rates of maternal mortality (116 per 100,000 births in 2005)
which has remained stable over the last 10 years and significantly above national averages (75
per 100,000 births). High rates of neo-natal and maternal mortality suggest deficient pre-natal
risk classification, lack of coordination between levels of care, and poor quality in hospital
birthing, neo-natal andmaternal units.

20.     Ceara has been a pioneer in finding alternative and innovative solutions to health system
problems. It was one of the first states to apply a results-based management approach at the
service delivery level, signing performance contracts with municipalities, regions, and providers.
The state also created a home-grown quality assessment and improvement program for primary
care (PROQUALI). It has promoted the extension of family health, resulting in one of the
highest population coverage rates inBrazil. Family health population coverage was 65 percent in
2006 comparedto the national average of 46 percent.

21.     Turning to hospitals, Cearii has identified and strengthened regional hospitals (hospitais
polo) to lessen transfers to, and overcrowding in, Fortaleza hospitals while implementing a
federal program to rationalize the care provided in small hospitals throughout the state. Ceara
also launched a very innovative PPP arrangement in a recently-constructed hospital whereby a
non-profit organization was contractedto managethe facility.

22.     The State has announced a massive investmentprogram to address infrastructure and HR
needs, particularly for hospital and specialty care.17Further, the Federal Government i s planning
to increase transfers to municipalities to strengthen primary healthcare. Interestingly, about one-
third of the identified problems relate to shortcomings in managerial and quality processes.
Examples include: deficient hospital governance and management, low quality and "resolutive"
capacity of primary care, poorly organized and managedprimary care systems, weak or informal
referral systems, weak commitment of health workers, and poorly trained health professionals,
and the irregularity of state transfers to municipalities andhospitals.

23.     Inlight of the sector issues, results of citizen consultations, andthe proposedinvestment
program, SESA authorities and Bank's health specialist sought to identify the gaps that: (i)               were
not being addressed by current and planned programs; and (ii)once addressed, would
complement or enhance the performance of these programs. One gap that quickly came to the
fore was quality of care-especially in terms of improving processes, raising standards, and
measuring results.




l7 On October 9, 2006 the Governor of Cearhrolledout a major healthfmancing initiativeco-fundedby the State,
Federal Government and Inter-American Development Bank. The program, included in the Government's MAPP
(Monitoramento de A@es e Projetos Prioritbrios do Govern0 do Cearb), consists of R$776million in investment
and recurrent financing, mainly for hospitals. The programs will be implemented between 2007 and 2009. The
Governor acknowledgedthat equipment and infrastructure alone do not result in more or better care. Absent from
the presentation (or program) was any discussion of improving the efficiency of resource use, strengthening
processes related to quality of care, or linking financing to results. However, the Governor challengedthe Health
Secretary to improve "management and organization" of health services to complement and support the physical
investmentsandresultsbasedmanagementwas emphasized.


                                                         63

24.     Quality of care. Despite the development o f a program to improve the quality o f care at
the primary level, quality i s often viewed interms o f upgrading equipment and infrastructure and
hiring additional professionals. Little attention is paid to other elements such patient safety,
processes, and results. Processes involve the mechanisms and procedures used to deliver care.
Poor processes can result in errors and delays in diagnoses and treatment, failure to follow
appropriate protocols, problems in the selection and administration o f treatments, errors in
dosage or use o f drugs and in the administration o f prescribed drugs. Pioneering research in
Brazilian hospitals18 found that improvements in structures (e.g., plant, material resources,
human resource number and specialization) without robust implementation o f processes (e.g.,
application treatment guidelines) can increase the risk o f negative outcomes (e.g., avoidable
mortality). Information on the application o f robust and standardized process i s unavailable in
Ceara. However, the high rates o f neonatal and maternal mortality-which           mostly occur in
hospital-suggest     significant quality process problems. High hospital admission rates for
childhood diarrhea suggest shortcomings in the implementation o f treatment and referral
protocols at the primary care level. Moreover, as is the case throughout Brazil, Ceara suffers
from lax regulatory enforcement o f quality standards: only two publicly financed hospitals are
licensed. None are accredited despite the existence o f three hospital accreditation systems in
Brazil. Although licensure and accreditationdo not guarantee good quality, these processes force
hospitals to examine their competencies, assessing and comparing the care they provide against
standards. Experience in Brazil demonstrates that hospitals that seek accreditation enter into a
systematic process to standardize care processes, measure results, and development continuous
quality improvement programs.

25,     Information environment. A key impediment to effective results-based management is a
weak informational environment. Comparative analysis o f contractors (e.g., hospitals) i s rare due
to the limits o f the information systems. For example, there is no consolidated database on
hospital statistics, production, patient transfers, quality indicators, etc. This constrains SESA's
capacity to verify results, provide feedback to providers and municipalities, and negotiate and
strengthen subsequent contracts. Also, information on costs-an       important input into budgeting
and financial management-is       generally absent. Consequently, there i s a "disconnect" between
technical performance and financial performance: contracts are not monitored or analyzed in
terms o f their overall cost-efficiency or the cost-effectiveness o f treatments and interventions.
For example, there i s no way o f determining if a highperformer i s achieving results affordably.
Further, without information on costs it is impossible to develop robust provider payment
mechanisms, such as DRGs (Diagnostic Related Groups) which have proven effective in
containing hospital costs.

26.     The assessment o f the Ceara health sector concluded that SWAP I1 should support
interventions along the following lines:

          Advance the Government's results-based framework by making a stronger effort to
          influence "sectoral business," supporting downstream results-based management that
          can influence behaviors at the point o f service delivery
          Focus on improving the quality o f care-the       forgotten component in municipal and
          federal programs


l8Rattner,Daphne (2001).


                                                  64

26.      The proposed SWAP I1 indicators do not repeat indicators "pactuados" between SESA
and other levels o f government (federal and municipal) because most o f those are outcome or
end-result indicators (e.g., mortality, disease incidence, service volume, population coverage,
etc.). The SESA i s already committed to achieve these indicators."                         Rather, the SWAP I1
indicators seek to identify intermediate measures that contribute to achieving a desired outcome
or end result. For instance, given that nearly all births occur in hospitals, improving the overall
quality o f care through licensing or certifying hospitals can contribute to reduced maternal and
infant mortality.

SWAP 11disbursement-linked indicatorsfor health

            Family healthhasic care quality certification. This indicator aims to accompany the
            implementation the Federal Health Ministry's AMQ quality certification system for
            family healthcare." Recent M O H directives have delegated to the states responsibility
            for quality monitoring and improvement o f family healthhasic care. SESA has
            embraced AMQ to complement and enhance PROQUALI. It already has initiated the
            assessment process o f teams in a number o f municipalities. This indicator has two
            dimensions. The first involves assessment and classification o f family health teams into
            one o f five quality stages or levels per the A M Q quality classification scheme. The

         0  Hospital licensing/certification. Licensure is a process by which a governmental
            authority grants permission to a healthcare organization to operate. Licensure
            regulations usually aim to ensure that an organization meets minimum standards to
            protect public health and patient safety. In Brazil, although robust legislation exists,
            licensure is rarely enforced. Many hospitals operate without the basic structural and
            humanresource conditions to ensure patient safety. The indicator seeksto stimulatethe
            expansion o f hospital licensing by the state.21
            Standardized cost-accounting systems for hospitals.Without information on costs, it
            i s difficult to achieve robust financial, budgetary, and quality management. Moreover,
            cost information provides the basis for improving hospital efficiency, which i s an
            essential objective o f any performance contract. SESA has initiated a process o f
            installing cost-accounting systems, but mainly in new hospitals. This indicator aims to
            stimulate expansion to nearly all state-financed hospitals inCeara.

2oDeveloped under the World Bank's PROESF project, Avaliap7o para Melhoria da Qualidade de Estratkgia Salide
da Familia (AMQ) is a quality certification system for Family Healthcare, similar to facility accreditation systems,
specifying standards for healthcare structures, processes and results. More than 160 quality standards are distributed
across five sequential stages. AMQ includes assessmentinstrumentsand a scoring system to classify health teams by
quality stage.
21Licensing is also considered the first step in a quality-enhancing accreditation process. Brazil's National
Accreditation Organization (ONA) accredits hospitals based on a three-step process. The first step is licensure.

Sector 4: Water Resource Management & Water Supply and Sanitation

40.     Ninety-three percent of Ceara's territory is semi-arid without any perennial rivers. Most
of its territory is underlain by crystalline rock, thus minimizing the availability of groundwater
storage and natural retention of surface flows. Moreover, the deterioration inthe quality of both
surface and underground water around major urban, industrial and agricultural centers has
exacerbatedthis natural shortage of water supplies. Urbanization reached 76.3% in 2006 and is
increasing rapidly. The other characteristic of the state's urbannetwork is dispersion: 117 out of
184 municipalities in the state have a total population of below 30,000, with urbanization ratio
under 50%. These facts have increaseddemandfor water and sewerage services inthe state, not
only in large but also on small municipalities. Consequently, water resources and their
management are critical to Ceara's development. Although a number of measures have been
taken over the past decade, there are still challenges to be overcome and strong actions neededto
ensure the most efficient use of water resources and their adequate management by the state. The
provision of potable drinking water and resolution of sewerage problems are essential to
improvingquality of life and combating water-born health and pollutionproblems.

Water resource management

41.     In order to address the issues mentioned above, Bank-financed operations have been
supporting the state's WRM agenda, starting with the Urban Development and Water resource
management Project (PROURB), followed by the Ceara Water Pilot Project (PROGERIRH
Pilot), the Ceara Integrated Water Resource Management Project (PROGERIRH) currently
under implementation, and the WRM disbursement-linkedindicators of SWAP I.This WRM
program has helped support the development of the institutional and managerial capacity of the
state, stressing improved bulk water charging by COGERH, sustainable cost recovery and the
implementation and management of water resources infrastructure to ensure the rational
integration of strategic water reserves.

42.     The Bank is preparing with the GoC an Additional Financing operation to supplementthe
original PROGERIRHproject so as to fund anticipated water storage and distribution projects to
provide water to rural communities and impoverished areas, while strengthening the institutional
framework for participatory WRM within the State. The State Government has also made good
progress incompleting a major portionof the Eixfio.

Water Supply & Sanitation

43.     Urban sewerage coverage of just 30.4% is far below national average. Even if septic
tanks are considered an adequate solution, urban coverage increases to only 51.2%. That low
level of sanitation coverage is already affecting the quality of water in rivers, reservoirs and
aquifers, threatening the quality of water sources. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation is
even worse inrural areas. Piped water reaches only 25.9% of the rural dwellings, andjust 7% of
the ruralpopulation has septic tanks.

44.     The State Water Resources Company (CAGECE) is in charge of water supply to 149
municipalities inthe State, includingall municipalities inthe MetropolitanRegion, holding about
80% of the market in the state. The remaining 20% is provided by municipal water bodies.


                                                  66

 CAGECE is one of the best performing SWC inthe northeast region, and its low coverage rates
 are due mostly to economic difficulties of the state and the highpoverty rate.

 45.      The CAGECE tariff model (structure and prices) was set inthe 1970s, and is similar in
 all 149 municipalities that it serves. Since 2002 ARCE is responsible for economic and technical
 regulation of CAGECE. ARCE is a multi-sector state regulatory agency linked but not
 subordinated to the State General Attorney Office (PGE). ARCE supports the state government
 as it i s in charge of CAGECE's tariff revision and adjustment22,directly enforces CAGECE's
 agreed service standards, and acts on behalf of consumers by providing an ombudsman service.
 Starting in 2005, CAGECE is also regulated by a Fortaleza municipal regulatory agency,
 ARFOR, which was set up under the newconcessioncontract signed with the Municipality.

 46.      In regard to rural WSS, the State has developed and is implementing a successful
 management model called SISAR (Integrated Rural Sanitation System) based on simplified
 technologies, and community participation, with operation and simple maintenance at local level
 and technical assistance and more complex maintenance at the regional level. Since 1996 the
 State has implemented over 470 systems under SISAR, servicing over 240,000 inhabitants in
 localities with population ranging from 250 to 1,250.

 47.      Pollution monitoring in rivers, reservoirs and aquifers i s under the jurisdiction of the
 Water Resources Secretariat (SRH), and costal management and beach quality monitoring are
 the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Environment (SEMACE). Potable water quality is
 supposed to be monitored by the health sector, but in practice ARCE is assuming this role in
 regard to CAGECE.

 48.      The quality and reliability of services are uneven in the state. While water supply in the
 Metropolitan Region has very good quality and reliable supply (over 99% of the analyzed
 samples up to Sep. 2007 accomplish with the DistributedWater Quality Index - DWQI - over
 excellent range), there are several constraints in about 50 small out of 220 supply systems inthe
 predominant semi-arid areas (over 25% of the analyzed samples up to Sep. 2007 do not reach
 good results for the DWQI).

State sector objectives and strategy

49.     The State is embarking upon an aggressive strategy for the delivery of WSS to urbanand
rural areas aiming at achieving universal coverage as soon as possible. The 2008-2011multi-year
plan(PPA) sent to the State Parliament set the following objectives: (i)   universal access to water
supply to urbanpopulation and to rural localities over 250 inhabitants; and (ii) coverage of
                                                                                  90%
sanitation services in Fortaleza, 60% in urban areas and 50% in rural localities with population
over 250. To reach these objectives the state must increase investment in the sector, using state
budgetary funds, CAGECE internal cash generation from tariffs, and funds from national
programs as well as credit operations. The PPA foresees total expenditures of about R$840
million for the period 2008-2011, including all sources of funds. CAGECE's share (generated
from tariffs) is anticipated to be R$79.4 million, or 9.4% of the total.

50.     Considering the scarcity of water resources in the state, reducing water losses is at the
core of CAGECE's corporative strategy, with the same level of priority given to economic
efficiency.

52.     In addition, CAGECE has elaborated protocols, baselines and targets in collaboration
with Bank specialists, and will be responsible for providing data during implementation. The
indicator baselines and targets correspond to those in CAGECE's multi-year strategic business
plan2008-2011, approved by CAGECE's ManagementBoard inNovember 2007.23

Sector 5: BusinessEnvironment& Innovation

54.     Both the World Bank and GoC are acutely aware o f the need to mobilize private sector
resources and entrepreneurship in order to achieve sustainable growth. A 2006 World Bank
Group report-Doing         Business in Brazil-ranked          Ceara last among 13 states in terms o f
business-friendly environment. The Governor strongly endorses measures to mobilize private
sector resources, especially in the interior. The Bank held a workshop with business and
government leaders to identify problems and develop recommendations, leading to several
plannedinitiatives to promote increases in:

           Job creation outside Fortaleza
           Private sector innovation (firms introducing new products and processes)
           Formally registered firms

Sector background

55.      During the electoral campaign the present Governor and Vice-Governor o f Ceara
indicated their intention to use Science, Technology and Innovation as tools to promote the
integrated and sustainable development o f the state.25 To achieve this objective their
"Government Plan" emphasizes initiatives to increase the level o f "digital inclusion" inthe state.
The Plan proposes to "democratize" access to information and communication technologies
(ICTs) as "a vector for social and economic development."

56.      The Government's increasing emphasis on STI can be traced to previous State
administrations. Indeed, between 2000 and 2004 the State's Science and Technology (S&T)
expenditures increased from 0.19% to 0.71% o f total State revenues,26 In absolute terms, total
government S&T expenditures grew from R$108.4 million to R$223.7 million. By 2004, S&T

expenditures by Government of Ceara were among the highest in Brazil as a share of State
revenues, trailing only Parana, Sao Paulo, and Bahia.

57.       According to Doing Business 2007 Brazil has one of the most laborious business
registration processes in the LAC region, with extremely complex procedures that require
multiple applications to different entities, resulting in a confusing, time-consuming, and
expensive process. Both Doing Business in Brazil and IFC's Municipal Scorecard 2007 have
shown that Northeastern Brazil has some of the most bureaucratic business processes in the
country. Infact, Cearawas the worst performer on the ease of doing business in

58.       During 2006 FIAS and the IFC LAC Facility carried out a number of projects to help the
country better understandthe extent of the problems inregulatory administration, and to develop
solutions. FIAS led an effort to expandDoing Business to 13 states across Brazil, and this report
has heightened interest in improving administrative procedures in states and municipalities
throughout the country. Meanwhilethe IFC LAC Facility has also beenrolling out its Municipal
Scorecard,** a benchmarking tool that provides comparative data on the quality and efficiency of
municipal regulation of private sector activities in five LAC countries (Brazil, Bolivia,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Peru). It i s currently being implementedin25 Braziliancities.

59.       The IFC Facility has recently approved a project that would involve the implementation
of a Municipal SimplificationProgram innortheastern states and municipalities, including Ceara
and Fortaleza, respectively. The project is modeled on the successful implementation of a similar
project in Sfio Paulo, where an ongoing reform program focuses on improving processes for
obtaining municipal Operating Licenses and construction permits. The new project will provide
targeted technical assistance to assist municipal governments in implementing reforms to
improve their regulatory and administrative processes (and thereby improve their rankings inthe
above-mentioned benchmarking exercises). Inaddition to Fortaleza, the following municipalities
in Ceara have already requestedIFC technical assistance for business regulation simplification:
Crato, Juazeiro do Norte, and Sobral.

The Government'sprogram

60.       In order to strengthen the State's innovation system and increase the level of "digital
inclusion," the GoC already has taken several significant actions aimed at improving policy
coordination, improving the supply of technical and technological training in various regions of
the state, and improving the supply of technological services available for private companies in
order to promote private sector innovation andtechnology adoption.




21DoingBusiness uses a methodology based on a standardized case o f a hypothetical firm to generate indicators that
are internationally comparable. Doing Business focuses on what laws and regulations say; it assumes that the
company has perfect information and does not waste time completing procedures. In practice, completing a
procedure may take longer if information i s not available or the fm does not follow up promptly. The information
is collected from lawyers, accountants and government officials who regularly administer regulatory requirements.
28 The Municipal Scorecard project focuses solely on municipal level processes related to Operating Licenses and
Construction Permits. I t collects data directly through interviews with business owners who have recently gone
through the process and government officials inthe respective municipalities.


                                                         70

61.     In 1999the GoC createdthe Center for Technological Education (CENTEC), as aprivate
non-profit organization funded primarily through contracts with the State. CENTEC has
developed a network of educational institutions that includes four technological colleges (located
inJuazeiro do Norte, Limoeiro do Norte, Quixeramobim, and Sobral) and thirty-seven technical
and technological vocational training centers (4 "CVTECs" and 33 "CVTs"). These colleges and
training centers are aimed at improving the skills of the labor force, encompassing both basic
skills to complement workers' formal schooling, and specialized skills in areas where there i s
proven potential for regional economic development. At the end of 2006, CENTEC had almost
34,000 students enrolled inbasic courses, about 2,000 intechnology courses, and more than 700
intechnical courses.

62.     The laboratory infrastructure that has been made available at CENTEC's technological
colleges and training centers also makes it possible to perform applied R&D and technology
transfer activities that can contribute to diffusing new technologies among SMEs, especially in
the less developed regions of the state. For example, CENTEC has established nine Digital
Centers (CDCs) where individuals and local firms can have access to the internet through
computer laboratories and courses adapted to local needs. Moreover, a World Bank project
currently under preparation--"Cities    of Cear8'-plans    to use CENTEC's centers in the Cariri
region as the basis for providing training and technical assistance to SMEs. These services will
be aimed at increasing regional employment and exports in selected sectors+.g.,              leather
products and tourism. CENTEC also has an enterprise incubator with a presence insix cities. It is
part of a network of incubators of technology-based enterprises coordinated by the State
Secretariat of S&T. By the end of 2006 this network had hosted 76 companies, and 40 of these
were hostedby CENTEC.

63.     The GoC is also investing in new laboratory infrastructure for improving the supply of
technological services, including in the areas o f metrology and certification. In particular, the
government is investing about R$ 20 million in the creation of the Institute of Research
Development and Innovation (IPDI), inthe establishment of the Northeast Industrial Automation
and Software ResearchInstitute (CenPra), the Center of Alternative Energies (Cenea) and inthe
modernization of the Foundation Nucleus of Industrial Innovation (NUTEC).

64.     Complementing the above initiatives, and inthe context of the priority given by the GoC
to increasing the state's level of "digital inclusion", a large project is being pursuedto increase
broadband access outside of Fortaleza. This so-called "digital belt" project is being led by the
State's Information technology Company (ETICE). Its total cost is estimated at R$ 55 M. The
project would allow 184 municipalities covering 87% of the state territory to gain access to the
internet, comparedto only 7 municipalities that currently have access to those services. The cost
of the infrastructure to be built under the project would be divided between the municipal, state
and Federal Governments. When profitable, the private sector would explore the network by
offering various types o f telecommunication services - e.g. phone, broadband internet, video
conference, etc. Inother areas these services will bepartially or fully subsidized by the state.

65.     The project will take advantage of an existing network linking the northern and
northeasternparts of the state-through     the cities of Sobral, Fortaleza, Quixada andRussas-via
optic fibers deployed using the infra-structure of electricity transmission lines. This backbone



                                                   71

network would be expanded to the western and southern regions o f the state using optic fibers
deployed either below ground or linked to transmission lines when these are available. Other
municipalities would then be linked to this backbone network using the wireless WIMAX
technology. The resulting "digital belt" would be linked to a "digital ring" that i s beingdeployed
inFortaleza under the federal CIGAFOR program of the Ministry of Science and Technology,
linking the main educational and research institutions, as well as the main public institutions in
the capital city, with emphasis onthe areas ofhealth, education andpublic safety.

66.     The GoC expects to use the expanded access to the internet and other telecommunication
services across the state to promote increases in private sector productivity, by means of
improving the quality o f education and worker training and through expected effects on the
development of electronic commerce. The project is also expected to increase public sector
efficiency, especially in the following areas: education, with the implementation o f distance
learning programs and the automation of various administrative processes (e.g. academic,
financial, human resources, etc.); and health, with the increased use o f ICTs in hospitals and
health centers both for improving the quality o f health services and for administrative purposes.
Inaddition, the "digital belt" project is expected to increase the efficiency of the public sector in
the areas of planning, budget monitoring, project management, accounting,                   financial
management, humanresources, logistics and procurement.

67.     The GoC has given a large importance to the simplification o f administrative procedures
for the registration o f businesses and the payment o f taxes. Thus, the Government has greatly
reduced the time needed to issue inscriptions in the Secretariat o f Finance's General Registry
(CGF). Until recently, it took between one and two months to obtain this inscription, which in
many cases i s reportedly being granted in less than 72 hours. Moreover, the Government i s
collaborating with some o fthe main municipalities inthe state to business-related one-stop-shops
to reduce the time and cost needed to complete transactions between businesses and the state
government. These efforts are expected to be supported by IFC under the project described
project.

68.     Complimenting the DLI for this sector, two "secondary" indicators will be tracked
throughout project implementation:

1.     The loan engages with six Secretariats, including an umbrella "sector" of Public Sector
Modernization with activities that cut across a number of agencies located in different
Secretaries. Project coordination responsibilities will be carried out by IPECE inthe Secretary of
Planning and Management (SEPLAG). This unit led the SWAP I development and
implementation, and continues as the primary interlocutor for SWAP I1project preparation. No
separate project implementation unit is contemplated. Rather, the IPECE will assume loan
coordination and implementation responsibilities as part of its ongoing responsibilities. It is
satisfactorily staffed to coordinate the project and will continue to rely upon other units for
assistance with procurement, financial monitoring and reporting activities. The Project
Coordinator is the Director of IPECE.

2.     Specifically, IPECE's project coordination dutieswill comprise the following:

       a. Ensuring general coordination with the Bank, the various Secretaries and Government
            stakeholders, and timely implementation of all loan activities so as to ensure
            compliance with loanconditionality (Eligible Expenditure Programsand DLI);
       b. Monitoring, evaluating and reporting of loan activities ina timely manner as required
            by the Bank and State includingthe presentation of financial and performance reports
            (and, if necessary, "requests for reassessment") as required by the Bank for
            disbursement;
       c. Ensuring that financial reports are prepared and presented in accordance with Bank
            fiduciary oversight requirementsand inatimely manner, includingthe presentation of
            State FMIS reports needed for disbursement against projected Eligible Expenditure
            Program (EEP) expenditures, those required to show actual EEP expenditures, and
            audit reports;
       d. Ensuring that procurement is carried out following Bank rules for the loan's SWAP
            and technical assistance components, includingthe preparation of procurement plans
            for the latter. O f particular importance will be the role of project coordinators in
            assisting inthe preparation of TORs, procurement, contracting and implementation of
            public sector management studies in areas such as the operationalization of
            recommendations resulting from the PEFA and OECD procurement diagnostics.
            While TORs and procurement for major sector studies outside of SEPLAG will be
            primarily managed by the relevant secretaries, the project coordinator will assist in
            these efforts, provide assistance as needed, and monitor to ensure that they are carried
            out inatimely and responsible manner;
       e. Ensuring satisfactory processing, implementation and completion of activities under
            the Public Sector Management sector ofthe loan;
       f. Establishing and chairing a SWAP Supervision Committee that will hold regular
            supervision meetings involving stakeholders to track and monitor results and ensure
            that any necessary corrective measures are taken in order to comply with loan
            fiduciary requirementsand to ensure that everything necessary is done to achieve the
            SWAps conditions;




                                                 85

        g. Hosting and facilitating Bank supervision missions and working with the Bank to
            optimize the operation's results and impact;
        h. Disseminating results in such a manner as to strengthen reform constituencies and
            ensure   the carrying      out  o f reforms deriving from       SWAP studies and
            recommendations.

3.      Note that, as indicated in (f) above, a SWAP Supervision Committee will be reconstituted
to supervise loan implementation. The Committee will meet at least once a month to report on
progress, especially relating to EEP expenditures, indicators and TA activities. IPECE/SEPLAG
will chair the Committee.       Its membership will include the representatives from the line
secretaries and agencies responsible for indicators and EEP compliance or technical assistance
(and any other important stakeholders). Under the SWAP I,this Committee structure assured
exchange o f information between different sectors, regular progress updates, and early
identification o fproblems.

4.      Ceara has for at least a decade been one o f the Bank's main clients. It i s currently
implementing a Bank education loan and preparing and Additional Financing request for the
PROGERIRH (WRM) loan. Consequently, there is sufficient capacity and experience to ensure
that fiduciary oversight-procurement      and financial management and reporting-are     carried out
inaccordance with Bank requirements. Eachparticipatingsecretary will beprimarilyresponsible
for implementingits sector commitments, meetingits performance indicators and related tasks.

5.      Following the SWAP I model, the specific responsibilities to be carried out by
participating line secretaries include the following:

        a. Implement EEPs (and other programs) in a timely and efficient manner so as to
            ensure compliance with EEP disbursement requirements and achievement o f
            disbursement-linked and secondary indicators;
        b. Participate in SWAp Supervision Committee activities and collaborate closely with
            the IPECE to report interim and final results and to identifyandresolve any problems
            that may arise such as impediments to program implementation (e.g., delayed budget
            release, slow procurement processing, etc.);
        C.  Develop TORSfor specific studies andmanage procurement and contracting;
        d. Oversee study implementation as well as follow-on activities to ensure appropriate
            implementationo f such recommendations;
        e. Take the lead in any and all sector interactions with municipalities as required to
            implement the loan and achieve its objectives;
        f. Provide sector expertise as appropriate to ensure optimization of results and their
            subsequent disseminationto build support for reforms and ensure the sustainability o f
            institutional strengthening, including inter-agency and state-municipal relations.

6.      The responsibilities o f Project Coordinator and line secretaries are well understood by
now given the experience o f SWAP I,and it is anticipated that implementation arrangements for
SWAPI1will runsmoothly, given this experience.

  ANNEX 7. FINANCIALMANAGEMENTAND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS


1.      A financial management assessment o f the State o f Ceara was carried out as part o f the
preparation o f the Ceara SWAP I1"Inclusive Growth'' program. The assessment was completed
in accordance with OPBP 10.02, and relied on the principles of the Financial Management
Practice Manual (November 2005). The assessment, which built on the preparatory work
completed for the Ceara Multi-sector Social Inclusion Development program (SWAP I
operation), as well as the 2004 Ceara State Financial Accountability Assessment, was based on
field work led by Bank staff, including a review o f the state's public financial management
system. The 2004 report on the state's public financial management system can be found inthe
project files.

2.      All financial management aspects of this project will utilize the state o f Cearh's public
financial management system, possibly including the State Court o f Accounts (TCE), to meet the
Bank's requirement for external audit.

3.      Program Implementation. The program will be implemented using the State's public
financial management systems.          While the coordination o f the program is managed by the
Secretary o f Planning and Management (SEPLAG/IPECE), the financial management o f the
program will be under the responsibility o f the Secretary o f Finance (SEFAZ)29.The design o f
this program is such that the day-to-day financial management operations, including budget
execution and transaction processing, will be carried out by budget and administrative divisions
in the line secretaries (e.g., health, education). State and Bank advances will be pooled as the
Bankwill disburse to the State Treasury.

4.      Program Expenditures Component. This component finances about $235 million of
program expenditures, meaning that the Bank will periodically disburse a percentage o f Eligible
Expenditure Program (EEP) expenditures. The EEP are part o f the State's own budget and
investment program. The expenditure mechanism satisfies Bank policy, in particular OP 6.0's
three pillars: (a) expenditures are productive, (b) they contribute to solutions within a fiscally
sustainable framework, and (c) acceptable oversight arrangements are in place. Specifically, in
relation to cost sharing the State has demonstrated ownership and commitment for these
programs. The State's ownership and commitment are seen in the prioritization o f these
expenditures inthe Multi-year Budget (PPA).

5.      Loan disbursements will include a retroactive disbursement against actual EEP
expenditures paid by the State before loan signing. This will be followed by six 6-month
advances against projected EEP expenditures and a final disbursement (reimbursement) against
actual EEP expenditures. Annual disbursements are capped to assure that adequate incentives are
inplaceto complete the programo floan activities andbenchmarks.



*'The  level of responsibility of SEFAZ is for the overall management and functioning of the state's budget,
accounting system (SIC), and also includes preparationof budgeufinancial, treasury and disbursement reports for
program and Bank management.


                                                     87

6.      Modules of the FM System, SEFAZ is responsible for managing the State's financial
management systems-the         budget (SIAP) and accounting (SIC) systems. The budget execution
system is uploaded with information from the planning process. It maintains all programs and
investments, as well as approved budget allocations. The Sistema Integrado de Contabilidade
(SIC) i s a robust information system designed to comply with the state's fiscal and budgetary
laws. SIC has a budget execution module that allows it to track the State's program expenditures
against budgeted amounts.30 It is centralized at the Secretary o f Finance and extends to all
executing agencies responsible for state budget execution.

7.      SIC identifies the programs (EEP) that will be supported by the Bank through accounting
codes where sources and uses o f funds will be recorded. Financial statements will be produced
on a regular and timely basis from this information. The State PFM review evaluated the
robustness o f SIC and concluded that it can provide financial information for the purpose of
supporting the Bank project. Adequate internal control mechanisms and procedures are also in
place.

8.      Banking arrangements.The borrower will use the State's single treasury account as a
Designated Account (DA) for Component 1 o f the project (DA-1). Disbursements to DA-1 will
therefore be made in Reais and pooled with other funds. Disbursements will consist o f a
retroactive reimbursement (retro financing), six advances and a final reimbursement.

9.      The State Treasury will disburse these budget resources to the EEP and other budgeted
programs as usual, except that particular care will be taken to ensure that disbursements to EEP
are timely and sufficient to ensure conditions o f disbursement are met.

10.     Bank disbursements for Component 2 (TA) will be made to a segregated Designated
Account (DA-2) for loan proceeds only. The Bank will disburse advances directly to this account
inReais (R$).

11.     Accounting and FinancialReporting. The State's accounting procedures and policies
will be followed and will serve as the basis for preparation o f project Financial Statements.
These accounting policies and procedures reflect the Fiscal and Budgetary Law. The State has
consistently applied these public accounting policies and procedures which are acceptable to the
World Bank (the cash-basis o f accounting is used).

12.     The State's accounting system will record the source and use o f Bank resources disbursed
under Component 1 (EEPs) as fonte (source) 40 for external or foreign fundingknancing
sources. As in Ceara SWAP I,loan resources will not be recorded in the EEPs identified in the
Loan Agreement. In other words, EEPs will not show the Bank loan as a source o f financing.
The State's commitment inthe loan agreement is: (i) achieve the performance targets; and (ii)
                                                           to
to finance the EEPs at a level o f at least 70% o f the budget forecast. Loanproceeds consequently
will finance other activities. These uses will be identifiedbyfonte 40.




30SIC is populated with the data fiom the budget system (SIAP) once the budget is approved by the Legislative
Assembly.


                                                     88

13.      Some standard financial reports are also produced directly by the SIC system. The GoC
relies on the accounting framework norms dictated by the Federal Internal Control Agency
(SecretariaFederal de Controle, SFC) and the Federal Accounting Council (ConselhoFederal
de Contabilidade, CFC).               The regular production of accounting records and financial
~tatements,~'as well as the performance of routine reconciliations, has facilitated the preparation
of State financial statements.

14.      All financial management reports32 containing EEP program expenditures will be
prepared by SEFAZ. Preparation of quarterly financial reports by the Secretary of Finance is
part of the normal routine required under the Fiscal Responsibility Law. These reports show
program expenditures in each quarter compared to the budget and will be used for the
documentation of eligible expenditures. The reports will also show achievement of primary
surplus, portfolio targets and disbursement-linked indicators. An appropriate format for the
requiredreports33has been agreed and the ability of the Secretary of Finance to generate them
has been verified. They will also be used by the Bank and the State to calculate the end of year
disbursement.

15,      The format of customized SOEs (EEP spendingreports) will essentially follow the format
of existing government reporting, to the extent possible. A description of the reports is indicated
below.

         SOE 1A - Report on the Sources and Uses of Funds (by EEP), cumulative (project-to-
         date; year-to-date) and for the period, showing budgeted amounts versus actual
         expenditures, includinga variance analysis.
         SOE IB - Forecast of Sources and Uses of Funds (by EEP) for the period, showing
         budgetedamounts.


16.      Oversight and Control Framework. The State's control framework for oversight of
budget and financial data i s robust. Cearahas implementeda new internal control system, which
i s headed by the Secretariat for Internal Control (SECON). SECON carries out regular internal
audits of each government secretariat, and its reports are given to the State Audit Court (TCE).
The audit court will not perform its independent audit of a secretariat without a report issued by
SECON.34

 17.     SECON's scope of work is not limitedto internal or compliance audits. SECON regularly
reviews the State's compliance with the targets set forth inthe Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL).
It also leads analytical reviews of state expendituresto look for areas for increasedefficiency in
public spending. SECON is the agency that oversees the implementation of the Procurement



3' Including reports required under Articles 54 and 55 o f the F a .
32 These financial reports meet the requirement for the production o f InterimFinancial Reports (IFR), as is required
under all Bank-financed operations.
33 The project fmancial reports will follow the same format as what had been produced under the f r s t Cearh SWAP
o eration (P082142).
38SECON audit reports issue a certificate that attests to the audited secretary's compliance with budget rules and
 laws, and that considers that all expenditures are "legal".


                                                            89

Quick Gains initiative-which      piloted a new process to leverage government bulk purchasing in
order to reduce per unit costs of goods and services.

18.    External Audits. It is a Constitutional requirement that the State Court of Accounts
(Tribunal de Contas do Estado, TCE-CE) verify the Governor's accounts every year and submit
a report to the Legislative Assembly for approval. The TCE-CE audit report is submittedto the
Legislative Assembly by June 15 of each year.

19.    The Bank normally requires the borrower to submit a copy of the audit report on the
project no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, or June 30. However, since the
Legislative Assembly has not approved the TCE-CE audit report in a timely fashion, and
therefore the state audit report i s usually not made public for at least 6 months after the report is
delivered in June, the TCE-CE and the Bank reached an agreement during the Ceara SWAP I
(August 2007) on audit Terms of Reference through which the annual TCE-CE audit report
would be made available to the Bank:

            a. Part A:
                    i.Annual AuditReportonthe State's accountsdeliveredtothe Bankby
                       June 30 of the following year.
                   ii.AuditReportontheexecutingagenciesandthenineEEPsincludedunder
                       the loanby December 31 of the second year following the year subject to
                       audit.
            b. Part B: The Audit Report on the TA Component to be delivered to the Bank by
               June 30 of the following year

20.    The State has delivered the Part A audit reports to the Bank required to date under the
Ceara SWAP I.Disbursements under the Part B TA Component are included in the accounts
subject to the Part A Annual Audit Report of the State, and Part B expenditures have therefore
beendeemedto have been audited under the Part A audit requirement..Actual TA disbursements
under SWAP Iwere much lower than originally planned and have been immaterial to the
financial statements of the project.

21.    The External Audit risk rating is "high," as shown in Table 23 at the end of this annex.
As a mitigationmeasureto counter the audit delays and backlogs, the TCE-CE has implemented
a program to upgrade its internal quality assurance process (IS0 9001). The TCE-CE has nearly
eliminated its backlog of audit work. (While the annual state audit is current, the audit of
individual state secretaries still lags.) Notwithstanding this, the use of country systems, including
the use of the state auditor to audit the project accounts, remains a Bank priority. Consequently,
the Bank will seek to identifyand implementmitigatingmeasuresthat mightpermitthe TCE-CE
to perform the audit, at least for year one of the present loan. Alternative audit arrangements
would be agreed if the year one audit were not delivered to the Bank as per the loan agreement.
Such mitigating measures might include audit TOR consistent with the loan agreement
requirements, State prioritization of the audit of project EEPs, training and agreement on audit
techniques and increase Bank FM supervision.




                                                  90

22.     Audit reports received to date have been delivered late and failed to fully address the
eligibility of expenditure objective.There were several contributingfactors: 1) Audit TOR were
agreedto late betweenthe Bank andthe ExecutiveBranchbut were not formally agreedto by the
TCE, 2) plannedtraining to the TCE was not provided and 3) Bank FM supervisioncouldhave
been more effective. These SWAP Ifailures provide strong lessons learned for SWAP I1and
underpinthe mitigatingmeasuresdescribedabove.

23.     TechnicalAssistance Component. Up to US$3.67 million of the Ceara SWAPI1will
be dedicated for technical assistance expenditures, including studies and expert consultant
assistance for public sector modernization, including government audit. These funds will be
disbursedandaccountedfor usingBankprocurementanddisbursementrules.

24.      DisbursementsandFlow of FundsArrangements. Disbursementswill be semi-annual
for the EEP component and as-needed for the TA component, subject to Bank minimum
disbursement amount practices. Disbursement will be based on customized Statement of
Expenditure (a.k.a. EEP Spending Report) for the SWAP component and Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) for the TA component. The reports will show program expenditures
incurredinthe programsdescribedby project documents (PAD)andcalculation of amountsto be
disbursedby the Bank.

25.      In accordance with normal Bank procedures, disbursements will be for eligible
expendituresincurredor to be incurredunder the program.Disbursementswill also be subjectto
disbursementconditionsas describedbelow:

26.      Disbursement Schedule (see Table 22). The SWAP I1framework for funding priority
expenditures, includingindicators, is similarto the first loan. The definingcharacteristics follow:


       0  There will be one retroactive disbursement against EEP eligible expenditures of up to
          30% ofthe loan.
       0  Disbursements two through seven will be advanced against six-month projections of
          EEPexpenditures.The use ofthese advanceswill bereportedinthe subsequentperiod.
       0  Secretariats' annual budgets will be included in the Loan Agreement and a "70% rule"
          will be appliedto disbursementsthree, five, seven and eight, requiringthat at least 70%
          of each EEP budget i s spent by the GoC during the precedingcalendar year.35(The total
          disbursement amount will be reduced by 10% for each EEP that does not disburse at
          least70%of its budgetinthe precedingyear.)

       0  In addition, disbursementsfive, seven and eight are contingent upon the GoC meeting
          the performance conditions set by disbursement-linkedindicators (14 indicators across
          five sectors).
       0  Inthe case that one or moreDLIis not fully met, the legalagreementwill spell out how
          the undisbursedamount can be rolledover to future disbursementrequests.

23.      It is important to note that for disbursement purposes, the Project will use Customized
SOEs that providesummary informationon expenditurespaidusingprojectfinancing. However,
the annual audit of the Project will review detailed supporting documentation of eligible


35 For the 2008 calendar year, 50% of each EEPbudget must be executed to satisfy this rule.


                                                     91

expenditures. Therefore, it is important that SEPLAG monitor the overall resources - Bank and
Government's - project performance from a financial management point o f view. Thus,
SEPLAG should routinely monitor:

          planned/budgeted figures;
         0amounts transferred to municipalities;
          actual expenditures reported by municipalities;
          reallocation o f unspent balances; and
         0reconciliation between amounts transferred,         actual expenditures reported by
          municipalities, and eligible expenditures.

24.     Taking into account that the Bank will finance only a small share o f a large "pool" o f
eligible expenditures, the auditor will need to review documents and other evidence showing that
expenditures inthe budget line items supported by the loan are eligible, and express an opinion
on: (i) the annual financial statements; and (ii) eligible expenditures cover the amount of
                                                 that
Bank financing. Bankfinancing will not be recorded inthe EEPs, and therefore will not appear
inthe Statement of Sources andUses. Consequently, the audit will not be able to directly link
Bank financing to the eligible expenditures.

25.     Retroactive Disbursement. The project includes a retroactive disbursement of
approximately US$ 47 million to take place immediately after Loan effectiveness for eligible
expenditures paid inthe 12 months prior to loan signing.

26.     Disbursement-linkedindicators and performance targets. The loan will disburse
against aggregate EEP expenditures. In addition to the incurrence o f eligible expenditures, the
State and the Bank have agreed that the State's performance must meet or exceed periodic
performance targets for the Bank to disburse loan proceeds. These performance targets are herein
referred to as disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). The value o f each DLI i s calculated as the
total disbursement amount for the period-after     applying the 70% rule-  dividedby the number
o f disbursement-linked indicators (14).

3' SWAP disbursements are always against pooled EEP; however, meeting      the agreed DLIperformancetargets are
conditions of disbursement(as explainedabove).
4'The "70% rule" means that during the previous 12-month period the GoC must have executed at least 70% of the
budgetedamount for eachEEP. The total amount eligible for disbursementinthe period will be reducedby 10% for
each EEP where the "70% rule" is not satisfied. For the third withdrawal, in relation to the 2008 calendar year, the
disbursementfor eachEEP must be at least 50% ofthe budgetedamount.

27.     Indicators.The determination of whether indicators are satisfactory for the purposes of
disbursement will be made on the basis o f EEP reports to be presented to the Bank with
necessary documentation verifying that they have been satisfied. The Bank will, at its
convenience and with the full assistance o f the State, verify the findings presented in these
reports. Should there be any discrepancy found such that the satisfaction o f the indicator i s not
validated then the Bank will, at its discretion, determine whether none or partial compensation i s
justified.

28.     ProgramRisk Assessment. The Risk Assessment Matrix (Table 23 below) presents the
items o f potential risk for the program from a Financial Management standpoint. Eventhough
most o f the individual dimensions o f risk have been rated as low, the residual (or overall)
Financial Management risk associated with the project i s rated as moderate due to the
complexity o f this investment program.

                         ANNEX 8. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS


A. General

1.       This operation is a US$ 240 million loan and addresses multiple sectors. It comprises a
US$235.7 million SWAP component and a US$3.67 million Technical Assistance Component.
The SWAp I1framework for funding priority expenditures, including indicators, will be similar
to the first loan. The defining characteristics follow.


     0  There will be two components-SWAP            and TA. The SWAP portion will disburse against
        the aggregate of 10 GoC Eligible Expenditure Program (EEP) expenditures. The TA
        component will disburse against SOEs.
     0  Each EEP will have been budgeted and formally approved by the GoC, appearingwith a
        budget code and in the PPA. As in the first loan, State financial systems will be used to
        track and report EEP budget estimates and actual expenditures for purposes of Bank
        financial management.
     0  A disbursement ratio of 30% will form the upper limit for the amount to be disbursed
        during any given period against aggregate EEP expenditures. Disbursements are expected
        to be less thanthe amount allowed by the disbursementratio.
     0  Disbursements will include a 20% retroactive outlay followed by a total of 8
        disbursements that will likely take place at six month intervals against estimated EEP
        expenditures. In addition, the US$3.67 million TA component will be disbursed over the
        life of the project.
     0  Secretariats' estimated annual budgets will be included in the Loan Agreement and a
        "70% rule" will be enforced requiring at least 70% of each actual EEP budget (as
        approved by the legislature) to be spent by the GOP in order to activate loan
        disbursement   .
     0  SWAP resources will go to the State Treasury and not to individual EEPs.
     0  SWAP disbursement estimates and actual expenditure data will be provided by GoC
        systems reports.

2.       Given the nature of SWAP program, funds flow to the Treasury and there is no SWAP
program incrementality. Thus, it has beendeterminedthat no procurement plan will be required
for the SWAP program expenditures, except for goods and works above the prior review
thresholds and consulting services with firms above US$lOO,OOO. Procurement under each of the
EEP may be done making use of the procurement methods as defined in the local procurement
law but subject to the caveats below and reiterated in the loan agreement. The Capacity
Assessment, the State Procurement Assessment Report and a series of Bank loans-including       the
first SWAp-confirm that the GoC is capable of carrying out procurement satisfactorily for this
operation. It is also worth noting that the technical assistance component i s supporting a
significant State procurement reform addressingkey areas identified during the self evaluation of
the state procurement systemsthrough the application ofthe OECD procurement indicators.




36 For the 2008 calendar year, 50% of each EEPbudget must be executedto satisfy this rule.


                                                     96

of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised October 2006, as well as
the provisions stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure
categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed under the TA
component of the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the
needfor pre-qualification, estimatedcosts, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed
between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be
updated at least annually, or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

14.     An assessment o f the capacity of the Implementing Agencies to implement procurement
for the project was carried out in October 2007. The capacity assessment included organizational
aspects, staff skills, quality and adequacy o f supporting and control systems, and suitability o f
the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the agency. Table 25 summarizes the key features o f
an action planto strengthen the weak areas identifiedthrough the capacity assessment.

C. ProcurementPlan

15.     The Borrower, at appraisal, will have developed a procurement plan for project
implementation of the TA component which provides the basis for the procurement methods.
This planwill be agreed between the Borrower and the Project Team prior to project presentation
to the Board. The Procurement Plan will be available on the project's database and on the Bank's
external website. The Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision

16.     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agencies has recommended yearly supervision
missions to visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions. A yearly external
procurement audit, acceptable to the Bank, will be required to assess and verify compliance with
the local law o f a sample of processes procured from the pool o f funds. As a result of the post

reviews and external procurement audits, the Bank will be in a position to identify any cases o f
noncompliance and apply the remedies provided for inthe LoanAgreement.

17.     The Bank will declare misprocurement in any misprocured contract funded by the whole
pool of funds, and will have the option o f canceling from its loan (or requesting reimbursement
of) an amount equivalent to the contract amount multiplied by the Bank's percentage
participation inthe pool o f funds.

18. In order to mitigate the inherent risk o f the SWAP operation and the corresponding use of
country systems, a series of performance indicators to be applied during post reviews and/or
supervision missions are proposed. These indicators will help to identify areas o f high risk and
issues that required special attention:


        0    Average # o f days between advertising and bidopening
             Average # o f days betweenbidopening and contract award
             Average # o f bids/proposals received under each procurement method
             Percentage o f rejectedbiddoffers ineach process
        0    Numberof direct contracts (dispensa de licita@o) and % inrelationto # o fprocesses

                   ANNEX 9. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

1.      Ceara SWAP I1 is a multi-sectoral operation that supports programs and activities in
different areas. The Government's priority programs supported by the Bank's SWAP operations
are summarized in Table 26 below. Some of these programs are better evaluated by their cost-
effectiveness, while others are amenable to more traditional cost-benefit analysis. However, as a
SWAP supporting the government's program, a detailed economic assessment does not apply
andwas not undertaken.

Sector 1:Publicsector management

2.      The present project supports Ceara's commitment to develop further the good public
sector managementpractices that have beenadoptedinthe state inrecent years includingprudent
fiscal management and special emphasis on mainstreaming Results BasedManagement.

3.      Fiscal sustainability and cost effectiveness are targetedthrough the choice of programs to
be supportedinthis operation, the setting of disbursement-linkedindicators and institutional
strengthening initiatives (see Annex 4). These includea number of initiatives that will generate
not only significant improvements inexpenditure efficiency and quality but also increase
revenues andreduce expenses.




                                                 103

4.       Strengthening fiscal and fiduciary oversight and institutionalizing results-based
management (RBM) in policy setting and public administration will have a positive impact the
efficiency and effectiveness o f the entire government, including the targeted sectors. The SWAP
Iinitiatedsomepreliminary,positivestepstowardjudiciousfiscalmanagementandRBM.Inthis
second SWAp, fiscal indicators have been selected to reflect the emphasis on growth: instead o f
using the more commonly-adopted primary surplus indicator, the project will target the gross
operating balance, which takes into account the need to preserve (or even expand) the level o f
public investmentwhile maintaining fiscal discipline.

5.       Expanding and mainstreaming RBM i s identified as perhaps the single most important
activity supported by the SWAP 11. Consequently, while the broad objectives for Public Sector
Management remain the same, the activities and indicators have been adjusted from the first
APL to the second.

Sector 2: Education

6.       Education i s considered an investment in the collective future o f societies, rather than
simply a contribution to an individual's success3'. Indeed, lower educational attainment i s a
significant factor explaining Brazil's disappointing growth performance since the 1980s. The
education gap between Brazil and South Korea i s responsible for growth rates 15% to 30% lower
than would otherwise be expected for                       In other words, the more educated is the
workforce, the better is it able to implement technological advances39

7.       Empirical evidence confirms the importance o f education for economic growth: by
analyzing 19 middle-income and less-developed countries, a study conducted by UNESCO
found that, for every additional year o f adult schooling there i s a 3.7 percent increase inthe long-
term economic growth rate. The same work concluded that physical capital investment is
correlated with growth in early stages o f industrialization, but educational attainment eventually
becomes the stronger driver o f economic growth with industrial de~elopment.~'

8.       Brazil has made steady improvements in education. Today, a 5-year-old school child can
be expected to stay in school twice as long as adults from just one generation ago4'. With
elementary education virtually guaranteed, the next step is to improve education quality and
secondary and tertiary completion rates in order to prepare the country for the demands o f a
knowledge-based society. An analysis o f data from Portuguese and Mathematics test scores
demonstrates the high impact o f the student's socio-economic status. The importance of socio-
economic conditions indicates how the educational system traditionally reproduces social
inequities and provides ajustification for GoC efforts at compensatory educational programs that

seek to reverse this tendency, such as the early childhood literacy program AlfabetizaCdo na
Idade Certa - something taken for granted for children from upper-income quintiles because
they learnto read at home.

9.       Inthe case of Ceara, as inthe case o f Brazil ingeneral, the low level o f education o fthe
labor force tends to lead to highprivate returns to education. Inthe chart below we show that the
premiumto the quantity o f education-measured           inyears o f education o f an individual-is   high
and that it increases with higher levels o f education. The low premia to primary education is an
indication o f the fact that primary education alone i s not sufficient to garner an earnings
differential inthe labor market which increasingly needs at least a secondary level o f education.

Sector 3: Health

 10.     Poor health lowers GDP per capita by reducing both labor productivity and the relative
size o f the labor force. Infact, the initial health o f a population has been identified as one of the
most robust and potent drivers o f economic growth. Countries that have low levels o f income
but high levels o f health are expected to experience relatively faster economic growth as their
incomes adjust.42

 11.     An early groundbreaking study concluded that roughly 30 percent o f the income growth
of a group of selected countries and territories-and          even more for the poorest of them-was

accounted for by declines in                      Another studied showed that GDP per capita i s raised
by about 4 percent for one extra year o f life e~pectancy~~.

12.     Health indicators in Brazil have improved in recent years, both through direct and
indirect policies that have had positive effects on the country's economy. Infant mortality fell by
72 percent between 1970 and 2000 thanks to improvements ineducation and sanitation services,
as well as increases in per capita income4'. However, Brazilian health expenditures remain well
below developed countries levels46.

Sector 4: Water resourcemanagement& Water Supply and Sanitation

13.     One o f the major issues affecting water utilities in Brazil i s the considerable high levels
o f unaccounted for water (UFW), also called "non-revenue water." This is the difference
between the amount o f bulk water put into the distribution system and the amount o f water billed
to customers. Highlevels o f UFW reflect huge volumes o f water being lost through leaks, failure
to invoice customers, or both. It affects the financial viability o f water utilities though lost
revenues and increased operational costs. Although CAGECE i s one o f the best performing
utilities inthe northeast region, UFW remain at high and inconstant levels, as shown in Figure 8
below.

14.     Although it is not feasible to eliminate all UFW in a water utility, reducing the current
level o f losses i s a realistic target. This reduction could generate an estimated additional R$ 10.2
million for the water company from 2008 to 2011 (from both increased revenues and reduced
costs). and save enough water potentially to service an additional 100,000 people without any
new investments inproduction facilities nor drawing further on scarce water resources.

15.     The project also expects to expand water supply and sanitation to about 284,000 people
living in urban areas serviced by CAGECE (or about 35,000 new clients). Considering the
current average payment o f R$ 1.98/m3, these added connections will generate an additional
cash flow o f about R$3.3 million over four years. Considering both UFW reduction and increase
o f clients from subsidized investments CAGECE may have a direct benefit o f about R$ 13.5
million infour years.

16.         The total benefit from increased WSS coverage and UFW reductions is far greater than
the financial effect for CAGECE. Infectious diarrhea is primarily caused by water-borne and
water-washed diseases. From a health perspective improving access to safe water supply and
sanitation services i s a preventive intervention, whose mainoutcome i s a reduction inthe number
o f episodes o f diarrhea and accordingly a proportionate reduction in the number o f deaths
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)47,evidence shows that improved water
supply and sanitation radically reduces population illness. Access to in-house regulated piped
water and sewerage connection, with partial treatment o f wastewaters, could achieve an average
global reduction o f 69% o f diarrhea morbidity.

17.         Beyond reducing the water-borne and water-washed diseases, providing better access to
improved water and sanitation confers many other diverse benefits ranging from the easily
identifiable and quantifiable (costs avoided, time saved) to the more intangible and difficult to
measure (convenience, well-being). WHO estimates that achieving the water and sanitation
MDG target would bring economic benefits ranging from US$3 to US$34 per US$1 invested,
depending on the region. Additional improvement o f drinking-water quality, such as point-of-use
disinfection, in addition to access to improved water and sanitation would lead to a benefit
ranging from US$5 to US$60 per US$1 invested. If we take the most conservative WHO
estimate of economic benefit for improved WSS (Le,, US$5 per US$l invested) the total
economic benefit from the projected expansion o f water supply and sewerage connections
included inthe Ceara SWAP I1project would be estimated at R$658 million.48

Sector 5: BusinessEnvironment& Innovation

(a) Innovation

18.     The economic literature has documented the role o f technological innovation as a key
source o f income and employment growth. Indeveloping country contexts, and especially at the
sub-national level, investments should be geared towards promoting technology transfer to local
firms and to strengthening local R&D capabilities so that Ceara will be in a better position to
take advantage o f the existing stock o f knowledge at the national or even global level.
Government intervention in this area i s justified on the basis that the market for knowledge and
technology presents a series o f failures that lead to sub-optimal private investments in new
technologies.

19.     Market failures arise in this area because o f significant positive externalities and
spillovers, which make the social return on R&D expenditures much larger than the private
return. As argued by Hausman and Rodrik (2003) this reasoning applies not only to the
generation o f knowledge that i s new in a global perspective, but also to the first introduction o f
foreign ideas ina country where they have not been tested on a commercial basis. Other relevant
market failures are related to possible indivisibilities in innovation expenditures which imply that
full in-house provision o fR&Dis prohibitive for all butvery large firms. Moreover, the highrisk
and long term horizon associated to R&D investments create serious obstacles for private
financing o f those activities. Finally, given that technological knowledge i s to a large extent tacit
and non-codifiable, the government has a role to play in bringing together and coordinating the
various agents and institutions involved inits production and use. With similar motivations many
countries have created specific programs to support the technical and managerial upgrading o f
SMEs, both individually and through consortia, in order to help them reach the standards
required for supplying large exporting companies and/or to overcome "export entry barriers" ina
cost-effective manner.

20.     As for the economic rationale for providing state support to the development of
broadband services, it i s based, first, on a general consensus that those services will have a
significant impact on economic activities and will accelerate economic development, including
through positive impacts ine-commerce, education, healthcare, entertainment and e-government.
E-commerce, for example, has the potential to assist SMEs in the marketingand distribution o f
their goods and services, while also expanding their markets and improving their internal
efficiency. Moreover, increased access to ICTs (including the internet) in rural areas can
facilitate access to market and technical information, and thus lead to increases in agricultural
productivity. Other important potential benefits o f the diffusion o f ICTs are related to the
improvement o f governance through improved decision making and public administration,
improved service provision (e.g., inhealth and education) and the empowerment o f civil society
through expanded access to government inf~rmation.~'

21.      Given these potential benefits, a second rationale for state support is the recognition that
whereas the promotion o f competition in infrastructure can go a long way to boost broadband

government assistance may be neededinorder to ameliorate the digital divide. Castro and Kester
(2003) conclude that a common theme to the broadband policies of several OECD countries-
including the U.S., Canada, France, Ireland, Sweden, and South Korea-is            an active role of
government in bringing broadband connectivity to every citizen at a reasonableprice, especially
inthose areas where the marketwill not provide theminthe coming years. Itis crucial, however,
to avoidpushing connectivity without the commitment of local communities, and the presence of
an adequate demandfor the corresponding services. Moreover, it is critical to implementpolicies
inparallel aimed at increasing the potential benefits of connectivity by developing applications
in areas such as healthcare, distant learning, e-government, etc. Finally, the public broadband
infrastructure should be opento all operators and service providers, suchthat the development o f
some technologies is not stifled at the expense of others, and regulation is used sparingly and
only to encourageinvestments and to promote competition.

(b) BusinessEnvironment

22.      As argued by Perry et al. (2007), the level of firm informality in any given situation is
likely to be based on private costhenefit analyses that take into account the firms' and
entrepreneurs' assets and productivity and the characteristics of the business environment in
which they operate. Inthis perspective, some of the main private benefits of informality are the
avoidance of the time and costs associated with compliance with government regulations,
including those related to tax registration and payments. As for the main costs of informality,
they include the risk of being caught, and a more limitedaccess to markets-both for inputs such
as credit, and for outputs such as government services (e.g., contract enforcement and SME
support programs)-which      may restrict the ability and incentives of informal firms to expand.

23.      Small and young firms are more likely to be informal because of their larger reliance on
local markets and implicit contracts-with      more limited use of formal contract enforcement
mechanisms-and      their larger reliance on internal sources of finance as well as on credit from
family and friends. When and if firms expand, the need for wider markets, formal contracts and
external sources of finance increase, as do the relative benefits from formality.

24.      Despite the fact that firm formality may be affected by a number of different factors,
there is now considerable empirical evidence on the potential impact that reductions in the time
and cost required for starting a business can have on informality. In particular, recent papers
have estimated the impact of specific reform programs aimed at simplifying and expediting the
process of firm registration. Thus, Kaplan et al. (2006) and Bruhn (2007) have analyzed the
effect o f the Mexican SARE program that allows for firm registration procedures to be
completed withinthree days. Kaplan et al. find that SARE ledto an increase of between4 and 8
percent in theflow of new registered firms. Bruhn (2006), on the other hand, finds that SARE
 increased the fraction of registered businesses-the    stock-by    5.6 percent. In addition, in the
 case of Colombia, Cardenas and Rozo (2007) have evaluated the impact of so-called Enterprise
 Service Centers (CAEs or Centros de Atencion Empresarial), which greatly simplified
procedures and reducedthe time for registering businesses. Using an empirical approach similar
 to that of Bruhn (2007), Cardenas and Rozo (2007) find that CAEs led to an average increase of
 5.2% inthe number of firms registered inthe corresponding cities, after controlling for city and
 country-level GDP, as well as for other time and city effects. These results are quantitatively



                                                 109

similar to those obtained by Kaplan et al. (2006) for Mexico. They suggest that administrative
simplification programs aimed at reducing the transaction costs associated with operating
legitimate businesses, including by taking advantage of internet-based technologies and one-
stop-shops, can be effective tools to tilt the incentives of small firms towards formalization.

(c) Human Development

25.     The quality of human capital is a key determinant of economic development, which
places investment in health and especially in education at the center of the growth discussion.
Economists differentiate investment inhumancapital from investment inphysicalcapital such as
machinery. Broadly speaking, accumulation of capital has positive effects on the economy inthe
short-run, but its impact decreases as the capital stock outpaces the limited land and labor
resources. The underlying assumption is the diminishing returns to capital accumulation.
Investing in education and health, on the other hand, has significant impact on long-run growth
because of its direct impact on labor productivity and indirectimpact on total factor productivity.

26.     Government authorities in Ceara have conducted econometric analysis of economic
growth across municipalities, providing linkages with the regional aspects of the Inclusive
Growth strategy. They usedCobb-Douglas style functions andtested labor (formal employment),
physical capital (proxied by energy consumption), humancapital (proxied by average education
levels or the number o f pupils completing high school), and infrastructure (proxied by a
composite index of urbanization, and connections to water and electricity). One test uses census
data from 1991 and 2000 and covers a sample of 151 municipalities, while another test uses
annual data for 2000-2004 and covers 177 municipalities. The preliminary results suggest that
both human capital formation and investment in physical capital provide the greatest growth
impacts in urban areas, even though all of these variables have statistically significant and
positive impacts on growth5'.


Fiscal Sustainability

Projected Fiscal Situation 2007-2020 and the impact of the proposed SWAP 11 World Bank
operation

27.     Inthis section, Ceara's fiscal situation is projected in order to assess the impact of the
proposed World Bank operation on state fiscal conditions.               Two scenarios are depicted: a
baseline scenario without the lending operation and a second scenario with the SWAP I1lending
operation. The projections look at the evolution of operating and primary balances and resulting
net lending/borrowing and indebtedness, as well as the compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility
Law indicators.

28.     The main hypotheses for both projections are presented in Table 27 below. Market
expectations, extracted from the Central Bank Report "Market Readout," were usedto set values
for inflation, GDP growth and the exchange rate in these exercises." The projection of the

baseline scenario and the scenario including the World Bank operation indicate a very
comfortable fiscal situation. The projection exercise shows that fiscal sustainability i s assured:
decreasing indebtednesslevels and increasing investment expenses - mostly financed by robust
operating balances and to a lesser extent by new credit operations -, will lead to lower but still
large primarybalances.

29.      Figure 9 below shows that, as a consequence o f higher investment levels (about 3
percentage points higher), the World Bank operation would reduce the state primary balance,
operating balances (due to the effect o f higher interest payments) and lendinghorrowing
requirementsduringthe implementationperiod 2008 to 2012. Onthe other hand, revenues would
improve since, starting in 2009, GDP growth would accelerate as a consequence o f
improvements in the business environment and gains in the education and health o f the
population. Net consolidated debt under the SWAP I1 World Bank lending scenario would be
about 3 percentage points higher than the baseline projection. Afterwards, state indebtedness
trends will converge under both scenarios. Other Fiscal Responsibility Law indicators will be
maintained below the legal ceilings. In summary, the lending operation will allow Ceara to
increase investment expenses without puttingmedium-term fiscal sustainability at risk.

Sensitivity Analysis

30.     Using the World Bank lending operation as the underlying scenario, a sensitivity analysis
exercise is performed. The purpose o f this section is to identify the most important risks to
future financial performance o f the Ceara state government. The analysis is based on a set o f
potential risks considered most important and assesses the state's financial performance
sensitiveness to each o f them. Changes inrevenues (tax and current transfers) and expenditures
(personnel and other current expenditures - without interest and constitutional transfers) will be
considered as well as changes in the most important economic determinants o f state fiscal
sustainability, economic growth, andthe exchange rate.

31.     The main conclusion o fthis section is that, only very large adverse shocks would threaten
the healthy financial situation o f Ceara. The projection exercise inthe previous section depicted
a comfortable fiscal situation during the period analyzed. This finding is inpart the result o f the
sound current financial situation and the better performance o f current revenues in comparison
with the performance o f current expenses that allow the State to increase investment
expenditures. Behind the better performance o f revenues is the hypothesis o f higher economic
growth (which affects revenue) vis-h-vis the population growth (which affects expenditures). In
this sense, even if a negative development forces the State to fail to comply with the legal
requirements for a few years, the assumption about GDP and population growth rates will
guarantee the returnto a sustainable path.

i)Revenues

32.     The debt level indicator (net consolidated level to net current revenue ratio) i s sensitive to
changes in revenues, as it depends directly on the latter. However, since the debt level i s well
below (58 percent) the FRL ceiling o f 200 percent, only extremely large variations in revenue
can make Ceara disrespect the legal requirement.

33.     A large decrease o f 20 percent o fthe state ICMS would revert the decreasing path o f state
indebtedness, however, even inthis adverse scenario, Ceara would comply the FRL requirement
o f indebtedness. The personnel expenditures to net current revenue ratio would continue below
the legal ceiling as well as the new loans to net current revenue ratio. The only indicator above
the FRLlimit wouldbethe debt service under suchlarge adverse shock.

34.     A reduction of 25 percent in transfers would promote similar results: increasing
indebtedness ratio 9albeit still below FRL ceiling), and the no-compliance with the debt service
to net current revenue ratio. In summary only sizeable shocks on the revenue side would put the
stat financial situation under risk.

ii)Expenses

35.     On the expenditure side, two items are considered: personnel expenditures and other
current expenditures, excluding interests and constitutional transfers to municipalities. The state
exercises more control on the former items thanthe latter, which i s constitutional and automatic.
Interest payments for debts already contracted are also outside the state's immediate control.



                                                 115

Besides these rigid expenditure categories, personnel expenditures constitute a substantial source
of nominal rigidity.

36.      An increase of more than 25 percent in personnel expenditures is enough for non-
compliance with the legal ceiling for personnel expenditures and would lead to a rapid
deterioration of state fiscal balances.       This sensitivity of the legal indicators to personnel
expenditures indicates the importance o f state policies directedto personnel expenditures control.
Ina similar way, an increase of more than 50 percent on other current expenditures, would lead
to the deterioration o f state fiscal balances, however, FRL requirementswould still be met. In
summary, as inthe case of revenues, only large increases in current expenses would jeopardize
the solid financial situation o f Ceara state government.

iii)EconomicGrowthand Exchangerates

37.       State finances are also resilient to adverse shocks on economic growth: only extremely
large negative shocks would deteriorate mediumterm fiscal sustainability. Despite external debt
i s relatively small, state finances are influenced by exchange rate variations. The vulnerability to
exchange rate shocks is due to the existence of debt indexed to the general price index (IGP), a
price index very sensitive to exchange rate. However, given the very low indebtedness, only
very large exchange rate devaluation would imply non-compliance with the legal debt ceiling.

                          ANNEX 10. SAFEGUARDPOLICY ISSUES

1.      This operation is a follow-up to the Ceara SWAP Iloan. The first SWAP supported
implementation of the state's development agenda, including numerous sectoral investments,
from 2004 to 2007. The innovative design of the project elevated the importance of Results-
based management ("GestGo por Resultados") and provided an important model for inter-
sectoral and inter-institutional management of key programs. The current operation will preserve
many of the SWAP Icomponents, as these are closely linked to the state's policy priorities.
However, the SWAP I1also will expand beyond the social sectors to address issues of growth
and competitiveness.

2.      This second Ceara Sector Wide Approach (CE SWAP11) of an Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) is rated as Category B inaccordance with the Bank's Social andEnvironmental Safeguard
Policies. World Bank safeguards policies apply to the SWAP EEP expenditures as a whole,
though specific focus i s directed to the project activities in WSS and health, as these appear to
present the greatest safeguards risks. The particular safeguards policies triggered by the Project
include OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment; OPBP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement; and OP
4.10 -Indigenous Peoples.

3.      OP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment. The proposed project will strengthen public
sector policies and improve the quality of primary education, healthcare and sewerage services.
For the most part, the proposed Project is expectedto provide an overall positive environmental
impact given the improvements inbasic sanitation and Health Waste management, especially the
final disposal of hazardous waste. Inaddition, the SWAP I1provides for contingent TA resources
to assist in developing better environmental management and licensing systems, focusing on
SEMACE and other state environmental agencies. Some specific investments might result in
short-term reversible impacts that will be mitigated.

4.      In accordance with the Bank's Information Disclosure Policy (BP 17.50) the Health
Waste Management Strategy has beendisclosed during a meeting with key stakeholders in early
December 2007. The project will continue to organize Public Consultations to address specific
impacts with key stakeholders and affected communities.

5.      The investments in water and sanitation services under the Sanear I1 will result in a
number of localized impacts. The Sanear I1already has anESMFthat was recently reviewed and
found adequate in addressing potential issues. The ESMF for Sunear 11includes: (i)     procedures
criteria and environmental assessment for regional and urban infrastructure subprojects
(environmental assessment framework); (ii)     resettlement policy framework; (iii) environmental
construction manual; (iv) mitigating actions for the envisioned impacts at this Project's stage;
and (v) strengthening of environmental managementwithin Ceara State Government.

6.      PreliminaryEnvironmentalAnalysis of the Project's Components. The following is
an analysis of the potential impacts by project componenthector:




                                                117

Sector 1: PublicSector Management("Umbrella Sector")
7.      The investments are focused on strengthening fiscal and fiduciary oversight, and
institutionalizing Results-based management (RBM) in policy setting and public administration
to improve efficiency and effectiveness o f the entire government, including the targeted sectors.
These investments will not have any negative environmental or social impacts.

Sector 2: Education
8.      The SWAP I1 investments are supporting the State Government's program to: (i)
implement a student testing cycle; (ii)     improve overall basic education quality and primary
school literacy; (iii)upgrade expenditure efficiency and quality; and (iv) improve state/municipal
cooperation in delivering primary education. There are no infrastructure investments considered
inthis sector, therefore no environmental impacts are expected.

Sector 3: Health
9.       This was a priority sector under the first SWAP and currently healthcare coverage is
relatively high. The most pressing problem that the second SWAP will address i s the quality and
efficiency o f healthcare delivery. The project will help implement and develop monitoring
systems for quality o f hospital and Family Health Center throughout the state. The improvements
proposed in the quality o f the health services inthe state are closely linked to the environmental
impacts related to the improper separation, handling and storage o f waste within healthcare
centers and hospitals and its collection, treatment and final disposal. A comprehensive strategy
involving health and environmental agencies i s needed. The proposed quality improvements and
licensing o f hospitals and healthcare centers include in-situ handling o f waste, especially
hazardous and contaminated waste, but should go beyond in addressing issues related to overall
collection, treatment and disposal o f waste.

Sector 4: Water ResourceManagement& Water Supply and Sanitation.
10.      Water resources in Ceara, a state located inBrazil's semi-arid Northeast, are fundamental
to the State's economic and social development. The SWAP I1 will support programs to
strengthen the financial health o f CAGECE and rationalizing water use through user charges, as
well as expand the provision o f potable drinking water and sewer connections to improving
quality o f life and combating water-born health and pollution problems. The construction o f the
basic infrastructure could result in some limited negative environmental impacts; most o f them
localized short-term environmental impacts, which would be prevented or mitigated through the
implementation o f a series o f measures. A specific EMSF has been prepared for the investments
inthis sector andwill be further discussedbelow.

Sector 5: BusinessEnvironment& Innovation
11.      This SWAP I1 component will support the government's strategy to strengthen
development poles - dynamic municipal clusters outside o f the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region
and will not have direct impacts in the short term. Strengthen the state's environmental
management and licensing systems (under component l),       should ensure potential environmental
impacts are prevented, minimized or properly mitigated.

Environmental and Social Management Framework for Basic Infrastructure Investments

12.     The "Sanear Il" project is structured in 3 components: (i) sanitation in Fortaleza;
                                                                      basic
(ii) andsewerageintheinteriorofthestate;and(iii)
    water                                                    institutional development. An overall
EIA was prepared for the project and included an Environmental Control Plan with guidelines
for the works financed by the project.

13.     The operational manual includes environmental screening procedures, assessment
requirements and procedures for different types o f basic infrastructure investments. For a project
with no or minor impacts, the actual environmental screening form will be used. For projects
with moderate impacts a simplified environmental report will be prepared; and for projects with
significant impacts, an EIA will be required. The procedures for preparing the environmental
reports and EIAs are presented inthe Operational Manual.

14.     The operational manual for the Smear II project includes detailed elements that need to
be considered inthe environmental assessments and the basic project designs. It also includes a
Terms o f Reference for compensation o f affected populations and resettlement o f poor families.
It also describes public consultation requirements and how issues discussed are being addressed
or incorporatedinproject.

15.     The contracts signed under the project include a series o f environmental requirements for
the constructiono fwater supplyand sewerage systems that haveto be followed bythe contractor
duringthe constructiono f systems.

16.     CAGEC,E i s responsible for overall environmental monitoring during construction phase
and operation o f facilities and systems. The project team within CAGECE includes an
environmental specialist and receives direct support from the Environmental Administration
(GEMAM) of CAGECE, especially regarding environmental licensing procedures. The
GEMAM has a close working relationship with the state environmental agencies, especially
SEMACE.

 17.    External environmental and social audits were contracted to evaluate the adequacy o f the
framework in addressing actual impacts o f Sanear II on the ground. An area that needs to be
better enforced i s the implementation o f environmental buffer zones around dams and water
bodies, as required in the operational manual. Overall the institutional capacity was also
assessed. So far, CAGECE's GEMAM has been able to adequately supervise the environmental
and social aspects o f basic infrastructure related investments, but the team could be expanded,
especially to more regularly monitor and ensure compliance o f investments inthe interior o f the
State o f Ceara.

Health Waste Management Strategy

 18.    Inadequate management o f waste generated by health services, along with an increase of
production has worsened the environmental risks to health and the population. The staff
responsible for handling waste in each health center must adopt a Health Waste Management




                                                 119

Plan (PGRSS). It i s the responsibility of the State Secretary of Health (SESA) and the SEMACE
to guide and assist inits preparation andmonitor its implementation.

19.    The PGRSS provide specific guidelines regarding waste handling, including strategies to
reduce, minimize and recycle waste, separate waste streams and actions to protect safety of
employees, public health and the environment. In case of radioactive waste, the norms CNEN-
6.05 have to be followed. The Plan should include procedures for cleaning and hygiene and
actions to betaken incase of accidents.

20.    As part of the PGRSS, a monitoring and evaluation plan has to be established with
indicators to monitor the progress in implementing the PGRSS, which should include the
following indicators: number of accidents with hazardous waste, changes in waste generation
andwaste compositions by type, amount of waste by bed, staff, patient andmeals.

21.    The project will support the state and municipalities in building the capacity of health
staff and Sanitary Teams (VISAS) in the implementation and monitoring of PGRSS. An
important step will be the creation o f regional technical commissions to oversee the
implementation of the program and with SEMACE work on the collection and proper disposal of
health waste. The acquisition of autoclaves for the treatment of hazardous waste in small health
units has to be encouraged.

OP 4.10  -IndigenousPeoples

22.     Cearahas been made progress improving economic and social indicators over the last ten
years. However, social indicators show half of the population still lives below the poverty line of
?4minimum wage, and more than !A live in extreme poverty. The SWAP I1project will support
the State of Ceara's efforts to promote "inclusive growth" and social inclusion, supporting
priority programs for education, health, WSS,and business environment & innovation selected
from the Plan0 Plurianual2008-2011 (PPA).

23.     According to a number of analyses in Ceara, indigenous peoples are among the most
vulnerable groups inthe state, with low levels of investment on infrastructure, and lagging access
to health and education services. In order to ensure full compliance with both Ceara law and
Bank safeguardpolicy concerning Indigenous Peoples(OP 4.lo), any intervention inindigenous
communities will require a special approach to ensure that the intervention is culturally
appropriate and reflects free, prior and informed consultation with affected indigenous
communities.

24.     The precise locations of all subprojects have not been identified. Thus, an Indigenous
Peoples Framework (IPF) has been prepared to provide for the screening and review of future
subprojects to determine what actions, if any, may be necessary in the social area concerning
indigenous peoples. The IPF will be applied to each subproject on a case-by-case basis prior to
the financing of any operation inindigenous areas underthe SWAP11.

25.     The IPF covers the following subjects: (i)    general context; (ii)potential impacts (both
positive and negative) on indigenous peoples of subprojects; (iii)    plan for carrying out Social



                                                 120

Assessments for qualifying subprojects; (iv) framework for free, prior and informed consultation
with affected indigenous communities; (v) institutional arrangementsfor screening, evaluation of
impacts, and addressing potential grievances; (vi) monitoring and reporting arrangements,
including appropriate mechanismsandbenchmarks; and (vii) disclosure arrangements.

26.     General Context. Approximately 21,000 people living in Ceara self-identify as Povos
Indigenas. There are 11 officially recognized indigenous peoples grouped by ethnic affiliation,
totaling 13,255 families. The largest group is the Tapeba (33.8 % of the indigenous population)
followed by the TremembC (16.8 % of the population), The other groups-Pitaguary,      Potyguara,
Tabajara, and the AnacC, Kanindd, Jenipapo KanindC, Kalabaca and Gaviao-each have less
than 1,000 members. Indigenous peoples are Portuguese speakers and little is known about the
socio-cultural characteristics of the less populous ethnic groups. Nearly 95% of the total
population is settled inurban areas (IPECE 2006). The indigenous communities are concentrated
in16municipalities andsettled in68 ruralvillages, confronting significant levels ofpoverty.

27.     The Fundaqfio Nacional do Indio (FUNAI) is a federal government institution for
indigenous policies established under the Constitution (1988). InCeara, FUNAIworks through a
Nucleo de Apoio Local (NAL). Among its competencies, it i s responsible for landtitling and the
official recognition of ethnic peoples.

28.     A number of Federal and State indigenous policies recognize that the provision of health
and education services should be delivered ina "differentiated manner" to respondto indigenous
demands and their cultural specificities. IPECE considers that the SWAP I1 provides an
opportunity to improve the quality of health and education in a culturally appropriated manner
for indigenous peoples.

29.     FUNAI is the federal organization that promotes Basic Education for indigenous
communities. As mentioned above, in Ceara the NAL receives demands from indigenous
communities andworks closely with COPICE andthe Secretarias Muncipais de Educaqfio.

30.     In 1991Presidential Decree no. 26 delegatedthe implementation of indigenous education
policies to the States' Education Secretaries. This reform was followed by a number of
regulations that defined the programs' contents, technical requirements and institutional
arrangements for policy implementation at the state level (e.g., the Lei Darcy Ribeiro, LDR,
 1996). The LDR definedthe differentiated treatment of indigenous education, underscoring its
inter-cultural andbilingual approaches. It confirmed the administrative collaboration betweenthe
States' systems and municipalities, while the profile of indigenous teachers was assigned to the
State Education Councils (Conselhos Estaduais de Educaqfio) along with the competence for the
authorization of indigenous schools. In2001the definition of indigenous curriculum parameters
was delegated to the National Council of Education (Law 10.172). Inthe same year the National
Plan of Education defined the objectives and targets of indigenous education. The system has
beengradually decentralizing.

32.     The State Education Council of Cearh, according to legal dispositions, performs a number
of activities,     including: organization, characterization, localization, accreditation and
administration of schools. They define and carry out teacher training, define the schools'
equipment provisions and lead the participatory processeswith community membersto ensure a
fluent dialogue andreceive demands.

33.     The ManagementNucleus (Nucleo Gestor) for Indigenous School Education of Cearahas
a technical team of five members in Fortaleza and twenty indigenous peoples working at the
schools of thirteen municipalities. Following the established regulations, in Ceara the
appointments of both indigenous teachers and members of the Nucleo Gestor are confirmed by
the Secretary of Education, applying differentiated selection criteria that emphasize the
indigenous self-adscription of the selected personnel. The system privileges participatory
processes; and consultations are carried inalliance with COPICE.52

34.     Ceara State has built four schools for indigenous students and another five are concluding
a biddingprocess. The infrastructure and design parameters were chosen after consultations with
indigenous communities, includingaspects such as size, materials, andbuilding sites.

35.     The National Health Foundation (Fundaqfio Nacional de Saude, FUNASA) provides
health services for officially-recognized indigenous peoples. FUNASA defined a regulatory
framework for the provision o f health services to the indigenous communities at basic and
specialized levels (2007). This regulatory framework defines the competences and budget of the
states and municipalities (SIAS/FUNASA), according to the number of indigenous inhabitants.
Thus, although FUNASA is a federal institution, it has arrangements for Regional Coordination
with the state and municipal Secretaries of Health. The Local and District Health Councils
(Conselhos Locais e Distritaes de Saude, CLDS) are mechanisms for participation and social
control by the indigenous population.



''COPICE,is   a NGO, createdin 2003, and responsible for the implementation of indigenous health with FUNASA
and advocacy for indigenousrights.


                                                    122

36.     In Ceara the CLDS, the 16 municipalities with indigenous peoples, and Ceara's
Coordinator of the District Health Council for Indigenous Health (CONDISI) issued a District
Plan 2008-2010. This Plan was preparedina participatory manner and definedthe following: (i)
a epidemiologic profile of the indigenous population; (ii) healthcare professionals attending
                                                           the
indigenous health programs; (iii) access of the indigenous population to primary health care and
specialized care, including geographic location and means of transport; (iv) indicators and tasks
for monitoringthe implementation of the Plan; and (v) resourcesfor capacity building for health
teams and beneficiaries, and investment (infrastructure and equipment) needed for Plan
implementation.

37.     Potential impacts. Overall, the decentralization process underway provides greater
competencies to the GoC for planning and providing education and health services. The legal
andregulatory frameworks define the process of informedconsultation before designing service
provision for indigenous communities. Multidisciplinary teams plan and attend in a
"differentiated and culturally appropriated manner" education and health provisionto indigenous
communities.

38.     Negative impacts under the project are unlikely. However, there will be screening for
possible adverse cumulative impacts in the context of the SWAP 11. Consistent with the
Operational Policy 4.10 of the World Bank the project will put in place a mechanism to ensure
the inclusion of traditional knowledge and practices where indigenous groups are impacted,
responding to indigenous demands for free, prior and informed consultation with affected
indigenous communities. Similarly, the IPF includes principles to guide activities to track the
positive impacts for indigenous peoples of the SWAp 11-supportedprograms.

39.     Social Assessments of subprojects. Given the type of project activities, these
investments are not expected to have negative impacts for indigenous communities. The
Framework is intended to ensure that indigenous peoples receive culturally appropriate benefits
under the project. That requires that the concept of "culturally appropriate benefits" must be
consulted with indigenous peoples.

40.     Prior to carrying out subproject activities that may impact indigenous peoples the
Borrower will carry free and informed consultations and conduct social assessments (SAs). The
objectives of the consultation are to: (a) provide an update of the quality of public services
offered to indigenous peoples; (b) assess the use of intercultural approaches for health and
education services provided under the project, and perceptions of good practices (traditional or
non-traditional) by public or private providers, individuals or agencies; and (c) ensure access by
indigenous peoples to health and education investments.

41.     The SAs will:

        a. Review, on a scale appropriate to the project, the legal and institutional framework
            applicable to indigenous peoples;
        b. Develop baseline data on the demographic, social, cultural and political
            characteristics of the affected indigenous communities-the      territories they have




                                                123

             traditionally owned, used or occupied, and the natural resources on which they
             depend;
        c. Review o f key project stakeholders and the elaboration o f a culturally appropriate
             process for consulting indigenous peoples at each stage o f subproject preparation and
             implementation;
        d. C m y out an assessment based on free, prior and informed consultation with the
             affected indigenous communities, o f potential positive and negative project impacts,
             as well as the relative vulnerability of, and risks to, the affected indigenous
             communities;
        e. Identify and evaluate measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or compensate for any
             adverse effects.

43.     The Social Assessments will be carried out by the GoC, supporting the harmonization
between the GoC and WB OP/ BP 4.10 and defining the corresponding mechanisms for
monitoring and evaluation o f this results-based approach. The Bank will review Terms o f
Reference for any SAs to ensure the necessary qualifications and experience o f the consultants.

44.     IPECE will ensure compliance with OP/BP 4.10, issuing the SAs for the preparation and
implementation o f the multiple subprojects. This includes evaluating and screening the potential
stakeholders prior to implementation, and recommending ways and procedures that could
prevent such impacts. A previous screening will define required capacity-building needs for the
implementingagency inthe GoC.

45.     IPECE will be responsible for formulating and implementing the consultations in order
to: (i)ensure the availability o f relevant information on the project to indigenous peoples; and
(ii) instrumentsforprojectmonitoring.IPECEwillestablishthemechanismtoinformat
    support
the design stage FUNASA, CONDISI, and EducaCa"o Escolar Indigena regarding project
objectives and descriptions in education and health, if implemented in areas with indigenous
population.

46.     Consultations: free, prior and informed consultation. Bank policy requires that all
projects affecting indigenous peoples include a process o f free, prior and informed consultation
with the affected communities throughout the project cycle. Federal law also requires
consultation to ensure the effectiveness o f basic rights to the cultural, social and economic
integrity o f indigenous communities. The following are the guidelines to be taken into account
for the consultation process, to be tailored to specific sectors needs and circumstances, as well as
to those o f the corresponding population:

           "free, prior and informed consultation" that occurs voluntarily, in a culturally
           appropriate manner, form and language, and where the consulted parties have prior
           access to information on the intent and scope o fthe project;
           full discussion withthe concerned groups, evenincases where the expected affects are
           indirect;
           legitimate representation o f indigenous spokespersons and leaders and established
           representative bodies;

      0   consultation.conducted in a manner compatible with the communities' own decision-
          making structures;
      0   provision of assistance necessaryto ensure full participation of all affected indigenous
          communities;
      0   record of the consultation process as part of the project files, including the
          participation of individuals and events (e.g., attendance sheets) and the opinions
          expressedand conclusions reached(e.g., minutesof meetings);
      0   a system for reporting and addressing any grievances and/or suggestions that might
          arise during the consultation process.

47.    Institutional arrangements for an Indigenous Peoples Plan.                 When screening
Programs, if it is determined that OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples is triggered, then it will be
determined if and Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) or other instrumentsare to be preparedby the
borrower. The Bank will make this determination and convey the decision to the borrower,
discuss any actions necessary to prepare the IPP or other required instrument(s), and agree on a
timeline for preparation and delivery to the Bank, IPECE will provide Terms of Reference for
the elaboration of the IPP and other instrument(s). The borrower will then submit the Plan to the
Bankfor reviewbefore the respectiveProgrammay bedeemedeligible for Bankfinancing.

48.    The IPP will detail the specific measures designedto ensure that any Indigenous Peoples
affected by the project will receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits, and that
any identifiedpotential adverse impacts will be avoided, minimized, mitigated or compensated. .

49.    Each Indigenous peoples Plan (IPP) will be fully integrated into the programs design,
with a varying level of detail according to the specific program involved. The IPP will include:
a) a summary of results of the consultation, and a framework for ensuring free and prior
informed consultation with the affected indigenous communities during implementation; b) an
action planof measures designedto ensure that indigenous peoples receive culturally appropriate
social and economic benefits (including, where necessary, capacity building measures for the
implementing agencies); c) measures designed to avoid, minimize, mitigate or compensate for
any identifiedpotential adverse impacts on indigenous peoples; d) cost estimates and a financing
plan for the IPP, and appropriate mechanisms and benchmarks for monitoring, evaluating and
reporting on the implementation of the IPP. FUNASA and FUNAIwill monitor and evaluate the
programs implementation on education and health respectively, when implemented in the rural
municipalities with indigenous population officially recognized as such, by FUNAI.

50.    Monitoring and Evaluation. An appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework will
be elaborated in consultation with key stakeholders, including affected indigenous groups, in
order to:

          identify expectedsocial development indicators;
       0  propose mechanismsfor measuring these social development outcomes; and
          define the institutional responsibilities for the monitoring and evaluation procedures.

52.    The monitoring and evaluation framework will be tailored to the particular subproject's
conditions and affected groups, and will rely to the greatest possible extent on participatory



                                                 125

mechanisms. It will include supervision instruments and stakeholder feedback as inputs into
project improvement

53.    Disclosure.The borrower will make the IPF and all draft IPPs available to the affected
indigenous communities inan appropriate form, manner, and language. Before project appraisal,
the borrower will submit the IPF to the Bank for review. Once it has been accepted as providing
an adequate basis for subproject appraisal, the Bank will then make the IPF available to the
public inaccordance with the World Bank Policy on Disclosure o f Information, and the borrower
will make it available to the affected indigenous communities in the same manner as the earlier
draft documents. All reports and accompanying materials will be provided inSpanish and, where
necessary, any relevant indigenous language.

OP 4.12 -InvoluntaryResettlement

54.     The SWAP I1project will support the GoC to extendthe coverage of water and sanitation
services. The EEPs include waste management and basic infrastructure for improvement on
water and sewage. Resettlement i s expected to be avoided and the affected population i s
anticipated to be either very small or non-existent. The affected population will be determined on
case-by case basis, based on field surveys, social assessments and consultations. In the event a
need for resettlement arises, the GoC has experience in applying involuntary resettlement
practices that are considered among the best practices across the country. (This experience has
been acquired mainly with two projects o f the IDB, Sanear I& 11.) The Bank's Operational
Policy (OP 4.12) and the GoC's principles and procedures o f involuntary resettlement and land
acquisition are very similar. The Bank has evaluated the Sanear resettlement framework and its
implementation. Both are deemed acceptable by the Bank. To support policy harmonization, the
SWAP I1 will follow the principles established for the Sanear project. In the event that any
discrepancy arises, however, the Bank's policies will prevail.

55.     The GoC Resettlement Framework provides the principles and guidance in cases when
the construction o f water and sanitation infrastructure financed by SWAP I1 results in the
removal o f either families and/or businesses (loss o f income sources or means o f livelihood).
This states that when a subproject affects fewer than 200 people, the project should prepare an
Abbreviated Resettlement Plan (ARP). Meanwhile, if a subproject affects 200 people or more, a
complete Resettlement Plan (RP) i s required. In either instance, the ARP or RP should be
submitted for World Bank review before construction begins. Any subproject "Resettlement
Plans" should consider: (i)  all occupants o f areas occupied by infrastructure; and (ii) people
                                                                                         all
temporarily displaced by the civil works.

56.     The principles that guide this framework are:


       0   Avoid and minimize negative impacts caused by the project
       0   Avoid affecting living conditions o f the community
       0   Provide technical assistance so that the displaced may have the possibility o f
           reestablishing their previous levels o f income
       0   Establish clear and transparent eligibility criteria for receiving benefits




                                                 126

          Establish a minimum standard for resettlement or compensation in order to guarantee
          a minimum quality of life, irrespective of the previous status of those being resettled
          (land owner, lessee, resident)
          Promote the participation of the affected communities and involvement of local
          institutions
          Include resettlementcosts inthe subproject's overall cost

59.    As with the SWAP I,the overall costs of resettlement, if any, are expected will be
provided by the GoC. When resettlement is considered as part of project activity, a prior
consultative process will be carried out, ensuring wide participation of beneficiaries and
interestedparties to:

           inform the affected population on works impacts;
           take note of the affected population's needs andpreferences;
           provide examples for alternative solutions for the affected families;
           register the reactions of the affected population to the proposed solutions, including
           suggestions

60.     A communication strategy will ensure the access to project informationduring the project
implementation.

InstitutionalArrangements

61.     IPECE in the Secretary of Planning will be the responsible implementing agency. The
Project Coordinator i s the head of IPECE, who will report to the Secretary of Planning. Each
secretaryhector is represented by a key technical staff person on a SWAP Committee to ensure
close and continuing monitoring and evaluation by all sector stakeholders. The Committee will
meet monthly and each representative will report on progress in achieving indicators, technical
assistance, and EEP so that any problems that surface can be identifiedand addressedpromptly.
Issues that require multi-sector responsescan be addressedinthese collaborative meetings.

62.     Project coordination responsibilities comprise the activities normally undertaken by
project coordinatinghmplementation units, including coordinating the effort of participating
secretaries, running the SWAp Committee, and identifying and resolving problems. The specific
responsibilities to be carried out by the participating Secretariesinclude: (i)
                                                                              implementing sector
