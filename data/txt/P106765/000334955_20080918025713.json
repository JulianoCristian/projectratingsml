higher-level objective of the Ceara\n            Second Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) Inclusive Growth Project\n            for Brazil is to contribute to expanding and consolidating\n            the social advances and institutional modernization of the\n            State of Ceara. The project will achieve this by supporting\n            nine key government investment programs in five sectors,\n            selected to optimize development impact. A series of\n            disbursement-linked indicators are mapped to the five\n            sectors-public sector management, education, health, water\n            & sanitation, and business environment &\n            innovation-to strengthen the incentives to achieve results.\n            There are two main project components: (i) the SWAP\n            component disbursing against ten pooled Eligible Expenditure\n            Programs (EEP), with disbursement-linked performance\n            indicators and individual EEP expenditure thresholds as\n            conditions to release loan funds; and (ii) a small technical\n            assistance (TA) component to support SWAP II objectives in\n            the five priority sectors. The TA component will disburse\n            like a traditional operation against statements of\n            expenditure (SOEs)."}, "docdt": "2008-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
