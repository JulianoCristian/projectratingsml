                         The higher-level objective of the Cear# SWAp II project is to contribute to expanding and consolidating the social advances and institutional modernization of
                         the State of Cear#. The project will achieve this by supporting nine key government investment programs in five sectors, selected to optimize development
                         impact. A series of disbursement-linked indicators (14) are mapped to the five sectors#public sector management, education, health, water & sanitation, and
                         business environment & innovation#to strengthen the incentives to achieve results.

                          Specifically, the project development objectives are to
                          # help the Government of Cear# to improve its fiscal situation;
                          # strengthen the state#s system of results-based management;
                          # promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and health;
                          # improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the government autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery;
                         and
                          # reduce barriers to business investment.
