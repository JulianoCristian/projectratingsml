The project will achieve this by supporting nine\n            key government investment programs in five sectors, selected\n            to optimize development impact. A series of\n            disbursement-linked indicators (14) are mapped to the five\n            sectors -- public sector management, education, health,\n            Water Resource Management/Water Supply and Sanitation\n            (WRM/WSS), and business environment and innovation -- to\n            strengthen the incentives to achieve results. Specifically,\n            the project development objectives are to: 1) help the\n            Government of Ceara to improve its fiscal situation; 2)\n            strengthen the state's system of results-based\n            management; 3) promote better service quality in education\n            (particularly childhood literacy and health; 4) improve\n            access to WSS, increase cost recovery in the water sector,\n            and improve the efficiency of the two government autarchies\n            with responsibility for water supply and management; and 5)\n            reduce barriers to business investment. The potential\n            safeguard impacts associated with this project are linked to\n            hospital certification (hospital waste disposal) and\n            investments in WSS connections. No potential large scale,\n            significant and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated\n            owing to the activities of the project. The works related to\n            water and sanitation will be localized and site-specific.\n            Some specific investments for WSS may result in\n            site-specific, reversible impacts that will be mitigated.\n            Involuntary resettlements, if any, associated with these\n            programs will be localized."}, "docdt": "2008-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
