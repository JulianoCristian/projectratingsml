                         business environment & innovation#to strengthen the incentives to achieve results.

                          Specifically, the project development objectives are to
                          # help the Government of Cear# to improve its fiscal situation;
                          # strengthen the state#s system of results-based management;
                          # promote better service quality in education (particularly early-childhood literacy) and health;
                          # improve access to water and sewerage services, and improve the efficiency of the government autarchies with responsibility for water quality and delivery;
                         and
                          # reduce barriers to business investment.
