                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to contribute to changing the behavior of the Chadian populations so that they will adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk
                         of: (i) HIV infection; and (ii) too closely spaced and/or unwanted pregnancies. Achievement of these objectives will be measured by the following in project areas: an
                         increase in knowledge of men and women aged15-24 years regarding HIV/AIDS and two means of avoiding transmission; increase in the use of condoms by young
                         people (aged 15 to24) during non-union sexual contact in the last 12 months; increase in the use of condoms by military personnel during sexualcontract over the last 12
                         months; prevalence of HIV in pregnant women aged 15 to 24; modern methods contraceptive prevalence ratein pregnant women (in urbanand in rural areas); percentage
                         of women aged 15 to 24 wishing to space births by at least two years;and percentage of women who donot want anymore children.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project will close as planned, on June 30th, 2013. The project progressed well towards achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and implementation. PDO
                         indicators improved steadily from their baseline and key benchmarks have been essentially attained: most indicators are very close to their end targets and six intermediate indicators
                         have also surpassed their target. In 18 months of implementation, the results-based financing (RBF) component has made impressive progress with a doubling of the number of

                         children vaccinated and women receiving more than 3 prenatal visits in the intervention districts. During the same period the RBF districts have seen a quadrupling of skilled birth
                         attendance and use of modern contraceptive methods. Quality of care, as measured by a quantitative checklist, improved by more than 50% at primary health care level. The project
                         also pioneered the use of mobile teams that brought modern health services to communities who had never had it before and dramatically improved equity in access to health
                         services. These two approaches have the potential to transform the health system in Chad and make a huge difference to a population that suffers from some fo the worst health
                         outcomes in the world. As of June 05, 2013, 100% of the IDA credit and 91.34% of the IDA grant have been disbursed (equivalent to about SDR12,1 millions or US$ 18.7 millions).
                         The IDA grant is expected to be fully disbursed by the closing date, since all major contracts are being executed and the Result-Based Financing (RBF) and mobile team components
                         have been disbursing predictably.

                         On the whole there are no major issues with respect to project management, procurement and financial management. The Project continues to be implemented in an adequate
                         manner despite a challenging country context. As this is the final year of the project, the Government of Chad is conducting several evaluation studies, to provide evidence and
                         documentation on what it was able to achieve and what challenges it faced in achieving its objectives. The Project has also conducted a financial and technical audit of the project
                         implementing agencies in the second quarter of 2013. During the last supervision mission the project received Bank support in organizing the Government's Project Completion
                         Report (PCR). Additional guidance was provided, and the project recruited the firm which did the 2011 survey to repeat it in 2013, which will be extremely helpful to document project
                         outcomes in time for the project completion report. In addition, interviews will shortly be conducted towards beneficiaries, people living with HIV-AIDS, NGOs and local authorities to
                         understand better what they feel the project has offered to them.
