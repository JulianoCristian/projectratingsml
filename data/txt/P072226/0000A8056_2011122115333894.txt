                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to contribute to changing the behavior of the Chadian populations so that they will adopt behaviors which will
                         reduce the risk of: (i) HIV infection; and (ii) too closely spaced and/or unwanted pregnancies. Achievement of these objectives will be measured by the following
                         in project areas: an increase in knowledge of men and women aged15-24 years regarding HIV/AIDS and two means of avoiding transmission; increase in the use
                         of condoms by young people (aged 15 to24) during non-union sexual contact in the last 12 months; increase in the use of condoms by military personnel during
                         sexualcontract over the last 12 months; prevalence of HIV in pregnant women aged 15 to 24; modern methods contraceptive prevalence ratein pregnant women
                         (in urbanand in rural areas); percentage of women aged 15 to 24 wishing to space births by at least two years;and percentage of women who donot want
                         anymore children.
