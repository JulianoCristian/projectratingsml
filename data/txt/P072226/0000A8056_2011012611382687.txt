                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           Despite its very recent effectiveness, the project implementation (including on procurement) is proceeding well and various preparatory activities for the execution of each of the
                         component as well as program launch activities have taken place, including trainings, communication and sensitization sessions regarding the RBF system held at different levels,
                         including at the Central level of the Ministry of Health for a range of actors. The mobile teams are getting ready to start their activities and the government has assigned the required
                         medical personnel/staffs to the mobile teams accordingly. The RBF (Results Based Financing Component) is also progressing well: a national workshop on RBF is scheduled for end
                         January 2011. There has been some progress on recruitment as well. The procurement of the Purchasing Performance Agency is at a very advance stage and the negotiations with
                         the best evaluated bidder will take place by mid January, 2011. The firm is scheduled to be on ground by end of February 2011 to start its work.

                         The state of M&E efforts remains generally problematic. The team has been working and consulting with both the authorities and partners to obtain the 2008 MICS dataset (or 2010
                         MICS results) which will save lot of trouble in terms of obtaining baseline data for the project and designing the geographic scope of interventions if we knew. This has been
                         challenging and the team will now refocus its energy on revamping the health management information system and helping to launch facility based surveys as well as household

                         surveys. TORs have been produced accordingly and RFP will be launch by end of December for the recruitment of the firm.
