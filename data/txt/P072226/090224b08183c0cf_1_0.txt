                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to contribute to changing the behavior of the Chadian populations so that they will adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk
                         of: (i) HIV infection; and (ii) too closely spaced and/or unwanted pregnancies. Achievement of these objectives will be measured by the following in project areas: an
                         increase in knowledge of men and women aged15-24 years regarding HIV/AIDS and two means of avoiding transmission; increase in the use of condoms by young
                         people (aged 15 to24) during non-union sexual contact in the last 12 months; increase in the use of condoms by military personnel during sexualcontract over the last 12
                         months; prevalence of HIV in pregnant women aged 15 to 24; modern methods contraceptive prevalence ratein pregnant women (in urbanand in rural areas); percentage
                         of women aged 15 to 24 wishing to space births by at least two years;and percentage of women who donot want anymore children.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to advance well both on progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and implementation. PDO indicators have improved steadily
                         from its baseline and shall likely reach their end targets. A large proportion of RBF indicators continue to show significant improvement, both in terms of utilization and quality, as
                         described in the later sections. As of October 2012, approximately USD 15 million equivalent has been disbursed, representing an overall disbursement of 70 percent of the grant.

                         The grant is expected to be fully utilized by the closing date (i.e., June 30, 2013), since all major contracts are signed and the RBF and mobile team components disburse predictably.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         On the whole there are no major issues with respect to project management, procurement and financial management. Project Implementation has remained at Satisfactory, indicating
                         that the Project continues to be implemented in an adequate manner despite a challenging country context.

                         As this is the final year of the project, the Government of Chad is to conduct an evaluation of the project, to provide some evidence and documentation on what the project was able
                         to achieve and what hurdles and challenges it faced in achieving some of the objectives stated in the project design. The Project is also to conduct a financial and technical audit of
                         the project implementing agencies in the second quarter of 2013 . During the next supervision mission/ review , the team intends to visit the beneficiaries, people living with HIV-
                         AIDS, and visit NGOs and local authorities to understand better what they feel the project has offered to them. The project will close as planned in June 2013.
