                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to contribute to changing the behavior of the Chadian populations so that they will adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk
                         of: (i) HIV infection; and (ii) too closely spaced and/or unwanted pregnancies. Achievement of these objectives will be measured by the following in project areas: an
                         increase in knowledge of men and women aged15-24 years regarding HIV/AIDS and two means of avoiding transmission; increase in the use of condoms by young
                         people (aged 15 to24) during non-union sexual contact in the last 12 months; increase in the use of condoms by military personnel during sexualcontract over the last 12
                         months; prevalence of HIV in pregnant women aged 15 to 24; modern methods contraceptive prevalence ratein pregnant women (in urbanand in rural areas); percentage
                         of women aged 15 to 24 wishing to space births by at least two years;and percentage of women who donot want anymore children.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This update is on the basis of the January/ February 2012 supervision mission, as well as the just completed implementation support mission (May 21 - 29, 2012) on M&E aspects.
                         The project indicators are updated accordingly.

                         The Project was recently extended by one year to June 30th, 2013 based on a agreed revised Annual Action Plan and Budget for 2012 and 2013. The project is on track and is
                         making rapid progress on implementing, including on fiduciaries aspects. As of March 2012, approximately SDR 7.0 million (USD 10.5 million equivalent) has been disbursed,
                         representing 50 percent of the grant, after 18 months of implementation. It is expected that given the recent launching of the RBF activities as well as the full operationalization of all
                         the planned mobile teams, the disbursement rate will be much faster in FY12 and FY13 than in FY11 and that the grant will be fully disbursed before the new closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         On the whole there are no major issues with respect to project management, procurement and financial management. Project Implementation has remained at Satisfactory, indicating
                         that the Project continues to be implemented in an adequate manner despite a challenging country context. The Government has officially requested an extension of 12 months of the
                         June 30th, 2012 closing date to permit the consolidation of recent gains on the ground and allow for the effectiveness of the RBF component as well as the scaling-up of the local
                         integrated response to HIV/AIDS and other well-performing HIV prevention activities implemented under the additional financing project components. The proposed request has been
                         reviewed and granted by the bank. Project new closing date is now June 30th, 2013.
