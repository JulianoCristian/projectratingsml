"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Population and\n            AIDS Project for Chad were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory\n            and borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: while the Bank can be\n            instrumental in stimulating Government commitment for both\n            HIV/AIDS and population, commitment is perhaps more easily\n            sustained for HIV/AIDS than for population. The advantages\n            and disadvantages of building on previous projects need to\n            be carefully examined during project preparation. While the\n            introduction of the mobile health teams and the Result-based\n            Financing (RBF) contradicted this lesson, this was justified\n            by the fact that when the existing delivery of services is\n            so poor and the need for services so great, important risks\n            are warranted, even without adequate feasibility studies.\n            For the follow-on project, more 'due diligence' is\n            in progress to assess accurately the risks of the operation\n            with a view to build stronger government ownership. The\n            importance of efficiency as a criterion for assessing health\n            and social development projects must be seen in a broader\n            context. There is no substitute for timely baseline data and\n            an operational Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system."}, "docdt": "2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
