 The proposed Additional Financing for the Chad Second Population and HIV/AIDS project was formally negotiated
on December 11, 2007, and scheduled for presentation to the Board in February 2008. While the project package was
delivered to SECBO in December 2007, it was subsequently pulled from Board consideration due to conflict in Chad.

F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives
The development objective of the project will be to contribute to changing the behavior of the
Chadian populations so that they will adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk: (i) of infection
from HIV; and (ii) of too closely spaced and/or unwanted pregnancies

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised.

I. Disbursement Profile
1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country context. Chad ranked among Africa’s least developed countries in 2000. The
World Bank estimated per capita GDP at US$200, the UN Human Development Indicator ranked
Chad 167th out of 174 countries, and the Human Poverty Index (HPI) was 57 percent. Health and
nutrition indicators were precarious with life expectancy estimated at 47 years, the infant-child
mortality rate at 222 per 1,000 and the maternal mortality rate at 827 per 100,000 births. 5

2.      The 1999 CAS identified diverse sources for this extreme level of poverty: geographical
characteristics; political instability; inadequate economic policies; and rapid population growth.
These factors had sharply curtailed economic growth and left the country with little physical
infrastructure, poor provision of social services, and weak institutions.

3.      Population and HIV/AIDS. From 1990, Government policies and strategies recognized
the implications of population growth and HIV/AIDS for the country’s future economic and
social well-being:

4.      Population. Chad adopted a National Population Policy (NPP) in 1994. Subsequently, the
country began to: (i) develop IEC and sensitization (particularly among political, religious, and
trade union leaders); (ii) expand reproductive health (RH) services; and (iii) initiate a condom
social marketing program to reach specific target groups (e.g., men, teenagers, and single
women). These efforts were accompanied by the creation of the Association Tchadienne de
Bien-Etre Familial (ASTBEF), an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation
(IPPF).

5.     The implementation of the NPP was challenged by widespread attitudes opposing the
notion of promoting family size 6 as well as the influence of religious leaders taking a position
against the use of modern contraceptives. The 1996-97 demographic and health survey (DHS)
estimated the total fertility rate (TFR) at 6.6 live births, demographic growth at 3.3 percent,
modern contraceptive use at 4.1 percent in urban areas and 0.3 percent in rural areas.

6.     HIV/AIDS. After 1995, the HIV/AIDS epidemic evolved towards a generalized
epidemic: (i) prevalence among pregnant women rapidly increased from 2 percent in 1995 to 6
percent in 1999 in N'Djamena; and (ii) overall prevalence was estimated by UNAIDS to be 3
percent in 1999 and between 5-12 percent in subsequent years. As of early 2000, the cumulative
number of AIDS cases was 11,681 with about 200,000 sero-positive persons. There was also
concern about future infections, particularly in the south around the oil exploration sites. By
2000, HIV/AIDS was already having a significant impact on the health system in general and on


5
  WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA data at the time estimated the maternal mortality rate between 1,000 and 1,500 per
100,000 inhabitants, which was later confirmed by the 2004 DHS.
6
  Due in large measure to: (i) high levels of poverty inciting couples to have many children as a means of
supplementing family income and providing social security in their old age; (ii) high infant and child mortality
prompting women to compensate for the loss of children; and (iii) civil conflict. See World Bank, PACP1-PPAR, p.
2.
households in particular.

7.      Despite difficult circumstances (insufficient human resources, inadequate infrastructure,
etc.) and highly unfavorable conditions among communities, Chad made progress in the fight
against HIV/AIDS: (i) a strategic plan for 1999-2003 was adopted and accompanied by high
level appeals for action; (ii) voluntary testing and counseling was introduced in 1999 (but
essentially limited to N’Djamena); (iii) piloting of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission
(PMTCT) strategies and case management of Opportunistic Infections (OI) began; and (iv) blood
transfusion capabilities were strengthened.

projects, the first Population and AIDS Control Project (PACP1) and the Safe Motherhood
Project, the Bank was very active in the health sector in Chad in the late 1990’s. The 1999 CAS
identified the "Demographic Challenge" as a priority. In 2000, the Government urged IDA to
make the fight against HIV/AIDS a key development objective in the Bank's country assistance
strategy, and an addendum to the CAS identified the need to prevent the epidemic from spiraling
out of control as in neighboring countries. This addendum also indicated that a follow-on multi-
sectoral HIV/AIDS project was planned. Simultaneously, a Health Sector Support Project was
approved in April 2000.

9.      In support of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Highly Indebted Poor
Country (HIPC), the proposed project was considered a key operation since it addressed both
human development and socio-economic challenges. Furthermore, the Bank’s previous support
to Chad (through PACP1 and other operations), the positive effect of Bank assistance on
HIV/AIDS and population awareness, and the lack of sufficient resources (from Government and
other sources) put IDA in a unique strategic position to finance the scaling-up of activities and to
contribute to the mobilization of additional funding.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.     The development objective of the second Population and AIDS Control Project (PACP2)
was “to contribute to changing the behavior of the Chadian populations so that they will adopt
behaviors which will reduce the risk: (i) of infection from the HIV; and (ii) of too closely spaced
and/or unwanted pregnancies.” 7 This PDO complemented the companion Health Sector Support
Project’s PDO, which was “to support the extension of basic quality health services in Chad
through the implementation of a National Health Policy as defined by the Ministry of Public
Health (MOH) and a specific objective of addressing health-related HIV/AIDS activities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/ justification

11.      The PDO was not revised. During the mid-term review (December 2005), project
activities were reoriented without a change in the PDO or the key indicators. A formal
restructuring in 2010 for the additional financing (AF) modified the project’s components in


7
 The objectives of PACP1 were similar: to advance the onset of fertility decline by increasing the use of modern
methods of contraception, and slow the spread of HIV infection by promoting behavioral change.
order to: (i) introduce the new Results Based Financing (RBF) approach; and (ii) better reflect
the integrated and decentralized approach to maternal and child health and the fight against
HIV/AIDS. Project indicators were also modified to reflect the current international thinking in
HIV/AIDS, be in line with UNGASS indicators, integrate the lessons learned during
implementation, and define more precisely the expected outcomes of the original project.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries and Benefits

12.    The HIV/AIDS component of the project was intended to benefit: (i) women and youths
generally; (ii) key ministries (Health, Education, Social Affairs, Communication, etc.); (iii)
groups at increased risk of HIV infection including: commercial sex workers (CSWs), long-
distance drivers, members of the defense forces and others in uniform, prisoners and prison
guards; and (iv) workers in key sectors of the economy such as agriculture, power and energy,
and construction. The population component of the project was intended to benefit mothers and
children through birth spacing, the use of chemo-prophylaxis for sero-positive pregnant women,
and bednets.

13.     Project benefits included: (i) a reduced number of new HIV/AIDS cases and deaths; (ii)
better care for people living with HIV/AIDS; (iii) an improved community response to the
epidemic and particularly the ability of households and individuals to prevent or cope with
HIV/AIDS (particularly among orphans in urban areas); and (iv) changes attitudes towards
family size combined with increased accessibility to modern contraceptives and condoms.

1.5 Original Components

14.    Component 1: Strengthening the Capacities of the Key Ministries (US$6.57 million).
To strengthen the capacity of those ministries most likely to have an impact on the evolution of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the project focused on six ministries (Communication, Justice, National
Defense and Reinsertion, Interior, National Education, and Social Action and Family) to develop
and implement HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support strategies adapted to the local conditions.
The component was expected to improve capacity for program coordination, resource
management, and implementation at all levels by supporting: (i) the Ministry of Health (MOH)
to complement the support provided to HIV/AIDS prevention and care by the HSSP; and (ii)
HIV/AIDS units established in key ministries and their activities at central and regional levels.

15.      Component 2: Strengthening of the Social Fund (FOSAP) and its two-sub-
components (Grants and Micro-credits) (US$8.87 million). The component was expected to
continue and expand support for: (i) grants to local non-governmental organizations (NGO) for
HIV/AIDS prevention and population activities; (ii) micro-credits for income generating
activities for women and women's associations; and (iii) supervision of these groups by NGOs
with strong proven capacities. Under this component, HIV/AIDS activities were considered
either as essential are as secondary:
    • Essential activities targeting priority vulnerable groups included: (i) information,
         education, and communication (IEC) for behavior change in the areas of population,
         reproductive health (RH), and HIV/AIDS prevention and care; (ii) promotion and
         accessibility of voluntary HIV testing and counseling for the general population, for
         prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; and for at risk and/or vulnerable
       groups; (iii) psycho-medico-social support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
       as well as economic support for HIV/AIDS infected and affected persons and
       comprehensive support and care for HIV/AIDS orphans; (iv) interventions to increase the
       status and the autonomy of women (e.g., income generating activities); and (v) promotion
       and distribution of condoms and other modern contraceptive methods.
   •   Secondary activities comprised: (i) advocacy for HIV/AIDS and population
       interventions; (ii) development of national guidelines to implement essential activities;
       (iii) training and capacity building for local NGOs and Community-Based Organizations
       (CBO); and (iv) social mobilization of traditional leaders.

16.    Population activities were expected to focus on linkages between reproductive health
interventions and the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, specifically: (i) IEC and behavior
change messages; (ii) promotion and distribution of condoms to supplement the social marketing
channels (e.g., in health centers, within the communities, and to persons in uniform); and (iii)
adolescent needs to address early pregnancies and the transmission of HIV/AIDS among this
vulnerable population. Interventions pertaining to screening and treatment of sexually
transmitted infections (STI) were to be complemented by the IDA-financed HSSP.

17.      Component 3: Support to the Social Marketing Program (MASOCOT) (US$4.03
million). Established under the initial project (with support from the Bank and KfW),
MASOCOT developed a social marketing program for condoms (and for oral rehydration salts).
This component was expected to provide support to MASOCOT for: (i) its transition to an
autonomous NGO (AMASOT); (ii) the ongoing marketing of condoms and rehydration salts; and
(iii) the addition of new products (e.g., oral contraceptives, impregnated bed nets, etc.).

18.     Component 4: Support for the implementation of the National Population Policy
(NPP) (US$3.45 million). This component was expected to continue support to Government
entities dealing with population issues, in particular the Ministry of Economic Promotion and
Development and its Population Division. Project support to the Division of Population was
intended to: (i) strengthen its managerial capabilities, especially its strategic planning capabilities
and management of decentralized programs, in order to prioritize the population activities; (ii)
mainstream IEC and behavioral change communication (BCC) interventions using existing
structures such as local and regional radios stations, public and private written press, prefectoral
population commissions, etc.; and (iii) carry out, disseminate and promote results of operational
research in the area of population, in collaboration with other specialized organizations

19.     Component 5: Project management (US$1.64 million). To coordinate and manage the
project, the project was expected to finance new personnel, vehicles, training and consultant
services (in particular for the financial audits) for the Project Coordination Team (PCT). In
particular, a Population Specialist was to be recruited for 24 months to assist in the
implementation of the National Population Policy Component.

1.6 Revised Components

20.    While the project’s components were maintained throughout the original and AF, there
were two important changes. First, after the 2005 mid-term review (MTR), Component 2 was
substantially modified by: (i) introducing two mobile teams covering 40 sites in two regions in
order to improve access to quality health services promote RH interventions and family
planning; and (ii) revising the micro-credit approach (which was subsequently eliminated in
2007). Second, after the 2010 AF, the project’s components were modified by: (i) reducing the
number of assisted ministries under Component 1 to receive financing to only 3 key ministries,
namely Education, Health, and Defense/Security and increasing financing to MOH; (ii) replacing
the support for social marketing under Component 3 (funded by KfW and the Global Fund) with
activities addressing results-based financing (RBF); (iii) reorienting the activities of Components
2 and 4 to support mobile teams and the implementation of the decentralized and integrated
approach adopted in 2005 and tested during the period 2007-09; and (iv) expanding Component
5 to strengthen monitoring and evaluation (M&E) efforts as well as medical waste management.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.    A series of amendments to the financing agreement were approved in order to restructure,
provide AF, reallocate funds and extend the project closing date.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     Soundness of the background analysis. Four major sources of information informed the
preparation of the project and provided a sound basis for project preparation: (i) the sectoral
analyses carried out in the context of the preparation the HSSP emphasized the poor quality of
health human resources and the inability of basic health services to improve maternal and child
health services; (ii) the HIV/AIDS strategic plan 1999-2003 (amended in 2001 to provide for
access to ARVs and to delegate specific operational tasks to selected regional decentralize)
provided the socio-economic context and institutional structure for the national response as well
as proposed priority actions in some eighteen different areas (including behavior change, VCT,
PMTCT, blood safety, etc.); (iii) the assessment of progress achieved in implementing the 1994
NPP, particularly in view of the results of the 1996-97 DHS which confirmed the country’s
accelerating demographic growth; and (iv) the experience of the first project 8, which highlighted
the country’s decision to use a multi-sectoral and civil society response, focus on HIV/AIDS
prevention and population (using a social fund to finance NGOs and community level activities)
and innovative condom social marketing program and micro-credit sub-components for women
and women's association.

23.     In addition, a PHRD grant was approved in March 2001 to prepare viable work plans for
key ministries involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities and assess the contribution
of on-going micro-credit activities and modalities for strengthening and decentralizing the grant
sub-component of the social fund (FOSAP). Support was also provided to establish sound
monitoring and evaluation systems and management mechanisms.

24.      Government’s commitment. Commitment to reverse the spread of the epidemic was
reflected by the Government’s early decision to finance PACP1 and by urging IDA to make
HIV/AIDS a key development objective in the Bank's CAS of May 2000. Government

8
    The lessons learned in the ICR for PACP1 were only available in June 2002 after the approval of the project.
commitment was further reinforced by: (i) its recognition of the linkages between HIV/AIDS and
health services development; (ii) its development of a comprehensive National Strategic
Framework for HIV/AIDS activities (1999-2003); and (iii) its intention to use anticipated oil
revenues as the means for reducing poverty and improving the living conditions of the Chadian
population. This commitment was explicitly presented in the June 2001 Letter of Sector Policy.
Government commitment to address demographic growth through the implementation of the
NPP was less clear as reflected in its lack of support for the high level body it created and action
on the priority action investment plan (PAIP) that was to translate the NPP into more concrete
interventions.

25.       Assessment of project design. Given the establishment under PACP1 of the key
institutions and the widespread awareness of HIV/AIDS and its means of transmission, PACP2
was designed in accordance with the Bank's regional HIV/AIDS strategy9 as a second generation
HIV/AIDS project and was expected to intensify action to motivate Chadians to change their
behavior. As with PACP1, PACP2 comprised three "MAP-like" components (sectoral responses,
community interventions, and social marketing) but did not include the full range of health-
related activities as they were included in the ongoing HSSP. The project was not financed by
the MAP because of the population component, which was especially requested by the Chadian
Government in view of the high fertility rate and the appropriateness of building on the results of
the first project. The project also included a management component to support the PCT’s role of
coordinating the various partners and acting as the relay between the Government of Chad and
the Bank.

26.      In most respects, the project design was very thorough: (i) institutional arrangements
were clearly established for all the components, except for the population component; (ii) project
implementation arrangements were defined in manuals and based on previous experience; (iii)
the PCT’s management responsibilities were made explicit and their capabilities strengthened;
and (iv) a two-year procurement plan was prepared to ensure project readiness. However, there
were some weaknesses: (i) lack of baseline data; (ii) very ambitious targets for project indicators;
and (iii) optimistic assessment of the Government’s commitment to the project, particularly with
respect to the population component. Also, some ministries and many districts had insufficient
experience with multi-sectoral initiatives and limited experience in HIV/AIDS control at the start
of the project.

27.      Risk assessment and mitigation. The overall risk rating was Moderate, but the
assessment did not identify certain key risk factors: (i) potential political and financial risks
(counterpart funding); (ii) institutional concerns with respect to the population component; and
(iii) monitoring and evaluation concerns. The proposed risk mitigation measures were somewhat
generic.

28.         Quality at Entry. No Quality at Entry Assessment was carried out.

2.2 Implementation

29.         Because of concerns about a potential gap in funding between PACP1 and PACP2,


9
    Intensifying Action against HIV/AIDS in Africa: Responding to a Development Crisis.
PACP2 was approved quickly, but with three conditions of effectiveness. 10 The time needed to
meet these conditions delayed project effectiveness until April 2002. Disbursements were
somewhat slower than planned over the first couple of years due to protracted procurement
processes. The resulting disbursement lag was mostly eliminated by 2004, though inadequate
counterpart financing (from effectiveness through mid-2005) posed significant problems for
paying suppliers.

30.     Despite these difficulties, reasonable progress was achieved during the 2002-2003
period: (i) the capacity of key ministries was strengthened; (ii) testing was expanded; and (iii)
FOSAP had adopted appropriate procedures, recruited CBOs, and begun approving sub-projects
and micro-credits for implementation. By the end of 2004, 701 sub-projects had been approved
(instead of the 83 envisioned) accounting for 56 percent of the total project budget; the Social
Marketing Program (AMASOT) increased sales for condoms (supported as well by KfW), oral
rehydration salts, and mosquito nets and was considering new products (e.g., oral
contraceptives); and the Population Division became the Population Directorate, produced
several key analyses (analysis of the implementation of the National Population Policy,
population projections for Chad through 2050, etc.), and provided support to the 18 Regional
Population Commissions.

31.      Beginning in late 2003 and continuing through 2005, problems became apparent: (i) the
Central Pharmaceutical Procurement Agency (CPPA) was unable to supply sufficient quantities
of STI treatment kits and reagents for HIV/AIDS thus affecting the quality of STI/HIV/AIDS
treatment 11; (ii) the lack of coordination between the National AIDS Council and the National
HIV/AIDS Program; (iii) the Global Fund’s selection of FOSAP as the Country Coordination
Mechanism (CCM) raised the risk of overburdening the institution with additional
responsibilities 12; and (iv) the remaining project components (involving condom sales, micro-
credits, and population) were not performing adequately (with condom sales declining,
reimbursement problems with the micro-credits, and insufficient progress on the population
component’s activities). The Bank succeeded in resolving some of these issues by: (i) promoting
institutional changes and a refinancing of the CPPA by the Government; (ii) financing a
technical audit of the institutions involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (iii) working with
FOSAP and the Global Fund to define FOSAP’s responsibilities with respect to PACP2 and the
Global Fund. Recommendations for strengthening condom distribution, micro-credit
reimbursements, and population activities were not followed.

32.    By the MTR, with the exception of the public sector support component, substantial
changes were needed for the other components since (i) there were weaknesses in FOSAP’s


10
    Conditions of effectiveness: (i) adoption of three implementation manuals (for the project as a whole and for the
FOSAP grant and micro-credit procedures); (ii) recruitment of an acceptable PCT and FOSAP management unit;
(iii) establishment of a project steering committee; and (iv) adoption of an action plan for implementing the
population policy.



11
     The project did not finance ARV, but CPPA was responsible for managing them.
12
     This became a significant issue in 2006 and was resolved by separating management of the two activities.
community grants related to the selection and administration of the sub-projects, performance of
the NGOs providing TA to the CBOs and lack of information on sub-project quality and impact
on their intended populations; (ii) the micro-credits faced significant problems with the
reimbursement rates 13; and (iii) AMASOT experienced cash flow problems with the project and
its suppliers and therefore was asked to focus on contraceptives and mosquito nets (and
particularly promotional campaigns), solve its supply problems (with the assistance of its partner
KFW), and improve collaboration with the priority ministries and FOSAP. In addition, the 2004
Demographic and Health Survey showed little impact in terms of fertility rate and there was
limited progress on policy issues (e.g., continued blockage of the Family Code, High Population
Commission’s failure to adopt the revised NPP). To strengthen the link between IEC activities
and RH/family planning services, the establishment of mobile health teams was proposed on a
pilot basis in two regions where contraceptive prevalence was among the lowest in the country
under the population component.

33.      The studies prepared for the MTR, the decisions reached at the MTR (in December
2005), and the suspension of the Bank’s portfolio during the first half of 2006 provided the basis
for three significant changes in the project over the final years of implementation: (i) decreasing
support for AMASOT as a result of some CFAF20 million of ineligible expenditures; (ii)
suspension of new micro-credit grants; (iii) increased emphasis on quality and results on the
ground, especially behavior and practice rather than knowledge and attitudes; and (iv)
reorientation of the population component’s funds to establish mobile teams in two regions of the
country. 14

34.      During the 2006-10 period, project implementation suffered from a series of stops and
starts due to: (i) contentious oil negotiations with the Bank which resulted in the project
suspension from January to June 2006; (ii) a national general strike from February to August
2007 which slowed down the implementation of project activities; (iii) rebel conflict which
reached the capital in 2008 leading to another project suspension from February to July 2008;
and (iv) delayed approval of the AF. Results during the short 2007-08 period showed the
potential for the decentralized local response to accelerate counseling and testing activities 15 and
to increase the use of modern contraceptive methods in the project areas. The project closed end
of July 2008 (despite a request from the Government for an extension of its closing date) given
the nature of the dialogue between the Bank and the Government at the time and that it was
almost fully disbursed. The Government provided the necessary financing to continue to support
the most critical project activities, at a reduced scale, while waiting for approval of the AF.

35.       In March 2010, based on exceptional country circumstances and in accordance with


13
   Only 45 percent of the outstanding amounts had been collected by the oversight agencies, and legal assistance
had been recruited to reduce the amounts (which totaled more than US$ 600,000).
14
   The proposed pilot experience was based on the successful experience of Tunisia (and to a more limited extent
Niger). Mobile teams were expected to focus on prevention and treatment of STIs, a complementary package of
services for PLWHAs, and population activities, including contraceptive prevalence. It was expected that the lessons
learned could be used to scale up the experience at a later date.
15
   For instance, between 2006 and 2007, the number of people tested for HIV in the project area increased by 38%
and the proportion of those testing positive was greater than 20%. The increases in testing as well as the high rate of
HIV positive cases among those tested demonstrated both a large unmet demand and the relevance of this targeted
strategy.
paragraph 5 of BP13.20, the Operational Policy and Country Services (OPCS) authorized the
processing of an AF for the project. The AF’s objectives remained consistent with the original
project with two modifications: (i) the introduction of a results-based financing approach; and
(ii) the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to prepare a sound evidentiary basis
for a new project.

36.       Components and activities for the AF were simplified: (i) only the three best performing
ministries continued to implement activities at central and local levels (Component 1); (ii)
FOSAP oversaw the decentralized local response using mobile teams (Components 2 and 4); and
(iii) a consortium of local and international expertise was recruited to implement the RBF pilot.
Project management and M&E (Component 5) were continued by the PCT in place throughout
project implementation. With a reduced volume of activities and an experienced set of
implementers, implementation was smooth over the period 2010-13.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.     M&E design. The M&E design was based on: (i) physical and financial monitoring in
accordance with the requirement for quarterly financial and management reporting (FMR); (ii)
project monitoring based on the agreed-upon M&E plan; and (iii) surveys and studies, including
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), sentinel sites, and specific surveys (on knowledge,
attitudes, beliefs and practices, etc.). More specifically, the M&E design proposed physical and
financial indicators to be monitored on a bi-annual basis for the first 18 months of the project and
on a quarterly basis thereafter, in agreement with the FMR requirements; defined key indicators
to be monitored on a yearly basis; and relied on a DHS to be conducted 2002 (with support from
HSSP) to provide demographic, RH and child, and HIV/AIDS baseline data.

38.    In addition, the M&E design included the following measures to ensure the effective, and
evidence-based supervision of the project: (i) adoption of a M&E plan; (ii) selection of indicators
on the quality, effectiveness and impact of sub-project grants and micro credits included in the
procedures manuals; and a MTR preceded by evaluation of project activities, a beneficiary
assessment, and an HIV sero-prevalence survey. 16 Finally, an M&E specialist was recruited to
provide M&E assistance the ministries and of the Population Division.

39.     At the time of the AF, the overall M&E approach was maintained but more resources
were included to strengthen the M&E subcomponent, in particular at the regional levels. In
addition: (i) the key performance indicators (KPI) and component output indicators were
modified in accordance with the HIV/AIDS Results Scorecard 17; and (ii) non-DHS baseline and
final evaluations were organized with sample surveys in the project areas and complemented by
the collection and analysis of secondary information.

40.     Implementation. Each of the planned M&E measures for the initial credit encountered
difficulties. First, while the FMR generally provided timely and accurate information, they


16
  The PAD noted that support for sentinel surveillance and the DHS had been included in the HSSP.
17
  An assessment of the original indicators identified excluded those which were regarded as too difficult to measure,
unrealistic or more strictly related to activities funded by the Health Sector Support Project rather than by the
PACP2 (e.g. the incidence of STI within the general population, the incidence of HIV/AIDS among truck drivers).
tended to emphasize the financial aspects more than the physical aspects of monitoring and thus
did not sufficiently link expenditures to outputs, thereby diminishing discussion of potential
efficiencies overall and from region to region. The internal audit function was established and
reports were regularly available, but like the FMR emphasized financial and accounting issues.
The transfer to the PCT (and strengthening) of the internal audit function resolved a number of
these weaknesses.

41.     Second, project monitoring was based on the definition of twenty-four indicators and
external consultants were recruited to prepare semi-annual M&E reports based on these
indicators. 18 These reports were systematically prepared but provided mostly process
information and did not adequately address the issue of the quality of the interventions. At the
MTR, substantial changes were proposed, but these were not followed up with a formal
amendment to the Financing Agreement. Ultimately, each component developed its own data
collection tools, but delays in the receipt of the data hindered their use for real time adaptation of
program activities.

42.     Ratings of project monitoring were generally satisfactory or moderately satisfactory,
except for the period from December 2005 to December 2007, when they varied sharply due
both to the suspension and to the Bank’s dissatisfaction with the collection and reporting of data
on the local integrated response. Subsequently, the M&E specialist was replaced and new
reporting forms and guidelines developed and linked to continuation of funding for the entities
supported by the project. Ratings over the period of the AF were uniformly moderately
satisfactory.

43.     Third, the DHS was not conducted until 2004 (and not released until September 2005)
which deprived the project of much of the baseline data it had anticipated. 19 Sentinel data was
collected, periodic UNGASS reports were prepared, and an evaluation of the status of the
national strategic framework was carried out. No follow up DHS was organized though a Multi
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was conducted in 2010.

44.    For the AF, an initial survey (October 2012) served as the baseline data, and a follow-up
evaluation was conducted (May 2013) using the same methodology. While the two surveys
might have provided some comparisons (albeit over a short period of time), the ICR team was
unable to independently verify the results of the follow up survey.

45.    Utilization. Although the PAD adequately described the project’s institutional
arrangements for M&E, it did not sufficiently detail the prospective use of M&E results for
decision-making and program management. The issue of utilization arose after the 2006
suspension, when it was noted that, while the components received reports, the implementing
agencies at national and regional levels were not included. Afterwards, the PCT and FOSAP


18
   Early supervision reports noted that baseline data was not available or relied on estimations from unpublished
sources, and it was agreed that the necessary studies would be carried out and all data would be based on published
sources.
19
   Both the ICR (2002) and the PPAR (2005) for the first project emphasized the extent to which the absence of
baseline data for key indicators undermines opportunities to track and fine-tune the performance and impact of the
project.
were expected to systematically provide official presentations to all of the partners and
implementing agencies at national and regional levels. By the 2009 appraisal for the AF,
quarterly meetings were being held in all regions and the different implementers were required to
present a report of the last quarter and an action plan for the next quarter. Subsequently, under
the AF, the information available was adequate and there are indications that the use of the
information by the regional and national structures progressively improved and that joint annual
reviews were carried out.

46.     M&E is rated Modest for the initial credit, due primarily to: (i) the lack of baseline and
follow-up information; (ii) the overly ambitious and poorly measurable indicators; and (iii) the
insufficient use of the M&E data for management purposes. M&E is rated Substantial for the
AF, since adequate information was regularly available to assess the financial situation and the
technical implementation (particularly for the mobile teams and RBF pilots). In addition,
separate evaluations of the mobile teams and the RBF were conducted. Finally, Bank supervision
missions systematically charted project responses to past recommendations with indications of
how information was used to improve project performance.

47.    Because the ICR mission was unable to independently verify the data from baseline and
follow-up evaluations, this information was not used in the ICR but is reported in the Borrower’s
ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.      Environment. The project was originally given a “C” rating since it was not expected to
generate any adverse environmental effects and could even have some positive environmental
effects through the population component’s potential long term impact on fertility reduction and
a decline in the population growth rate. 20 In 2004, the rating was retroactively changed in the
system to a B (along with all HIV/AIDS projects). Safeguard compliance was not rated
throughout the initial project. The “B” rating was maintained for the AF due to the risks
associated with the handling and disposal of medical waste, and a Medical Waste Management
Plan (MWMP) was prepared in August 2007.

49.      Because the Borrower's experience and ability to implement safeguards were limited,
capacity building on safeguards, particularly medical waste management, was built into the AF.
In addition, critical materials and equipment for medical waste management as well as
safeguards supervision was included to address weaknesses and enhance the implementation and
systematic monitoring of the MWMP by the MOH. Safeguards compliance was rated
Satisfactory throughout the AF.

50.      In July 2012, an assessment and update of the MWMP was conducted. Among the issues
identified were: (i) insufficient political support and legislative gaps; (ii) inadequate organization
of plan implementation including a lack of material support and appropriate behavior among


20
  Three risks were cited: (i) the inappropriate or poor disposal of condoms which would be mitigated by
information provided at the time of sale; (ii) disposal of chemicals for re-impregnating mosquito nets which would
be mitigated by ensuring a life span of 5-8 years; and (iii) the effects of the sub-projects, for which the project
implementation would include guidelines for taking environmental considerations into account.
health personnel; and (iii) very limited financial resources from the Government and virtually no
collaboration with the private sector. The updated MWMP proposed a comprehensive strategy,
an estimated budget, institutional responsibilities, and monitoring measures.

51.     In addition, an environmental audit of the project was conducted (October 2012) by the
Direction for Environmental Evaluations of the Ministry of the Environment and Water
Resources for each of the ten health facilities supported by the project. The audit found that
waste management capabilities remained limited and cited in particular a lack of documentation
to guide the disposal of bio-medical waste and insufficient and inadequately trained staff. A
remedial plan and budget was proposed along with formats for monitoring waste management.
Key recommendations had been implemented through national budget and donor funding,
including IDA.

52.     Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management.

53.     Procurement. Early missions noted the difficult overall country procurement context, the
time-consuming national procedures, and the persistent delays which had reduced disbursement.
Though generally satisfied with the PCT’s capacity, the June 2003 audit recommended recruiting
a procurement specialist, which was done in February 2004. Post reviews of contracts under the
review ceiling were carried out on several occasions, and no major irregularities were found.

54.      The lengthy procurement delays continued to be a problem throughout the project,
particularly with respect to the approval, signature, and obtaining of the required visas. In
addition, during the initial project there were minor problems linked to procedures for local
shopping and NCB) and an issue with respect to AMASOT’s conformity with IDA procedures.
During the AF period, the principal recommendations concerned: (i) keeping the procurement
plan current; (ii) publishing the announcements and results of procurements in a timely manner;
and (iii) improving the organization and archiving of procurement documents. Subsequent
missions continued to emphasize these problems as well as that of contract management.

55.      Financial management. Financial management (FM) was complicated by the number and
relative independence of the implementing agencies. The computerized accounting and reporting
system was determined to be adequate and though shortcomings in FM were identified, they did
not prevent the timely and reliable provision of information required to manage and monitor the
implementation of the project. After initial delays, the FMRs were submitted on time and were
deemed to be of acceptable quality. Annual project audits and bi-annual FOSAP audits indicated
that project management was acceptable; supervision missions noted that recurrent costs, in
particular those linked to vehicles were particularly high and attributed these high recurrent costs
to requests from Government officials for vehicles, fuel, and spare parts. Consequently, it was
agreed to put in place, as in the Health Project, a system to monitor expenses by vehicle.

56.     There were, however, repeated lapses in FM: (i) in 2003, the project audit was qualified
because some of the assets of the first project were not accounted for in the inventory of the
second project; (ii) in 2004, both AMASOT and the PCT incurred certain ineligible expenditures
(which were subsequently reimbursed); (iii) in 2006, the audit report was qualified and the
external auditors raised issues related to ineligible expenditures and internal controls which
required an action plan (along with refunding the ineligible expenditures and inactive special
accounts; (iv) in 2005, 2007, and 2008, the auditors refused to certify the financial situation (due
in part to the destruction of financial records); (v) in 2009, there were ineligible expenditures
(related to funding the project coordination staff after project closing were identified and
subsequently refunded); and (vi) in 2011 and 2012, the audits were qualified.

57.      A recurrent problem throughout implementation of the project was the delay in
providing counterpart financing in a timely fashion, which strained FM and probably contributed
to some of the lapses noted above. Successive Bank missions (from 2006 to 2010) followed the
counterpart financing issue closely and identified CFAF160 million outstanding as of January
2010. 21 As the AF was 100 percent IDA grant funded, there were no counterpart financing issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

58.      All the National Strategic Frameworks clearly define the institutional arrangements
between the Permanent Secretariat to the Offices of the President and the Prime Minister as well
as between the implementing structures and the external partners; these steps should ensure an
adequate institutional framework after project closing. In addition, the Government adopted Law
19/PR/2007 (2007) to protect people living with HIV/AIDS. While the analysis of the evolving
epidemiological situation could have focused more on the concentrated nature of the epidemic,
the strategies and operational directives for implementing the National Strategic Frameworks
were prepared in a participatory manner and adopted by consensus. With further examination,
these guidelines (e.g., protocols and standards around screening, PMTCT, management of HIV
and STIs, etc.) should serve as the basis for the future planning and implementation of the
different interventions.

59.      The project contributed to the capacities of its key implementing agencies, and c ertain
sectoral ministries (MOH and the Ministry of Defense) and FOSAP made significant progress
and can be expected to continue their work. The other participating institutions (the other
sectoral ministries, the Population Divisions/Directorates, and AMASOT) made slower
progressand, though they may continue to carry out their mandates, the quality of their work may
suffer.

60.      Future planning and implementation of population interventions raises somewhat
different issues. The project made reasonable progress in conducting analytical work but an
effective program of priority population-related activities was not developed. Though the AF
significantly reoriented the interventions to address RH and FP, the broader population policy
issues remain to be addressed.

61.     The post-completion phase must confront two key issues. First, inadequate human
resources remain an issue and constrain both the provision of services and the management of
the implementation of the NPP and the National Strategic Framework. Second, insufficient
financing of the national response remains a key constraint, especially given the budgeted needs
expressed in the National Strategic Framework. In the immediate term, for the period July-
December 2013, the Government allocated CFAF1.324 billion to continue the integrated local
response and the RBF in their current zonesbut as of December 1st, no funds had been disbursed.

21
     A subsequent supervision mission noted that Chad had deposited its outstanding counterpart obligations.
Similarly, none of the three non-health ministries hadreceived a budget line item for combating
HIV/AIDS.

62.     In the longer term, the problem is more acute. The Global Fund proposal for Round 10
estimates the funding gap for 2014 at 74 percent of need and it is expected to rise again in 2015.
The approval of new Bank financing (of US$15 million to finance the scale up of the
RBF/Mobile team pilots) will reduce the gap by about 25 percent of need. 22


3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

63.     The overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial for both the initial credit and the
AF. While the objectives were (and remain) highly relevant to the existing political orientations
and technical considerations, the relevance of the project design was relatively modest early and
has become more substantial over time.

64.      Relevance of the project objectives. The relevance of the project's development
objectives, components, and specific activities is rated Substantial for both the original credit
and the AF. The project’s objectives: (i) support the country’s international (e.g., the Millennium
Development Goals, the declarations of Abuja and Brazzaville, universal access, etc.) and
regional (Lake Chad Basin initiative) obligations; (ii) are consistent with the country’s overall
socio-economic development objectives; and (iii) contribute to the prevention and mitigation of
the effects of HIV/AIDS and the consequences of rapid the demographic growth.

65.      In April 2008, Chad moved to a second generation national poverty reduction strategy
(PRSP 2), prioritizing five axes, including human resource development and protection of
vulnerable populations. Throughout implementation, the project was consistent with the Bank’s
country assistance strategies and objectives of achieving a sustainable reduction in poverty and
building capacity for delivering basic social services. The 2010-2012 Bank Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) confirmed the Bank’s continued engagement in the social sectors and their direct impact
on population and poverty. The project’s objectives continue to reflect the Population Policy
(adopted in 1994 and most recently revised in 2007), the National Strategic Frameworks to fight
HIV/AIDS (and most recently the National AIDS Strategy for 2012-15), and specific strategies
(e.g., the national roadmap for reducing maternal mortality), which have guided the national
response.

66.    Relevance of the project design and implementation. The relevance of the project design
and implementation is rated Modest for the original credit and Substantial for the AF. Though


22
  The Global Fund proposal for Round 8 (2008) estimated funding needs from 2008-13 at approximately US$57.49
million annually of which domestic resources were estimated at US$ 1.96 million (or 3.4 percent). The Government
included ARV, reagents, and drugs to combat opportunistic infections on the list of essential medicines, and about
50 percent of the Government’s contribution was allocated to a budget line for purchasing of medicines and
reagents. Other external sources (excluding the Bank, which was not operational at the time the estimates were
made) accounted for some US$1.58 million annually and the Global Fund for US$ 3.61 million annually.
the project’s original PDO remained constant throughout implementation, its components
evolved significantly to correct weaknesses which became apparent to respond to past
implementation experience and current program priorities.

67.     The original design did not adequately address four issues: (i) inadequate information to
determine the impact of the project, particularly on at-risk groups; (ii) weak links between
PACP2 and the companion IDA-financed health sector support project; (iii) insufficient
coordination of HIV/AIDS financing and activities through the National AIDS Commission
(NAC); and (iv) ineffective decentralization of HIV activities through the priority ministries and
NGOs to address drivers of the epidemic and particularly vulnerable groups.

68.      The AF significantly modified the original and emphasized implementation based on the
strengths of the previous design by: (i) allocating funding only to the four successful public
sector ministries (Component 1); (ii) reallocating resources away from the ineffective social
marketing intervention (Component 3); and (iii) merging FOSAP’s community-based initiatives
(Component 2) and population activities (Component 4) to focus on the integrated decentralized
approach and RBF. While implementation of the integrated approach using mobile health teams
benefited from experience since 2007, the RBF design was developed as a pilot and did not fully
benefit from a feasibility analysis. The overall assessment of risk as High was accurate, but the
project proposed no risk mitigation measures.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

69.      The project’s efficacy rating is based on: (i) the project's results as summarized in
Section F of the Data Sheet; (ii) the quantitative results by year for the OI, IOI, and outputs in
Annex 2; and (iii) the project's weighted results as a proportion of actual disbursements at the
time of the AF and at closing. The following table provides an overview of the results for the
numbered outcome and intermediate outcome targets in the data sheet and shows that 57 percent
of the project’s targets were fully achieved:

    NB. The numbers in the outcome and intermediate outcome columns correspond to the numbered targets in
    the data sheet. The table shows, for example, that 57% of the targets were fully achieved.


70.       PDO 1: Adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk of infection from HIV. Of the
six outcome indicators for PDO 1, one was fully achieved, two were partially achieved, three
were not achieved, and three were measured but the data was not verifiable. During both the
initial credit and the AF, awareness/knowledge of HIV/AIDS was partially achieved:
     • OI 1: Based on a comparison of DHS results for the awareness of HIV/AIDS, men’s
        awareness increased from 88 percent (1997) to 90 percent (2005) (or 95 percent of the
        target); women’s awareness increased from 60 percent (1997) to 80 percent (2005) (or
        89 percent of the target. The MICS (2010) found that women’s awareness of HIV/AIDS
        was 64 percent.

71.     During the initial credit, there were significant increases in condom use by persons aged
15-24 and by military personnel, though the ambitious targets resulted in mixed results:
    • OI 3: There was a significant increase (from 15 percent to 67.6 percent) in the use of
        condoms by military personnel, and the target was achieved at 90 percent.
    • OI 2: Significant progress was made in the use of condoms by persons aged 15-24: from
        8.1 percent to 25.4 percent for men and from 5.8 percent to 17.2 percent for women.
        However, the targets were not achieved either for men (51 percent of the target was
        achieved) or for women (34 percent of the target was achieved).

72.     HIV prevalence during the initial credit decreased considerably, but was not measured
during the AF:
    • OI 4: Based on sentinel site data, HIV prevalence among pregnant women aged 15-24
        was reduced by more than 25 percent (in fact, by more than 55 percent from 7.0 percent
        to 3.9 percent).

73.     Components 1 and 2 of the initial credit and of the AF contributed to these results.

74.    Component 1: Strengthening the Capacities of the Key Ministries. The initial credit
comprised three intermediate outcome indicators, of which one was achieved:
    • IOI 1: Of the six units of the National AIDS/STD Control Program expected to be
      functional by the end of 2002, none were; by 2006, two of six were considered
      functional.
    • IOI 2: Of the six selected key-ministries expected to develop annually an action plan
      including the prevention and care priority activities, all six did so.
    • IOI 3: Of the 14 Regional Health Councils (18 after 2006) expected to develop an action
      plan including the prevention and care priority activities, none did so.

75.      In addition, the project achieved the output target of assuring voluntary counseling and
testing (VCT) services are available in 25 percent of the 54 existing health districts by the end of
2003 (41 percent of districts had VCT services), and 75 percent by the end of the project (96
percent of districts had VCT services by the end of the project).

76.     Component 1 (AF): Strengthening the Capacities of the Key Ministries. The AF
focused on counseling and testing with positive results:
    • IOI 7: The average number of persons counseled and tested over the period 2010-12 was
       136,891 (or 155 percent of the target);
    • IOI 8: The number of military personnel tested increased from 2,414 in 2010 to 7,915 in
       2012 (or 124 percent of the target);
    • IOI 9: The average number of pregnant women tested for HIV during prenatal
       consultations over the period 2010-12 was 27,671 (or 99 percent of the target). The result
       is almost double (172 percent) the baseline which is the average number of women tested
       over the period 2007-09.
77.      Component 2 (Initial credit): Strengthening of the Social Fund (FOSAP) and its
two-sub-components (Grants and Micro-credits). During the initial credit, the PAD did not
establish any intermediate outcome indicators for this component; there were, however, three
important outputs:
    • The project far surpassed the target of 170 community-based sub-projects, approving
        more than 1500 between 2003 and 2007.
    • Data on the number and amounts of the sub-projects by target group suggest that youths
        were the principal beneficiary group.
    • Overall, micro-credit sub-projects reached almost half (47 percent) of the departments by
        the end of the first phase.

78.     Component 2 (AF): Strengthening of the Social Fund (FOSAP). FOSAP made
reasonable progress on condom distribution and significant progress in two other areas during
the AF phase:
    • IOI 10: In 2012, 4.5 million condoms were distributed (or 89 percent of the target), but the
       average number of condoms distributed annually over the period 2010-12 improved from 3.4
       million (2010) to 4.1 million (2011) to 4.5 million (2012).
   •   IOI 11: The households of 9,102 orphaned and vulnerable children (aged 0-17) received free
       basic external support in caring for the child. This constitutes 103 percent of the target.
   •   IOI 12: Some 410,538 women of child-bearing age were reached by interventions
       provided by community-based organizations.

79.     PDO 2: Adopt behaviors which will reduce the risk of too closely spaced and/or
unwanted pregnancies. During the initial credit, the target for women using modern
contraceptive methods was not achieved:
    • OI 5: While some progress on the use of modern contraceptives was made in urban areas
       (71 percent of the target was achieved), there was virtually no change in rural areas (13
       percent of the target was achieved).

80.     During the initial credit, the project aimed to increase the proportion of women aged 15-
49 in union who wish to space their next birth by at least two years. This target was not achieved.

81.      OI 6: Based on project data, the target remained unchanged: from 39 percent in 2000 to
38 percent in 2004. The indicator was dropped for the AF. Components 1 and 2 of the initial
credit contributed to these results;

82.      Components 3 and 4 of the initial credit contributed to these results as shown below;
components 3 and 4 of the AF contributed more broadly to reproductive and child health, which
are determinants of pregnancy.

83.       Component 3 (Initial credit): Support to the Social Marketing Program. During the
initial credit, AMASOT did not achieved its targets under this component:
     • IOI 4: The social marketing program for oral contraceptives was not established.
     • IOI 5: The social marketing program for impregnated bed nets in the five southern
          prefectures where malaria is very prevalent was established in 2005 (rather than at the
          beginning of 2002) and more than 90 percent of the nets were sold in N’Djamena.
84.     Among the outputs, the targets for condoms and oral rehydration salts were not achieved.
At the end of the initial credit, the component and its targets were dropped.

85.    Component 4 (Initial credit): Support to the implementation of the Declaration of
Population Policy. The single intermediate outcome target was achieved:
    • IOI 6: the 14 Regional Population Commissions were established and later increased to
      18 after the administrative organization of the country.

86.      All of the planned outputs were achieved: Workshops for religious leaders and
traditional leaders were organized, as were the IEC activities. There was no assessment of the
results of this component, and the component and its targets were dropped for the second phase.

87.   Component 3 (AF): Implementation of RBF. The results of the implementation of the
RBF approach are presented in the table below:

               Table 2: Cumulative, declared results of the results-based financing approach (RBF)

88.      An evaluation of the RBF pilot identified several weaknesses: (i) the underfunding of the
RBF budget (at approximately US$1.5 per capita); (ii) the contents and remuneration of the
minimum (health center) and complementary (hospital) packages of services; (iii) the inability to
manage drugs independently of Central Medical Stores and personnel independently of MOH;
and (iv) the unfamiliarity with planning and with data collection and analysis. Despite these
difficulties, available data show substantial progress on both the quantity and quality of services
offered in the facilities as shown below:

89.     All of the key services demonstrate significantly increased utilization: (i) child
immunization (measles and Pentavalent 3) more than doubled; (ii) both first and third pre-natal
consultation have increased, the latter more than doubled; (iii) assisted delivery quadrupled; and
(iv) family planning increased six-fold.

90.     By comparing services delivered with prescribed, protocols, the evaluation determined
that quality has also improved in RBF health centers and hospitals; in both cases, rapid early
increases were followed by consistent measures of 63-66 percent. 23 The RBF pilot also
contributed to other aspects of quality, both physical (infrastructure and equipment) and non-
physical (improvement in the quality of the information collected by the RBF facilities.
Unfortunately, the poor quality of the data in the non-RBF zones precluded a comparison of RBF
zones with non-RBF zones.

91.     Component 4 (AF): Support for implementation of the decentralized and
integrated approach. As shown below, the project’s targets were met and, in most instances,
exceeded:

92.      The contribution of the mobile teams varied considerably from district to district and
particularly from service to service. However, two of the essential services delivered through the
mobile health teams were VTC for pregnant women and post natal consultations. The mobile
teams did not perform assisted delivery. Formal baseline data for before/after comparisons are
not available, but the project collected data to evaluate zones with/without the mobile health
teams; these data show important gains in service delivery in districts with mobile teams, ranging
from 50 percent to several hundred percent depending on the service provided.

93.     Overall achievement result. Based on ICR guidelines, the project's initial and revised
indicators, and disbursement during the initial credit and the AF, project efficacy is rated Modest
for the original grant, Substantial for the AF (due largely to the results on the Intermediate
Outcomes), and Modest overall.

3.3 Efficiency

94.      Technical efficiency. Annex 4 of the PAD 24 relied on the general finding that both high
HIV prevalence and high fertility had been shown to negatively affect the economic wellbeing at
the household level and for the country as a whole but that there were synergies in addressing the
two issues together. 25 Annex 4 recommended a specific set of Population and HIV/AIDS
interventions. For Population, it proposed that the project focus on implementing proven
interventions to: promote the control of family size; increase the use of modern contraceptive
methods; and adopt technologies contributing to child survival. To this end, Annex 4 proposed
synergies between an expanded family planning program and the use of vaccination,
impregnated bed nets, oral rehydration salts, etc. to reduce infant mortality. For HIV/AIDS,
Annex 4 proposed interventions which would provide value for money, including specifically to:
(i) increase condom use and reduce the prevalence of STIs among female sex workers and their
male clients; and (ii) to increase condom use and reduce the number of sex partners among males
and females in union.

95.     Project interventions are technically sound and recognized as high impact interventions
to reduce the risk of infection by HIV and child and maternal mortality rates. There is evidence
that some of the project’s benefits were considerable, as the project succeeded in: (i) supporting
the development of policies, strategies, and operational guidelines; (ii) strengthening the capacity
of key stakeholders within Government (at national and local levels) and community groups to

     See Annex 3 of the ICR for a more detailed summary of the PAD’s arguments.
25
     See Annex 4 of the ICR for the complete discussion.
collaborate in organizing and implementing HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities; and (iii)
preventing the rapid spread of the disease among the most productive (and sexually active)
elements of the population as well as providing support to groups infected and affected by
HIV/AIDS. Moreover, both innovative interventions (the decentralized and integrated approach
and the RBF pilot) contributed to significant increases of health-related indicators (project
evaluation reports) with a limited cost: US$2.6/person/year for the integrated and decentralized
approach and US$1.8/person/year for the RBF pilot.

96.      Management efficiency. From a management perspective, the project had mixed
results. First, while it may not have been able to measure the efficiency of its interventions, it
was able to identify and act on underperformance: (i) the number of ministries supported was
limited to those demonstrating results; (ii) the number of sub-projects financed by FOSAP was
reduced (and then halted) when results were not evident, and the micro-credit program was
halted; and (iii) financial resources for the social marketing component and for population
activities were reduced and then eliminated. In place of this range of activities, the project
focused on specific ministries (at national and regional levels) and on specific interventions at
the health district level (with the mobile teams and RBF).

97.       Second, the PCT successfully managed project implementation while operating within
an administrative environment which handicapped efficiency: (i) counterpart funding (during the
initial credit) was not timely; (ii) procurement was slow and difficult; (iii) financial management
was weak (and audits often qualified); and (iv) evidence-based results (from either the
monitoring and evaluation system or associated studies) for decision-making was not sufficient.
Finally, the PCT’s resilience in confronting the constant implementation challenges resulting
from the socio-political situation should be noted.

98.      Despite the measures taken to improve efficiency and the efforts to improve operations
in the complex Chadian environment, project efficiency is rated Modest for the initial credit and
Modest for the AF.

Based on OPCS and IEG guidance and the previous ratings of Substantial for relevance, Modest
for efficacy, and Modest for efficiency, the overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

100.     Poverty. As highlighted in the strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, "high fertility and rapid
population growth impede efforts to reduce poverty", and thereby contribute to the spread of
HIV/AIDS. 26 Thus, by slowing down demographic growth, reducing pressures on the need for
services, and empowering people and institutions to deal more effectively with the epidemic, the
project components addressed the issue of poverty. Further, reducing the number of HIV
infections and AIDS deaths would decrease life years lost, the costs of treatment, and the loss of
productivity27 and thus contribute to the reduction of poverty. Because the burden of HIV/AIDS
falls disproportionately on poor and vulnerable groups, who are at increased risk of being
infected, the project sought to fund micro-credits to generate revenue among vulnerable groups
and support for PLWHA and families providing for orphans. The Government’s contribution to
free periodic clinical follow-up and ARV has also reduced the risk of poverty resulting from
catastrophic illness.

101.     Gender. PACP2 expected to finance research on RH behavior, family structure and
function, gender issues, and the causes and consequences of population growth. A study of these
population issues concluded that the direct determinants of population growth had not changed
significantly since 1964 28, which confirmed other findings that change is virtually impossible
without long-term efforts to change attitudes and improve the socio-economic status of women.
The project addressed knowledge needs (to empower women to decide on their fertility), service
delivery needs (through the promotion, inter alia, of birth spacing, the use of bednets, testing and
prevention of mother to child transmission, etc.), and economic needs (through the micro-credit
window of the FOSAP grants). The project also included gender specific targets and indicators
among the project performance indicators, but did not explicitly address the feminization of the
epidemic. 29

102. Social development. The project contributed to the country’s overall social development
by addressing the need to: (i) adopt a legislative context to promote RH and the protection of
PLWHA; (ii) identify the importance of socially marginal groups in the spread of HIV; (iii)
discuss culturally sensitive issues (including family size, sexual behavior, sexually transmitted
diseases and HIV infection, etc.); and (iv) develop an overarching programmatic response to the

   UNICEF’s PMTCT Fact Sheet for 2010 noted that HIV prevalence has remained relatively stable among adults
(15-49 years), but that levels of infection are much higher among young women (2.5%) than among young men
(1%) (15-24 years).
epidemic. Specifically, the project: (i) strengthened the participation of regional health
institutions; and (ii) supported NGOs capable of providing technical assistance to the
community-based organizations as well as the organizations themselves. Most importantly,
through the mobile health teams, the project reduced the physical, cultural, and financial barriers
for utilizing health services by populations with little previous access to these services.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

103. Population. At the outset of PACP2, the Government adopted the Law No. 6 (2002)
promoting RH, and during project implementation the NPP was revised and adopted by the
National Assembly in 2007. Prior to the MTR, the contributions of the project to institutional
change were mixed: (i) Regional Population Commissions were established in all regions
(though their achievements were not evaluated); (ii) certain operational research was conducted
(though dissemination was inadequate); (iii) key groups (religious leaders, traditional chiefs, etc.)
were sensitized (but attitude change was not assessed and seems not to have been significant);
and (iv) numerous IEC activities were carried out (though not with significant impact on key
indicators such as use of modern contraceptive methods). After the MTR, population activities
were reoriented to focus on the establishment of mobile health teams to deliver basic health
services, including RH services, family planning, HIV, IEC, etc. Though the scale of this
intervention has been limited to selected districts in two regions, the success of the approach has
been recognized by the Government and carefully followed by the Regional Governors involved.

104. HIV/AIDS. The project contributed to strengthening national and regional institutions
capable of formulating and coordinating the national response: (i) at central level with the
National AIDS Committee (NAC), the National AIDS Control Program (NACP), and the PCT;
and (ii) at regional level through the Regional Health Councils and the Regional Population
Committees and the Regional Permanent Secretariats. Combined with the series of national
strategic frameworks to combat AIDS and the adoption of an MCH strategy for 2008-15, the
project has contributed to the adoption of the requisite instruments for implementing the national
response. Within this framework, the project has effectively maintained the Government’s multi-
sectoral response to the epidemic by: (i) mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities into the action
plans of key sector ministries (with particularly good results for the Ministry of Health); (ii)
decentralizing resources and responsibility for implementing these activities (especially through
the mobile health teams); and (iii) strengthening the management capabilities and financing a
range of civil society organizations to improve results at local levels. 30

105. By delegating responsibility for component implementation to specific entities
(ministries, FOSAP, AMASOT, etc.), the project contributed to the development of capacity at
the national level. In the end, the ministries of health and defense performed adequately but the
others less so, FOSAP increased its financial and program management skills and established
itself as a viable non-governmental entity with follow-up financing from the Global Fund, but
AMASOT encountered organizational and societal problems and was subsequently dropped



30
   A number of these improvements followed the recommendations of the institutional audit, which was partly
funded by the project. See Dr. Idrissa Ouedraogo, et al., Audit technique des organes d’encadrement de la lutte
contre le VIH/SIDA au Tchad (septembre 2004).
during the AF phase. 31

106.     In addition to national level strategies and institutions, regional and district authorities,
the project also financed the involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil
society organizations (CSOs) to implement sub-projects, which responded to community-led
initiatives and contributed to strengthening the capabilities of these community institutions
(including Priority Vulnerable Groups and associations of PLWHA).

107. Finally, during the implementation of the PACP2, the Government adopted the Law No.
19 (2007) promoting the fight against HIV/AIDS and the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS
and with sexually transmitted diseases. The law provides a basis for protecting the rights of
PLWHA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

108. Though unintended, the difficulties (political, financial, etc.) confronting the PCT
contributed to the development of a resilient and resourceful unit, capable of adapting the project
to the changing conditions for its implementation. In addition, unlike many other similar
projects, the project team demonstrated the potential for coordinating a multisectoral approach
and collaborating with the Ministry of Health rather than assuming implementation
responsibilities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

109. Though a beneficiary assessment was completed for the MTR, it was destroyed when the
project offices were burned in 2008. As part of the final evaluation in 2013, an analysis of the
project’s “penetration” and interviews with some beneficiaries were carried out and showed that
some 70 percent of the target population in the project zones knew of the project, and of these 60
percent had had experience with the project implementing agencies. Among the communications
channels cited most frequently by the population were: (i) the mobile health teams (83.6
percent); (ii) the community-based organizations (67.7 percent); (iii) local radio (66.5 percent);
and (iv) other members of the community (51.3 percent). In addition, the ICR mission met with
many of the stakeholders, both within their institutions for thorough discussions of the way in
which the project strengthened their responses to HIV/AIDS issues and during the final project
evaluation workshop (June 2013).

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

110. Several elements should contribute to the reduction of risks to development outcomes;
these include the current legal structure, strategic measures (as well as oil revenues) for
implementing a national population policy, and a series of frameworks to combat HIV/AIDS.
However, a number of risks identified in the PAD are still pertinent and in particular: (i)
intersectoral collaboration; and (ii) coordination and implementation capacity at all levels. Other

31
     AMASOT had financial support from other donors, mainly KfW, during both phases of the project.
risks have become more apparent over time and include: (i) inadequate human resources; (ii)
weak capabilities for supplying the requisite drugs and consumables to avoid service
interruptions; and (iii) the likelihood of insufficient financing, particularly for community-based
prevention activities.

111. Despite Government promises, the lack of follow-up funding since project closing is
particularly worrisome and may even raise questions about the Government’s continuing
commitment to the project’s objectives. Given such concerns, the risk to development outcome
would be considered high, except that a follow up IDA operation is being prepared to build on
the experiences of the pilots initiated during the additional financing period.

112. Within the framework of these innovative service delivery mechanisms, priorities for
improving RH have been identified, and adequate progress for fighting HIV has been made,
including the adoption of program policies and procedures (for testing, care and support, and
treatment), enhanced surveillance and knowledge of the most vulnerable populations, expanded
testing and counseling, formal protection of PLWHA, and provision of MTCT prevention and
ARV treatment. The follow-on IDA financing will support these services and strengthen the
mechanisms for delivering these services.


5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

113.     Preparation of the PACP2 relied on the experiences of the first operation, but was not
able to take advantage of the findings of the ICR. 32 As a result, preparation of the second project
was relatively easy and predictable but perhaps missed opportunities to re-think important
aspects of the project. Specifically, the second project repeated a number of the design
weaknesses identified by the ICR for the first project, namely that: (i) baseline data were
insufficient and contributed to the establishment of overly ambitious targets (and expectations)
which were reflected in the M&E plan subsequently adopted by the Government; and (ii)
assessment of the Government’s capacity to implement the objectives outlined in the National
Population Policy was overly optimistic. Somewhat surprisingly, given the first project’s
contribution to the preparation of the National AIDS Control Strategic Plan for the period 1999-
2003, there is little reference to the integration of project financing in support of the
implementation of the plan. Finally, as noted previously, the identification of risks and proposed
risk mitigation measures were weak and did not envision the possibility of civil strife.

114.  Preparation of the second project did have a number of strengths: (i) formal
documentation by recognized international experts was satisfactory; (ii) the PAD was clear and


32
  The ICR for the first project was prepared a year after the Second Project was approved. For the discussion of
design weaknesses, see the ICR for the first Population and Aids Control Project (Report No. 24344) (June 2002),
pp. 6ff.
concise; (iii) an extensive economic analysis of high fertility and HIV/AIDS was done; and (iv)
implementation manuals were prepared as a condition of effectiveness. Discussion of these
elements with the Government and participation of various groups (at least before the national
consensus building workshop after effectiveness) seems to have been fairly minimal. From the
Bank’s perspective, there do not appear to have been many concerns expressed during the PCN
review, the Decision Meeting, and the negotiations. A QEA was not prepared.

115.    The major consideration in rating quality at entry as moderately unsatisfactory is that
within two years of effectiveness, there was already consideration that there were important
problems for the implementation of the project components.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

116.     Two TTLs assured continuity during project implementation over the period 2002-2009
as well as the preparation of the AF (in 2007). Their performance under often difficult
circumstances punctuated by extended periods of civil strife was laudable. 33 Supervision
missions were conducted regularly, often by sizeable Bank teams (generally six or more
specialists). Informative aide-mémoires with detailed component results and lists of observations
and recommendations were submitted in a timely manner. Fiduciary management was
particularly systematic.

117.    The task team’s contributions to the project were especially useful (and valued by the
Borrower) for: (i) the systematic analysis of progress (accompanied by very comprehensive
action tables); and (ii) the identification of implementation issues where progress was
inadequate. Despite the recommendations, action plans, and management letters, the missions
were less successful in resolving a number of chronic problems, including poor implementation
of the population component, slow formulation of certain strategies necessary to organize
financing, and insufficient counterpart funding. There was a tendency to identify the need for a
study, for which terms of reference were eventually proposed but which rarely reached a
concrete conclusion.

118.     During the initial credit, the ISRs had several weaknesses: (i) some of the ratings seem
to have been too generous, notably for achievement of the PDO and financial management; and
(ii) the component ratings tended to lag about a year after the findings of the supervision
missions. The supervision reports did not include many observations about how the IDA
financing reinforced other financing in the sector (e.g., EU, GFATM, etc.) or the contributions of
other agencies (e.g., UNAIDS for the REDES, UNICEF for the MICS, etc.). During the AF, the
ISRs tended to emphasize the positive findings rather than the observed implementation
challenges. 34 In addition, discussion of measures to promote the future sustainability of the
project’s benefits was insufficient.


33
   Two other TTL assumed responsibility for the additional financing (the last for only the final six months before
project closing).
34
   Compare, for example, ISR 18 (December 2012) with the TA report on project progress (November 2012) where
the former rates the PDO and the IP as satisfactory and the latter identifies an urgent need to reinvigorate all of the
project’s activities (p. 7, and especially Annexes 5 and 6).
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

119.    Following ICR guidance that when ratings for the two dimensions are in different ranges
(moderately unsatisfactory for quality at entry and moderately satisfactory for supervision), the
rating for overall Bank performance depends on the outcome rating. Bank performance is
therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

120.     Government performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory, based on an assessment
of its moderately satisfactory performance on HIV/AIDS and its unsatisfactory performance on
population. From a statutory perspective, the promulgation of a national population policy and
laws on RH and protection of the rights of PLWHA constitute significant accomplishments. The
implementation of these laws through the adoption and application of the necessary judicial texts
has not followed.

121.     The Government also provided satisfactory project oversight, including: (i) participation
of the prime minister in the steering committees; (ii) support for the project implementation unit
(including their retention during the period 2009-10); and (iii) its contribution to the
development of a common enabling environment (politico-legal, institutional, technical, financial,
and administrative) facilitating the national response by public and private actors.

122.    Performance of Government entities at the regional levels (regional health councils and
regional population commissions) was less successful, though the participation of the regional
governors in the efforts of the mobile health teams was positive. Though the project envisioned
funds for both entities, only the population commissions took advantage of them. Disbursement
tended to be slow and justification of expenditures even slower. Also, while timely counterpart
funding was weak, the amounts were eventually paid and served to carry out project activities
during the 2008-09 period (particularly for the mobile teams). The Government’s relationships
with donors, partners, and other stakeholders were not always productive.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

123.     The PCT’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Though confronted with a
succession of intractable problems (ranging from complicated Government procurement
regulations to the destruction of their offices), the PCU provided both an effective environment
for project implementation and a positive channel for communication between the project and
the Bank. The PCU showed tremendous resilience during project implementation, responding to
changing circumstances and adapting program interventions as required. The PCU was
recognized as an effective coordinating unit (and not viewed, as in many other similar projects,
as an implementing unit). The PCT effectively handled the period from 2008-2010 by
maintaining core staff and ensuring the continuation of key activities (notably, the mobile health
teams). The PCT also effectively managed the start-up and implementation of the AF as well as
the oversight of the RBF initiative.

124.     Neither procurement nor financial management was ever rated lower than moderately
satisfactory, but: (i) the aides-mémoires noted procurement problems related to conformity with
the procurement procedures, delays, contract management, and procurement documentation; and
(as noted previously) there were problems with virtually all of the external audits. Finally, the
MTR was carried out with considerable delay and without all of the planned documentation, but
the borrower’s completion report was completed on time.

125.  Several other entities assumed responsibility for the implementation of the project’s
components; an assessment of their performance is presented in Annex 10.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

126.     Following ICR guidance that when ratings for the two dimensions are in different ranges
(moderately unsatisfactory for Government performance and moderately satisfactory for
implementing agency), the rating for overall Borrower performance depends on the outcome
rating. Borrower performance is therefore rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6.   Lessons Learned

127.     Combining components for HIV/AIDS and population (and RH) in a single project
is challenging. While the Bank can be instrumental in stimulating Government commitment for
both HIV/AIDS and population, commitment is perhaps more easily sustained for HIV/AIDS
than for population. Though both address sensitive cultural issues, mobilizing support is easier to
achieve when personal interests (e.g. avoidance of HIV) are at stake 35 and more difficult to
obtain with respect to changing long-standing traditional attitudes and practices (e.g. the demand
for large families and high fertility). The case of religious leaders in Chad offers the example of
where their support for HIV/AIDS prevention strengthened the project’s actions but (despite
project efforts to raise awareness) their opposition to family planning and population weakened
the project’s achievements.

128.     The advantages and disadvantages of building on previous projects need to be
carefully examined during project preparation. Continuing interventions which had been
successful during PACP1 was an attractive option for PACP2, but by the mid-term review it was
clear that many of these “inside” approaches needed substantial modification or elimination.
Instead, the interventions which succeeded in the late stages of the initial credit and throughout
the additional financing were innovations based on “outside” ideas adapted to the Chadian
context. For the follow-on project to PACP2, evaluations of past performance and studies of
future improvements are in progress to ensure that the two innovations initiated during the


35
   The PPAR for PACP1 cites informant comments indicating that “the fight against HIV/AIDS became more
relevant (especially in the south) as the epidemic progressed and more people observed first-hand and were affected
by the disease and its consequences”. (p. 30).
additional financing period (results-based financing and mobile health teams) remain pertinent
for the foreseeable future in Chad.


129.     Risk assessment is an essential aspect of project design. A more rigorous risk
assessment of PACP2 might have concluded that: (i) significant risks (political, socio-cultural,
technical, and financial) existed; (ii) potential mitigation measures would likely be insufficient;
and (iii) the feasibility of completing the project as designed was questionable. In addition, it
should also have comprised risk assessments for institutional arrangements and financing, both
of which underlie potential commitment to the project’s objectives. Where roles and
responsibilities are insufficiently defined and/or overlap, implementation will suffer; where
future financing is uncertain, sustainability will suffer (even with adequate institutional
arrangements). While the introduction of the mobile health teams and the RBF contradicted this
lesson, this was justified by the fact that when the existing delivery of services is so poor and the
need for services so great, important risks are warranted, even without adequate feasibility
studies. For the follow-on project, more “due diligence” is in progress to assess accurately the
risks of the operation with a view to build stronger government ownership.

130.     The importance of efficiency as a criterion for assessing health and social
development projects must be seen in a broader context. Multi-sectoral responses to sensitive
socio-cultural issues, a comprehensive range of interventions involving health and non-health
actors (at national, regional and local levels), and the participation of organizations, associations,
and communities with varying capabilities have all been shown to be essential but not
predictably efficient components of success. This is especially true when these various aspects
are considered in the context of Chad’s ongoing civil strife. What is important in these
circumstances is: (i) focusing on sectors with the greatest potential impact on the epidemic
(health, defense, education, etc.); (ii) clearly distinguishing the potential contributions (political
mobilization, technical expertise) of community organizations; and (iii) initiating and sustaining
a series of priority actions.

131.     There is no substitute for timely baseline data and an operational M&E system.
Though often ignored by task teams, these elements are needed by projects: (i) at the beginning
to ensure that targets (and the expectations raised by them) are reasonable; (ii) during to assess
financial and technical accountability and provide the means for evidenced-based project
management; and (iii) at the end to determine whether (and to what extent) the results can be
attributed to the project.

7.   Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

132.    (a) Borrower/implementing agencies: The task team and the Borrower reviewed and
agreed on the results of the indicators reported in the Data Sheet. 36 The Borrower has prepared a
comprehensive final evaluation report in French and an English summary, which is presented in
Annex 7. The Borrower’s final evaluation report is available from the Project Files.

                                Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis


A. Summary of the original Economic Analysis (PAD 2001)

1. Initial situation. Annex 4 of the PAD noted that both high fertility and high HIV prevalence
had been shown to negatively affect economic wellbeing and had been identified by the
Government of Chad as major priorities to be addressed as part of its development and poverty
reduction strategy. The first part of the annex addresses HIV/AIDS while the second treats high
fertility; in both cases, an analysis of the cost of inaction will be related to the cost of action. 37

2. HIV/AIDS. Annex 4 assumed that HIV/AIDS was on the rise in Chad and “seemed” to have
moved towards a generalized epidemic. Prevalence was estimated by UNAIDS at 3 percent in 1999,
but cross-sectional studies conducted in four cities in 2000 showed prevalence among adults at 9-15
percent. Based on the 2000 results, the annex estimated the number of PLWHA in 2000 at between
160,000 and 360,000 and projected that this number could reach between 260,000 and 700, 000 by
2005, that is, double between 2002 and 2005.

3. Population. Annex 4 estimated that population size would grow at an annual rate of some 3
percent, based on an expected decrease in child mortality and a slight rise in fertility. This would
reflect a classic demographic transition pattern resulting from decreasing use of traditional birth
spacing methods but not yet accompanied by an equivalent increasing use of modem contraceptive
methods. Assuming a constant level of fertility, Annex 4 projected that the population was likely to
almost double within the next 20 years with an explosion of the number of people less than 20 years
of age. Annex 4 concluded that significant changes were needed to modify the economic
environment and encourage the use of family planning methods but noted that family planning
services benefit only a small proportion of the population, mainly the richest and most educated.

4. As in a number of instances under MAP 1 and MAP 2, assessment of HIV/AIDS prevalence
was overestimated; the number of PLWHA in 2005 was estimated at 193,000 and at 206,000 in
2010. Similarly, the projected population growth rate was overestimated, as World Bank data
showed a downward trend from 3.23 percent in 2005 to 2.62 percent in 2011.

5. Projected costs of inaction and benefits of action. Annex 4 attempted to estimate the costs of
inaction and action in intervening to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS and slow population growth.

6.    HIV/AIDS. Based on 2001 data, the projected costs of the epidemic comprised:
     • direct costs (for Government financing of hospitals and for outpatient care), which were
        estimated at US$560 per year per case of AIDS care, financed by the public sector (20
        percent) and households (80 percent); and
     • indirect costs linked to losses in productivity and revenue from labor, which were estimated


37
  The PAD referred to the “Economic Analysis of HIV/AIDS” in the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa
Region (MAP) Project Appraisal Document (Report No. 20727 AFT, Annex 5) and the Second Multi-Country
HIV/AIDS Program (MAP2) (APL) for the Africa Region (Report No. P7497 AFR). It did not, however, cite the six
volume study of the Swiss Tropical Institute (2001).
                                                                                                           45
       (based on the results of a case control study in 2001) at about US$800 per AIDS case per
       year.

7. Annex 4 then estimated the combined cost of AIDS in 2010 at almost US$200 million or 14
percent of GDP and the cumulative costs over the period 2000-2010 at between US$180 million to
over US$1 billion overall, extremely high amounts suggesting that the epidemic was likely to have
a substantial impact, not only on the welfare of households, but potentially on the pace of economic
growth.

8. Given the costs of the project and the costs of inaction, Annex 4 concluded that the project
should focus on implementing proven interventions to: (i) reduce the estimated number of new
HIV/AIDS cases in targeted groups; (ii) reduce the estimated number of HIV/AIDS deaths resulting
in a reduced number of years of life lost due to HIV/AID; and (iii) increase productivity and
significant savings in public and private health care and expenditure. Specifically, Annex 4
estimated impact on incidence:
    • for female sex workers and male clients of: (i) increasing condom use; (ii) reducing the
        prevalence of STIs; and (ii) jointly increasing condom use and reducing STD prevalence;
        and
    • for males and females in union: (i) increasing condom use; (ii) reducing the number of sex
        partners; and (iii) jointly increasing condom use and reducing the number of sex partners.

9. According to the model used, a gradual change in condom use (2 percent increase per year) and
an accompanying decline in STIs (1 percent per year) would, after 4 years, reduce the number of
new infections among female sex workers and their male clients by 40 percent. Similarly, a gradual
change in condom use (2 percent increase per year) and an accompanying decline in sex partners (of
0.1 per year) would, after 4 years, reduce the number of new HIV infections among couples by
almost 40 percent and the number by almost 700 per 100,000 couples. Based on these changes,
Annex 4 projected that, by 2010, the anticipated level of behavior change would represent a savings
of US$5 to 30 million per year, or a cumulative savings of between US$17-$97 million.

10. These findings conform, for the most part, with the general findings in the literature, as shown
in the following table 38 and with the proposals recommended by the preparation studies in 2000 39:

11. Population. Based on evidence of the impact of demographic changes on economic growth,
poverty and inequality, Annex 4 identified the costs of inaction on fertility and population growth,
comprising:
   • direct costs resulting from the continuing strain on social services as a consequence of rapid
       population growth; and
   • indirect costs emphasize the negative impact of population growth on the pace of aggregate
       economic growth and on the lost contribution of declining fertility to contribute to the
       reduced incidence and severity of poverty.

12. Given the costs of the project and the costs of inaction, Annex 4 concluded that the project
should focus on implementing proven interventions to: promote the control of family size; increase
the use of modern contraceptive methods; and adopt technologies contributing to child survival. To
this end, Annex 4 proposed synergies between an expanded family planning program and the use of
vaccination, impregnated bed nets, oral rehydration salts, etc. to reduce infant mortality.

B. Development impact of the Second Population and AIDS Project: cost, benefits and
efficiency

13. The development objective of the Project was to contribute to changing the behavior of the
Chadian population so that they would adopt behaviors which would reduce the risk of: (i) infection
from HIV; and (ii) too closely spaced and/ or unwanted pregnancies. Thus, the project was
designed, then restructured, to comprehensively address supply and demand side issues related to
costs and barriers to access HIV/AIDS and population information and health services. Costs,
benefits and efficiency of the project are assessed in this section.

14. As no direct evidence is available to assess the direct impact on population of capacity building
activities of component 1 and as activities under component 3a were funded by other partners after
2010, the economic analysis would be limited to the components 2, 3b and 4 (specifically with the
additional financing). Indeed, more measurable information is available for these components and
after 2010 (63 percent of AF costs; and 26 percent of the total project costs).

15. Components 2 (reoriented with the additional financing) and 4 supported the implementation of
the decentralized and integrated approach. The integrated approach consisted in (i) the supply of a
comprehensive package of basic maternal and child health services through mobile health teams;
(ii) strengthening of the existing public and private health centers and voluntary counseling and
testing centers, including for medical waste management; and (iii) promotion of demand for
services through social mobilization, communication and peer education activities implemented by
civil society. This approach was implemented in 10 health districts after 2010.

16. Component 3b financed a Performance-Based Financing (PBF) approach to improve maternal
and child health outcomes in 8 pilot health districts (different from the 10 districts targeted by the
integrated approach). This component supported the design, implementation and supervision of the
PBF approach.
                                                                                                   48
B.2 Direct benefits and cost efficiency

17. The project led to several impacts, including a greater awareness of HIV/AIDS issues, better
availability and quality of HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health services, and an increase in
utilization of these services.

18. The decentralized and integrated approach contributed to significant increases of health related
indicators according to data from project surveys. Covering a population of 2.2 million in ten health
districts, the cost of this intervention represented only US$2.6/hab/year:

19. The Performance-Based Financing pilot was implemented in eight health districts (different
from the ones covered by the decentralized approach) from October 2011 to June 2013. Even after
such a short period of implementation and limited funding (US$1.8/capita/year) for a PBF scheme,
the intervention generated promising results:

reduce the risk of infection by HIV40 and child and maternal mortality rates 41. Both innovative
interventions funded through the Project (additional financing) had a limited cost: US$2.6 /hab/year
for the integrated and decentralized approach and US$1.8/hab/year for the RBF pilot.

21. Due to data availability and methodological constraints, an estimation of Disability-Adjusted
Life Year (DALYs 42 ) gained from the project is not proposed. However, implementation of
components 2, 3b and 4 could be compared to similar interventions related to HIV/AIDS prevention
and family planning programs in other Sub-Saharan countries. As stated in the table below, these
interventions cost between US$12 and US$34 per DALY gained. By international standards, health
interventions that cost less than US$100 per DALY are considered highly cost-effective. Thus, the
integrated and decentralized approach and the RBF pilot can be considered as highly cost-effective
as they both contributed to HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning activities.

Financial Analysis

22. According to Annex 4, the fiscal impact of the project was likely to be small, as: (i) less than
US$ 6 million was expected to be disbursed annually; and (ii) counterpart funds (mostly for
operational costs) were not expected to be unduly heavy (particularly given current HIPC and future
oil revenues). The actual fiscal impact would be somewhat diminished by the fact that much of the
project would be directly channeled to CSOs, NGOs, and communities, which were required to
generate their own counterpart contributions equivalent to 20 percent of the cost of their proposals.
Despite the difficulties with counterpart financing under the initial credit, these assumptions were
(and remain) valid.

high-risk groups most likely to contract and spread the infection; and (iv) enhanced the efficiency of
national AIDS programs. These were also all positive.

percent had had experience with the project implementing agencies. Among the communication
channels cited most frequently by the population were: (i) the mobile health teams (83.6 percent);
(ii) the community-based organizations (67.7 percent); (iii) local radio (66.5 percent); and (iv) other
members of the community (51.3 percent).

                 Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The Population and AIDS Control Project (PACP 2) has been implemented since April 2002 by
the Ministry of Planning, Economy and International Cooperation (MPECI) and managed by the
PCT under the aegis of a Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary General of the said Ministry.
It was designed to enhance the achievements of PACP 1 by focusing on changing people's behavior
with respect to STI, HIV/AIDS, RH, and family planning. Initiated by the Government of Chad
with technical and financial support from the World Bank, it supports implementation of the
National Population Policy (NPP) and the National Strategic Framework to Fight AIDS (CSNLS).

2. Additional funding for PACP 2 was provided for the period from June 2010 to June 2013. This
evaluation was designed to assess the results of the project, both immediate (output) and
intermediate (effects and outcome), in the context of the ten health districts supported by the project
(Kanem, Salamat, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Mayo Kebbi West region, and N'Djamena).
A survey was conducted of a representative sample of households in areas covered by PACP 2 and
of the Priority Vulnerable Groups (GVP) to determine the effects and results of the key activities,
the penetration of the Project, and the satisfaction of those members of vulnerable groups and
people living in the priority service areas. In addition to the survey, interviews and discussions were
also conducted with officials of the project and partners involved in its implementation (e.g.
FOSAP); documents were also made available to the evaluation team.

3. The evaluation addressed project relevance, effectiveness/impact, efficiency, sustainability, and
visibility.

4. Relevance. The project was consistent with the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty (NPRS2) adopted in April 2008; the Declaration of Population Policy adopted in January
1994 and revised in July 2007; the National Strategic Framework for the Fight against
STIs/HIV/AIDS (2007-11); and the national roadmap for accelerating the reduction of maternal and
child mortality (2009-2015).

5. The project’s three development objectives (PDO) were appropriate, consistent, and clearly
related to the problems identified. PACP 2 was designed to consolidate the achievements and
experience of PACP 1 through: (i) actions focused on changing people's behavior with respect to
STI/HIV/AIDS, RH, and family planning; and (ii) initiation of an additional component “RBF” to
improve outcomes of maternal and child health in four other pilot regions. Each of the four
components addressed an aspect of the problem and was also relevant.

6. Effectiveness/Impact. With respect to the PDO, all the deliverables have been fully met or are
on track to be. Results from the survey for the various indicators are presented in Attachment 1. 44
The impact of the project’s peer education (on awareness of HIV/AIDS) and social communication
sessions (on RH/FP) have been very noticeable despite the relatively high attrition in attendance.



44
   Though not included in the Borrower’s final report, results for comparable indicators from the 2011 and 2013
surveys are presented in Attachment 2 for the reader’s convenience. Data in the report from project sources has been
included in the text of the ICR.

                                                                                                                 56
7. Efficiency. Regarding project management and the relationship between cost-effectiveness and
efficiency, the procedures developed and implemented by the project contributed to effective daily
management. The project monitoring and evaluation established by the PCT and FOSAP was
especially valuable.

8. Collaboration with the administrative authorities was very good, and their involvement in the
project activities was very noticeable. The local authorities were particularly pleased with the
mobile health teams and their ability to bring services to the populations in rural, underserved areas.
They were concerned about the continuation of the project’s benefits.

9. With the community-based associations and their support groups, there were
misunderstandings from time to time, especially related to delays in in the transmission of
supporting documents of funds and activity reports by the CBA and DP and disbursements by
FOSAP.

10. The social centers also complained of inadequate support for vulnerable people. Relations
between the social centers and the associations of PPLW were not always smooth, and the PPLW
associations found it very difficult to provide home visits for patients, especially for patients living
in rural areas.

11. Sustainability. The selection of districts for project implementation did not sufficiently take
into account either local perceptions and needs or status systems and beliefs; this was particularly
noticeable in the Kanem and Salamat Districts.

12. The project’s financial viability, including peer education and social communication services,
which entirely relied on the use of local dialects, were well-considered and welcomed by
communities, and there is no doubt that these elements will continue in some form. Funding for the
CBA were only sufficient to cover the activities planned, and it is doubtful these activities will
continue beyond the life of the project. The situation is almost identical in the social centers, where
the sustainability of the the project’s achievements is not yet on their agenda. Supplies of inputs for
systematic screening and treatment of STIs as well as all the benefits of mobile teams to the
development of maternal and child health will need to rely on Government assistance.

13. Visibility. The project was well-known and received throughout the project areas and affected
communities: about 70 percent of respondents knew of the project, and among these, 60 percent
were also familiar with key partners’ developing activities in the field. In the regions of Logone
Occidental, Logone Oriental, and Salamat, the proportion of the population aware of the project was
highest; in the Kanem Region and even in the capital, only 40 percent of the population knew of the
project.

14. The project’s strong popularity resulted from the implementation approach adopted by the
project, and particularly:

   •   The range of service providers involved at various levels in the implementation of activities.
       These included: NGOs and Community-Based Associations, community and public radio,
       theater troops, health services (Voluntary Testing Centers, Health Centers), Social Centers,
       Legal Clinics, and Associations of PLWHA; and

                                                                                                     57
•   The high mobility in districts of the mobile health teams, and especially the indication
    "Mobile Team, PPLS2/FOSAP” on all vehicles.

               Annex 10: Assessment of the Additional Project Implementing Agencies

133.      As with the first project implementation, responsibilities were established for each component: (i)
line ministries for Component 1; (ii) FOSAP for Component 2; (iii) AMASOT for Component 3; and the
Ministry of Economic Planning and Development for Component 4. After the AF, AMASOT was dropped,
and the MEPD assumed responsibility for oversight of the mobile teams. Finally, a consortium comprising an
international NGO (AEDES) and a national NGO (CSSI) managed the RBF pilot program. Overall, the
performance of the project implementing units is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
134.      Line ministries. Six line ministries received assistance under the initial project and four under AF.
Implementation started slowly (due in large measure to procurement delays), but the ISRs assessed
performance as satisfactory through the Mid-Term Review and moderately satisfactory thereafter. The
Ministry of Health performed well, and progress was made on: (i) expanding testing in regional and district
hospitals and using mobile screening units to reach people living in rural and remote areas; and introducing
free ARV treatment and biological/radiological check-ups which have markedly improved access to care and
explain the rapid increase in the number of patients under medical supervision. The Ministry suffered from
insufficient supplies of reagents and other consumables, difficulties coordinating with the mobile teams, and
inadequate human resources to ensure the smooth implementation of the FBR sub-component. The
performance of the Ministry of Defense was considered satisfactory, but the performance of the other
ministries during both phases was variable. The overall performance of the line ministries is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
135.      FOSAP. Though the ISRs judged FOSAP’s performance as satisfactory (except for the period
around the Mid-Term Review), the ICR rates its performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory. FOSAP’s
financial management would seem to have had significant problems; virtually all annual audits were
qualified, and the auditor refused to certify FOSAP’s accounts in 2005, 2007, and 2008 (due in part to the
civil strife which destroyed the financial records). The audits in 2011 and 2012 were approved, but not
without a number of questions raised.
136.     The results of the sub-projects were Moderately Satisfactory. With a manual describing the sub-
project procedures, a pre-approved set of priority activities aimed at specific vulnerable groups, and the
recruitment of oversight NGOs (projets dynamisateurs), FOSAP rapidly surpassed the project’s objective for
the number of sub-projects to be financed. However, supervision missions noted that: (i) the sub-projects
were not always targeted in line with the project’s objectives 45; and (ii) there were issues related to the actual
performance of the sub-projects, particularly insufficient data collection and inadequate quality control. After
the Mid-Term Review, the number of sub-projects was reduced and the selection and implementation
guidelines modified significantly. Beginning in 2007, new sub-projects were suspended, and attention was
focused on FOSAP’s role in implementing the integrated local response.
137.     Micro-credits were Unsatisfactory. There were significant problems linked to the design (too few
beneficiaries could actually be reached by the approach) and to the implementation by the oversight
organizations (agences d’encadrement). The oversight organizations failed to ensure adequate management
and reimbursement of the loans, and FOSAP was obliged to sue them (over the period 2006-08) to recover
unpaid loans.
138.      AMASOT. The ISRs rated the social marketing component satisfactory or moderately satisfactory
through mid-2007 before dropping the rating to moderately unsatisfactory in late 2007 and dropping it
entirely for the AF. Initial issues with AMASOT’s NGO status were followed by condom pricing issues with
respect to neighboring countries and, then, the organization of oral contraceptive and bed net distribution
campaigns. The 2006 audit highlighted a number of fiduciary issues, including more than 20 million FCFA



45
  The December 2004 supervision mission concluded that all of the vulnerable groups benefited from the sub-projects,
but the distribution among groups did not conform to the project’s objectives: e.g. only 3% PLWHA objective was
achieved while 157% of the sub-project objective for youths and 588% of the target for other groups were achieved.
                                                                                                                  64
of ineligible expenditures. Based on poor management and a lack of achievement on almost all objectives,
the ICR rates AMASOT’s performance as Unsatisfactory.
139.     Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. ISR ratings for this component varied markedly
over the life of the project: (i) from satisfactory through the end of 2004 (when the Population
Division/Direction produced several important documents); (ii) to unsatisfactory through mid-2007 (when
planned activities were implemented with difficulty, and there were questions about the Government’s
commitment to the NPP); and (iii) except for the last ISR, to satisfactory through the end of the initial credit
and the AF (based on the supervision of the integrated local response). Overall, as a result of the
reorientation of the component, the ICR rates its performance as Moderately Satisfactory.
140.    AEDES/CSSI. According to the final evaluation, there were minor shortcoming in the consortium’s
performance, but, overall, it successfully carried out its contractual obligations. The ICR rates its
performance as Moderately Satisfactory.
