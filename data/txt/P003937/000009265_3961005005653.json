It will also assist the Government\n            of Indonesia (GOI) in its management of part of the coastal\n            zones and help ensure sound environmental practices in swamp\n            development. The project will be implemented over a six year\n            period (1994-2000) in twenty existing swamp settlement\n            schemes, covering a potential net cultivable area of about\n            55,000 ha, in Jambi, Riau and West Kalimantan Provinces\n            which are among the poorest provinces in Indonesia. It will\n            include the following main components: (a) rehabilitation of\n            existing and construction of new water control structures,\n            and support for better water management practices; (b)\n            promotion of food crop production through support for\n            research and extension with associated provision of seeds,\n            pest control and seasonal inputs; (c) development of tree\n            crops, including land titling and certification, in an area\n            of about 12,500 ha; improvement of rural infrastructure\n            through rehabilitation of existing or construction of new\n            roads, bridges and jetties, and provision of potable water;\n            and (e) improvement of coastal zones land use management,\n            including the preparation of an Environmental Profile in\n            West Kalimantan and support for the development of the\n            Berbak National Park Buffer Zone in Jambi.
