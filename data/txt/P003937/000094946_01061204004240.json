outcome is rated\n            marginally satisfactory, while overall project\n            sustainability is rated uncertain. Overall World Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory: The two important aspects\n            missed during project preparation were 1) a well-described\n            coordination mechanism and detailed sequencing of various\n            activities, and 2) a detailed control mechanism on\n            procurement and provision of pesticide to farmer groups.\n            Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory. The main\n            lessons learned included the following: Swamp development\n            requires an integrated approach including water management,\n            food and tree crops production, and provision of essential\n            services such as roads and water supply. Decentralized\n            project design and planning involving the active\n            participation of local government and other stakeholders is\n            essential for defining and prioritizing real needs, thus\n            improving the chances of project success. Greater\n            participation on community development and a participatory\n            approach in project planning, implementation, and management\n            is recommended in future lowland projects. Inadequate\n            consideration of environmental factors during planning and\n            engineering design may lead to a serious negative impact on\n            the environment and human life. Such projects such as swamp\n            development projects should be implemented in phases over a\n            much longer period that the typical project time-frame in\n            order to accommodate community development and the proper\n            sequencing of development activities."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
