         environment within the area of influence of the project; 2)\n            identify the project components which might have a\n            significant impact on the existing natural and\n            socio-econonomic environment; 3) identify the potential\n            impacts of these project components on a local and regional\n            scale; 4) identify existing and ongoing negative\n            environmental impacts of the schemes and suggest ways they\n            may be mitigated through project design or environmental\n            management; and 5) analyze the net environmental impacts of\n            the project and suggest mitigating measures or alternatives\n            which might alleviate negative impacts.  The study\n            encompasses the three project areas in the provinces of\n            Riau, Jambi and West Kalimantan.  The study also covers\n            outside areas of potential impacts, especially where such\n            areas included conservation reserves, primary forests,\n            coastal habitats, neighboring villages, and local fisheries."}, "docdt": "1992-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
