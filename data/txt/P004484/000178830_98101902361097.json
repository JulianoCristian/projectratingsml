The program is\n            designed to accelerate industrial growth, expand exployment\n            more rapidly, maintain the rapid growth of nontraditional\n            exports, increase the efficiency of capital use, and\n            stimulate industry outside of the Metropolitan Manila area.\n            To achieve these long-term objectives, actions will be\n            taken, in phases, in the five major areas of export\n            promotion, tariff reform and trade liberalization,\n            investment incentives, industrial restructuring, and major\n            industrial projects. The initial phase of policy reform\n            measures, to be supported under the loan, concentrates on\n            export promotion, tariff reform and trade liberalization."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
