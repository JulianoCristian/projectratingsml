The Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. The risk\n            to development outcome was substantial. Significant changes\n            included extension of closing date and a shift in focus from\n            a crisis response operation to also provide technical\n            assistance for critical support for energy sector reform.\n            Several lessons were learned. It is important to set up\n            functioning implementation arrangements before project\n            effectiveness so that implementation is not delayed\n            unnecessarily. Further, better coordination between the\n            Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy and Industry\n            would avoid unnecessary delays and ensure smoother project\n            implementation.  For an emergency project it is imperative\n            to ensure that the project implementation unit (PIU) has\n            qualified and competent staff who are familiar with the\n            Bank's procedures, especially on procurement and\n            financial management.  It will be useful that the\n            operational manuals are developed and shared with PIU's\n            and all implementing entities to get staff familiarized with\n            project management and other procedures so that even if\n            there is a high staff turnover, the transition would be\n            smooth and project implementation would not be adversely\n            affected. In order to avoid delayed submission of audit\n            reports and breach financial covenants, it is essential to\n            select the auditors in time."}, "docdt": "2014-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
