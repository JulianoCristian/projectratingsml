The Project was approved on\n            September 30, 2010 in order to mitigate the impact of the\n            April and June 2010 violence upon public finances and access\n            to energy. The changes under the current restructuring\n            include: (i) addition of a new results indicator to monitor\n            the technical assistance; (ii) addition of technical\n            assistance to the scope of Component 2; (iii) reallocation\n            of project funds in the amount of US $1.068 million from\n            component one (retroactively financed gas purchases) to\n            component two (rehabilitation and repair of energy\n            infrastructure and networks), and (iv) extension of the\n            project closing date by twelve months to December 31, 2013.\n            These changes will allow completion of ongoing procurements\n            and delivery of critical items of equipment in the amount of\n            US $10.1 million under component two, utilization of\n            approximately US $5.0 million in uncommitted funds, and the\n            provision of critical technical assistance for energy sector\n            reform and the Central Asia-South Asia electricity\n            transmission project (CASA-1000)."}, "docdt": "2012-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
