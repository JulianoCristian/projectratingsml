strengthening key sectoral institutions.  It will help to\n            improve the quality of and increase access to primary\n            education by: (i) upgrading teaching in schools; (ii)\n            increasing the availability of good quality textbooks and\n            teaching materials; (iii) increasing the number of primary\n            school classrooms; (iv) improving students' health and\n            nutritional status; and (v) promoting female participation\n            in education.  It will improve the quality of general\n            secondary education by:  (i) upgrading the skills of\n            teachers; (ii) strengthening the Secondary School\n            Inspectorate; and (iii) increasing the availability of\n            low-cost textbooks and teaching materials.  It will\n            strengthen key sectoral institutions by providing support to\n            the Ministries of Basic Education and Mass Literacy and\n            Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research to\n            further strengthen their capacity for policy formulation and\n            implementation and to improve their operational efficiency.\n            The project also includes key policy measures to: (a)\n            improve the allocation and increase efficiency in the use of\n            sector resources; and (b) promote private initiatives in the\n            provision of education through incentives for establishing\n            and operating private and community schools."}, "docdt": "1991-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
