MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BURKINA FASO
FOR A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed development credit to Burkina
Faso for an equivalent of US$24.0 million equivalent on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to
help finance the fourth education project. Cofinancing, totalling US$19.8 million equivalent, would be
provided by the Kingdom of Norway, the Canadian International Development Agency, and the European
Community.
2.        Backgromnd. Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world. Further development
of the economy is constrained by underdeveloped human resources, a limited endowment of physical
resources, and difficult climatic conditions. In 1990, the estimated GDP per capita was US$320, and the adult
literacy rate was estimated at 13%, the lowest in the Sahel. Human resources development is adversely
affected by low and inequitable access to prmay education, the poor quality of education, low external
efficiency of higher education and training, financial and budgetary constraints, and weak planning and
management of education.
3.        Although the primary enrollment rate in Burkina doubled between 1975 and 1989, from about
15% to 31%, it remains substantially lower than the average for the Sahel (52%) and for Sub-Saharan Africa
(77%). Primary enrollment also varies greatly among provinces - ranging from 88% tD 6%, and by gender
- 37% for boys and 23% for girls. The average number of pupil years per graduate s 1S, and only 45%
obtain the primary school certificate. The poor quality of primary education is attributable to the high
proportionof unqualified teachers (25%), scarcity of teaching materials and textbooks, insufficientpedagogical
support and control, and inadequate student assessment systems. Poor nutritional and health status of students
firther affects access to and the quality of education. Student retention in secondary education is high, but
only 30% pass the "Baccalauret" examination. Unemployment among secondary and higher education
graduates is growing.
4.        Further development of primary education is hampered by financial and budgetary constraints.
The public per pupil costs of education are high as a result of high average teacher salaries at the primary level
(13 times GNP per capita, compared to an average of 8 times GNP per capita for the Sahel); at the same time,
student subsidies in secondary and higher education (11.8 times GNP per capita) are the highest in the Sahel.
Furtermore, ceilings on private gchool fees, which are fixed at unrealistically low levels, limit the creation
of new school places. The Government has initiated steps to address these issues.
5.        Rationale for IDA's involvement. 'Te Bank Group's strategy supports the high priority given
by the Government to the development of human resources because of its key role in helping to develop the
countrys' scarce natral resources. In the education sector, because of the low primary school enrollment
ratio, emphasis wil continue to be on expanding and improving the quality of primary education to raise the
general educational level of the population and thereby their productivity, and to facilitate the Introduction of
improved technologies. Support for post-primary education would aim to improve the quality of general
secondary and higher eduwation, and design and implement good quality, low-cost training programs to meet
basic techniAl sldil requirements. Given the financial constraints and inefficiencies that inhibit orderly and
sustned development of the education sector, IDA would assist the Government in introducing policy



-2 -
measures to reform the sector, including increasing resources for primary education and improving
effectiveness in the use of those resources, limiting expenditures on secondary and higher education student
subsidies, and promoting private initiatives in the provision of education. The project would thus complement
corresponding efforts being made at the macroeconomic level.
6.        The ongoing IDA-financed Primary Education Development Project is helping the Government
to achieve major efficiency gains and is contributing to a significant expansion of enrollment in primay
edu.ation. The project is expected to be closed by July 1992, as scheduled. Following a difficult start-up
period (up to 1988) caused by indecision on the part of the Government, implementation is now proceeding
at a steady pace. All major contracts for civil works, materials, textbooks, furniture and equipment have been
awarded. About 75% of the available funds have been committed; similarly, disbursement rates, which have
lagged behind commitments (due in part to an estimated 37% increase in the US dollar value of the SDR credit
amount) are now back on track. Prospects for further improvement and expansion of the scope of educational
reforms have firmed up following discussion of recendy completed sectoral analyses and investment priorities
among the Government, IDA and other donors. As the major donor assisting the Government in developing
the education sector, IDA should take the lead in organizing support for the Government's stepped-up human
resource development efforts.
7.        Priect gbiectiye. Ihe project would assist the Government in further improving the quality of
primary education and increasing the enrollment ratio from 31 % in 1989/90 to 40% by 1996/97; improving
the quality of general secondary education; and strengthening key sectoral institutions.
8.        Pjroect descri2ign. To achieve these objectives, the project would support the implementaion
of an investment program and related policy measures. The ineget =gm would fiace investments
to: (a) improve the qualitv of and inca  access la pim    education by (i) improving the quality of
teahing in schools through upgrading the skills of about 4,000 untrained teachers, strengheing primary
school management and teacher support by training 2,000 school directors and 200 inspectors, and
restuctring the student assessment system; (iI) increasing the availaiity of textbooks and teaching mateWials
through completing the publishing program started under the Primary Education Development Project,
improving the quality of textbooks, and introducing a textbook rental scheme; (iii) ncreasing the number of
primary school classrooms through Improving the skills of communities to build low-cost primary schools,
and helping to rehabilitate about 300 classrooms and construct about 1,200 classrooms; (iv) improving
students' health and nutritional status through reinforcing nutrition/health education in school programs and
providing micro-nutrients and deworming tablets to students; and (v) promoting female participation in
education; (b) improve the quality of general secondary education by (i) strengthening the National stitute
for the Science of Education with equipment and materials; (ii) upgrading the skills of about 2,000 teachers;
(iii) providing training and logistical support for the secondary school inspectorate; and (v) ensuring a reguar
supply of low-cost textbooks and teaching materials by establishing textbook loan schemes in schools; and
(c) strengthen Ine sectoral institutions by providing support to the Ministries of Basic Education and Mus
Literacy and of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research to firther strengthen their capacity
for policy formulation and inmlementation and to improve their operational efficiency.
9.        The siuymres supported by the project aim to: (a) improve the allocation an4 increas
deien   In the u  gf WM rsuc  by (i) increasing the primary education budget by the amount required
(estimated at 8.5% annually in nominal terms, assuming the level and structure of teacher salaries do not
dcange) to recruit about 950 teachers annually and finance materis and other operating costs to increase the
enrollmt ratio to 40% by 1996/97; (ii) introducing and generalizing multigrade teaching in a minimum of
840 classrooms over the project period, ad inroducing doublehift teahing in a minimum of 590 classrooms
over the project period; during the September 1994 mid-term review, the results of an evaluation of the
double-shift system will be discussed, and the outcome of these discussions taken into account in the further



-3 -
implementation and generalization of the double-shift program; and (Mi) reducing secondary and higher
educaton subsidies by 5% in 1991/92 and by 10% annually in nominal ternms from 1992/93 to 1996/97; and
(b) prmote private initiatives in the provision of eduCtion by (i) taking measures to encourage the
establishment and operation of private and community schools, including Madarassas, and to create an
environment more conducive to the rapid expansion of other private initiatives in education; and (ii)
establishing guidelines for the operation of these schools and providing them with easy access to teacher
training, low-cost textbooks, teacher guides and inspectorate services to help maintain minimum levels of
quality and standards.
10. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$46.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$32.0 million (70%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedul
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of the Bank Group Operations in Burkina Faso are given in Schedules
C an D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9119-BUR, dated April24, 1991, are also
attached.
11.  Aor         . The Government has agreed that it will, according to the agreed calendar: (a) increase
the teaching cadre by recruiting about 950 teachers annually during the project period; allocate a minimum
of 6% of the primary education budget to finance teaching materials, textbooks, and other non-salary
expenditures; allocate an agreed amount for financing the operating costs of inspectors; and increase the
primary education budget by the amount required to finance the above items, estimated at 8.5% anmually in
nominal terms; (b) introduce and generalize multigrade teaching in a minimum of 840 classrooms over the
project period; and intrwduce double-shift teaching with one teacher for two cohorts of about 55 pupils each
in a minimum of 590 classrooms over the same period; (c) reduce expenditures on secondary and higher
education studentsubsidies by 5% in 1991/92, and 10% annually between 1992/93-1996/97; (d) by December
31, 1991, announce its decision with respect to the lifting of ceilings on fees charged by schools run by
individuals, private groups, and communities; establish guidelines for the operation of these schools; and
facilitate their access to teacher training, textbooks, teacher guides, and inspectorate services to help maintain
minimum levels of quality and standards; (e) submit to IDA for review the draft rules governing the
standardized student assessment in Grade 3 and the improved examination combining certification of
completion of primary education and entry into secondary school and, based on agreements reached following
the review, approve these regulations and being implementing; (t) introduce a book rental scheme in primary
schools; (g) select the communities to be included in the school construction program in accordance with the
agreed crieria (h) complete the studies on constraints to female participation in education, and discuss and
implement the agreed recommendations; (i) submit a detailed plan for the establishment and operation of a
textbook loan scheme for secondary schools, including a revolving fund for textbook re-supply, and implement
the plan as agreed; O) complete the study on vocational education and training, and discuss the conclusions
of the study with IDA; (k) continue to staff the Education Project Directorate with personnel with experence
and qualifications acceptable to IDA; Q) undertake with IDA annual reviews of the progress of project
implementation as well as a mid-term project evaluation; and (m) submit to IDA annual audit reports as
agreed.  ondiions gf ceit effeiveness would be: (a) submission of a plan, acceptable to IDA, for the
establishment and operation of the textbook rental scheme for primary schools, starting in school year
1991/92, including operation of the Textbook Fund, arrangements for the collection, safekeeping and use of
the fees collected, and the Government's contribution to 1ie Fund to cover book replacements; (b) submission
to IDA of the findings of two studies concerning, respectively, the establishment and operation of schools run
by individuals, private groups, and communities, and the proposed liberalization of fees charged by these
schools; and raise the ceiling applicable to such fees by not less than 10% as of school year 1991/92; and (c)
the establishment of an accounting system adapted to meet the specific requirements of the project, and
selection of an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA.



12.  Benef. The project would assist in further developing human resources in Burkina Faso by increasing
the level of basic education in the country, thus improving the overall quality of the labor force. At the
primary level, the project would increase the primary school enrollment ratio from 31% in 1989190 to 40%
in 1996/97 by creating about 200,000 additional school places. This would Imply a rapid increase in student
enro1lment from 470,000 in 1989/90 to about 80,000 in 1996 and I million in 2000. Introduction of
multigrade and double-shift teaching would increase student enrollment by about 62,000 over the project
period and 24,000 annually thereafter, lower the per pupil costs of education, yielding total cost savings over
the project period of about CFAF 774 million (US$3.0 million) and CFAF 313 million (US$1.2 million)
annually, and increase access to education in sparsely populated and utban areas. Quality Improvement in
secondary education would help meet middle-level skill requirements by improving the employability and
trainability of secondary school graduates. Reduction of student subsidies, including fellowships, in secondary
and higher education would save about CFAF 3,000 million (US$11.5 million equivalent), over the project
period, which could be applied toward improving the quality and quantity of education inputs. Targeting of
fellowsbips would help direct students to priority areas and reduce overcrowding in some areas. Incentives
to promote private and community schools would help increase resources for the sector, Improve their
utilization, and thereby help alleviate constraints on the expansion of education. In addition, efforts to
improve knowledge and awareness of issues related to health, nutrition, population, and the environment, as
well as to increase female participation in the education system would have a broad positive Impact on the
society as whole. The project would also help strengthen the institutional famework for effective policy
development and implementation in the education sector.
13. R.iLk. One major risk concerns difficulties the Government may face in meeting the conditions to
increase budgetary allocations for primary education and reduce student subsidies. This risk is miigated by
the Governent's consensus-building approach to policy changes through wide-ranging consultations; and
initial steps towards that goal have proven successful. There is now widespread support for increasing
allocations in favor of primary education, which have been increased in the 1991 budget. The Government
has also taken steps to limit the number of new fellowships awarded for higher education, which have been
markedly reduced in recent years. The Government's performance in meeting these budgetary conditions
would be monitored during the annual reviews of project implementation, and under the PFP and the SAL.
A second risk concerns the ability of communities to contribute the required 10% of school construction costs
in cash or in kind. This risk is expected to be minimal, judging from the experience of the Primary Education
Development Project, where communities were effectively mobilized to contribute materials and labor to
school construction. This risk woud be furlher mitigated through greater decentralization of the responsibility
for the establishment and operation of schools to the Provincial Directorates. Furthermore, Burkina Faso has
a strong tradition of successful community participation in similar construction works.
14.  R     nd      . I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Association, and recommend thtat the Executive Directors approve it.
