formal primary education and mobilize\n            more resources for primary education. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower are rated satisfactory as well. The project is\n            likely to be sustained. Lessons for future projects include:\n            The Government should early on develop a comprehensive\n            policy framework for an effective intervention of all donors\n            in the subsector. To guide implementation and build\n            momentum, reasonably detailed implementation arrangements\n            covering the first year should be developed before the\n            project becomes effective. Faster development of primary\n            education is constrained by high education unit costs and\n            inefficient resource use and allocation. To address this\n            issue, the government is considering recruiting more\n            teachers at lower salary, developing low-cost pedagogical\n            materials, reducing grade repetition, and increasing the\n            share of basic education in the total education budget. The\n            government has to develop a demand-side approach to overcome\n            resistance to schooling since merely providing access to\n            school is not enough to increase enrollment. Standardized\n            assessment of student learning should be made available. It\n            would be more efficient to engage small, private, local\n            contractors; and to delegate more responsibility to local\n            communities to do the work themselves or contract it to\n            local artisans and entrepreneurs."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
