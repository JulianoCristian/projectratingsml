The main objectives of the ADP were to help\n            newly-emerged private farmers and to enhance ongoing\n            privatization of agriculture, the agro-processing and,\n            forest industries through fnancial and technical assistance.\n            Banks performance was highly satisafactoy. Borrowers\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) ownership of a project by the borrower\n            is an essential element for a successful outcome and\n            frequent changes of government made building local ownership\n            difficult; (ii) effective and frequent supervision by the\n            Bank and the Government of a loan is very important,\n            particularly in a new client country with limited project\n            management experiences; (iii) a credit line operating in a\n            transition economy must be accompanied by complementary\n            reforms, in land titling, development of collateral, farm\n            investment, production and marketing information; (iv) it is\n            possible to create an effective development finance\n            institution that can fill an existing void in a\n            nation's financial system; and (v) a project should\n            have multiple Participating Financial Institutions (PFI) to\n            create competition among banks, and provide a wider access\n            to credit by clients."}, "docdt": "1998-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
