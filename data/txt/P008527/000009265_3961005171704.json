The main components of the project are:\n            (a) farm credit for on-farm production and development. A\n            financing company, the Agricultural Finance Company (AFC) is\n            being established to identify investment opportunities,\n            appraise viability, assess credit-worthiness, and channel\n            funds to individual sub-borrowers; (b) support for private\n            small and medium scale agro- and forest-industries through\n            long-term investment funds. Priority will be given to\n            commercial viability, export potential, and management\n            capacity; and (c) technical assistance support for sector\n            reform program including development of human and\n            institutional skills necessary for a market economy through\n            support for agricultural advisory services, training of\n            technicians, managers, and workers/farmers and strengthening\n            of market information, land survey, registration and titling services."}, "docdt": "1993-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
