Backing Entrepreneurs in Latvia                                                                              July 1, 2002
                       Agris Smelteris employs 28 people in a small business that makes plastic window frames.  He also
                       runs a cafÃ© and two shops.  What makes him unusual is that he lives in the Latvian countryside,
                       where he is one of a growing number of farmers whose entrepreneurial flair is changing the way of life
                       for people in rural areas.

                          In the absence of any private sector interest, the Agricultural Finance Company (AFC) was set up in
                          1993 with support from the World Bank.  Its credit officers took financial services to the farmersâ€”an
                          approach that helped overcome farmersâ€™ lack of transportation. The success of the AFC was
impressive.  In its first five years, with just 42 staff, it approved some 2,860 loans for a total of $43 million.  Repayment
performance was high, and it remains at over 90 percent.  The AFC helped establish a rural financial system based on
commercial lending terms, and conditions that were later adopted by commercial banks.
