or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: client ownership and strong strategic leadership\n            on the beneficiary side is a key to success of institutional\n            development projects. Continuity of the core team working on\n            the project, both from the Bank side and the government\n            side, is very important for the success of a project. While\n            designing the project, wider involvement of counterparts\n            involved in management of public finances should be ensured\n            in order to explore various available options for a good\n            project. It is essential to pay close attention at the\n            design stage to the political economy context of the\n            country. Simple design and focus on the core functionality\n            of the treasury system are highly appropriate for initial\n            stage of implementation of public Financial Management\n            Information Systems (FMIS). Frequent changes in legislation\n            will adversely affect the momentum of implementation of any\n            project that supports automation of procedures derived from\n            that legislation. Very close monitoring of procurement\n            process by the project team and quick reaction to each\n            potential problem or bottleneck with finding appropriate and\n            mutually acceptable solution, will work strongly for the\n            smooth implementation of the project and its overall success."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
