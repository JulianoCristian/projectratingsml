                                              Restructuring Paper
                         (for Closing Date Extension and Reallocation of Proceeds only)



1.       The Closing Date for Russian Federation, Treasury Development Project, Loan No. 4662-RU, P064508
will be extended from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2012. This would be the third such extension of Closing
Date (the original Closing Date was December 31, 2007).
2.       The policy and institutional reforms associated with the formation of a Treasury (the first development
objective) have been mostly completed by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Federal Treasury (FT). Remaining
changes in the legal and regulatory framework are expected to be completed in 2011. The training component is
substantially completed (nearly 20,000 MoF/FT staff trained so far). At the present stage of the project, the
technical infrastructure required for implementing new Treasury System (FTAS) capabilities is being rolled out
across the country (the second development objective). FTAS was developed as the core budget execution
system installed in 83 regions, to capture all government expenditures and revenues through a Treasury Single
Account (TSA) system. FTAS functional modules support the registration of budget data, cash management,
commitment control, payments and receipts management, general ledger accounting, and budget reporting. As of
November 2010, the new system has been successfully implemented at 21 (out of 83) regions, and the oblast
treasury offices and associated rayon offices have fully transitioned to the new FTAS for their day to day
operations. All preparatory work (related with Engineering Support System (ESS) installations and Departmental
Transport Network (DTN) connections) is completed and currently, there is no technical infrastructure constraint
to the remaining part of the roll-out. In view of the progress in carrying out the project activities, the team has
rated the latest project implementation progress as Satisfactory. The task team is of the view that the project
objectives continue to be achievable.
3.       The proposed extension is necessary to:
     a) complete the ongoing FTAS roll-out in all 83 regions, including the largest regions/cities in the country,
        such as Moscow and St. Petersburg (the Bank's experience in similar projects in many other countries
        would help the FT in overcoming challenges that are likely to come up in these specific
        implementations); and
     b) ensure the successful completion of ongoing/remaining contracts for FTAS implementation over the
        course of the next 18 months (with remaining commitments worth about $100m, the Bank's continued
        supervision of FTAS implementation would help ensure that the elements of the ICT infrastructure are
        implemented smoothly and FTAS becomes fully functional by project end).
4.       The TDP is significantly different from similar Bank projects in other countries in terms of the scale and
complexity of implementation. The FTAS is expected to support 30,000 active users in 83 regions spread across
11 time zones (3 satellite zones). In addition, the regional and local governments (nearly 330,000 spending units)
will also use FTAS to process payment requests to ensure that these payments are made through similar systems
established for their respective areas. The total number of transactions processed each day through the system
would be several millions. Digital signature is used extensively in treasury operations since 2005. The FT
Certificate Authority (CA) center has issued more than 1.3 million certificates of digital signatures so far
(currently, more than 420,000 certificates are valid). Therefore, the Bank's technical support is strategically
important to assist in proper management of this huge transformation process in PFM systems and cultural
changes in the MoF/FT organization. In such an exceptional project, Closing Date extensions can be acceptable,
considering the challenges faced and resolved so far.
5.       The performance of the MoF (Borrower) and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory. The
Borrower has prepared an action plan, including revised FTAS roll-out plan, procurement plan and disbursement
estimate, acceptable to the Bank, in order to complete the project. There are no overdue or qualified audit
reports.
                                                       1
6.      This will be the third extension of the Closing Date of the project. The first extension was granted on
July 14, 2006, to extend the Closing Date until December 31, 2009. Following the mid-term review, the Bank
indicated that it would consider a further extension of Closing Date to December 31, 2010, subject to satisfactory
completion of the pilot implementation. The Bank agreed to a second extension of Closing Date to December 31,
2010, following the successful completion of pilot implementation (on October 30, 2009). Details of previous
extensions can be found in the justification memo.
7.      In addition, the Borrower has requested a reallocation of the proceeds of the Loan. As a result of such a
request, the Loan proceeds for Russian Federation, Treasury Development Project, Loan No. 4662-RU,
P064508 will be reallocated as follow:
   Category of Expenditure              Allocation (USD)                         % of Financing

8.       Most of the TDP procurement (92%) was performed through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
packages. The FT has saved about $70m (after amendments) during project implementation due to competitive
prices obtained in these ICB contracts (mainly for FTAS Application Software and main servers), and new ICB
packages were included in the revised Procurement Plan (PP) to cover additional needs in Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and for the expansion of FTAS capabilities. During the last
visit in October 2010, the team was informed by the FT officials about the need for reallocation of funds from
"Unallocated" to other loan disbursement categories due to the changes in revised PP. The team is of the view
that the proposed reallocation is necessary to complete remaining activities and expand the scope of FTAS
implementation as proposed in the revised procurement plan.
