The\n            extension is necessary to complete the ongoing Treasury\n            System (FTAS) roll-out in all 83 regions, including the\n            largest regions/cities in the country, such as Moscow and\n            St. Petersburg (the Bank's experience in similar\n            projects in many other countries would help the Federal\n            Treasury (FT) in overcoming challenges that are likely to\n            come up in these specific implementations); and ensure the\n            successful completion of ongoing/remaining contracts for\n            FTAS implementation over the course of the next 18 months\n            (with remaining commitments worth about $100m, the\n            Bank's continued supervision of FTAS implementation\n            will help ensure that the elements of the Information and\n            Communication (ICT) infrastructure are implemented smoothly\n            and FTAS becomes fully functional by project end).
