INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO GUYANA
FOR A LIVESTOCX PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$2.2
million to Guyana to assist in the financing of a livestock project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the first made by the Bank Group
for the development of a modern livestock industry in Guyana. An economic
mission, which visited Guyana at the end of 1966, identified a potential
for developing a beef cattle industry. An FAO livestock reconnaissance
mission in mid-1968 was followed by two Association missions in the first
half of 1969, which assisted the Government in developing the scope of the
project. A Government Livestock Preparation Commission, headed by an ex-
perienced livestock consultant engaged by Government, prepared the project
during the second half of 1969. The project was submitted to the Asseciaticn
in December 1969 and appraised in February/IHarch 1970.
3.        Negotiations for the prcposed credit were held from October 12
to 16, 1970. Mhe Government of Guyana team at these negotiations was
headed by Mir. Frank Noel, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and
Niatural Resources, and included Mr. Winston King, Chief Planning Officer,
Ministry of Economic Development, and Mir. H. Parris, Chief Economist, Bank
of Guyana.
4.        The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's third lending
operation in Guyana since independence in 1966, and would increase the
Group's total lending to US$13.0 million. The following is a summary of
Bank loans and IDA credits to Guyana as at October 31, 1970:

5.        Following an initial delay in the selection of the consultants
and thereafter in the letting out of contracts because of higher than
anticipated quotations, the sea defence project is now progressing satis-
factorily. The final designs of the main buildings included in the
education project have been completed and the project is progressing
roughly on schedule. A number of new projects are in various stages of
preparation and consideration. The feasibility study of a scheme to
protect Georgetown from cyclical erosion attack is currently being reviewed
by the Government, and appraisal should take place early next year. Pro-
jects are also under preparation in the power and highway sectors.
6.        There has been no IFC operation in Guyana to date.
1/ Net of cancellations, since the loan was for US$1.25
million. It was guaranteed by the United Kiungdom.

Return:              20 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Beef Cattle Project, Guyana"
(PA-61a) is attached. The proposed project would assist Guyana in deve-
loping a modern and efficient beef cattle industry, and add a promising
agricultural commodity to its two basic agricultural products, sugar and
rice. Guyana has considerable land resources suitable for the establish-
ment of such an industry, particularly in relation to the Caribbean
countries which, jointly with Guyana, are members of the Caribbean Free
Trade Area (CARIFTA).  The most promising areas for beef production in
Guyana are located immediately south of the sugar/rice coastal belt in
the East Demerara and Beibice/Corentyne areas and in the Rupununi savannas
in Southern Guyana where there are some extensive cattle ranches. What
have so far been lacking for the development of the livestock potential
have been expertise in modern ranching and animal husbandry techniques,
commercialized ranching units and the legal and institutional framework
necessary for channelling financial resources into the sector.



-a -
9.        The project consists of:
(a) the development of approximately 25 ranches, mainly
cooperative but also, possibly company and private ranches;
of these, 15 ranches, each with about 10,000 acres and
2800 head of cattle, would be in the coastal areas; in the
IRupununi savannas, 10 ranches, each with about 64,000 acres
and 1200 head of cattle, would be commercial and Amerindian
tribal ranches.
(b) the development of two ranches belonging to the Livestock
Development Company (LDCo) - a new commercial enterprise
with majority government holding; one is a 20,000-acre
ranch at M4ara in the coastal area with about 3000 head
and a small breeding herd and the other, a 200,000-acre
ranch at St. Ignatius in the Rupununi with about 3000 head;
(c) equipment for chain clearance of grazing lands on coastal
ranches;
(d) developmental studies, including technical, marketing and
processing studies and pilot studies for pasture establish-
ment with tropical legumes, animal production trials and
use of urea/molasses supplements; and
(e) technical services for project implementation.
10.       The cost of the project is estimated at approximately US$4.4
million (including working capital). The proposed credit of US$2.2 million
would finance 50 percent of this cost and would cover the foreign component
of the project, estimated at about US$1.8 million, and local currency
expenditure of about US$400,000 equivalent. This amount of local currency
financing is justified in view of the broad project and sector objectives
which the proposed credit is intended to achieve and of the substantial
local contribution (noted in paragraph 12 below) that would be made for
on-farm investments.  Although the project is small by Bank Group standards,
it would cover about 60,000 animals, which is a little over 25 percent of
Guyana's cattle population.
11.       An important feature of the project is the grouping of small
coastal cattle owners into commercial ranching enterprises. During
project preparation, a number of these owners have recognized that it
would be in their interest to transfer their cattle as equity to enter-
prises that they would cooperatively own, ranch them on new land that the
Government would make available and employ professional ranch management.
A few cooperatives have already been formed and others await the approval
of the proposed credit. Such cooperative ranches would have the character
of company ranches since the ranching activities would be managed profes-
sionally and not by members of the cooperative. Suitable rules for the



organization and running of these cooperative ranches have been agreed w.;,
the Association. The Government has agreed to change its present practica
of extending annual or short-term leases, and instead grant 25-year trans-
ferable and renewable leases for ranches participating in the project. To
facilitate an expeditious grant of leases of large tracts of land, the Govern-
ment is presently taking action to amend the survey legislation to enable
granting of leases on the basis of aerial mapping instead of the time-
consuming method of ground surveying.
12.       The financing provided for ranch development would cover pastura
establishment and improvement, fencing, water supplies, buildings, livestoek;
agricultural machinery and equipment. The small scale of individual invest-
ments and the great variety of items to be procured in small lots, make
international competitive bidding impractical.  Therefore, procurement w   .out!
essentially be through existing commercial channels in the country. Compe--
tition is keen and servicing adequate. Financing from the proposed credit
would be used to cover 60 percent of the on-ranch investment, while the
participating commercial banks would provide 20 percent, as would partici-
pating ranchers through contributions in cash and kind. All six commercial
banks now existing in Guyana (5 branches of foreign banks and the new Nationfal
Cooperative Bank) have been invited to participate by providing the long-;S"
financing for ranch development (12 years including 4 years of grace).   Th'63
banks would also provide short-term financing for working capital, incluci-tn-
financing for herd build-up in the early stages of ranch development. CoIm-
mercial banks, which have so far provided long-term agricultural credit in
Guyana mainly to sugar interests, would for the first time provide such c.rs;-t
generally for agriculture and livestock.  The Association has assisted in
developing an appropriate draft chattel mortgage law to provide a suitable
basis for the commercial banks to lend to the livestock sector. Governmenit
contributions will consist of financing part of the assets of LDCo and the
local costs of technical services and developmental studies. In all, the
Government would cover 14 percent of the total project cost, commercial
banks 18 percent and ranchers 18 percent, and the Association 50 percent.
13.       The Bank of Guyana, the central bank, will act as the trustee of
the Government for channelling the funds from the proposed credit through
participating banks to the ranchers and a land clearing contractor. The
Government would establish a Livestock Development Fund (LDF) in the Bank
of Guyana. The ranch plans would be developed and their implementation
supervised by the Livestock Projects Division (LPD), also located in that
Bank.  The LPD would be headed by an experienced and qualified livestock
specialist as Project Director and would include experienced technical art
administrative deputies and other suitable staff. The ranch plans developed
and approved by the Project Director, would be reviewed and recommended to
the participating banks by a Project Executive Committee consisting of a
reuresentative of the Agriculture Ministry as Chairman, a representative cach
of the Bank of Guyana and the Economic Development Ministry, and the Project,
Director. The overall policy aspects of the project would fall within the
purview of a national Livestock Advisory Committee headed by the Governor
of the Bank of Guyana.



14.       The ranch plans approved by the Project Director and recommended by
the Project Executive Committee would be financed through the participating
bank chosen by the rancher. The chain clearance contractor, selected by this
Committee, would also be financed through the participating bank of the con-
tractor's choice. The sub-loans to ranchles would ordinarily be for 12 years,
including 4 years of grace.  That to the selected clearing contractor would
be for 5 years with no grace. The participating banks would carry the full
credit risk involved in sub-loans, except for those given to Amerindian tribal
ranches. Because of the character of the tribal property, the Amerindian
ranches cannot be used to secure these sub-loans, and hence, the Government
has agreed to guarantee them. All sub-loans for ranch development would ca;
a 9-1/2 percent rate of interest. This is acceptable in the night of the
general price stability and prevailing interest rates in Guyana. Out of the
9-1/2 percent, one-half of one percent would be used to help meet the cost or
the LPD.  The participating banks would get 3 percent to cover their adminis-
trative charges and full credit risks for all sub-loans, except those to
Amerindian ranches. Since Government would guarantee sub-loans made to
Amerindian ranches, the participating banks would get only 1 percent towards
administrative and service costs. The sub-loan to the clearance contractor
would be at a 9 percent rate of interest.   The participating bank involved
would get 3 percent to cover the administrative costs and credit risk. S!nr,O
hardly any service would be required from the LPD, the one-half of one perc n.c
charge towards the LPD costs would not be payable in the case of this sub-
loan. The participating banks would obtain financing from the LDF for 75
percent of all their sub-loans at 6 percent interest per annum, except on
financing obtained in respect of sub-loans for Amerindian ranches, where
interest would be at 8 percent. The Government would carry the foreign
exchange risk. Repayments to LDF would be based on repayments of the sub-
loans to the participating banks.
15.       At full development in the eleventh year, the value of the annual
beef production resulting from the project would reach over US$1.0 million
or about 45 percen-t of present production. At that time the project would
enable Guyana to reduce its beef imports by about US$1.0 million at com-
petitive price levels. Thus, in the long run Guyana should become a beef
exporter. The estimated rate of return of the project to the economy would
be about 20 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL ISTRUIIE1TS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Guyana and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
Bank of Guyana, the Recommendation of the Committee provided f6r in Article
V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the
text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.



- 7 -
17.       The draft Development Credit and Project Agreements conform
substantially to the pattern of agreements for livestock projects. The
following provisions are of special interest:
Section 8:01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement: The enactment of
the necessary legislation and resolutions, the effective establishment of
the Livestock Development Corporation and of the LDF and the LPD -with a
Project Director, are conditions of making the proposed credit effective.
Schedule 1 of the draft Project Agreement: Sets forth the basis for
making all sub-loans under the project.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       The economic report on "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Guyana",  Volumes I and II (No. CA-4a dated October 1, 1970) was circu-
lated to the Executive Directors on October 30, 1970. A basic data sheet
is annexed. The report concludes that Guyana has achieved a substantial
pace of economic growth in the last five years, almost 5 percent per annu'n
in real terms, in combination with reasonably sound financial policies.
During this period public savings have risen and the balance of payments
has been strengthened. IJith the prospects for continued substantial levels
of external assistance, the outlook for future growth is reasonably good.
The external debt service ratio is about 4 percent. However, Guyana has
limited natural resources and uncertain export prospects, and taking into
account the relatively low per capita income, there is a continued need
for external assistance on concessional terms.
19.       As a result of various tax measures introduced in 1970 and the
termination of tax holidays on past bauxite mining investments, government
revenues are expected to increase substantially in 1971. At the same time,
a newly-created social security system is expected to generate sizeable
savings which will be available for public sector investments. With the
Government's intention to keep non-development expenditures in check - which
should be relatively easier to do now that understandings have been reached
with Venezuela and Surinam on border disputes - the prospects are for
significant increases in public sector savings. These fiscal prospects over
the next few years should permit a significant increase in public investment,
without detriment to the external balance of payments. A new development
plan is currently under preparation. It is likely to propose, as did the
recent Bank economic mission, a much higher public investment effort than
in the past. While administrative constraints will probably set a ceiling
on the Government's development expenditures, a gradual improvement in the
planning and executing capacity of the relevant ministries is anticipated.

PART VI - CNiPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOIIIMNDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
