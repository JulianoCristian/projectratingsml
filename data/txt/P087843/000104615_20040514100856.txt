A.2. Project Objectives 
 
This technical assistance project aims to increase the capacity of government and non-
governmental institutions responsible for the national response to HIV/AIDS to utilize 
and assess the impact of funds received for HIV/AIDS.
 
 
The project would achieve its objectives through (a) increasing the capacity of the 
executing agency for the Lesotho national HIV/AIDS program, which is currently 
LAPCA, or LAPCA’s future version as Secretariat of the proposed National HIV/AIDS 
Commission, to coordinate and monitor and evaluate the national response to HIV/AIDS 
and fulfill its role as sub-recipient of Global Fund resources for public sector and civil 
society implementation ; (b) increasing the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social 
Welfare to provide access to quality care and treatment to those infected by HIV/AIDS 
and fulfill its role as sub-recipient of the Global Fund resources; and (c) strengthening 
and mobilize the latent capacity for implementation of interventions in Lesotho and 
supporting implementing agencies to properly implement the national program using 
Global Fund and other resources.

A.3. Project Description 
This project is designed to complement the use of Global Fund approved resources in 
Lesotho through provision of technical assistance and institutional capacity building 
activities.   The project is supporting the implementation of the national AIDS program to 
control the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigate its impact on vulnerable groups, 
individuals, families, communities and the nation as whole.  The Global Fund support to 
Lesotho is aimed at supporting the scaling up of specific interventions for preventions, 
care, treatment and impact mitigation, including the expansion of training and education, 
provision of basic care to those infected and affected by the epidemic,  home based care, 
community mobilization, and promoting civil society and public-private partnerships in 
the fight against HIV/AIDS.   In furtherance of its objective, the project will have the 
following components : 
 
Component I: Support to the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning  (MOFDP):
 
 
This component of the project will focus on supporting the MOFDP to discharge its 
fiduciary and program management responsibilities.  The project will specifically finance 
technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Coordination Office in the Ministry 
so that it perform its oversight role under the Global Fund grant agreement.  The Ministry 
will be supported to fulfill its accountability function with regards to the money disbursed 
to the sub-recipients through the same technical assistance and by providing it with 
computers and equipment.   
 
Component II: Support to Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) :  This 
component of the project will provide support to the MOHSW through two sub-
components : Sub-component A will finance technical assistance support to the central 
Ministry of Health and Sub-component B will focus on enabling the National Drugs and 
Supplies Organization (NDSO) to fulfill its role for procuring and distributing  health 
sector goods.   
 
Component III: Support to Secretariat of the National HIV/AIDS Program :  The project will specifically 
finance the following: (i) engagement of a firm to generate and manage proposals submitted for funding 
through LAPCA, strengthen the District AIDS Coordinators and the District AIDS Task Forces through 
regular training activities, monitor implementation by the civil society, private and public sector grant-
recipients and ensure that appropriate fiduciary safeguards and procedures are in place without constraining 
implementation, (ii)  provide assistance to develop community based monitoring and evaluation capacity 
for implementers at the district and sub-district levels, and (iii) provide assistance to public sector line 
ministries to develop fund-able proposals for mainstreaming HIV/AIDS and support their implementation. 
 
Component IV: Support for civil society and private sector capacity development for 
HIV/AIDS:   
The project will support capacity building for facilitating and umbrella civil society and 
faith based organizations, traditional institutions and communities to develop proposals,

the GF agreement.  Formal and informal private sector would also be supported to 
increase their capacity to implement HIV/AIDS activities with resources provided 
through the national program.
