B.  Project Objectives 
The development objectives of the proposed project are to (i) increase the capacity of the 
existing executing agency for the Lesotho national HIV/AIDS program, or its replacement as 
secretariat of the proposed National HIV/AIDS Commission, to coordinate and monitor and 
evaluate the national response to HIV/AIDS; (ii) increase the capacity of public sector line 
ministries, private sector organizations, civil society and faith based organizations to mobilize 
funds, design intervention programs and implement activities for prevention, care and impact 
mitigation. 
 
C.  Project Description 
The proposed project will focus on capacity building and technical assistance for 
implementation.  Four project components and their indicative costs are proposed as follows :  
 
Component 1:  Increased capacity for coordination and short term technical assistance ($1.0 
million) :  This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of the Lesotho AIDS 
Prevention and Control Authority as the institution currently mandated to coordinate and monitor 
and evaluate the national response to HIV/AIDS.  The capacity built should be transferable to its 
replacement as secretariat to the National AIDS Commission once the commission becomes 
operational.  The project will build upon on an institutional assessment of LAPCA to be financed 
by DFID and will finance training, workshops, equipments and materials to enable the authority 
or its replacement perform coordinating and M&E function for the national program.  The

capacity of the district AIDS task forces will also be strengthened to improve coordination at the 
district and sub-district levels.  This component of the project will also support the engagement 
of an experienced firm to assist the principal recipients of the Global Funds to prepare 
implementation plans, build the capacity of the implementing agencies, and provide overall 
project administration and reporting for the GF resources. 
 
Component 2 :  Increased capacity for monitoring and evaluation ($0.50 million) :  This 
component will support the development of community based, participatory monitoring and 
evaluation capacity and the development of an overall M&E system for the national program.  
The component will enable implementers at all levels to properly monitor and report on their 
activities as well as to promote learning by doing among all implementing agencies. 
 
Component 3 :  Increased public sector capacity for implementation ($1.5 million) :  This 
component will support the strengthening of implementation capacity among all public sector 
line ministries and agencies to design effective intervention programs, establish adequate 
fiduciary mechanisms and implement the activities financed by partners such as the Global 
Funds and others. 
 
Component 4 :  Increased civil society and private sector capacity for implementation ($2.0 
million) :  This component will support capacity building for facilitating and umbrella civil 
society and faith based organizations, traditional institutions at the community levels and the 
associations of people living with HIV/AIDS.  Formal and informal private sector will also be 
supported to increase their capacity to implement HIV/AIDS activities with resources provided 
through the national program. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
National and district level.
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Borrower has limited capacity for managing safeguard policies.  However, this is a 
Technical Assistance Project and will not directly support implementation.
