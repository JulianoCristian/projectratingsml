1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
Lesotho is among the countries worst affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  With a national 
population of 2.2 million and 330,000 of its adults estimated to be infected with HIV, the country 
is a facing an unprecedented national disaster.  Compared to neighboring countries like South 
Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland who all have similar high HIV/AIDS prevalence, 
Lesotho has limited national financial and human resources to effectively tackle the epidemic, 
which threatens to further undermine its development.    
 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), approved a US $34 
million grant ($29 million for HIV/AIDS and $5 million for tuberculosis) in 2002 for the 
Government of Lesotho to scale up its fight against the HIV/AIDS and TB epidemics over the 
next five years.  The Principal Recipient of the Global Fund resources is the Ministry of Finance 
and the two sub-recipients are LAPCA and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.   
 
In July 2003, Lesotho hosted an extraordinary meeting of SADC on HIV/AIDS, and recent 
approval by the Cabinet of a document titled “ Scaling up the fight against the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic in Lesotho” reflects increased high-level attention needs to be followed up by concrete 
action.  The Cabinet’s approval of the document was accompanied by a decision to create a 
National AIDS Commission that will oversee the national response to HIV/AIDS in Lesotho.  
The Commission is envisioned to comprise appointed Commissioner and four other 
Commissioners elected by their constituents (Youth, Women, Church Groups and People Living 
with HIV/AIDS)  and with an improved LAPCA functioning as Secretariat to the Commission.   
 
2. Objectives 
 
Page  2
 
 
This technical assistance project aims to increase the capacity of government and non-
governmental institutions responsible for the national response to HIV/AIDS to utilize and assess 
the impact of funds received for HIV/AIDS. 
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The Global Fund operates as a financing instrument, not an implementing entity.  The challenge 
facing Lesotho is that of implementation of robust national program with financial resources 
approved by the Global Fund.  The Bank has substantial experience with implementation of 
multi-sector operations and has specifically gained more experience than any other agency in 
implementation of national multi-sector HIV/AIDS programs in Africa.  Thus, the rationale for 
this project is to provide implementation support for HIV/AIDS, complementary to other 
partners that are supporting the Lesotho national response.   
 
4. Description 
 
The proposed project will have four inter-related components : 
 
Component I: Support to the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning  (MOFDP).  This 
component will support the MOFDP to discharge its fiduciary and program management 
responsibilities as principal recipient of the HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis grants from the Global 
Fund.   
 
Component II: Support to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) :  The project 
will support MOHSW to fulfill its role as a sub-recipient of the Global Fund resources for 
implementation of HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis interventions in the health sector.   
 
Component III: Support to Secretariat of the National AIDS Program (LAPCA):  The project 
will finance technical assistance to enable the national program secretariat perform its mandated 
coordination and monitoring and evaluation functions as well as support implementation of 
activities by public sector line ministries, civil society and the private sector in the GF approved 
work plan. 
 
Component IV: Support for civil society and private sector capacity development :  This 
component will support capacity building for facilitating and umbrella civil society and faith 
based organizations, traditional institutions and communities to develop proposals, implement 
such proposals and fulfill the reporting requirements for disbursements under the GF agreement.

6. Implementation 
 
Page  3
 
 
As the project is intended to support the implementation of the Global Fund for HIV, AIDS, 
Malaria and Tuberculosis (GFATM), the project preparation and project implementation will be 
closely coordinated with the Portfolio Manager of the GFATM, members of the CCM (Country 
Coordinating Mechanism) and the LFA (Local Fund Agent, PricewaterhouseCoopers). 
 
The Bank’s supervision of the TAL will effectively act as supervision of the GFATM program in 
Lesotho.  As the GFATM has no capacity to supervise or provide implementation support, the 
Fund and the Bank have been exploring ways to collaborate.  The project is viewed as a potential 
model for this partnership. 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
The project focuses on building the capacity of government institutions, as well as the capacity 
of civil society.  Key project inputs focus on defining the terms of reference for, and establishing 
both the National AIDS Commission Secretariat, the Directorate for HIV/AIDS within the 
MOHSW and the GFATM Unit within the MPFDP.  These new structures within the public 
sector for responding to HIV/AIDS, will be enabled to better absorb and manage significant 
external resources, as well as to demonstrate results.  This is expected to enable to country to 
better attract additional external resources following the Closing Date.   
 
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The project builds upon Bank experience supporting HIV/AIDS in Lesotho
. Under the 
existing Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP), approved in June, 2000, the Bank has worked 
with the MOHSW and LAPCA to make grants available to NGOs to undertake HIV/AIDS 
projects. The Bank, more than any other partner, is aware of the additional capacities required to 
enable LAPCA to better perform this function (as is envisioned under the GFATM program), 
and to coordinate information at the national level. The project has identified needs within civil 
society for additional skills in HIV/AIDS project design, proposal writing, performance 
monitoring and accounting. The HSRP has also supported an assessment of pharmaceutical 
management, the results of which have informed the proposed project. 
 
Implementation experience from national AIDS programs
 in Africa has shown that in those 
countries which have not made progress in reversing the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic the 
main reasons included : (i) the national programs were inadequately financed; (ii) there was 
inadequate government commitment and leadership; (iii) support from governments and the 
international community was too slow, especially for scaling up effective programs, often 
developed by NGOs; (iv) insufficient resources reached communities; and (v) programs were too 
narrowly focused on the health sector. With these lessons at hand, the project adopted the 
following approach :
 
• 
The project is stepping in to strengthen implementation of the national program and 
thereby improve outcomes by ensuring that the GFATM resources are effectively used and 
appropriately accounted for.
 
• 
The project has nurtured a broad based partnership across several donor agencies and 
with civil society organizations and has contributed to the development of consensus on the 
way forward for Lesotho, which is to focus on implementation.

• 
The adoption of a flexible approach to financing NGOs and communities by the GFATM 
is complemented by this project’s effort to strengthen the implementation capacities of the 
NGOs.
 
• 
While the health sector has a normative responsibility and a leadership role to play in 
scaling up access to care and treatment, the national program in Lesotho was built on the 
foundations of multi-sectorality and the project is providing support to the health sector as 
well to all other sectors. 
 
 
Focus on comparative strengths of various partners within the national program
 : The 
Bank is acknowledged to have comparative strength in institutional development and improving 
capacities for fiduciary functions, such as dealing with procurement and financial management. 
In addition, the Bank has been involved in HIV/AIDS in Lesotho for almost two decades and, as 
such, it has institutional memory that may not be available among other partners.  
 
Projects involving multiple implementing agencies 
need implementation arrangements that 
ensure effective coordination of these agencies.  In this regard, the project management and 
coordination arrangements have already been discussed and agreed to ensure better 
understanding of issues to be addressed by the project and of the Bank’s policies and procedures. 
The early agreement on project components and coordination mechanisms will ensure that once 
the project is approved, start-up activities can be implemented without delay.
