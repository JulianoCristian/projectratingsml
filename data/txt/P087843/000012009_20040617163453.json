The first component will support the Ministry of\n            Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) discharge its\n            fiduciary, and program management responsibilities as\n            principal recipient of the HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis grants.\n            The project will finance technical assistance (TA) to\n            strengthen the capacity of the Coordination Office in the\n            MFDP to appropriately perform its oversight role under the\n            grant agreement. Long term TA will be contracted to\n            coordinate and ensure timely submissions, and approval of\n            annual work programs, facilitate disbursement of funds,\n            ensure adequacy of financial controls and audits, and ensure\n            timely reporting on agreed monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators. Support to the Ministry of Health and Social\n            Welfare (MOHSW) is the second component, and involves two\n            sub-components: TA to establish the new HIV/AIDS\n            Directorate, provision of equipment and training to the\n            Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, and, TA to the Procurement\n            Unit; and, medium term TA to enable the National Drugs and\n            Supplies Organization (NDSO) conduct procurement, using\n            international competitive bidding. The third component will\n            finance Consultants to manage proposals submitted for\n            funding, strengthen the District AIDS Coordinators and Task\n            Forces, through training activities, and implement\n            monitoring and evaluation activities. Finally, the fourth\n            component will support capacity building to enable civil\n            society and other organizations develop proposals, implement\n            and fulfill the reporting requirements for disbursements\n            under the grants agreement. Formal and informal private\n            sector will also be supported to increase their capacity to\n            implement HIV/AIDS activities."}, "docdt": "2004-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
