AIDS Capacity\n            Building and Technical Assistance Project for Lesotho were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the successful\n            strengthening of capacity in the project accounting and\n            procurement units underscores the value of building on and\n            use of existing systems. Strengthening procurement and\n            financial management capacity had a positive impact and\n            helped to accelerate project implementation. Moreover, it is\n            commendable that the project worked with other health Sector\n            Wide Approach (SWAp) partners to use common fiduciary\n            systems. The World Bank has tremendous influence and\n            leverage in a country like Lesotho that is highly reliant on\n            its support for sustainable development. The World Bank has\n            greatly assisted the private sector in Lesotho by working\n            for regulatory changes and other adjustments to create a\n            more enabling environment for business development and\n            growth. In contrast, the civil society sector appears\n            neglected and its potential to contribute to economic growth\n            in Lesotho is unacknowledged. This is a particularly large\n            gap when one considers the amount of donor funds flowing to\n            Lesotho to support the response to HIV and AIDS and the\n            growing proportion of these funds that is now supporting\n            local, non-governmental organizations and other civil\n            society entities. These funds create employment\n            opportunities and alternative futures for Lesotho's\n            young people. Creating a more enabling environment for civil\n            society growth and development, by, for exampling, reviewing\n            and revising laws and policies governing such entities,\n            would significantly improve the ability of the sector to\n            provide effective responses to Lesotho's development\n            challenges and to provide meaningful employment and\n            professional development opportunities for Lesotho's\n            future generations."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
