high institutional\n            development impact, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and the Borrower. A supplemental loan was approved\n            in June 1995 which enhanced project activities including\n            additional activities of diagnostic studies of troubled\n            banks, hiring advisors for the restructuring of troubled\n            banks, identification and measurement of fiscal cost, as\n            well as establishing a regulatory framework for private\n            investment management of SAR accounts and voluntary\n            occupation plans. Lessons learned include: a high degree of\n            government commitment is essential for successful\n            implementation; well defined project objectives must\n            accurately assess the countries needs and absorptive\n            capacity; regular monitoring and supervision executed\n            directly from the field offers support and allows closer\n            contact with clients. Reform of financial sectors will\n            require a long-term commitment and the Bank's key role\n            and comparative advantage is to stay as a policy advisor for\n            the long term."}, "docdt": "2001-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
