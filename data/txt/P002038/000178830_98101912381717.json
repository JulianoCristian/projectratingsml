directly\n            60,000 farm families located in the southern part of Niger\n            State. Support services will include extension advice, crop\n            protection measures, improved seeds, fertilizers, and the\n            provision of credit facilities. Physical infrastructure will\n            include constructing and improving 650 km of gravelled\n            feeder roads, the maintenance of feeder roads, the\n            establishment of project headquarters, 4 area development\n            centers and 23 farm service centers, the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of irrigation schemes, better water control and\n            the development of 2600 ha of valley swamps. A project\n            management unit with appropriate technical and\n            administrative staff will be established to implement the\n            project and to develop guidelines for future projects.\n            Facilities will be provided for training both agricultural\n            field staff and senior specialists. Consultant services will\n            be engaged to review state agricultural policies and prepare\n            feasibility studies for a second phase project."}, "docdt": "1979-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
