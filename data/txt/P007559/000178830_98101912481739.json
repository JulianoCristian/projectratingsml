fixed assets required to\n            increase production capacity.

Credit would\n            also be provided to enterprises for ore reserve development,\n            both on a risk-sharing and secured basis. About ten regional\n            mineral beneficiation plants would be constructed to process\n            minerals produced by small- and medium-scale mining\n            enterprises. Technical assistance would be provided by CRM,\n            CFM and FM to mining enterprises and equipment would be\n            provided to the executing agencies to expand their technical\n            services. The project presents the risks of possible delays\n            in committing resources due to institutional constraints and\n            possible loss of interest in the sector by investors due to\n            mineral price declines.
