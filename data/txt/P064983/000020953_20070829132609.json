"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Mortgage Finance\n            Technical Assistance Project of Algeria were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The lack of\n            responsiveness from the Ministry of Housing slowed\n            considerably the project implementation. The\n            inter-ministerial steering committee put in place to ensure\n            participation and cooperation between the different\n            ministries was only adopted at the end of the project and\n            therefore did not have the intended catalyzing effect\n            intended. The important lesson here is that during the risk\n            evaluation of a project, the team should also anticipate the\n            possible break-down of the mitigating measure and revise\n            them in order to make them as full-proof as possible. The\n            quantitative data required for the impact evaluation of the\n            project was extremely difficult to obtain. As a result, the\n            impact evaluation can only be qualitative, therefore at\n            times subjective. It is important for project teams to\n            remember that while controlling spending is very important,\n            it is equally important to respond to the needs of the\n            borrower and provide know-how and assistance where and when\n            required. Finally, project teams should keep in mind that if\n            all the blocks are important in the building of a structure,\n            the sequence in which they are laid is also vital to ensure\n            the soundness of the construction."}, "docdt": "2007-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
