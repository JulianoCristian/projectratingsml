The project\n            consists of three components. First, integrated community\n            child care package will improve parental awareness on child\n            care and development through parental education, child\n            growth monitoring and promotion, training, and\n            sensitization. Second, community support grants for child\n            development will provide a) community support grants, which\n            finance construction and operation of child care centers, or\n            the production and marketing of weaning foods; and b)\n            innovation grants, which support communities in implementing\n            \"innovative ideas\" on improving the lives of\n            children within their communities. Third, national program\n            support for child development and nutrition will support\n            program monitoring and evaluation; preventive program\n            initiatives on micronutrients; early childhood development\n            curriculum development; training; and information,\n            education, and communications (IEC) for children's rights."}, "docdt": "1997-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
