DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 2949-DO
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Sector Rehabilitation and
Distribution Project in Dominican Republic, for which Loan 2949-DO in the amount of $105
million equivalent was approved on June 7, 1988 and made effective on January 12, 1989.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, the original closing date. It was fully disbursed, and the
last disbursement took place on August 11, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Manuel I. Dussan, a consultant, and reviewed by Marcelo Osorio, Task
Manager, Peter Ludwig, Division Chief (LA3IN), and Robert Crown, Project Advisor. The
borrower provided comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during December, 1995 with a mission of the consultant to
Dominican Republic. It is based on material in the project file and on information provided by the
borrower to the consultant during the mission. The borrower submitted in late March, 1996 a
Final Progress Report on the project with an evaluation of the project's execution.

﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 2949-DO
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1. The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Distribution Project (PSRDP) was the first project loan
approved by the Bank for the power sector in the Dominican Republic. Project preparation was
supported mainly by an engineering loan which financed studies to improve the precarious
situation of thermal power plants and distribution networks. The US$105 million Bank's loan
financed four basic components: 23% in a program for the expansion and improvement of
transmission networks in Santo Domingo, 34% for a distribution rehabilitation program in Santo
Domingo; 36% for the rehabilitation of thermoelectric power plants; and 7% for consultant
services to support project execution and improvements in Corporaci6n Dominicana de
Electricidad (CDE) operations.
Project Objectives
2. The project had two basic objectives: to improve the reliability of electricity service in the
Dominican Republic, and to improve CDE's operational efficiency and restore its finances,
characterized by a chronic state of insolvency and poor operational performance. In order to
improve sector performance, the SAR relied on a performance agreement between the
Government and CDE, and the Bank's loan was designed to help finance the implementation of
this action plan through the rehabilitation and strengthening of transmission and distribution
networks, rehabilitation of thermal generation and technical assistance for project implementation
and for improving CDE management practices and operations.
3. The strategy selected to improve sector performance, based on the operational and financial
rehabilitation of a state-owned enterprise without attacking its major structural problems, was not
effective.
Implementation Experience and Results
4. By and large, the project objectives were not accomplished. CDE performance from 1988 to
1994 was poor, below the goals established in the project SAR. Total losses increased in this
period from 28% to 40%, while the goal was to reduce them to 19%. The collection period
remained in the range of 200-250 days, excessive by any standards, and well above a target of 60
days. The availability of thermal plants remained very low, about 50%, well below a target of
about 80%. In spite of a real increase of more than 100% in electricity tariffs during the period,
CDE's financial position remained very weak because non-technical electricity losses were too
high, revenue collection deteriorated and operating costs were not reduced.


﻿11
5. Reliability of public electricity service continued to be poor during project implementation. In
1989, it was estimated that about 30% of energy demand could not be served, in spite of a 38%
generation reserve margin and in 1994, poor reliability remained to be a major problem: 15% of
demand could not be met. In 1995, reliability improved due to the rehabilitation of CDE's
thermal plants and availability of 418 MW in private generation. However, reliability is still poor
due to low availability of CDE's generation plants (54%) and transmission constraints.
6. Despite a substantial financial support by international institutions, large investments in the
rehabilitation of the power system and substantial technical assistance for strengthening CDE
management and operations, there have not been significant improvements in the utility's
performance. Recently rehabilitated thermal plants deteriorated rapidly due to lack of spare parts,
new procedures and methodologies developed by consultants were only partially implemented,
CDE's management continues to be weak, and the technical level of CDE's staff is very low. The
main reasons for this debacle are structural problems: lack of autonomy and accountability, and its
monopoly position.
7. In 1993, the Government and the Bank agreed that it was unlikely that the power sector
performance could be improved in a sustainable basis without structural changes, and the
Government agreed to implement a sector reform, based on unbundling and privatization of
electricity services, separation of Government's regulatory, policy making and operating
functions, and introduction of competition at generation level. With the Bank assistance, the
Government took two important actions: prepared a new electricity law and submitted it to
Congress in late 1993; and, in late 1994, retained the services of international consultants for the
corporatization and divestiture of CDE. However, in early 1996, this new legislation was still
under discussion in the National Congress.
8. Execution of the physical components and consultant services included in the project was
subject to changes and delays. Loan resources had to be reallocated to finance rehabilitation of
additional generation units and spare parts that CDE was not able to finance because of its poor
financial situation. The transmission and distribution components were implemented according to
a scaled down version prepared at the beginning of the project to take into account financial
constraints and revised power network expansion requirements. The Bank's loan was disbursed
just one year behind schedule, a portion of the transmission component (3 substations) would
only be completed in 1997, more than two years behind schedule, due to lack of counterpart
funds.
9. During project preparation, the Bank responded timely to a Government's demand for urgent
help to solve problems derived from power outages that had reached up to 20 hours a day. Since
there was no time to design a sector restructure scheme, the Bank decided for a heavily
covenanted rehabilitation loan. In taking this decision, the Bank underestimated the risks involved
in trying to improve the performance of a weak state owned enterprise (SOE) without introducing
structural changes. During project supervision, the Bank played an active role to promote actions
for sector improvement and compliance with loan covenants. However, affected by serious
structural deficiencies, CDE was not able to achieve the project targets and comply with loan
covenants. In late 1990 and late 1991, the Bank, alerted by the project team, considered loan
suspension and prompted the Government and CDE to take actions to improve sector finances


﻿iii
and operational performance. Some improvements were achieved and CDE decided to retain a
foreign public utility for management and operational support, which was a condition for
effectiveness of a BID loan for the sector. Based on these actions, and on the agreements on a
long-term strategy for sector reform reached by the Bank's regional director with Government
during his visit to Dominican Republic, the Bank decided to continue supporting de Project. In
1993, the Bank reached the conclusion that sector performance could no be improved under the
existing institutional arrangements, and promoted and supported a new strategy based on a
power sector reform that introduces a pro-competitive environment and promotes private sector
participation.
10. The Borrower performance in project implementation was deficient.   Although the
Government provided substantial financial support to CDE and increased electricity tariffs above
targets, it failed to meet and enforce commitments under the contract-plan with CDE and to
support CDE's corporate independence and stability, essential to improve its performance. On
the other hand, other Government initiatives to contract generation services with independent
power producers had improved the electricity service reliability but deteriorated CDE's finances
due to CDE's inability to perform commercial functions.
11. In sum, the project outcome was highly unsatisfactory, as it failed to meet its main objectives.
However, the Government, with the Bank support, took actions during the execution of the
project to design and initiate a major power sector reform that, if approved by Congress and
implemented, should improve sector performance.
Summary of findings, future operation and key lessons learned.
12. A substantive sector reform and the establishment of a new regulatory framework are
indispensable to improve sector performance and ensure the sustainability of the rehabilitation and
expansion works implemented under the project. In this regard, the Bank has prepared a Power
Sector Restructuring Project to support a comprehensive reform that would require, among other
things, corporatization and divestiture of CDE and establishment of a wholesale power market.
13. Lessons learned. The main lessons learned are:
a) There is a high risk that investments in the rehabilitation of power facilities will be wasted if
there are no adequate incentives in place for the performance of power utilities.
b) A long list of loan conditions on performance goals is not a good substitute for a few and
specific actions on institutional change.
c) Improving sector efficiency based on performance contracts that call for the financial and
operational rehabilitation of a state-owned enterprise which continues operating as a
monopoly with limited autonomy and accountability does not work and is not sustainable.
d) The participation of private firms in the provision of generation and distribution services may
be an essential instrument for improving sector performance in a country like Dominican
Republic. Private firms force the Government to make credible commitments to solve sources
of inefficiency, such as tariff subsidies, energy theft, and revenue collection problems, which
have proven to be difficult to honor if the sector is dominated by state-owned enterprises.

﻿IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 2949-DO
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Objectives
1. The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Distribution Project (PSRDP) is the first project loan
approved by the Bank specifically for the power sector in Dominican Republic. Two previous
loans to other sectors included components to finance small thermal power plants. The PSRDP
was identified, prepared and appraised over an extended five year period (1983-1987) . Project
preparation was supported by an engineering loan (Loan 2369-DO, 1983) which financed studies
to improve the precarious situation of thermal power plants and distribution grids and by a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF-089, 1985), which supplemented these studies. The US$105 million
Bank's loan financed four basic components: 23% of the loan was allocated to a program for the
expansion and improvement of transmission networks in Santo Domingo; 34%, to a distribution
rehabilitation program in Santo Domingo; 36%, to rehabilitation of thermoelectric power plants;
and 7% to consultant services for project execution and management assistance to CDE.
2. The project had two basic objectives:
* to improve the reliability of electricity service in the Dominican Republic
* to improve CDE's operational efficiency and restore its finances
3. The project objectives pretended to deal with the main deficiencies in the power sector,
identified during project preparation and appraisal, namely, CDE's chronic state of insolvency
(from 1982 to 1986, rates of return were low or negative and the self-financing ratio was also
negative), poor operational performance (33% electricity losses in 1986, about 70% of
distribution feeders and transformers were overloaded, CDE generation plant availability of 65%,
102 customers/employee, 150 days of receivables) and poor reliability of electricity service
(average customer outages of 150 hours/year, 10% of peak demand could no be served, about
15% of installed generating capacity in small emergency units)
4. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) attributed CDE's poor performance to a lack of autonomy,
insufficient tariff levels, high turnover of senior staff, deficient salary policies, and lack of clearly
defined corporate objectives. Consequently, the SAR formulated a strategy to deal with these
problems based on a performance agreement between the Government and CDE establishing, on
the one hand, Government's resolution to grant corporate independence to CDE, align electricity
tariff with economic costs, and bankroll CDE and, on the other, CDE's obligation to meet specific
performance goals and implement a comprehensive action plan for institutional, financial and


﻿2
operational improvements. The Bank's loan was designed to help finance the implementation of
this agreement.
5. The project objectives and the instruments selected to achieve them were consistent with the
Government policy, as stated in the SAR, of reducing the burden of the power sector in national
finances by strengthening CDE's operations. This approach was based on the assumption,
common at the time that the project was prepared, that it was possible to improve sector
efficiency without structural changes either in the market (unbundling), ownership (privatization)
or institutional organization (regulatory framework).
Achievement of Project Objectives
6. By and large, the project objectives were not accomplished and the strategy of improving the
performance of a SOE based on a contract-plan was not effective in the Dominican Republic. The
following paragraphs assess the results regarding reliability of electricity service and CDE's
operational performance.
Reliability of electricity service
7. Reliability of public electricity service continued to be poor during project implementation.
From 1980 to 1990, the average annual rate of growth of electricity sales to the industrial sector
was negative (-1.6%), which according a recent electricity demand study ', was due to constraints
in and lack of reliability of supply. In 1989, it was estimated that about 30% of energy demand
could not be served, in spite of the fact that CDE installed capacity of 1163 MW was sufficient to
serve an estimated peak demand of 840 MW with a reserve margin of 38%. In 1994, poor
reliability remained to be a major problem: 15% of demand could not be met. The poor reliability
of the public electricity service was reflected in a high installed capacity in emergency generating
plants. A 1994 survey of large and medium industrial and commercial consumers (other than
large self producers) indicated that these consumers might have an additional installed capacity of
320 MW, operating more than 30% of the time. Furthermore, small generation and backup
power supply units are used extensively by small businesses and residential consumers.
8. In 1995 reliability improved due to the rehabilitation of CDE thermal plants and the
establishment of IPPs selling energy to CDE under power purchase agreements. CDE installed
capacity increased to 1462 MW  and an additional capacity of 418 MW in private generation
(about 290 NW in IPPs) was available to meet an estimated peak demand of 1,063. However,
reliability is still poor due to low availability of CDE's generation plants (54%), transmission
constraints in the Santo Domingo area, detrimental to economic dispatch, and deficient condition
of distribution networks'.
/ Study completed by a consultant, DECON, in June/94
/ In December 1995. this picture had not improved. CDE was struggling to complete rehabilitation of 600 MW
an IPP with a 185 MW combined cycle plant was not fully available due to technical and contractual problems and,
consequently. most consumers were subject daily to several hours of rationing.


﻿3
CDE's operational performance
9. CDE's performance from 1988 to 1994 was poor, below the goals established in the project
SAR and the contract-plan between the Government and CDE and, furthermore, according to
most performance indicators, it deteriorated during this period (see figures 1 and 2 below and
Table 5 in annex). First, CDE was unable to reduce or contain electricity losses. Total losses
increased in this period from 28% to 40%, while the goal was to reduce them to 19%. According
to rough consultant's estimates, about two thirds of these losses corresponds to non-technical
losses, mainly illegal connections, connections without meters and incomplete or inadequate
billing records' . Although the distribution rehabilitation component contributed to reduce
technical losses, and CDE had the assistance of consultants to improve commercial practices, total
losses increased during this period. Second, no sustained improvement could be made in reducing
accounts receivables. The collection period was maintained in the range of 200-250 days,
excessive by any standards, in spite of some temporary improvement in 1993 due to actions taken
under a technical assistance by a foreign public utility. Third, management problems identified
during appraisal were not resolved, as there were no significant improvements in CDE's corporate
planning and control and technical and operational capabilities. As a consequence, total number
of employees increased during the period, while the goal was to freeze it and improve the
indicator customer/employee. Fourth, in spite of large investments in the rehabilitation of CDE's
thermal plants, their availability remained very low, about 50%, well below a target of about 80%,
due mainly to maintenance and financial problems (lack of spare parts, operation accidents, and
postponement of preventive maintenance programs).

10. CDE's financial position remained very weak in spite of a large increase in electricity tariffs
during the period (see figure 2 below and table 5 in annex). Although the average tariff increased
' / CDE management consultant estimated that 1/3 of consumers were not metered, did not have billing records
or were illegal.


﻿4
from 42 US$/MWh in 1988 to about 108 US$/kWh in 1994, well above a target of 81.6
US$/kWh, financial indicators like rate of return, and operating ratio were off targets. There are
several factors contributing to this condition: a low availability of CDE's generation plants which
was not sufficient to meet demand ( it is estimated that in 1991 and 1992 about 40% of demand
could not be served for this reason, and 15% in 1994); high non-technically electricity losses
(about 27% in 1994); swelling receivables (a Bank's mission in late 1991 estimated that about
25% of electricity bills were not collected); and high operating costs. Thus, as shown in table
below, electricity sales were low (70% of projected), revenues were about 10% below targets
(shortfall in sales was compensated by higher tariffs), and net income and cash flow were not
satisfactory (in 1990 and 1991 CDE did not meet its debt service, and, by 1993, Government
contributions to serve CDE external debt amounted to US$242 million).

Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
11. The project included four basic components:
a) a program for the expansion and improvement of transmission networks in Santo
Domingo, consisting of about 54 kms of 138 kV lines, 42 kms of 69 kV lines, and 3
distribution substations with a capacity of 250 MVA.
b) a distribution rehabilitation program in Santo Domingo, consisting of the rehabilitation and
expansion of about 295 kms of primary feeders, 875 kms of secondary lines, 103 MVA
distribution transformers, 135,000 new service drops, and tools and vehicles for operation
and maintenance.
c) spare parts and technical assistance for the rehabilitation of 5 thermoelectric generation
units with an installed capacity of about 330 NlW; and


﻿5
d) consultant services for the design, supervision and management of the transmission,
distribution and generation components, for financial advise to CDE, for external auditing
services and technical assistance in the financial, planning, technical and administrative
areas, and for environmental studies.
12. In 1989, the consultant hired to assist CDE in project design and management revised the
transmission component to take into account new conditions and requirements for power
transmission. The consultant recommended to expand only the 138 kV network and to develop
initially about 32 kms of lines and 345 MVA of substations. Execution of this component was
delayed due to procurement problems and lack of counterpart funds. Main contracts for
construction of transmission lines and distribution substations were awarded, respectively, in July
and December, 1992, about three years behind SAR schedule, and construction during 1995
progressed at a slow pace as CDE did not pay local currency on time to contractors. By March,
1996, construction of transmission lines and about 25% of substations was completed, all
equipment and materials financed under the Bank's loan had been procured and delivered, and
CDE had reached an agreement with the contractors of these works on a payment schedule for
counterpart funds, which would allow to complete the substations by mid-1997, more than 6
years behind SAR schedule.
13. The distribution component was also revised in 1989 and it was divided in three phases,
comprising, respectively, the rehabilitation of primary and secondary circuits, primary branches
and specific problem areas. Due to financial constraints, only the first phase was included under
the Bank's loan. This phase included 185 kms of primary lines, 207 of secondary lines, 65 MVA
in distribution transformers and 24,000 service drops, representing about 50% of the original
program. In 1991, a $6.4 million emergency program was included in this component for the
procurement of equipment, spare parts and materials urgently needed for maintenance of
distribution and generation facilities.
14.  The rehabilitation of thermoelectric generations units was partially completed and
experienced many difficulties. Rehabilitation of three units (Timbeque 1 and 2 - gas turbines and
Haina 2 - steam turbines), with an installed capacity of about 95 MW, was completed with no
major problems. The Puerto Plata I and Haina 4 steam-turbines had serious accidents shortly
after rehabilitation was completed (boiler explosion and turbine overspeeding), an indication of
inadequate maintenance and operation practices. The rehabilitation of Itabo 1, a 125 MW steam
turbine, experienced major delays due to problems in supplying equipment and materials by the
boiler contractor, and has not achieved initial goals: needed repairs in equipment to use coal as an
alternative fuel have not been initiated, the unit has only operated at 67% of rated capacity, and,
in 1994, a fire destroyed a preheater and caused a reduction of the unit's thermal efficiency.
15. Several factors affected execution of the thermal plant rehabilitation program:
a) The program was prepared by a consultant in 1986, based on a diagnosis of the operating
conditions of the generation units at that time, but its implementation started more than
four years later, when the condition of the plants had worsened due to four years of
operation under adverse circumstances (power shortages, lack of spare parts, no


﻿6
preventive maintenance); consequently, it was necessary to increase substantially the scope
and cost of repair work '.
b) Poor maintenance conditions after the generation units were commissioned (lack of funds
for spare parts, lack of preventive maintenance due to pressure to run units and mitigate
energy shortage, and deficient maintenance practices).
c) Deficient performance by some contractors and deficiencies in project management and
supervision, specially in the case of the Itabo I unit that, by all accounts, was a problem
project.
16. By and large, the consultant services included in the project were executed as planned. Two
consulting firms were retained for project engineering and management of generation, and
transmission and distribution works; a financial advisor assisted CDE's General Manager; a public
accounting firm provided assistance for improving accounting systems; CDE retained the services
of an external auditing firm; and two international individual consultants provided assistance in
preparing expansion plans and for the organization and initial operation of the project execution
unit. The environmental studies included in the project were reassigned to a separate technical
assistance financed by USAID.
17. A Tariff Adjustment Program (TAP) was adequately designed and successfully implemented
from 1988 to 1991 under the consultant services component. It enabled raising the level of tariffs
at the distribution level up to CDE's economic costs and rationalized the tariff structure of low
voltage consumers. The highlights of the TAP were:
(a) rationalization of the high voltage tariffs into binomial tariff based on Long run Marginal
costs (LRMC), including large penalties for inefficient power factors; and
(b) a monthly adjustment program to rationalize low voltage tariffs (commercial and
residential) implemented over a period of two years to reduce a six block tariff into three
blocks.
18. The above program resulted in a 100% average rate increase, but its smooth and gradual
implementation did not cause any public riots. The economic rate levels was a positive factor that
enabled the entry of a large number of IPPs into the Dominican power market.
19. The Bank loan was supplemented in 1991 by three IDB's loans (585/OC, 586/OC and
831/SF-DR, for a total amount of US$148.8 million), which financed rehabilitation of other
power stations, expansion and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems in cities
other than Santo Domingo and institutional strengthening. This loan financed about US$8 million
of technical assistance services by a foreign public utility for supporting CDE, from late 1991 to
4 / Contract value for Itabo I unit was increased in 45%. rehabilitation has not been completed and contractor is
now requesting an additional 100% increase to complete works. Contract for Haina II was increased in about 30%.
As shown in table 8A, total cost of rehabilitation program increased 65% from US$34 million to US$56 million.

1995, in the commercial, generation, transmission, distribution and human resources areas.
Although there were partial improvements in billing, revenue collection and generation availability
while the consultant was participating actively with a large team, these improvements could not be
sustained once the consultant finished its contract.
20. Total project cost was about the same as estimated in the SAR (see table 8A), because the
scope of work was revised to adjust it to financial resources available for the project. The funds
allocated to the generation component was increased by 67% to finance the rehabilitation of one
of CDE's largest generation units that exploded and spare parts for the maintenance of its other
units. To compensate this increase, the transmission and distribution components were revised
and programmed to be implemented in phases, to facilitate the use of financial resources available
from the Bank and other international financial institutions. As a result of this process, total cost
of the transmission and distribution components was limited to about 85% of initial estimated base
costs for these components. The consultant services components had an overrun of 230% due, in
part, to less than expected CDE's counterparts to the Project.
21. Although the physical components and consultant services included in the project were
implemented as planned, they did not contribute to improve, once and for all, CDE poor
performance and weak financial position, mainly due to the fact that the main critical issue was
not resolved, namely, a state-owned enterprise o0erating with a lack of continuity, support,
autonomy and accountability. From 1988 to 1990 CDE had four general managers, situation that
improved temporarily in 1991 with an administration that lasted about three years. Generally, the
Government distrusted CDE's technical and operational capabilities due to poor results in
improving power system reliability and, as a result, interfered in CDE day-to-day operations and
was not willing to provide needed financial and institutional support. On the other hand, CDE
management did not have enough financial and institutional support and incentives to improve its
performance.
22. However, in late 1992, the Government and the Bank agreed that it was unlikely that the
power sector performance could be improved in a sustainable basis without structural changes,
and the Government adopted a strategy for sector reform, based on unbundling and privatization
of electricity services, separation of Government's regulatory, policy making and operating
functions, and introduction of competition at generation level. In 1993, with the support of the
Bank, IDB and USAID, the Government prepared and submitted to Congress an Electricity Bill
to support the implementation of the new institutional and regulatory arrangements and, in 1994,
it retained the services of an international consultant to assist in the corporatization and divestiture
of CDE. In early 1996, this new legislation was still under discussion in the National Congress.
To support the implementation of the proposed sector reform, the Bank prepared in 1995 a new
operation, the Power Sector Restructuring Project.
Project Sustainability
23. As it was mentioned before, the project did not achieve its main objectives of improving CDE
performance and the reliability and quality of electricity service in the Dominican Republic. The
project achieved transitory improvements in reducing technical losses in the Santo Domingo area
with the rehabilitation of distribution networks, increasing the availability of rehabilitated thermal


﻿8
units and establishing information systems for billing and collection. However, it was clear during
project execution that these improvements could not be sustained. The performance of recently
rehabilitated thermal plants deteriorated rapidly due to lack of spare parts and poor operation and
maintenance practices, procedures and methodologies developed by consultants could not be
implemented or were short-lived and improvements in distribution networks did not have an
appreciable impact in operating performance.
24. It is unlikely that the power sector performance can be improved in a sustainable basis
without structural changes.  A substantial financial support by international institutions, large
investments in the rehabilitation of the power system and substantial technical assistance for
strengthening CDE management and operations have not been effective in improving performance
of a state-owned enterprise operating with little autonomy and accountability, and holding a
monopoly position.
25. As indicated above, in early 1993 the Bank recognized the fact that, under the current sector
structure, performance improvements, as envisaged in the SAR, were not longer achievable before
the loan closing date. Thereafter, it has supported a new strategy for the power sector based on a
reform of the institutional and market structure. The new electricity law, currently under
consideration of Congress, if it is approved and implemented, should be instrumental for
improving sector performance and for taking advantage of the rehabilitation and expansion works
implemented under the project.
Bank Performance
26. During project preparation, the Bank responded timely to a Government's request for urgent
help. The country was facing critical conditions with power outage reaching up to 20 hours a
day. Without time to design a sector restructuring scheme, the Bank decided for a heavily
covenanted Rehabilitation Loan. In taking this decision, the Bank underestimated the risks
involved in trying to improve the performance of a weak state owned enterprise (SOE) without
introducing structural changes. The approach used in the SAR of improving the performance of
a SOE without introducing significant structural changes did not work. Probably there was a lack
of project ownership and commitment   on the part of the Dominicans and the Bank
underestimated the risks involved. A long list of substantial commitments by CDE and the
Government to improve institutional and management performance, agreed during negotiations,
was an indication that the plan of action to improve sector efficiency was not realistic.
27. During project supervision, the Bank played an active role to promote actions for sector
improvement and compliance with loan covenants, such as the implementation of an adequate
tariff structure. However, affected by serious structural deficiencies, CDE was not able to
achieve the project targets and comply with loan covenants from the very beginning. The Bank
took some actions to try to resolve the lack of compliance with loan conditions: in late 1990, the
Bank, alerted by the project team, considered loan suspension and prompted the Government and
CDE to take actions to improve sector finances and operational performance. Some
improvements were derived from the Bank action, including a financial support to CDE by
Government, but none of the improvements were sustainable and CDE's performance continued
to deteriorate. Soon, in late 1991, the Bank was facing a case of massive non-compliance with


﻿9
loan covenants again. The Bank's regional director visited Dominican Republic to discuss this
case with the Government and reached preliminary agreements on a long-term strategy for sector
reform. Based on these agreements and on CDE's decision to retain the services of a prestigious
foreign public utility for management and operational support, which was a condition for
effectiveness of an IDB loan for the sector, the Bank decided to continue supporting the Project..
28. In 1993, the Bank reached the conclusion that sector performance could not be improved
under the existing institutional arrangements, and concentrated its efforts in supervising execution
of physical works included in the project and in promoting and supporting a power sector reform
(see par. 21 above).
29. Project execution was supervised by 13 Bank missions from 1988 to 1994, four of which
took place during 1991, during the period when the Bank threatened to suspend disbursements.
Overall, the Bank allocated enough resources for the supervision of this problem project.
Borrower Performance
30. The Borrower performance was deficient, specially during the initial phase of project
execution: the Government failed to meet and enforce commitments under the contract-plan with
CDE (see table 10, status of legal covenants), and failed to support CDE's corporate
independence and stability, essential to improve its performance. Furthermore, Government
initiatives to improve reliability of electricity service by contracting distribution and generation
services with private operators contributed to de-institutionalize the sector due to a lack of a clear
sector strategy". Beginning in 1992, the Government provided substantial financial support to
CDE, maintained electricity tariffs above targets, and supported the proposed sector reform.
However, as of early 1996, these efforts had not yielded concrete results.
31. On the other hand, CDE's management failed to strengthen the company's technical
capabilities, to support the implementation of programs to improve CDE information systems,
commercial practices and financial areas, to establish transparent procurement procedures and to
comply with the Bank's reporting requirements.    Probably, this was a vicious circle, the
Government constrained financial and institutional support to CDE due to its poor performance
and CDE could not improve performance due to lack of Government's support.
Assessment of outcome
32. The project outcome was highly unsatisfactory. As it was discussed above, it failed to meet
its main objectives and there are serious doubts about its sustainability under current institutional
arrangements. Furthermore, the substantial financial resources spent in the rehabilitation of the
/ From 1988 to 1990 the Government entered into direct negotiations with private investors to develop new
thermoelectric generation projects and manage distribution networks, without appropriate preparation and
technical support. Some of these initiatives were aborted because contract conditions were unfavorable to the
country, and others resulted in costly contracts with independent power producers.


﻿10
power system and in consultant services were not effective in improving CDE performance and
could be wasted unless the proposed sector strategy is implemented and works.
Future Operation
33. The plan for the project's future operation and the measures to maximize the project benefits
depend on the approval of a sector reform that has been under consideration by Congress since
late 19936. In the mean time, to address a power supply emergency, CDE signed long-term
power purchase agreements with private investors for the development of about 470 MW in
thermal generation projects. These projects are now in operation', selling energy to CDE at an
average price of about $60/MWh.
34. In spite of CDE's success in attracting private investors, unfortunately CDE has had to
conduct this emergency process without adequate competition and planning and lacking a clear
regulatory and legal framework. The main risk associated with this approach is that the rules and
regulations for the participation of private capital and the provision of a public service are
established, using ad-hoc procedures, in the individual contracts (BOOs, concessions, etc.) that
are negotiated with each investor. This process may result in the establishment of inconsistent
and inflexible rules and costly conditions that may become a burden on country resources, and
that may hinder, later on, the implementation of a comprehensive sector reform'.
35. The Bank has prepared a Power Sector Restructuring Project to support a comprehensive
reform that would require, among other things, corporatization and divestiture of CDE and
establishment of a wholesale power market, formidable tasks for GODR, that can only be
accomplished with strong political support. Notwithstanding these difficulties, there might not be
simpler and easier solutions, in this case, for improving the performance of the power sector on a
sustainable basis.
Key Lessons Learned
36. There are project related and sector related lessons. Related with the project, the first lesson
is that there is a high risk that investments in the rehabilitation of power facilities will be wasted if
there are no incentives in place for utilities' performance. This is particularly important in a
country like Dominican Republic that was experiencing energy shortages, a condition that
required to keep running all available generation plants. The second lesson, is that a long list of
/ Although there is political consensus about the need for power sector reform and privatization of distribution,
there is still a political debate on how to conduct this process and Congress would like to retain some control of
main privatization decisions.
7 / 50 MW were commissioned in May/94; 236 MW between August/94 and January/96: and 236 MW in April/96.
" / For example, CDE's financial position is likely to worsen with energy purchases to private generators if
distribution performance is not improved and non-technical losses and account receivables remain so high that
there is a financial loss associated with these transactions. GODR would have to fill the gap with resources from
the national budget.


﻿11
loan conditions on performance goals is not a good substitute for a few and specific actions on
institutional change. Generally, as it happened in this project, performance goals are optimistic
and are not met, and the conditionality loses credibility and is no longer effective as an instrument
to demand good performance.
37. Related with the sector, the first lesson is that contract plans are not suitable instruments to
restore good performance to an SOE in crisis. Improving sector efficiency based on performance
contracts that call for the financial and operational rehabilitation of a state-owned enterprise that
continues operating as a monopoly with limited autonomy and accountability does not work and
is not sustainable, specially in a country with weak institutions and a power sector in crisis. There
is a major risk that the Government, acting as sole owner of the power utility, imposes social and
political objectives over economic efficiency, that managers would not have enough incentives to
improve performance, and that there would not be adequate instruments to make people and
institutions accountable for poor performance9.
38. The second lesson is that, in order to improve power sector performance, it is essential to
restructure the market and to have active participation of private firms in the provision of
distribution services and operation of thermoelectric generation. Most of the opportunities for
improving efficiency are related to these activities: increases in availability and efficiency of
thermal units, reduction of energy losses, improvement of billing and collection, increasing labor
productivity, and economic purchase of bulk energy. Private firms participating in these activities
have strong incentives to improve its operations and increase profits, and the definition of a
concession contract or any other regulatory contract with a private firm force the Government to
make credible commitments on pricing, investment, energy theft control, and payment of bills by
official institutions, which have proven to be difficult to honor if a sector is dominated by state-
owned enterprises. Nevertheless, participation of private operators is not a sufficient condition to
improve efficiency on a sustainable basis. Build, Own and Operating (BOO) contracts for power
generation and concession contracts for distribution may be a costly solution if they are not well
designed and do not operate under a market structure and a regulatory framework which provide
strong incentives for improving efficiency.

APPENDIX A:
AIDE MEMOIRE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION MISSION
1. Una misión del Banco Mundial compuesta por los señores Marcelo Osorio y Rafael Moscote,
visitó Santo Domingo entre el 21 y el 28 de febrero de 1996 con la finalidad de: (a) discutir el
informe de evaluación del Proyecto (Implementation Completion Report, ICR) preparado por el
Banco Mundial y apoyar a la CDE en la preparación del Informe de Terminación del proyecto
financiado con el Préstamo 2949-DO; y (b) revisar los informes presentados y el programa de
estudios financiados con fondos de donación japonesa para preparar el proyecto propuesto para la
reforma del sector eléctrico (Power II Project). Este documento extracta las discusiones
sostenidas por la misión sobre el Proyecto 2949-DO de la ayuda memoria dejada por la misión.
Informe de Evaluación preparado por el Banco (ICR)
2. La misión revisó con la CDE el borrador del ICR preparado por el Banco sobre la ejecución
del Proyecto financiado con fondos del Préstamo 2949-DO, el mismo que contiene las siguientes
conclusiones preliminares:
(a)   los objetivos del projecto (mejorar la confiabilidad del servicio eléctrico, mejorar la
eficiencia operacional de la CDE y sanear la situación financiera de la CDE) no han
sido alcanzados;
(b)   las pérdidas de electricidad se incrementaron de 28% a 40%, el período de cobro
de las facturas permaneció entre 200 a 250 días, la disponibilidad de las plantas
termoeléctricas de la CDE permaneció en alrededor del 50%, y la situación
financiera de la CDE se ha deteriorado;
(c)   no hay seguridad de que la rehabilitación de las instalaciones realizada dentro del
Proyecto tenga un efecto duradero debido a que el déficit financiero de la CDE le
impide disponer de un stock de repuestos para el mantenimiento de las mismas;
(d)   en vista de los resultados parciales observados en 1993, el Gobierno y el Banco
llegaron a la conclusin de que no era factible una mejora permanente de las
operaciones de la CDE a menos que se introduzcan cambios estructurales
fundamentales, y el Gobierno acordó,en esa fecha, proceder a la reforma del sector
para lo cual preparó un proyecto de Ley General de Electricidad que lo presentó a
consideración del Congreso pero que todavía no ha sido aprobada.
3. La CDE informó a la misión que no tiene comentarios al borrador del ICR, y que ha enviado,
para comentarios, copias del informe a la Secretaría de Finanzas, Secretaría Técnica y Banco
Central. En caso de haber comentarios de estas dependencias del Gobierno, estos serán
comunicados al Banco hasta el 15 de marzo de 1996.

Informe de Terminación del Proyecto
4. La misión discutió y acordó con el personal de la Unidad Ejecutora del Proyecto (UEP) el
contenido que debería tener el Informe de Terminación del Proyecto. La misión acordó lo
siguiente con el personal de UEP:
(a)   el informe contendrá una sección principal de 10 a 12 páginas de extensión y una
sección de anexos que sustenten la sección principal;
PART II - STATISTICAL ANNEXES
(b)   en el caso de que la sección principal se extienda más allá de las 12 páginas, el
informe incluirá un resúmen ejecutivo de no más de 12 páginas;
(c)   el informe debe ser no sólo descriptivo sino fundamentalmente crítico con
referencia al cumplimiento de los objetivos, metas y presupuesto del Proyecto;
(d)   el informe será enviado al Banco antes del 31 de marzo de 1996.
Plan Operacional
5. Con el fin de asegurar la sostenibilidad de la rehabilitación y mejoras alcanzadas bajo el
Proyecto, la CDE acordó tomar las siguientes acciones:
(a)   concluirá la instalación de los materiales y equipos adquiridos con fondos del
Préstamo;
(b)   dividirá y descentralizará las operaciones del sistema de distribución en tres
unidades separadas, en un plazo no mayor de seis meses, con base en la
recomendación realizada por los consultores Coopers & Lybrand. Esta división
tiene los siguientes objetivos:  (i) mejorar los niveles de los servicios de
distribución y comercialización mediante la asignación de responsabilidades
gerenciales específicos; y (ii) preparará el sistema de distribución para la futura
conformación de empresas separadas que permita la participación del sector
privado;
(c)   igualmente, dividirá y descentralizará las operaciones de las plantas de generación
eléctrica en tres unidades gerenciales separadas con objetivos similares a los
enunciados para el sistema de distribución;
(d)   establecerá una unidad encargada de la planificación, expansión y operación del
sistema de transmisión y centro de despacho, también con base en las
recomendaciones del Coopers & Lybrand;


﻿3
(e)    establecerá contratos de compra-venta de energía entre las unidades de generación
y las de distribución, simulando la operación de un mercado competitivo, en la
forma prevista en el proyecto de Ley Eléctrica que el Gobierno ha presentado a
consideración del Congreso.
Auditoría de los Estados Financieros de la CDE y del Proyecto
6. La misión recibió copia de los informes de los Auditores externos sobre los estados
financieros de la CDE y sobre el cumplimiento de las condiciones contractuales incluidas en el
Convenio de Préstamo 2949-DO, informes que anteriormente habían sido remitidos al Banco.
Estos informes contienen serias observaciones de los auditores, lo que hace que dichos estados
financieros no sean aceptables al Banco, pero la CDE informó a la misión que desde la fecha de la
auditoría ha tomado las acciones correspondientes para la correción de las anomalías señaladas
por los auditores y que espera que los informes de Auditoría correspondientes al ejercicio fiscal de
1995 estén libres de observaciones. En el interim, la CDE solicitará a los auditores la preparación
de un informe que presente el estado de las acciones tomadas hasta el presente tendientes a
satisfacer las observaciones hechas por los auditores.
7. La misión entregó a la CDE un modelo de términos de referencia actualizado por el Banco
para la preparación de auditorías de estados financieros. Se acordó que la auditoría de los estados
financieros de la CDE correspondiente a 1996, se realizará con base en estos términos de
referencia.
8. La misión expresó la preocupación del Banco por los retrasos en los pagos de la CDE a
contratistas, e informó que el Banco ha recibido comunicaciones de las compañías BESCO y
ECEM en las que informan de substanciales valores pendientes de pago por más de un año. La
CDE informará al Banco sobre las acciones que tome o espere tomar respecto a estas
reclamaciones.

APPENDIX B:
BORROWER CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
Antecedentes
1.    La República Dominicana y el Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento (BIRF)
concertaron el Préstamo 2949-DO por un monto de US$105 millones para la rehabilitación del
sector eléctrico nacional. Dicho préstamo, el primero otorgado por el Banco Mundial al sector
eléctrico de la República Dominicana, fué aprobado el 7 de junio de 1988 y finalizado el 30 de
junio de 1995.
2.    El referido proyecto tenía dos objetivos: i) mejorar la baja confiabilidad del servicio
eléctrico nacional; ii) mejorar la eficiencia operacional de la CDE y restaurar sus finanzas.
El préstamo estaba destinado a ayudar financieramente en la rehabilitación  y
fortalecimiento de las líneas de transmisión y distribución, en la rehabilitación de las unidades
térmicas de generación, en la asistencia técnica para su implementación y en mejorar las
capacidades administrativas y operacionales de la CDE.
4.    Este informe de cierre es política del Banco Mundial, a fin de evaluar el desempeño de la
institución ejecutora del proyecto, del Banco, así como el impacto del proyecto en el desarrollo
del sector.
Evaluación del Proyecto
5.    Aunque los objetivos del proyecto, así como el instrumento seleccionado eran consistentes
con la política Gubernamental de reducir la carga del sector eléctrico en las finanzas públicas
mediante el fortalecimiento y saneamiento de las operaciones de la CDE, los mismos no fueron
conseguidos, y los resultados obtenidos se pueden catalogar de insatisfactorios.
6.    De manera similar, los problemas gerenciales diagnosticados no fueron resueltos. En tal
sentido, a pesar de las grandes inversiones en rehabilitación de plantas; su disponibilidad se
mantiene en 50%, muy por debajo del objetivo 80%, debido a problemas financieros y de
mantenimiento.  Esto sugiere la necesidad de mejorar las áreas de control y planeación
corporativos, así como las capacidades técnicas y operacionales.
7.    Los logros obtenidos durante la ejecución del proyecto fueron de corta duración y no
sostenibles. En tal sentido, la disminución de las pérdidas técnicas y el aumento de generación
resultantes de la rehabilitación de las plantas térmicas se tradujeron en un aumento de las pérdidas
totales, las cuales pasaron de un 28% en 1988 a un 40% en 1994, cuando la meta era de un 19%.


﻿5
8.    A pesar del sustancial aporte financiero del Gobierno Central, para enfrentar el crónico
déficit operativo de la CDE, y el servicio externo de la deuda, contribución por este último
concepto que para 1993 alcanzó unos US$242 millones; asi como de los grandes aumentos de
tarifas registrados durante el período del préstamo, la posición financiera de la CDE se mantiene
muy débil. En particular, la tasa de retorno, los beneficios netos y los flujos de caja no son
satisfactorios.
9.    La ejecución de los diversos componentes del préstamo estuvo acompañada de
dificultades. El componente de transmisión se retrasó considerablemente debido a la carencia de
los fondos de contrapartida. La rehabilitación de las unidades térmicas fué completada
parcialmente Accidentes operativos y el retraso en la ejecución del proyecto significaron una
considerable reducción de la capacidad de las plantas y un aumento en los costos de reparación.
Similar responsabilidad tienen los contratistas de estas reparaciones y la administración y
supervisión del proyecto.
10.   La necesidad de revisar el alcance del proyecto y de reasignación de los fondos limitó la
ejecución de los componentes de transmisión y distribución a un 85% del estimado inicial, que
fueron destinados a financiar los sobrecostos en la rehabilitación de la generación en un 67% y los
servicios de consultoría en 230%.
11.   La inadecuada implementación del proyecto y la no obtención de los objetivos de
mejoramiento en el desempeño administrativo operacional del sector, obligan a rediseñar la
política de asistencia al sector eléctrico. Esta deberá estar destinada a darle una utilización
racional a los recursos, tanto nacionales como extranjeros, que demanda la modernización del
sector. En consecuencia, se debe continuar con la política diseñada en la Ley General de
Electricidad sometida al Congreso en 1993. Sólo los cambios estructurales contenidos en el
espíritu de esta ley garantizas la eficiencia y la competitividad del sector eléctrico nacional.
12.   Aunque la banca multilateral parece haber subvaluado los riesgos para la obtención de los
objetivos propuestos en el diagnóstico para el diseño del préstamo, al haber apostado al
mejoramiento de la eficiencia del sector sin la implantación de cambios radicales en el negocio,
dominado por una empresa estatal operando en condiciones de monopolio y con poca autonomía
administrativa, ha realizado significativos esfuerzos por enmendar esta situación. En tal sentido, y
en común acuerdo con el Gobierno, en 1993 se diseñó el proceso de reforma del sector, con el
objetivo de promover la competencia del sector a través de la participación del sector privado, de
la separación y privatización de los diferentes componentes del negocio eléctrico (generación,
transmisión y distribución), y en la asignación del rol de regulador y diseñador de políticas del
Estado.
13.   A pesar del significativo esfuerzo financiero realizado por el Gobierno Central en auxilio
de la CDE, los resultados del proyecto han sido inadecuados. La falta de independencia y
estabilidad de la empresa contribuyó, especialmente en la etapa inicial del proyecto, en este
resultado.
14.   Por su parte, la administración de la CDE no ha podido fortalecer las capacidades técnicas
de la empresa; ha fallado en la implementación de programas para mejorar sus sistemas de


﻿6
informática, de práctica comerciales y de las áreas financieras, y en el establecimiento de
procedimientos de adquisición transparentes.
15.   De igual manera, las iniciativas destinadas a mejorar la confiabilidad del suministro
eléctrico mediante la contratación de servicios con generadores privados contribuyó a la
desinstitucionalización de sector, debido a la falta de una estrategia claramente definida y de
procedimientos de licitación transparentes.  Estos contratos negociados sin la apropiada
preparación ni el soporte técnico, aunque son una realidad, se han convertido en un obstáculo
para la eficientización del sector.
16.   Los cuantiosos recursos financieros utilizados para la rehabilitación del sector y para los
servicios de consultoria, no brindarian ninguna utilidad si la nueva estrategia diseñada no es
implementada. Los reducidos logros obtenidos no podrán ser mantenidos en el largo plazo,
debido a la falta de sostenibilidad que presenta la actual estructura institucional. De hecho existen
evidencias que apuntan a una mayor complicación financiera de la empresa y el Estado.
17.   El plan para la futura operación del proyecto y las medidas para maximizar los beneficios
del proyecto están asociados con la reforma del sector contenida en la ley eléctrica. Cualquier
iniciativa para la participación del capital privado en las actividades de generación y distribución
son costosas y pueden no mejorar el desempeño del sector si ellas no son parte integral de una
reforma sectorial creible.
18.   Cualquier inversión en rehabilitación no tendría resultados favorables si no hay seguridad
de que las plantas; y los equipos serán operados y mantenidos por una compañía con adecuados
recursos técnicos y financieros.
19.   Para mejorar el desempeño del sector es imprescindible la reestructuración del mercado
eléctrico y tener una activa participación de firmas privadas en la distribución y generación de
electricidad.
20.    La participación del sector privado, no es una condición suficiente para mejorar la
eficiencia en una base sostenible.  Los contratos con productores privados, así como las
concesiones en distribución pueden constituirse en una costosa solución si no están bien diseñados
y no operan bajo una estructura de mercado y un marco regulatorio que provea un fuerte
incentivo para el mejoramiento de la eficiencia.
Desempeño del Banco
21.    La participación del BIRF durante la ejecución del Proyecto es considerada por la CDE como
muy buena. Durante la ejecución del proyecto y a pesar de que los objetivos planteados originalmente
no se cumplían a cabalidad, el Banco se mantuvo siempre del lado de la CDE.
22.    Creemos sin embargo, que por la experiencia acumulada en el caso particular de la CDE,
conforme al avance del programa, el Banco debió tomar decisiones, en relación a los destinos de sus
recursos, aunque se afectara momentáneamente a la Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad. Estó así
debido a que de esta forma en la Corporación se reconsiderarían las actividades, de tal forma que


﻿7
fueran consistente con la planificación original del proyecto, hasta lograr los correctivos en torno a lo
planificado. Creemos que el BIRF, en el momento en que entendió que los objetivos propuestos se
habían desvirtuado, debió reorientar sus inversiones, con lo cual la CDE tendría también que retornar a
los objetivos propuestos.
Desempeño de la CDE
23.    La Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad, como entidad receptora del préstamo tuvo una
participación inadecuada e insatisfactoria durante la ejecución del mismo.
24.    Esta pobreza se matizó básicamente por la falta de seguimiento a las actividades y los
proyectos realizados con los recursos provenientes del préstamo, así como, por la no aplicación o la
aplicación limitada de las recomendaciones de los ejecutores del proyecto y de los consultores.
25.    La falta de supervisión por parte de la CDE constituyó también una causa cuyos resultados
fueron la no consecución de los objetivos que dieron origen a este préstamo.
Desempeño del Gobierno
26.    El Gobierno de la República Dominicana tuvo una participación que puede ser calificada como
buena, en el desarrollo del proyecto.
27.    El cumplimiento del Gobierno en la asignación de los fondos de contrapartida fue cumplida.
Sin embargo, se produjeron algunos retrasos en la aplicación de fondos, casi al final de proyecto,
debido a la utilización inadecuada de los mismos, por parte de la CDE.
28.    Oportuno es señalar, que sin la supervisión de organismos gubernamentales externos, la CDE
desarrolló los proyectos, financiados con este préstamo, con autonomía total y sin supervisión en la
aplicación de los recursos, lo que contribuyó a que se cambiasen, sin la debida evaluación, las
actividades programadas originalmente en el préstamo.
29.    Los retrasos provocados en los pagos a contratistas y a suplidores del proyecto no pueden ser
atribuidos al Gobierno sino a la CDE.
Desempeño de Contratistas
30.    En general, podemos considerar el comportamiento de los contratistas como aceptable, en
reconocimiento de ciertas dificultades de la CDE, con la firma ECEM (DE-02/90), los contratos han
sido ejecutados normalmente y han sido liquidados dentro de los límites y las formas previsibles. Las
firmas DECON, ELECNOR y ABB, en particular, han sido pacientes y siempre han estado dispuestas
a seguir ofreciendo sus servicios dentro de las precariedades existentes, con un alto grado de
comprensión ante la situación actual de la Empresa.

APPENDIX C:
OPERATIONAL PLAN TO MONITOR CDE'S FUTURE OPERATIONS
The operational plan for the sector consists in the implementation of an structural sector reform.
The principles of this reform would be ruled by an Electricity Law that is presently under
consideration by Congress. The Electricity Law would be instrumental for improving sector
performance and for taking advantage of the rehabilitation and expansion works implemented
under the Project.
The proposed sector reform is based on a new strategy for the power sector that includes a
reform of the institutional and market structure. The objectives of the strategy are:
(a)    Improve operating and investment efficiency by introducing direct competition in
generation, yardstick competition in distribution, and private management of the
transmission grid; and
(b)    reduce the financial burden on the GODR by transferring control of distribution
activities to the private sector, attracting private investment for new generation capacity,
and subsequent privatization of existing generation facilities.
To achieve the above objectives, the sector reform would consists of:
(a)    Preparation and enactment of a General Electricity Law to provide an adequate legal
framework for sector development;
(b)    separate government's policy, regulatory, and operating functions in the sector to
increase transparency and public accountability by eliminating overlapping and conflicting
jurisdiction, and to reduce the scope for political interference in commercial operations;
(c)    unbundle   generation, transmission, and    distribution  services  to  introduce
transparency and to assure non-discriminatory access to bulk power supplies;
(d)    horizontally desegregate generation and distribution to establish market conditions
conducive to effective competition. CDE's generating and distribution facilities would be
separated into two thermal and one hydro generating companies and three distribution
companies.
(e)    transfer ownership and control of the distribution facilities to the private sector to
promote increase of efficiency; and


﻿9
(f)   attract private investors for the development of all future generating stations to mobilize
private capital and to finance rehabilitation and new investment.
In 1996, CDE would be unbundled into four Divisions that would be responsible one for the
operation of CDE's hydro and thermal generation, one for the operation of the transmission
system and the dispatch center, one for the operation of the distribution networks and the
commercialization of the electricity to the final consumers, and one to provide support to the
other three divisions. Initial commercial arrangements will be established among them,
specifically:   (a)   a   contract  between   the   Generation   Division  and   the
Distribution/Commercialization (D/C) Division, (b) contracts between the Transmission Division
and the Generation Division; and (c) contracts between the Central Support Division and all
other Divisions. At the same time, the Government would create the institutions established by the
Electricity Law, these are: the National Energy Commission (NEC), the Superintendencia de
Electricidad (SE) and an Operation Coordinator (OC) for the power system.
In 1997, the Government would: (i) incorporate six independent companies to assume the control
and operation of CDE's assets: one hydro and one thermal companies to operate the government
owned hydro and thermal power plants respectively; one transmission utility, and three
distribution/commercialization (D/C) companies, (ii) transfer the D/C companies to one or more
private companies; (iii) appoint a private operator for the management of the transmission
company; and (iv) appoint a private company to provide maintenance services to the government
owned thermal generating company. The D/C companies would be sold with Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) with the government owned generating companies. All additional generation
would be purchased directly by the D/C companies to private generators.
The hydro generating company is expected to remain in the hands of the Government indefinitely
and assume most of present CDE's liabilities, including obligations under prevailing long-term
power purchase agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs).
By 1999, the following actions are expected to be completed: (i) development of dispatch and
settlement system; (ii) split of the generation company into two separate companies; and (iii)
marketing and sale or leasing of the thermal generation companies.
Once the sector reform is implemented, and the distribution system is privatized, the main
indicators to monitor the sector's future performance will be:
(a)   level of electricity losses. In 1995, CDE's electricity losses amounted to about 40% of
CDE's total generation plus purchases of electricity; and.
(b)    cost of electricity. The average cost of electricity to CDE in 1995, including costs of
generating and purchasing electricity, transmitting and distributing electricity, was
estimated at US$0.12 per kWh.
