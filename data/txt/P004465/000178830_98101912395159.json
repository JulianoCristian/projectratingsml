management, and reduce\n            rural unemployment among out-of-school youth by\n            strengthening the National Extension Service of the Ministry\n            of Agriculture (MOA). Under the project the extension\n            service would be strengthened through provision of buildings\n            and equipment, introduction of sound extension methodology,\n            changes in organization, and implementation of a staffing\n            and training program. Also, the project would provide for\n            studies to develop effective monitoring and evaluation\n            procedures and an equitable compensation system. Five\n            million rural families would be reached by the project at a\n            total project cost of $10 per family and an annual\n            incremental operating cost at full development of $2.20 per\n            family. The project would make an important contribution to\n            the benefits expected from many of the ongoing agricultural\n            projects supported by the Bank, particularly the irrigation\n            projects. These rely heavily on the existence of an\n            effective extension service. The project will expand the\n            coverage of the extension service and the smaller,\n            lower-income farmers and their families who receive\n            relatively little assistance at present are expected to benefit."}, "docdt": "1978-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
