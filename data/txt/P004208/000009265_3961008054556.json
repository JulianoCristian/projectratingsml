In confirmation with this\n            goal, the objectives of the project are to foster the\n            development of efficient land markets and to facilitate\n            domestic resource mobilization by providing a system of\n            clear and enforceable land use ownership rights, and by\n            developing a land valuation capacity. The project will\n            support the first seven years of a longer term national land\n            titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and\n            developing land administration and valuation systems,\n            including compiling a cadastral mapping system. The main\n            components of the project are: 1) completion of the policy\n            and legal framework for land management and administration;\n            2) implementation of an accelerated land titling program; 3)\n            improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and systems\n            for land administration; 4) improvements in land valuation;\n            5) support for project management and implementation, and\n            institutional strengthening; and 6) studies on community\n            land tenure and registration, definition of forest\n            boundaries, cost recovery, land rights issues on\n            nationalized lands and socio-economic impact of land titling."}, "docdt": "1996-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
