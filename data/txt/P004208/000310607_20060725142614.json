The overall\n            goal of the project was to strengthen the basis for the\n            long-term sustainable economic and social development of the\n            Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).  In broad\n            terms, the project has contributed significantly to the\n            achievement of the objectives defined in the Staff Appraisal\n            Report (SAR) and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).\n            Lessons learned include:  the use of a preparation grant and\n            a pilot project with bridging finance helped to develop\n            continuity and the early accumulation of practical\n            experience in new techniques and practices where the legal,\n            policy and practical frameworks were at best ill-defined and\n            at worst nonexistent; wherever possible, the objectives of a\n            project should be made as specific as possible and should be\n            defined in discrete and quantifiable terms; it is essential\n            to prepare a base-line study either as part of project\n            preparation or as soon thereafter as possible; the provision\n            of counterpart funds in an adequate amount and a timely\n            fashion is essential to effective project implementation;\n            where significant change and growth is required in public\n            sector institutions as a necessary condition for project or\n            program success, a careful and pragmatic strategy of\n            institutional development is required including the\n            requirements for development and training of human\n            resources; the use of modern technology in projects of this\n            kind is clearly superior to, and more efficient than, older\n            techniques; the indications of malpractices in the\n            implementation of the project lead to the conclusion that\n            other projects under implementation should be subjected to\n            an in-depth review; if studies are considered at appraisal\n            to be important, their preparation should be pursued\n            energetically during project implementation; the experience\n            of the project demonstrates the importance of out-reach\n            activities where significant changes in culture or\n            traditional practices are concerned; the creation of a\n            complete land administration system is an enormous\n            undertaking that must be expected to take decades to\n            achieve; and in this project, a strong case could have been\n            made for standardizing on one manufacturer when additional\n            equipment was required to be purchased."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
