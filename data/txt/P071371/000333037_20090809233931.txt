1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.       Burundi's long civil strife exacted an extremely high social as well as economic toll. Between 1993
and the late 1990s alone, more than 300,000 persons had died, and some 800,000 had been forced to
emigrate. Pervasive poverty, with 70 percent of Burundians living on less than US$1 a day, and a GDP of
about US$100 per capita/year, underpinned and exacerbated development challenges, among the most
serious of which were:

(i) A significant deterioration in health status as reflected in such key indicators as the infant
      mortality rate which rose from 110 to 125 per 1000 live births between 1993 and 1998; prevalence of
      chronic malnutrition among children under five years of age which increased from less than 6
      percent in 1993 to over 20 percent in 2001; and life expectancy at birth which declined from 55 years
      in 1993 to 53 years in 1999 (Burundi : Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, 2007).
(ii) Limited institutional capacity to deliver basic social services. Major gaps in social sector
      financing and in skilled professionals, and the poor state of most public sector facilities and
      equipment, coupled with limited capacity within NGOs and provincial and communal authorities,
      severely limited access to health, education and other social services essential for prevention, control
      and treatment of HIV/AIDS and mitigation of its impact on those infected and affected. Low levels
      of education and literacy, particularly among women, and social disruption perpetuated the vicious
      cycle of poverty and high fertility, exacerbating health risks and slowing development.
(iii) A seemingly high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. During project preparation, the prevalence of adult
      HIV in Burundi was believed to be 12 percent based on UNAIDS estimates, representing a sharp
      increase from less than 1 percent in 1990 (UNAIDS estimate derived largely from epidemiologic
      bulletins from selected sentinel sites on prevalence among pregnant women 15-24 years of age and
      national survey data from 1989-90--the only prevalence data then available). Data from a nationally
      representative sero-prevalence survey conducted in 2001 whose results became available after the
      project had commenced, revealed a significantly lower prevalence rate of 3.9 percent among those
      18 and older, putting the original estimates into question. Significant urban and rural differentials in
      prevalence rates also existed. Nationally, an estimated 19,000 children under 15 and 360,000 adults
      were living with HIV/AIDS, with women disproportionately affected (55.8 percent of all adult cases).
      HIV/AIDS led to an estimated 11,000 to 39,000 deaths annually, and had become the major cause of
      adult deaths, threatening to erode all development gains of the 1970s.
(iv) Hundreds of thousands of orphans, to which HIV/AIDS was a major contributor. Nationally,
     UNICEF and ISTEEBU (Institut des Statistiques et des Etudes Economiques du Burundi) survey
     data indicated some 558,000 children under 14 years of age--one in five in this age group -- had lost
     at least one parent, and 77,000 both parents. According to UNICEF and WHO estimates, some
     160,000 to 230,000 of those orphaned were due to HIV/AIDS.

2.       Despite efforts by the government to change behavior around HIV/AIDS (including the first
National Program launched in 1986, three years after diagnosis of the first cases, and the formulation and
implementation of a 1999-2003 Strategic Plan), successive behavioral surveys revealed limited change in
general knowledge of HIV/AIDS, prevalent high risk behavior, and low use of condoms. Uncoordinated
public and private sector activities hindered the Program's ability to reduce HIV/AIDS prevalence or to
effectively address HIV/AIDS-associated health and social problems.

3.       In July 2001 an autonomous National AIDS Council was created under the Office of the
President, and in November 2001 a designated Ministry of HIV/AIDS was created. These


                                                       1

entities brought attention to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and served as a major impetus to the
development of the 2002-2006 National AIDS Strategic Plan (NASP), developed by the
government. The Plan espoused a multisectoral approach and a highly decentralized public-
private partnership for delivering priority services. Solidly endorsed by donors, the NASP
focused on: (i) prevention; (ii) expanded treatment of PLWHA and activities to mitigate adverse
socioeconomic effects on PLWHA; (iii) intensive capacity building endeavors across public and
private sectors to accelerate the decentralization of the program to provinces, communes, and
local areas; (iv) studies to enrich knowledge of HIV/AIDS; and (v) the institution of an
integrated national AIDS monitoring and evaluation system.

4.       Burundi thus met the four key eligibility criteria for access to IDA resources within the framework
of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) for the Africa Region [(a) satisfactory evidence of a
strategic approach to HIV/AIDS; (b) existence of a high level coordinating body; (c) government agreement
to use exceptional implementation arrangements, including channeling funds directly to implementing
agencies, contracting out activities where appropriate, and adopting simplified administrative procedures;
and (d) use and funding of multiple implementation agencies]. Financing of an HIV/AIDS project also
promised important synergies with the ongoing IDA-supported Second Health and Population Project,
Second Social Action Project, and the Emergency Recovery Credit. Finally, HIV/AIDS was one of the
pillars of IDA's 2002 Transitional Support Strategy.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.       The project supported implementation of Burundi's Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Program (MSHAP)
and its underlying 2002-2006 NASP. Overarching objectives of both the program and the project were to:
(i) slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general population; and (ii) mitigate the impact on those infected
with or affected by HIV/AIDS.

The project indicators reflected a mix of outcome, output and process measures.

      (*) As spelled out in the Supplemental Letter dated July 25, 2002.


      The appraisal baseline values were incorrect for the two first PDO indicators as opposed to those in the
      NASP which are based on the BSS results. No source was found for the appraised data and the ICR
      mission did not find any explanation to this anomaly. The PAD target value for indicator no. 9 is different
      from that in the DCA. Indicator no. 10 was phrased somewhat differently between the PAD and
      the DCA albeit the concept of what needed to be measured is the same in both cases.



                                                                      3

1.3.     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.       Over the project life, no formal revisions were made to the PDOs or to the 10 core KPIs. However,
a spirit of "learning by doing" pervaded the MAOP, as in many first generation MAP projects. TTLs
exercised considerable discretion in selection and use of indicators to report on PDO progress as better
HIV/AIDS information became available, the M&E system matured, and project-supported activities
evolved. The mix and number of KPIs reported in PSRs/ISRs over time varied, using most of agreed KPIs
and adding new indicators, but at that time formal approval for such revisions was not required by Bank
guidelines. All original KPIs continued to be monitored ­ among others ­ by the national M&E system
throughout the project.

7.       Modifications to ISR reporting on KPIs represented important enhancements to performance
monitoring, allowing measurement of project progress in priority investment areas not captured in the
original KPIs. As of March 2004, ISRs reflected (i) 2 new indicators related to the numbers of persons
receiving respectively VCT and ARV treatment (at the start of the project ARVs were considered too costly
to provide to PLWHA; with decreased prices and improved treatment sites and trained personnel, ARV
treatment was begun and monitored); and (ii) the number of orphans placed in families, all of which had
been being monitored within the NASP M&E framework. The ICR assessment is based on the 10 original
KPIs as well as on these 3 additional indicators.

8.       The paucity of timely, reliable, nationally representative HIV/AIDS data at the time of project
preparation and appraisal led to erroneous baseline values provided by the Borrower and consequently
unrealistic targets for two of the core outcome indicators, as mentioned above. This hampered the
assessment of project outcomes based on those values, as discussed later in the ICR. Furthermore, in some
cases where innovative CSO grants were developed, there were no precedents for determining realistic
target indicators. As new reliable data became available, the team modified these outcome indicator targets
informally. In today's Bank this would have constituted a reason for first order restructuring under the
"opportunistic restructuring" label. However, at the time it was not common practice to restructure a
project in order to adjust the indicators, but rather reflect those changes in the Aide memoirs and back to
office reports. Therefore the Mid-term Review (MTR) changed the end-of-project target value for the
percentage of girls 15 years or younger who reported being sexually active--one of the core outcome
indicators--was increased from 10 percent to 18 percent (as compared to an estimated baseline of 18%)
from the 12/20/ 2005 ISR forward solely with a cryptic notation in that ISR's KPI matrix that the original
target was "no longer realistic because of the increase due to war conditions." It was reported for this ICR
that the base line value of 18 per cent was taken from studies done prior to the conflict, and that the results
from the 2001 Behavioral Study Survey (shared in 2002 after project effectiveness) suggested that the real
number was 32.5 percent.

9.       Further, the reliability of KPI values reported in ISRs was uncertain, given the lack of adequate data
quality control measures in the M&E system. Considerable effort was expended on reconciling various data
inconsistencies in the process of preparing this ICR. This underscored continuing challenges the M&E system
faces to become a fully effective Program management information tool as discussed in Section 2.3 below.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

10.      The project was intended to prevent the spread of infection among all groups in Burundi with
special attention to high risk groups, including orphans and other extremely vulnerable children, women of
reproductive age, commercial sex workers, youth in and out of school, long distance truck drivers, people

infected with STIs, armed forces and displaced persons and refugees. Substantial benefits were also
expected to accrue to those infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS through project-supported interventions
to mitigate social and economic impacts. This primary target group remained unchanged throughout the
project.

11.     In addition, through its support for implementation of multisectoral HIV/AIDS efforts through the
public and private sectors, the project was expected to strengthen national capacity to deal effectively and
efficiently with both the current HIV/AIDS epidemic as well as other potential epidemics.

Original Components

Component 1: Strengthening the public sector response to the HIV/AIDS crisis (US$9.3 million). To
expand HIV/AIDS activities implemented by public sector entities.

Component 2- Increasing the civil society response (US$13.4 million): To increase HIV/AIDS
control activities initiated and implemented by grass-roots organizations and communities (as well as
some initiatives of private sector enterprises) in the areas of prevention, mitigation and capacity building
proposed in the National Strategic Plan.

Component 3 - Orphans Integration & Education Pilot (US$ 7 million): To (i) support the
placement of orphans with their extended family; or with an unrelated family; (ii) provide orphans with
scholarships for primary education and vocational training; (iii) strengthen the economic and nutritional
well being of families that care for orphans through investments to supplement nutrition and income-
generating activities; and (iv) provide training for the informal job market to older adolescent orphans.

Component 4 - Strengthening the Program Strategic Formulation, Implementation, Monitoring ,and
Evaluation capacity (US$4 million): to reinforce the capacity of public and private agencies in the
design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS control activities.

Component 5 - Project coordination (US$3 million): to ensure efficient coordination of the project's
HIV/AIDS control activities by all concerned parties.

Revised Components

12.     No components were substantially revised. The definition of orphans targeted in Component 3, however,
was changed from children up to 16 (with one or no parents) to orphans 16 to 18 years of age, a subgroup highly
vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, particularly if they are heads of household and/or unemployed. This change was made
based on the project launch workshop's recommendations, without any amendment of the DCA.

Other significant changes

13.     There were three DCA amendments during the life of the project. They all answer to changing realities
in the country situation. The First Amendment dated March 4, 2005, increased the percentage of IDA financing
100 percent of all categories of Credit expenditures. The Amendment was approved by the country director in
view of the serious counterpart financing problems due to a major deterioration in the country's macroeconomic
situation. The Amendment, not applicable retroactively, required the Government to meet all current outstanding
counterpart financing commitments and debt (subsequently done). It also modified procurement arrangements,
consistent with simplified Bank procurement procedures introduced after Credit signature, and in recognition
that goods such as ARVs, drugs and other related products could only be purchased from a limited number of
suppliers; increased thresholds for national competitive bidding and shopping for selected works and goods; and


                                                       5

        permitted, under certain thresholds, procurement of goods including drugs and medical supplies from UN
        agencies.

        14.      The second and third amendments reflected two reallocations of Credit proceeds (March 30, 2006 and
        June 1, 2007, respectively). Both reallocations were approved by the regional vice-president.

        15.      This reorientation of the project proved crucial to advance the PDOs. Extremely weak capacity within
        the public sector, increasingly evident over the early implementation period, precluded it from assuming the
        central, direct role in implementation envisaged by the project design. In sharp contrast, the civil society actively
        and positively responded to availability of grant financing, with the volume of quality grant requests received
        rapidly exceeding original project targets. After the two reallocations, financing for grants for CSO subprojects
        increased to 76.6 percent, or 46.7 percent of total project financing (Table 2). This substantial increase enabled
        the PES/NAC ultimately to fund 564 (98.6 percent) of the 572 approved CSO subprojects by project's end (see
        Annex 2).

        16.      The reallocations also better aligned Credit financing with evolving program funding needs, particularly
        in light of: (i) availability of alternative sources of financing to procure priority goods originally to be financed
        by MAOP such as ARVs, other drugs and condoms, including increased support from UNDP, UNICEF and the
        EU and new financing from the Global Fund, a new program partner from 2003; (ii) increased demand for
        financing for non-drug related costs of treatment and follow up care of PLWHA by CSOs, for which IDA was
        the primary source; (iii) reduced need for financing for works subsequent to the decision to rehabilitate existing
        small facilities nationwide to serve as youth centers rather than construct two new large ones initially planned;
        and (iv) need for financing of additional studies to both evaluate program performance and inform preparation of
        the National AIDS 2007-2011 Strategic Plan.

        17.      The reallocations contributed to: (i) a major scaling up of the breadth and depth of CSO participation in
        the National AIDS Program, thus successfully deploying much of their unexploited potential to expand access to
        priority services; (ii) mobilization of supplementary Program resources, with CSOs sharing costs of subprojects
        via resources they mobilized from other sources, with Credit-supported grant payments circumscribed
        predominantly to costs associated with direct service provision; and (iii) intensification of community-designed
        and community-led initiatives, thus increasing likelihood of responsiveness to local needs and, importantly,
        sustainability of actions.

18.       Other significant changes included:

   (i) A major expansion of the scale and scope of project support for ARV treatment and for
          orphans. These changes were requested by the government, endorsed in principle by a Bank
          Quality Enhancement Review Panel convened March 8, 2005, prior to the Mid-term review, and
          made effective during that mission. Demand for ARV treatment had risen significantly after the
          government introduced its policy of universal access to treatment (the required reallocation
          resulted in a 70 percent increase in financing for consultants' services, audits and training
          (Category 3) to support increased capacity building and performance-based contract activities; a
          63 percent increase for grants for CSO subprojects, consistent with Mid-Term review
          recommendations to scale up CSO activities; and a 1.7 percent increase in operating costs, to be
          accommodated by decreases in all other expenditure categories.) Extension nationwide of
          coverage of the OVC component responded in part to mounting political pressure amid large
          unmet needs of hundreds of thousands of OVC, but also highly positive, multiple improvements
          in the well-being of orphans and their host families found in an independent, project-financed
          impact evaluation of the three pilot provinces, summarized in Annex 10.

   (ii) Extension through the end of secondary school of MAOP financial support for school fees
          and related education expenses for OVC, with special attention to identifying and providing
          secondary school support to young girls.


2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.       Project preparation proceeded satisfactorily. A fast track approach was adopted, supported by a
$682,400 PHRD (Japanese) grant approved in March 2001, and with the MOH as the main counterpart. The
approach recognized the magnitude of Burundi's HIV/AIDS crisis and significant risks of an increase in
prevalence with greater population mobility in the post-conflict period. The March 2001 Washington visit of a
high level government delegation to solicit Bank financing for the National Program, in which representatives of
NGOs and civil society notably were included, was viewed by Bank management as an "exceptional"
reaffirmation of national HIV/AIDS commitment, and provided additional push.

20.       The design process was highly participatory with: (i) regular consultations with key public and private
sector personnel, including CSO representatives, elected officials, and international stakeholders; and (ii) the
organization of focus groups at the central, regional, and local levels, all working to develop appropriate
strategies at each level.

21.       The design responded well to the need to scale up Burundi's HIV/AIDS response rapidly by providing
strong incentives, including both financial and technical assistance, to fully engage the public and private sectors
and all administrative levels of the nation in the Program. The project design and the national plan it supported
were informed by a series of surveys and studies commissioned by the government to better understand local
attitudes and barriers to behavioral change, particularly among the most vulnerable groups--children, women,
and youth. One example was a survey of the population 15 years of age and younger in which 9 provinces
participated and in which 38 focus group discussions were held with over 2000 persons participating. The
project design also drew extensively on lessons learned from first generation Bank MAP-supported projects,




                                                                    7

from successful HIV/AIDS programs in Uganda and Senegal and, even from Burundi's own decentralized,
community-based operations (Social Action Projects and two community nutrition projects).

22.     Although there were several qualitative studies, quantitative data was scarce because the country's
ongoing conflict impeded the collection of good quality base-line data. Corrections were not included in the
restructuring or formally corrected during project implementation. This resulted in a discrepancy in PDO
indicators between the original project outcome and the final outcome.

23.     A special design challenge arose in mid-2001, with the joint Bank and Government decision to fully
integrate into the HIV/AIDS project a separate project, then under preparation, to support the social integration
and education of orphans. This merger, which brought an additional US$7 million to the orphan's component,
was expected to permit realization of important synergies between the two projects as well as to reduce
administrative costs. Consistent with the original thrust of the orphans' project, the new component would target
only the most vulnerable orphans, regardless of their HIV/AIDS status, and provide them the already agreed mix
of benefits. Needs of the larger group of orphans were to be addressed by other HIV/AIDS project components.

24.     The relatively late integration of this new component on the orphans in the design phase of the project
presented substantial risks. The project executing agency, the National Council (PES/NAC), had no specialized
expertise or experience in the area of orphans. The risk was largely mitigated by the Council's recruitment of an
expert team involved in preparation of the original orphans' project to guide the execution of the component (for
which Norwegian Trust Funds were used until the project became effective in order to ensure continuity of
preparation and leadership). The Orphans Steering Committee, established as part of the initial orphans' project
preparation process, was also tapped to review all CSO subprojects serving orphans. Its agreement to the
appropriateness and consistency of targeting criteria was a condition of the PES/NAC's final approval of the
financing of these subprojects.

25.     Project Quality at Entry, was compromised, by the preparation team's significant underestimation of the
high risks associated with serious capacity constraints at all levels, particularly shortages of qualified
professionals, as discussed in Section 2.2.

2.2. Implementation

26.     The Credit became effective on October 7, 2002, approximately two months later than expected,
followed immediately by a highly participatory project launch with over 140 representatives from all sectors as
well as beneficiary groups affirming broad "buy-in" for the project. Initially project implementation advanced
steadily but at a far slower pace than projected, amid institutional capacity constraints not adequately identified
during preparation.

27.     Incomplete project documentation hampers assessment of the extent to which the implementation
strategy pursued by the government and the Bank was appropriate, including whether sufficient priority was
assigned to those interventions most likely to reduce HIV transmission, especially among high risk groups. The
vagueness in project documents of what "actually happened on the ground" was underscored by the September
2006 QSA7 Panel.

28.     Public sector response: The KPI target for this component was attained. However, the quality and
number of action plans and activities varied significantly across central ministries. This was due in large part to
the exodus of many highly qualified public sector staff to CSOs, external assistance agencies, and neighboring
countries during the conflict. Nonetheless, by project end, all ministerial departments had some definable Action
Plan established.




                                                     8

29.      Contrary to the PAD's assumption that the MOH "should have little problem in scaling up its operations,"
(Para 4.1, p. 25) its HIV/AIDS sectoral unit had limited capacity, which led the MOH at mid-term to recruit four
additional specialists -- a physician/health planner, an epidemiologist, an infectious disease physician, and a
pharmacist. With this improved capacity, the unit produced solid guidelines for treatment, certification of
facilities and staff training, and improved projections of pharmaceutical needs. In 2006 an in-depth cross-
ministerial strategic planning exercise resulted in improved plans.

30.      Despite implementation problems at the central level, the eight Ministries key to the fight against
HIV/AIDS, had integrated a solid HIV/AIDS action plan, with budget, into their sectoral strategy by the end of
the project, leaving a solid base for sustainability beyond the MAOP Project.

31.      At the decentralized level, the project preparation team's assumption that existing capacity in provincial,
communal and local committees was "good enough to ensure speedy implementation from project launch" (PAD
p. 26) proved to be overly optimistic. Trained personnel constraints slowed the decentralization process and
perpetuated inequities in access to quality HIV/AIDS care and services (March 2005 Mid-Term Review).

32.      Notwithstanding, over time, decentralized public entities, particularly provincial authorities, assumed a
major role in project execution, not as implementing agencies, as had been initially envisaged, but rather in
mobilizing, coordinating and guiding the response of local CSOs, in strengthening their capacity, and in
monitoring and evaluation, including data collection and analysis. Local authorities were represented in all
provincial and communal committees reviewing subproject proposals and were closely involved in monitoring
subproject performance. They were, thus, instrumental in forging the dynamic public-private partnership that
propelled the project forward.

33.      MAOP also provided essential technical and financial support for accelerating the decentralization of the
(PES/NAC). By the project's second year, Provincial Committees had been established and were operative in all
17 provinces. Communal Committees were also operating in all of 17 provinces. By 2004, AIDS Communal
Committees were in operation in all 129 communes. These decentralized Council Committees provided an
institutional base for full engagement of local authorities in project-supported activities.

34.      The civil society response was exceptionally strong, with subproject grant requests greatly exceeding
original project expectations and targets. Fueled by the availability of grant financing, CSOs rapidly scaled up
the breadth and depth of delivery of HIV/AIDS education and services. Engagement of the CSO sector in the
HIV/AIDS Program fostered substantial innovation and experimentation. It also promoted a highly participatory,
inclusive approach with PLWHA, women and youth, among others, actively engaged in subproject activities.

35.      The Orphan Component scaled up quickly. By mid-term, responding to its good results and the demand
from communities and local authorities, it was expanded nation-wide. Over the life of the project, this
component was largely mainstreamed into the public sector and civil society components of the project. CSOs
were particularly responsive to addressing OVC needs, with 181 OVC subprojects financed in total, representing
one-third of the total 564 CSO grants provided by MAOP (see Annex 2).

36.      The Mid-Term Review (October-November 2005) marked a critical juncture in the project. On March 8,
2005, a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was held, attended by both the Bank project team and their
government counterparts. Suggestions were made regarding: (i) essential preconditions to ensure the success of
the proposed expansion of coverage of the OVC component and of ARV treatment (approved at Mid-Term); (ii)
the desirability of addressing human resource constraints cross-sectorally within the Burundi portfolio; and (iii)
the high priority that must be assigned to establishing a truly national, integrated M&E HIV/AIDS system. The
QER panel also underscored the need for the Bank team to significantly improve ISR documentation, with a
wide divergence found between the quality of the Aide Memoires and the ISRs.




                                                       9

37.     The MTR team assigned a generally "satisfactory" rating to overall implementation performance and
noted that several components had advanced well. It also identified potential challenges to full achievement of
DOs (though maintaining a "satisfactory" rating for both DO and IO in the ensuing ISR). Among priority next
steps were: (i) improvements in institutional arrangements, the clarification of discrete roles and responsibilities
of all executing agencies, and the enhancement of activity coordination; (ii) full compliance with mandated
financial management requirements, including timely submission of FMRs; and (iii) solid, more systematic
monitoring and evaluation of all project activities, with special attention to CSO-executed subprojects which had
scaled up rapidly. With improved monitoring of these steps following the MTR, project implementation progress
accelerated substantially.

38.     Despite the generally positive outcome of the MTR, it became evident in mid 2006 that the closing date
of the project would have to be extended in order to fully expend the credit proceeds.

39.     Disbursements lags over the project period were primarily due to :
         
(i)      Favorable exchange rate fluctuations over the life of the project that increased total Credit
        financing to almost US$43 million equivalent, an increment of 19 percent (about one year of
        implementation) over the US$36 million original amount based on appreciation of the SDR to
        dollar exchange rates from the time of Board approval. 
(ii)    The slow process of putting in place essential conditions for effective implementation including
        intensive capacity building across the public sector and CSOs and the finalization of procedural
        manuals, financing code and forms for submission and evaluation of CSO grants and training of
        decentralized Council Committees in their use. 
(iii)   The initially weak financial planning of the PES/NAC leading to a substantial overdraw of the
        sub-project category and the consequent stop of disbursements for this category until a
        reallocation was formally proposed by government and approved. 
(iv)    Local banks' periodic freezing of funds within the project's Special Account to cover outstanding
        Letters of Credit, thereby obstructing payment to foreign suppliers upon delivery of procured
        goods. This practice, specific to Burundi, resulted in periodic, unanticipated shortfalls in project
        funding. Eventually, the World Bank agreed to lower thresholds for IDA direct payment of
        foreign suppliers, while PES/NAC improved its financial management, allowing more frequent
        replenishment of the Special Account. 

40.     In November 2006, the government requested a one year extension of the credit's closing date. The Bank
team, however, advised and received a 23 month extension, which proved to be helpful in bridging unforeseen
financing gaps. Indeed, the volatility of Global Fund (GF) resources had a substitution effect on government use
of project resources. Specifically, when the second tranche of Round 5 of the GF was delayed, and Burundi's
proposal for Round 7 was not approved, the government was compelled to allocate project proceeds away from
fast disbursing activities (drugs) that could be covered by the GF remnant resources toward slow disbursing
operational costs that were supposed to be covered by the GF. While IDA's flexibility ensured the PES/NAC
and the national program continuous operation, as recognized by GF reports, it had a deleterious effect on the
pace of disbursement.

41.     During implementation two other problems arose, the risks of which were not foreseen. First, periodic
shortages in the initial project years of antiretroviral medicines and reagents threatened discontinuity of care for
PLWHA and reduced testing capacity. The government attributed these disruptions to long and often arduous
procurement procedures. A March 8, 2005 DCA amendment permitting the government to use Bank simplified
procurement methods alleviated this problem. Second, significant geographic and gender disparities in access to



                                                       10

key HIV/AIDS interventions emerged. Uneven geographic distribution of HIV/AIDS service delivery sites, due
to both capacity and security constraints, left some provinces significantly under- if not un-served. M&E system
data on beneficiaries of youth centers and school-based Stop AIDS Clubs-- key National AIDS Program
modalities to reach this key target group--revealed that girls 15 years of age and younger were substantially
underserved--a group at substantial risk of HIV/AIDS because of their relatively high rates of sexual activity, as
highlighted in the KPIs in Table 1. In future, activities will be considerably more targeted toward at-risk
populations.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


42.      The project invested substantially in building the capacity of the new National AIDS Monitoring and
Evaluation System.

43.      M&E Design: The M&E system for the multisectoral HIV/AIDS Control Program was designed, and
established with project funds and IDA's technical assistance. Financial support included financing of: (i)
salaries of M&E staff; (ii) training of the staff; (iii) technical assistance; and (iv) decentralization of the M&E
system, with a multisectoral M&E team established in 2006 in each of the 17 provinces to enhance local data
collection and analysis.

44.      The indicators identified to monitor progress toward PDO were adequate, given the knowledge available
at the time of appraisal. The seventh indicator ­ regarding orphans -- in the DCA referred to access of services
for orphans at the community level, while the seventh indicator in the PAD referred to the placement of orphans
into families. The NASP' s arrangements for results-monitoring included the latter, plus another indicator on
access to psychosocial support. The base-line data given in the DCA was collected during a period of conflict
and proved to be both outdated and not fully representative of the overall country situation. This was first made
clear in 2002 when the government released data from the 2001 National HIV/AIDS Survey, and subsequently as
data from new surveys of greater extent became available.

45.      M&E Implementation: The challenges of establishing a national AIDS M&E system which would
respond in a reliable and timely manner to the demanding HIV/AIDS Program were not fully recognized in
the project design. The quantity and quality of data improved over the life of the project: initially, as the
M&E system was being designed and set-up, data collection was spotty; following the mid-term review,
more attention was given to the system and improvements were made. Nonetheless, to date, although
project data were gathered using adequate collection methods, no data audit has been carried out to verify
quality. There were data inconsistencies while gathering data for this report. Among key challenges faced
were:

(i)      The lack of previous M&E system experience in the country to build upon, and hence weak
         institutional capacity in M&E to support the new system
(ii)     Increasing demands on the M&E team, over time, by the Bank and other Program partners to
         expand the number of indicators monitored and the sophistication of analysis
(iii)    The need for systematic compilation and coordination of data across diverse administrative levels
         and key entities, e.g. EPISTAT, the Sector Unit of the MOH, and the PES/NAC's own teams
         managing the diverse MAOP components. Though in theory one national integrated M&E
         system existed, in reality, parallel collection points and even duplication of data frequently
         occurred
(iv)     Use of a plethora of data collection instruments, complicating data entry and management
(v)      Incomplete reporting of requisite data, including reports from many MOH health centers and
         hospitals on STDs and OI treatment



                                                         11

(vi)     Inadequate base-line data which impedes assessing the impact of specific program interventions
(vii)    Insufficient transfer of skills by the external technical expert to fully prepare the M&E team to
         assume M&E system responsibilities when that technical assistance ended.

46.     Serious M&E problems were flagged in Bank supervision reports throughout much of the project
life. The October 2004 supervision mission, noting significant shortfalls at that point in the M&E system --
a full two years into implementation--reached agreement with the Council to streamline data collection,
simplify data entry and, notably, "recruit full-time M&E staff to coordinate M&E activities." Nevertheless,
more than a year later, the December 2005 supervision mission underscored continuing significant lags in
development of the M&E system that "threatened timely, reliable measurement of the final project
outcome."

47.     The quality and timeliness of data reporting was enhanced over time by training partner
organizations in data management and analysis, and introduction of more standardized data collection tools.
The resultant far more systematic reporting enabled the PES/NAC to prepare and widely disseminate
quarterly M&E reports. Better mobilization and use of GAMET (Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation
Team) support during supervision missions, and additional technical assistance from ASAP (AIDS Strategy
& Action Plan, a joint UNAIDS /World Bank program) in the latter years of the project, also helped
strengthen overall M&E capacity.

48.     M&E Utilization: Data from the M&E system have been used for strategy definition, policy
orientation and resource mobilization. Specifically, results from the M&E system shaped the 2007-2011
strategy as follows: (i) preventive strategies focused on at risks groups; (ii) prioritizing prevention of mother
to child transmission efforts; (iii) expanding orphan efforts to the whole territory; (iv) improving ARV
needs forecasting; (vi) preparing the different rounds of the Global Fund documents and the IDA second
MAP. Other uses of data generated by the M&E system were: (i) preparation of regular, six month Program
status reports shared with the Bank and other Program partners and used extensively by Bank supervision
missions to monitor project progress; and (iii) preparation of proposals and definition of strategic directions
and annual planning for other external support to the Program, including for several rounds of the Global
Fund.

49.     However, the system was not effectively utilized as a day-to-day management tool for the National
AIDS Program. For instance it is only in the last year of the project that data were used to actively redirect
investments to underserved areas and hot spots.

50.     In conclusion, although designing and implementing the M&E system represents a significant, solid
project achievement, there are still weaknesses fragile in select areas. Major challenges ahead are: (i) to refine
the system, as needed to improve the timeliness and quality and reliability of routine inputs; and (ii) further
enhance team capacity to manage the large volume of data compiled and translate data into relevant reports,
policy analyses, etc. to inform and guide Program management decision making. The issues facing the M&E
system and the consequent measures needed to improve it will form an integral part of the institutional
strengthening component of the Second HIV/AIDS Project.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

51.     Environment: The project was originally assigned a "B" category. Accordingly Provision 5.01 of
the DCA stipulated that the Borrower prepare, within three months of project effectiveness, a medical waste
management plan (MWMP). Thereafter, however government encountered difficulties in implementing the
MWMP and ensuring the collection, disposal and management of medical waste, which posed some health
and environmental risks. Lack of progress on this front was not actually flagged to management until some
three years into project implementation. Under increased monitoring, by 2007 selected health staff had


                                                      12

been trained on appropriate disposal of medical waste, and guidelines and norms had been developed by
MOH for handling waste by health facilities.

52.      Subsequently, the MWMP was revised and updated. It was publicly announced in February 2008
and approved by the government in March 2008. Its implementation is to go into effect within the Second
HIV/AIDS Project. Recently, the MOH and PES/NEC jointly identified priority medical waste management
activities and committed to the quick implementation of the 2009 Plan of Action to fulfill this outstanding
Covenant. Overall, the difficulties in executing the MWMP stemmed more from post-conflict capacity
limitations than from lack of commitment by the Borrower. During the MOAP, the country had no national
environment strategy. Environmental capacity is often weak in post-conflict settings, and future projects
should take into account the unique limitations such countries face.


Procurement, Disbursement and Financial Management (FM)

53.      Procurement: Project-supported procurement proceeded smoothly overall, with a total of 116
tenders over the project life, all successfully concluded within budget. Disaggregating total procurement by
category, almost 90 percent of the project's $13.5 million was spent on equipment and supplies.

54.      Procurement was facilitated by: (i) recruitment and retention, from preparation through the end of
the project, of a two-person procurement team well versed in Bank procedures from prior work on a Bank-
supported health project; and (ii) continuous technical support from the procurement specialist at the Bank
country office. Intensive capacity building across the diverse line ministries, CSOs and community
organizations involved in pharmaceutical and medical supplies procurement by the PES/NAC's
Procurement Specialist helped to improve procurement processes nationally, one of the most important
project legacies. In 2007 delayed communications between the Technical and Finance departments of the
NAC led to a temporary overestimation of available funds for project implementation. Examples included
(i) delayed equipment supply and training of personnel for the implementation of the MWMP; and (ii)
delayed equipment and furniture supply for the National Center for Blood Transfusion. These issues were
quickly remedied with Bank support during the February 2007 supervision mission and thereafter.

55.      Financial Management. Intensive Bank training of the PES/NAC's financial management team
(intended to reduce the high financial management risk generally associated with Bank-financed MAP
projects) had an important multiplier effect: the PES/NAC team conducted extensive training of executing
agencies of the diverse project components.

56.      A major financial management problem was the PES/NAC financial team's failure to submit the
four DCA mandated quarterly financial management reports (FMRs) for 2004 or for the first quarter of
2005. This reporting failure, coupled with difficulties of the government to secure counterpart financing
over this period and inadequate supervision (by the PES/NAC) of the accounting function, as reported in
the ISRs, led to Bank downgrading of financial management in the May 2005 ISR to "moderately
unsatisfactory." Notably, this was the first ISR to assign less than a "satisfactory" rating to financial
management and the first to alert Bank management about the several missing FMRs (all of which were
finally received in June 2005). An Action Plan for improved financial management was agreed with the
government as part of the Mid-Term review and from that point, close monitoring of financial
management is evident in all ensuing ISRs. Though all outstanding FMRs had been issued by the end of
June 2005, from March 2006 until June 2008 the financial management rating was upgraded to, but
sustained at "moderately satisfactory." Over this period, stronger linkages were established between
financial disbursements and actual activities, and communications were improved between the PES/NAC's
financial management and procurement teams to ensure adequate funds were available to support planned
procurement. With these improvements, in June 2008, albeit less than six months prior to project closing,


                                                      13

the rating for financial management was deemed "satisfactory." It is noteworthy that satisfactory,
unqualified audit reports were received each year.

57.      Examining disbursement flows, Bank and project executing agency data provide quite distinct
patterns. As noted in the ICR Basic Data Sheet, actual Bank disbursements over the project period closely
followed projections. While the graphs in the Bank system are based on cumulative disbursement flows,
those prepared by the PES/NAC are based on actual disbursement flows per year as shown in Annex 1(e).
These more closely mirror the early implementation progress (with a relatively slow rate of disbursements
over the initial few years), a peak disbursement rate in 2005 (particularly after the Bank assumed 100
percent of financing), and a gradual decline in 2006 with lower but steady disbursements thereafter.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

58.      The need to sustain the significant HIV/AIDS Program momentum created by the first project and
address newly emerging needs is well understood. The country's continued heavy reliance on external
support to meet HIV/AIDS Program needs is also fully recognized. Continued Bank involvement is
viewed as crucial to consolidate and scale up effective interventions under the first project and to fill
continuing serious financing gaps confronting the National HIV/AIDS 2007-2011. IDA is the only source
willing to fund select, priority prevention and treatment activities delineated in that Plan and to reinforce
multisectoral activities. With the Bank, the government wants to benefit from the comparative advantages
of the public sector and civil society gains to progressively mainstream HIV/AIDS activities in key
ministries. It wants to further decentralize implementation in order to maximize the Program's longer term
sustainability. To ensure the requisite financial bridge for these priority actions through 2009, IDA
financing was made available through a Second HIV/AIDS Project (preparation of which began in
December 2007). This three-year project in the amount of SDR 9.4 million (US$15 million equivalent)
was financed by IDA-14 funds was approved by the Board on May 13, 2008, had its DCA signed on July
16, 2008, and was declared effective October 9, 2008, before the first Project closed.

59.      Building on lessons learned in the MAOP and other MAP projects, the Second Project adopts a
sectoral approach, financing a slice of the overall costs of the 2007-2011 National HIV/AIDS Strategy.
Through its four components, the project will support: (i) reduction of transmission among high risk
groups through carefully tailored IEC specifically programs promoting behavioral change and increasing
access to preventive services including male circumcision; (ii) implementation of the MWMP rolled over
from MAOP; (iii) expansion nationwide of PLWHA access to ARV and OI treatment, with services to be
provided via performance-based contracts signed between the MOH and public and private health
facilities; (iv) provision of small grants for decentralized subprojects to provide monetary and other
support to high risk groups and HIV-affected families, including support to protect rights of HIV/AIDS
orphans and widowed women; (v) strengthening the capacity of key ministries and local authorities to
implement and monitor HIV/AIDS control activities; and (vi) operational costs for managing the National
Program including improving the M&E system.

3 Assessment of Outcomes

60.      A preliminary assessment of project performance was shared with the government in an April
2009 Aide Memoire, based on initial findings from a March 23-29, 2009, mission to Burundi. The paucity
of data available during that mission precluded drawing firm conclusions on project performance. The
ensuing sections take into account government comments on that preliminary assessment as well as
substantial project data subsequently provided by PES/NAC.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation



                                                       14

61.      The relevance of the project's development objectives and implementation is rated "satisfactory."
The PDOs are as relevant now as during MAOP preparation. A MAOP-supported national sero-
prevalence survey in 2007 found select subgroups of the population were at particularly high risk of
HIV/AIDS, with a 4.46 percent rate among displaced persons and 38 percent prevalence found among
female sex workers. Greater mobility of the population as political stability deepens poses a real threat of
an increase in prevalence rates unless intensified prevention and control activities are undertaken. This
could lead to an increase in the number of HIV/AIDS orphans, currently estimated to be about 25 percent
of the some 800,000 orphans and vulnerable children nationally, or about 200,000 children.

62.      Despite strong government commitment to attain growth with equity, Burundi's still fragile
national reconstruction process and slow economic growth seriously constrain social development. It
remains one of the poorest countries in the region as revealed by such key measures as its US$110 per
capita annual income and a maternal mortality rate of 1100 per 100,000 live births, among the highest in
the Region.

63.      Combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic was designated as one of four strategic pillars of the 2006
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) presented to the IDA and IMF Boards in March 2007.
Furthermore, the attainment of the other three pillars depend largely on slowing the epidemic and
mitigating its effects. The PDOs remain consistent with the overall Bank Country Assistance Strategy
approved in 2008, and in specific with its objectives to improve access to social services and consolidate
social stability. The PDO also is consonant with two key Bank sector strategies -- the 2007-2011
HIV/AIDS Agenda for Action and the 2007 HNP strategy.

64.      HIV/AIDS prevalence rates continue to be high in rural areas, where 90 percent of Burundi's
population resides. Its impact will continue to exert a powerful downward drag on development and exact
high associated economic, social, and political costs, significantly threatening progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

65.      Achievement of the project's two primary PDOs (slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigating
its effects) is rated "Moderately Satisfactory." Projected causal linkages between key activities financed
by the project, output indicators and anticipated outcomes were reasonable. There is some evidence that
the project helped reduce or stabilize HIV transmission, and its positive impact on the education of
orphans (i.e. mitigation of risks) was substantial, given that they had higher enrollment rates than their
non-orphaned peers. There appears to have been large improvement, from a low base, in the number of
people receiving VCT and ARV treatment. Given questions about the data, a marginally satisfactory rating
has been given.

66.      Attribution: Given that IDA funds accounted for between 80 and 90 percent of the national
program resources for HIV/AIDS activities until 2006 and for about 60 percent in 2007 (see graph 1.1 in
Annex 1) much of the progress made during the project period can be attributed to project activities.

HIV prevalence appears to have stabilized or to have declined.

67.      Survey data suggests that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS may be at least stabilizing if not declining
among the general population in Burundi, with a slight decrease in prevalence observed among youth 15-
24 years old (from 3.5% in 2001 to 3.1% in 2007)--a key target group for the National AIDS Program
and the project. HIV prevalence among pregnant women receiving prenatal care at sentinel sites also



                                                      15

seemed to decline between 2002 and 2007 (see Table 11.1 in Annex 11). It should be noted, however, that
when ARV treatment began being provided, international health authorities agreed that HIV prevalence in
the general population was no longer a viable measure of HIV transmission (although if prevalence goes
down in the face of increasing access to effective ARV treatment which would extend the lives of PLWHA,
then incidence must be declining).

Slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS

68.      Public sector commitment to increasing HIV/AIDS awareness among staff and constituents.
Progress was made in developing a multisectoral approach towards educating the entire population about
HIV/AIDS. By project end all 30 central level public sector institutions had instituted annual HIV/AIDS
Action Plans (up from 8 out of 20 in 2002). Through these plans, heavily focused on IEC, about 308,065
civil servants, their families, and sector constituents, were reached, not only raising their awareness of the
epidemic but also of behavioral changes needed to protect against infection (see Annexes 2 and 11).

69.      Improved safety and management of the nation's blood supply. Over the project period, the
prevalence of HIV among those donating blood fell from 0.50 percent to 0.36percent although there are
possible issues with the quality of the data (see Table 11.3 in Annex 11).

70.      Behavioral change has occurred among some key groups. The percentage of adults using a
condom during contact with a non-regular sexual partner rose from 12.7 percent in 2001 to 19.8 percent in
2007 (National Behavioral Survey data). Over the same period, the percentage of girls 15 and under
sexually active decreased from 32.5 percent to 21.5 percent. Nonetheless, survey data also shows that by the
project's end, the risk of HIV infection of these same populations was still quite high (see Core KPI table, p.
2) compared to other countries in the region.

71.      Increases in access to voluntary counseling and testing and preventive services. Over the
course of the project, the number of functioning VCT sites increased four-fold. Almost 3000 persons were
trained in counseling and testing, increasing the number of informed persons seven-fold, and disaggregated
data by age and gender are available (see Annex 2 and Annex 11). By project end, 15-17 percent of
Burundi's population may have been tested (depending on how often individuals had themselves
re-tested).

72.      Youth-oriented HIV/AIDS education scaled up significantly. The 4410 young people trained
under the project to serve as peer educators (over 30 for each of the 129 communes) has created a strong
cadre with substantial promise of reaching successive cohorts of youth with crucial information to impact
their behavior and reduce the risk of infection. 131 youth centers were created (covering all 129
communes) and 972 Stop SIDA Clubs were started nationwide.

73.      Condom distribution. Consistent with the project's approach of reaching the general population
with key preventive activities, over 52 million condoms were distributed over the life of the project (Table 6,
Annex 11).

Mitigating the adverse effects of HIV/AIDS.

74.      Significant expansion of PMCT sites to serve both mothers and newborns. The number of
PMCT sites increased from 1 in 2002 to 63 in 2008, contributing directly to a ten-fold increase in the
number of pregnant sero-positive women treated over this same period. (Annex 2). Despite this major scale
up of effort, unmet needs for PMCT are significant, with less than 8 percent of HIV infected pregnant
women covered by the close of the project (see table 11.5, Annex 11).



                                                       16

75.      Similarly, 1,299 newborns of sero-positive mothers were treated in 2008 compared to only 274 in
2002 (Annex 2), but coverage remained far below needs (see Table 11.6, Annex 11).

76.      Rapid expansion of ARV and OI treatment capacity: The number of PLWHA receiving ARV
treatment increased from 600 in 2002 to 14,343 in 2008. 68 centers for ARV treatment were established,
ARV treatment providers were trained, home-based care systems were developed and drugs and medical
supplies were provided. The 43.7 percent ARV coverage rate attained in 2007 substantially exceeded the
average 30 percent for the Sub-Saharan Africa region, although such comparisons are complicated. (see
Table 11.7 and 11-8, Annex 11).

77.      Substantial improvements in well-being of orphans: The project contributed to a major
expansion of access by orphans and vulnerable children to education through 2006 (when school support
was assumed by UNICEF), medical and psychosocial support (see Table 11.9, Annex 11).

78.      Project inputs generated numerous positive outcomes for both orphans and their families. Primary
school enrollment increased, while rates of repetition and dropout decreased. Between school year 2002-3
and 2004-2005 the number of orphans receiving school assistance went from 5245 to 19,565, i.e. virtually
the totality of the estimated 19,800 orphans of primary school age in the three provinces at the time.
Enrollment, rates of promotion, and non-drop out rates among assisted orphans were clearly better than
those of their non-orphan peers in the three pilot provinces. Moreover, although the overall numbers of
orphans enrolled at the secondary school level was significantly lower than those attending primary school,
major advances also were achieved in this key age group: the number of orphans assisted increased from
176 in the 2002-3 academic year to 1655 in the 2004-5 academic year, and their rate of promotion increased
from 60.2 percent in the 2002-2003 school year to 83.4 percent in the 2004-5 school year.

79.      These advances contrast sharply with the findings of a 2003 social analysis in the pilot area
indicating that only 43.2 percent of orphans of school age were enrolled in school; that dropouts were
common due to lack of funds to pay school fees and other educational needs; low motivation to continue
schooling; halting of schooling, particularly by girls, to carry out domestic chores including caretaking of
brothers and sisters; interruption of schooling during the national conflict coupled with low reintegration in
schools by those older orphans; and non-enrollment of orphans because the support families, with limited
resources, favored enrollment of their own children.

80.      Other important outcomes that the 2006 orphans component evaluation revealed included:
attainment of new vocational/technical competencies among older orphans attending project-supported
workshops; improvements in the living conditions of orphans as a result of project supported economic and
food supports to the families in which the orphans resided; and increased identification and resolution of
cases of orphan exploitation and abuse, as highlighted in Annex 10.

81.      In summary, the above indicators reflect substantial progress made towards achievement of the
PDOs over a relatively short time period and under difficult country circumstances. These indicators may
be better gauges of project performance than the original KPIs because: (i) two of the original baseline
values presented in the DCA were incorrect (see para. 6), thus underestimating the magnitude of
improvement expected in these indicators by the end of the project (the baseline for percentage of adults
using condoms with non-regular partners actually was 12.7 percent, not 43 percent; and the percentage of
girls 15 and younger who were sexually active was 32.5 percent, not 18 percent); (ii) two KPIs related to
new OVC initiatives (percentage of orphans advancing from one grade of primary school to the next and
percentage receiving psychosocial support within their communities) for which there were no baseline data
and hence no solid basis for setting targets; and (iii) the low starting point from which the MAOP
embarked (post conflict and inexistent HIV/AIDS infrastructure). In aggregate, these factors strongly


                                                      17

suggest that many KPI targets were unrealistic. Based solely on DCA KPIs, one of the four outcome targets,
two of the three output targets and one of the three process targets were fully met; one process target was
partially met (see Table 1).

3.3 Efficiency

82.      Project efficiency is rated as moderately satisfactory using criteria applied in other MAP projects.

83.      Slow start-up of implementation in first few years. Because the public sector was weaker than
expected at project outset, considerable effort had to be expended over the first few years to organize and
train key executing agencies at all levels. Secondly, the fast track preparation process did not allow
sufficient time to prepare the ground for project execution prior to project launch. Preparation activities --
such as design refinement, evaluative instrument testing and fine-tuning, and development of financing and
monitoring and evaluating systems -- had to be finalized during the implementation period. This slowed the
pace of overall project implementation and contributed to disbursement lags in the first years.

84.      Phased capacity-building of public sector institutions. The project pursued a three-phased
strategy to assist PSOs in developing HIV/AIDS Action Plans: (i) organization of training workshops on
elaboration of plans with representatives from the HIV/AIDS sector units within each Ministry; (ii)
mobilization of resource persons to assist these sectoral units, when needed, to finalize their plans; and (iii)
validation of the sectoral plans through consultations with sectoral staff and their beneficiaries. This
systematic approach resulted in final Action Plans for all 30 PSOs by project end compared to 8 at the
project outset.

85.      Adoption of a generalized rather than targeted approach. Based on project results, it was found
that the substantial project resources spent for mass media-delivered IEC, mass condom distribution and
promotion of the wide utilization of VCT was not the most efficient use of funds. A 2007 socio-behavioral
study showed that the HIV/AIDS radio transmissions reaching out to an estimated 4 million Burundians,
actually had limited impact. Taking these lessons into account, the Second HIV/AIDS Project will adopt a
far more targeted approach, delivering interventions that have been proven to respond to risks among the
most vulnerable groups.

86.      Within the public sector component, the effort expended by the PES/NAC to engage all line
Ministries in the HIV/AIDS Program was inefficient. Many of the ministries were not committed to the
program despite NAC/PES staff time and effort. While seven Ministries incorporated HIV/AIDS plans and
budgetary resources into their sectoral programs, many Ministries committed only part-time staff to their
HIV/AIDS sectoral unit and appear to have limited their HIV/AIDS actions to IEC. The Second HIV/AIDS
Project has adopted a more strategic, targeted approach to engagement of line Ministries, with identification
of lead Ministries to promote and facilitate actions by others within their cluster.

87.      Efficient Management of CSO subprojects. Management of the CSO subprojects was efficient,
and since almost one-half of total project disbursements went into this component, it translates into project
efficiency. The evaluation of financed subprojects consistently revealed high payoffs from invested funds
in the first few years of project implementation. A 2007 financial audit of 66 subprojects revealed overall
satisfactory performance (and led to the exclusion of some grant recipients who failed to meet performance
standards). A 2008 evaluation of subprojects also indicated a strong performance. A recent independent
audit of the 564 subproject grants funded in the course of the project revealed only 12 poorly performing
subprojects. Those 12 projects represented just 2.3 percent of the total number of subprojects, and 1.6
percent of the total financing disbursed under this category.




                                                     18

88.     Underlying these impressive results were: (i) careful development of the financing code guiding
grant applications that required extensive analysis of subproject plans, expected outcomes and indicators
and strict application of subproject selection criteria by the PES/NAC and its provincial and communal
Committees; (ii) circumscription of CSO overheads to 10 percent of subproject costs; (iii) substantial
accountability, with systematic internal and external audits to assess performance and compliance with
contracts and elimination of CSOs not performing at acceptable standards from eligibility for future grants;
and (iv) transparency of the process, with detailed information on all grants disseminated publicly.

89.     Performance-based contracts. Another efficient change took place in late 2006, when
the project introduced performance-based contracts (PBCs) for grants provided to CSOs
delivering regular, continuous medical services, while maintaining standard grant agreements for
CSOs carrying out local initiatives of a defined duration. Use of PBCs led to major efficiencies
in grant management due to: (i) clarity regarding beneficiaries and expected results from the
outset which facilitated performance monitoring and the release of grant tranches; (ii) the
reduced need for PES/NAC support to CSOs; (iii) direct flow of funds to provincial heads of
CSOs and more rapid disbursement of subproject financing; (iv) reduced cost per beneficiary, as
all costs not directly linked to the service to be delivered were eliminated from financing; (v)
cost efficiencies through the sharing of experiences across CSOs; and (vi) an increased sense
among CSOs of partnership with the PES/NAC through greater collaboration and interaction in
the course of implementation.

90.     Approval and oversight of both PBCs and standard CSO grants were highly decentralized. The
respective NAC Provincial Committees played a major role ensuring satisfactory technical execution,
appropriate accounting, and timely and effective monitoring and reporting.

91.     Finally, efficient use of project funds lay in the wide use of relatively low-cost, community-based, often
innovative models to deliver priority HIV/AIDS education and services. Peer education among youth,
community educators or animateurs, and community home care providers to ensure continuity of ARV and OI
patients are among these services. The latter also reduced the need for hospitalization and additional health
system costs.

92.     One notable, but controversial inefficiency in the MAOP was the decision by the PES/NAC to limit CSO
contracts to just one year from the beginning until the of the project closing. While this facilitated high quality
control over contracts and reduced breaks in core medical services from year to year if the CSOs planned
carefully and ensured that successive annual agreements were in place before the current one ended, ICR mission
discussions with CSO representatives in-country indicate this modus operandi made it difficult for them to
reliably project their annual funding streams and hence to plan efficiently. Since many CSOs participating in the
project were quite small with limited alternative sources of financing, unpredictability of MAOP funding from
year-to-year threatened possible discontinuity of the services they were delivering, including, for example, ARV
treatment. It also raised overall transaction costs in terms of staff time of CSOs to prepare annual proposals to
mobilize continued funding and of the PES/NAC and its decentralized Committees to review and approve them.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     Overall, the PDOs remain highly relevant and their attainment essential to accelerating Burundi's
economic and social development. They are consonant with the current Bank country assistance strategy.
Although end of project coverage levels of priority services appear low, the project directly contributed to the
government's establishment of preconditions to carry out an expanded, multisectoral, coordinated and sustained


                                                       19

attack on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The project worked with the government to develop a strong, decentralized,
institutional framework, a significantly expanded infrastructure, a body of skilled professionals, and additional
external and national finances to advance the fight against AIDS, as discussed throughout this ICR and its
Annexes. The project's emphasis on community-led and community-based models of delivery of HIV/AIDS
education and preventive and curative-oriented services, represents an efficient use of national resources.
Independent evaluations of the CSO subprojects, the largest single expenditure category, consistently revealed
high quality projects. All things considered, the Project outcome was deemed moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

94.      The project revealed that:
(i)     PLWHA should have a strong role in HIV/AIDS Program design, execution, monitoring and
        evaluation and more broadly in HIV/AIDS policy making. In this project PLWHA were
        represented in all key aspects of the National Program, from key PES/NAC entities at the central
        and decentralized levels to direct participation in HIV/AIDS education and promotion of
        prevention and control activities.
(ii)    Women (especially widows, elderly women and young female orphans) have a strong crucial
        contribution to make in the provision of support to orphaned children and youth.
(iii)   Youth bring substantial value added to all aspects of AIDS programs, particularly as as advisors
        and peer educators. Two important innovations of the MAOP was the national AIDS festival in
        which 820 young artists presented works on AIDS themes and a concert that drew 800 young
        people.
(iv)    Child labor is more common among children who have lost both parents and must work to
        maintain themselves and their siblings.
(v)     Females -- particularly young girls -- are likely to be under served if close monitoring of the
        gender balance among beneficiaries of HIV/AIDS interventions is not enforced. They should be
        well represented in stakeholder consultations and advisory capacities.
(vi)    Community-based Child Protection Committees are invaluable in monitoring and reporting on
        child abuse, including violations of widows' and children's property and inheritance rights. These
        committees were known to exert collective political pressure, where needed, to review existing
        laws and regulations and to formulate new national policies to protect these vulnerable groups.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

95.      From the perspective of long-term investment impact and institutional development, three major
achievements of MAOP should be noted. First, the project directly contributed to the transformation of a nascent
National AIDS Council into a mature, strong multi-sectoral, autonomous, highly decentralized entity to guide
and coordinate National Program activities. The PES/NAC has now become a well-reputed institution, staffed
by highly qualified professionals with a strong commitment to results. Initially PES/NAC played a major
catalytic role in resource mobilization for the national program, attracting substantial funding for priority
HIV/AIDS activities from other national and external sources. Presently, the GF is in the process of negotiating
with the government a new proposal for which Burundi has requested US$140 million, with allocations to be
distributed between the public sector and civil society. The successful leveraging of MAOP resources under the
first HIV/AIDS Project, with an extensive group of national and international partners mobilized to support the
National Program, as highlighted in Annex 1 (c) augurs well for the National Program's ability to respond to the
still largely unmet HIV/AID education and service needs nationwide.

96.      Second, MAOP instilled a new culture of strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation across the public
and private sectors, including CSOs. Further, MAOP significantly enhanced transparency across the National


                                                       20

AIDS Program. This transparency has helped create substantial, heretofore somewhat limited, trust between the
public sector and CSOs. In this sense, it contributed directly to good governance objectives of the country's
poverty reduction strategy.

97.     Third, MAOP catalyzed a major decentralization of the National AIDS Program. This process extended
far beyond establishing key institutional structures such as the provincial and communal committees with their
broad representation. Actual program implementation was mainstreamed to these decentralized levels. Via the
PES/NAC, project funds were directly transferred to these decentralized entities. They in turn mobilized CSOs
and communities to participate in the Program, reviewed and approved local proposals for grant financing,
channeled project funding to CSOs for executing approved grants, and monitored performance of those
subprojects. The project thus led to a significant devolution of power to local authorities, setting a positive
precedent which will, hopefully, be continued.

98.     Strengthened CSO capacity in planning, management, monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS projects
had enormous spillover effects. The institutionalization of this process is evident in several major CSOs that
participated in MAOP such as Réseau Burundais des Personnes Vivant Avec Le VIH (RPB+) which now has its
own multi-year strategic plan, annual work plans and monitoring indicators.

99.     Access to subproject grant financing as well as considerable technical assistance for capacity building,
proposal preparation and project implementation and evaluation itself promoted a substantial expansion of the
CSO presence nationally. Whereas only some 35 CSOs were working in HIV/AIDS in the late 1990s, 530 CSOs
were active nationally by project end. CSO activities complemented public sector actions, filling many key gaps
in public sector capacity to deliver core services, even in geographic areas still in conflict and inaccessible to
government entry.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

100.    The highly decentralized PES/NAC structure, with high levels of community participation, strongly
promoted experimentation and innovation. CSOs proved particularly creative and well poised to test new
models such as use of community promoters or animateurs for IEC, with a network of over 6000 animateurs in
place across the nation by project end. CSOs also introduced new community-based HIV/AIDS service delivery
approaches and filled crucial service gaps, such as conduct of psychosocial counseling, a priority need to which
the public sector could not adequately respond because of its own critical shortages of psychologists and social
workers.

101.    Concomitantly, CSOs' sense of real ownership and stake in the outcome of the National AIDS Program
was significantly expanded. For the first time, they gained an important voice in the Program. Their influence
extended beyond their role in service delivery to their direct representation in key positions including the
National Council and its Coordinating Committee, Permanent Executive Committee and decentralized provincial
and communal committees.

102.    Finally, MAOP helped identify, through its M&E system and a special follow-on study, the challenges
the Program faces in reaching young girls--a key target group if the epidemic is to be slowed-- through youth
centers and through their recruitment for participation in youth-oriented activities. Information from the study
will help develop new girl-friendly prevention and control activities under the Second HIV/AIDS Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant

104.    Substantial political, security, and economic uncertainties in a nation only recently emerging from
conflict and among the poorest in the world, makes the risks to National AIDS Program sustainability
significant, despite major program advances under MAOP and strong commitment from the government.
Combating HIV/AIDS is one of four strategic pillars of the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and a
well articulated 2007-2011 NASP is in place to guide policy and investment decision-making. MAOP's inclusive
and participatory approach has integrated key stakeholder groups, particularly PLWHA, women, and youth, in
all aspects of the program. Nonetheless, the country's heavy dependence on external aid to advance its
development agenda makes it highly vulnerable amid the current global economic downturn.

105.    Institutionally, the now well-experienced PES/NAC, along with a dynamic public-private partnership,
are major assets upon which to build. However, the roles and responsibilities of three major "lead" entities--the
PES/NAC, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of HIV/AIDS -- have not yet been clearly determined. (The
Ministry at the President's Office in charge of HIV&AIDS was established from 2001 to 2007; in November
2007, a Vice-Ministry in charge of AIDS was created within the Ministry of Health and HIV/AIDS; in January
2009 the Ministry of HIV/AIDS and the Ministry of Health were recreated). Other unclear areas are: (i) the pace
at which the PES/NAC will now turn their attention from implementation responsibilities to a coordinating one;
to do this, they will have to work with other public and private entities, building up their capacity to take over
implementation; (ii) whether the MOH has fully acquired the expertise and absorptive capacity to fulfill the
broad technical leadership role the HIV/AIDS Program requires while, at the same time, meet its broader health
sector responsibilities; (iii) whether the delivery of priority HIV/AIDS prevention and promotion activities, can
be effectively and efficiently assumed by other entities; and (iv) whether a stronger MOH presence in the
HIV/AIDS Program will undermine the multisectoral achievements of the first project.

106.    The continuing large HIV/AIDS Program financing gap -- presently on the order of US$ 104 million --
obviously puts sustainability at risk. The 2002-2006 NASP secured only 30 percent of the financing required to
support planned National Program activities, even though successfully leveraging Bank resources to attract many
other financiers, including the Global Fund (see Annex 2). The PDOs must be attained, particularly in light of
the 2007 national sero-prevalence survey showing that prevalence rates remain high, especially among select
vulnerable groups. Bank financing for Burundi's Second HIV/AIDS project is less than one-half that provided
for MAOP, and the project itself extends only until June 30, 2011. This makes it all the more imperative that the
government rapidly attract additional external resources, with only a little more than two years left to accomplish
the 2007-2011 goals. The significant financing shortfall has had one important, positive effect, however. It has
forced prioritization of the Plan's multiple programs, active pursuit of evidence-based interventions, and better
targeting of activities to highest risk groups--all of which promise more cost-effective use of scarce financial
and technical resources.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

107.    Bank performance in project design through MAOP approval was satisfactory overall. The Bank,
mobilized a substantial PHRD grant to enable fast tracking of project preparation. The Bank team worked
fervently and extremely closely with the government to prepare the project, moving from Concept Review to
appraisal in a remarkably short time, particularly given the difficult country situation over this period. The
overall project design was sound, drew well on Bank and Burundi prior project experience, and rightly identified



                                                       22

the wisdom of expanding civil society participation in the HIV/AIDS program, in close partnership with the
government.

108.     Early on, the Bank recognized the possibility of realizing synergies and significant reductions in
administrative costs by merging an Orphans Project currently under separate preparation, with the HIV/AIDS
Project. While this decision carried some calculated risks, the merger proved to have many benefits. It
permitted a quick start and rapid scale-up of OVC activities by enabling the OVC program to draw upon the
strong PES/NAC institutional capacity, and to utilize its M&E systems rather than having to create a new
institutional framework. It facilitated mobilization of extensive CSO participation in identifying needs and
delivering OVC services via the project's CSO subproject grant mechanism. Most importantly, the integration of
the two projects identified OVC with HIV/AIDS -- among the most vulnerable OVC -- thus allowing the project
to target specific interventions to improve their lives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

109.     Bank supervision performance was uneven over the project life. A September 8, 2006 Quality of
Supervision Assessment rated overall supervision as "moderately satisfactory."

110.     Four changes in TTLs between preparation and project close, created some lags in project oversight.
Turnover in other Bank Headquarters staff, particularly from 2005-2006, appears to have slowed implementation
in terms of delayed approvals of government requests for non objections and reallocation of Credit proceeds.

111.     From project initiation through mid-term, ISRs did not always meet Bank standards for supervision
reporting. It was noted, upon occasion,: (i) the failure to flag selected issues needing decisive action (e.g. missing
FMRs and failure to implement the MWMP); (ii) some cursory entries from one ISR to the next of updated
information within the "Summary of Issues and Actions" section, suggesting no progress had been made in
addressing key implementation issues (PSR of 10/26/04), whereas Aide Memoires from corresponding ISRs
revealed significant project advances; (iii) ISRs that appeared to have replicated information with no explanation
of missed deadlines; and (iv) some inconsistencies and errors found in the reporting (ISR of 3/26/04). It was also
noted that project performance indicators, reported within the "status of agreed outcomes" matrix of the ISR,
were added, revised or deleted without adequate explanation. Over time, four core KPI ceased to be reported on
in the ISR. Revisions in wording of some indicators created uncertainty in what statistics actually were being
reported.

112.     The quality of Aide Memoires (AMs) on which ISRs were based varied considerably over the course of
the project. Most provided solid, thoughtful analyses of project status and recommendations to redress
implementation problems, but some were more narrative than strategic, exceeded 30 pages in length, and
included several pages of non-prioritized actions for the government to take subsequent to the mission.

113.     Inadequate ISR reporting was mentioned in two separate Bank Panel Reviews. The need for "future
ISRs to capture more effectively relevant implementation status points and issues highlighted in the Aide
Memoires written in French and in back to office reports" was raised by the March 8, 2005 QER Panel prior to
the Mid-term review. The September 2006 QSA commended the core health team for "performing very well in
identifying issues and addressing them," but, the report concluded that the team was "not always successful in
documenting and reporting on the measures adopted and the results achieved." Though documentation improved
over the remaining project period, it did not fully attain satisfactory standards. The documentation shortfalls
limited Bank management access to timely, comprehensive updates on project performance and hence effective
decision making.




                                                      23

114.     Following the March 2006 supervision mission, the Bank initiated a strategic planning exercise, with
expert input, to assist each sector to improve its HIV/AIDS action plan. The Bank also conducted an
institutional assessment to help better define capacities and comparative advantages/optimum roles of distinct
organizations involved in the National Program. This information was also used in the preparation of the 2007-
2011 National Strategy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

115.     Consistent with ICR guidelines, one rating of satisfactory and one rating of moderately satisfactory
dictates that the overall rating assigned be moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

116.     Throughout the project, the National AIDS Program benefitted from exceptionally strong commitment
from the Office of the President, but not always accompanied by a corresponding commitment from some line
Ministries. As the project neared its end, the Borrower's institutional framework for advancing the National
AIDS Program became unclear when significant changes were made in Ministerial responsibilities and mandates,
as mentioned earlier. These organizational changes were not expected by the HIV/AIDS program stakeholders,
since previous ministerial decrees had just been issued in the summer 2007 clarifying the respective roles of the
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of HIV/AIDS, and the National Council with regards to the 2007-2011 National
AIDS Strategy. As reported in the 6/20/2008 ISR, the resultant uncertainties about respective roles of the various
ministers and vice ministers hampered management of HIV/AIDS activities in several sectors, including health.
Weighing the strong commitment at the Presidential level against the organizational uncertainties of the MOH
and the reduced commitment of other line Ministries to fully commit staff and resources to the National AIDS
Program results in a "moderately satisfactory" rating.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

117.     Overall performance of the executing agency was commendable. The PES/NAC was pro-active in
identifying implementation problems and coordinating closely with the Bank team to recalibrate the project plan
of action when needed. It quickly identified capacity constraints in the public and private sector and decided to
scale up activities more gradually than originally planned in order to strengthen that capacity. Similarly the
PES/NAC submitted, through the government, a timely request for amending the DCA when the country's
macroeconomic deterioration precluded meeting counterpart funding commitments. It also requested a
reallocation of Credit proceeds to respond to evolving project financing needs, including the much higher than
anticipated demand for grant financing by CSOs that held much promise of accelerating progress toward the
National Strategy goals. When needed, it also increased demands for funds to support consultants' services,
audits and training.

118.     On the down side, the PES/NAC experienced two changes of its Permanent Executive Secretary during
the six years of the project. Additionally, a 10-month leadership hiatus occurred between the first and second
secretaries. The acting secretary was eventually confirmed in her position. Though each permanent executive
secretary selected was a highly qualified professional, the lack of continuity of leadership, compounded with the
changing TTLs from the Bank, had an unsettling effect on project implementation. The relatively low level of
turnover among PES/NAC staff overseeing such key areas as financial management and implementation of
selected components helped to ease the transitions in PES/NAC leadership but did not fully offset their effects.



                                                     24

The fluidity in PES/NAC management may also account in part for some slippages that occurred in such crucial
areas as financial management reporting and finalization and implementation of the MWMP.

119.     Notwithstanding, the executing agency is to be recognized for its balanced project performance
assessment, reflected in its ICR, that identifies substantial project strengths and achievements but also significant
challenges and obstacles confronted in implementation, and a substantial unfinished agenda to still pursue to
achieve goals of the National HIV/AIDS 2007-2011 Strategic Plan.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

120.     Consistent with ICR Guidelines, with both government and Executing Agency performance ratings
moderately satisfactory, the overall rating must be moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

121.     Many key lessons that emerged in the execution of MAOP are consistent with those found in other MAP
projects by the external MAP Project evaluation and the IEG Review of the Multi-Country AIDS Program in
Africa, Select Countries, 2006-2008: Lessons Learned. Those lessons were taken into account in the design of
the second MAP Project. Among the most important lessons to be drawn from MAOP follow.

122.     Regarding project preparation and planning:

(i)   Adoption of a fast track preparatory process has hidden costs that cannot be discounted. The
      extensive effort needed over the first few years of the project period essentially to complete
      preparation of core inputs required for actual project execution significantly slowed implementation
      and disbursements and ultimately contributed to the need to extend the MAOP closing date by
      almost two years.

(ii) Investments made in the careful preparation of procedural manuals, a financing code, detailed
      application and evaluation forms for selecting CSO grants, use of performance-based contracts,
      training of decentralized committees, and good monitoring and evaluation systems had high returns.
      The PES/NAC's conduct of financial and technical audits of CSO projects imbued a strong sense of
      accountability for results (see section on efficiency). Circumscribing CSO grants to just one year,
      presents many problems, not only in terms of creating substantial uncertainties among CSOs for
      programmatic and financial planning purposes (and the risk of breaks in service delivery), but also
      in terms of generating relatively high transaction costs for both the CSO and the government and
      local authorities in the preparation and review of annual proposals. With the introduction in 2006 of
      performance based contracts for medical services delivered by CSOs, adequate protections are in
      place to enter into multi-year contracts while maintaining good quality and financial controls.

(iii) The risks to implementation from capacity weaknesses, particularly pervasive shortages of skilled
     professionals, can be and indeed were in Burundi significantly underestimated during project
     preparation. These shortages presented major obstacles to effective, efficient project
     implementation. Tackling major, widespread human resource constraints may be best done cross-
     sectorally rather than on a sector-by-sector basis since the underlying dynamics of low morale and
     high turnover among civil servants tend to be common across public sector entities.

123.     Regarding the design:




                                                       25

(i)  The integration of the orphans' project was desirable but added complexity to project design. This
     component introduced additional project objectives that were not part of the National AIDS
     Strategic Plan or the HIV/AIDS components of the project. Meeting the OVC objectives demanded
     specialized expertise unique to this component to support interventions in such areas as education
     and vocational/technical training, income generating activities and home gardens and protection of
     property and inheritance rights of orphans and widows. This demanded close interaction with
     ministries outside the general AIDS community, including the ministries in charge of Gender and
     Human Rights and National Solidarity, Repatriation and Reintegration of Refugees and Internally
     Displaced Persons.

(ii) Initial (and erroneous) base-line data suggested that the epidemic was generalized, so the project
     was designed accordingly (general population-oriented mass IEC, VCT, condom distribution and
     treatment of STDs). It was later found that HIV/AIDS in Burundi was heavily concentrated in select
     population groups and geographic areas. In such a case, evidence-based interventions, targeted and
     tailored to those at highest risk, appear to be the more cost-effective way to reduce transmission.
     Projects need to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in information regarding the
     epidemic profile.

124.    Regarding Monitoring and Evaluation:

(i)  In selecting key performance indicators to monitor project progress, extreme care must be taken to
     ensure that baseline data exist and are verified, and that the suggested methodology for obtaining
     data over time to track progress is feasible and cost-effective. Similarly, the baseline data must be
     adjusted quickly if new, more reliable data sources become available and the targets relating to
     adjusted indicators must be amended then as well to ensure that they reflect reasonable magnitudes
     of change, given the specific mix of project interventions and the timeframe for project execution.
     In the case of this project, the failure to restructure the project in order to formally update baseline
     values (and subsequently their targets for two core outcome indicators) adversely impacted
     assessment of project performance, as discussed earlier.

(ii) The preparation of both the 2007-2011 National Strategy and the second MAP highlighted the
     importance of including ongoing surveillance, epidemiological and analytical work in any project. ,
     Impact assessments and M&E studies are needed to effectively guide and adapt policies. Systematic
     sharing of M&E results with key stakeholder groups is instrumental in gaining their support for
     financial and strategic programs.

125.    Regarding Institutional Arrangements for Implementation:

(i)  In pursuing a truly multisectoral strategy, balance must be maintained in distribution of
     responsibilities, human and financial resources, and hence power, between high level coordinating
     bodies like Burundi's National AIDS Council and its permanent secretariat (formerly PES/NAC;
     then PES/NAC), and other public agencies and local authorities whose buy-in and own concrete
     actions are essential to attain HIV/AIDS Program goals. Substantial risks exist that such
     coordinating bodies become widely perceived as "supra-Ministries," particularly given their
     proclivity over time, especially in the face of serious capacity constraints in the public and private
     sectors, to assume core Program implementation responsibilities, thus extending their role well
     beyond their fundamental coordination mandate. This inevitably creates friction with and resistance
     to collaboration from other entities participating in the Program.

(ii) In the long run, every effort must be made to ensure that the Ministry of Health in particular has
     both the commitment and capacity to play the central role it must for successful HIV/AIDS Program


                                                       26

     execution. The MOH's exercise of technical leadership is crucial to ensure quality of care and
     treatment, including establishment of HIV/AIDS treatments protocols and standards for ARVs,
     STDs and OIs. With the primary responsibility of National AIDS Program activity largely centered
     at the PES/NAC, some partner organizations have suggested that the MOH assumed, detrimentally,
     that it was largely "off the hook" in terms of its own accountability for the HIV/AIDS Program.
     Indeed wide experience reveals that every effort must be made over time to fully integrate
     HIV/AIDS care and treatment within existing health services in order to ensure institutional
     sustainability and rationalize use of scarce resources.

 126. Regarding Project Management - High turnover of Bank TTLs presents a major
 obstacle for smooth project implementation. The five TTLs over the MAOP life led to serious
 shortfalls in project performance, monitoring, and reporting. Continuity of Bank project
 leadership, particularly in challenging operational environments is essential. Similarly, having
 two Executive Secretaries at the NAC was disruptive. In such circumstances, increased
 attention must also be given to identifying alternative approaches to attract and retain project
 managers in executing agencies.

(c)      National AIDS Program Financing by Source of Funds


1.       Full implementation of the 16 programs within the five-year National AIDS Strategic Plan 2002-
2006 was estimated to cost US$233 million. The PES/NAC played a major catalytic role in resource
mobilization for the National AIDS Program. The recognized strong managerial and technical capacity of
its team was a strong magnet to attract financing from both national and external sources. Nationally,
these resources included cost-sharing of CSOs that were recipients of project-financed grants. A
multiplicity of other financiers ultimately participated in that Program, providing in aggregate 3.73 billion
BIF over the project life. Of special note are contributions from the GF which provided US$8.657 million
in complementary support for the period April 2003 to March 2006, and US$32 million for a five-year
period commencing April 2006.

2.       Notwithstanding this strong resource mobilization effort by the PES/NAC, as highlighted in the
Graph below, IDA support channeled via the MAOP represented the dominant source of National AIDS
Program financing from 2002 through 2007.

3.       The successful leveraging of MAOP resources allowed the National Program to scale up
activities significantly over the project period. Notwithstanding the large number of partners mobilized,
and the substantial resources they infused, the financing available for the National Program fell
significantly short of needs defined in the National Strategic Plan 2002-2006, leaving a large unfinished
agenda for action for the 2007-2011 Plan, now being supported by IDA via the Second HIV/AIDS Project.

Overview
1.      A major objective of the first HIV/AIDS Project in Burundi was to establish an institutional
framework and operational base to develop a timely, effective and sustainable national response to the
epidemic. The MAOP financed numerous studies that helped inform the 2007-2011 NASP. MAOP
financing also helped support the expansion of service sites and centers for prevention, control, and
treatment of HIV/AIDS. It helped upgrade the National Center for Blood Testing; paid for programs
allowing for the systematic testing of donated blood and improvements to safe handling of injections;
provided funds for the intensive training of providers of crucial services.

2.      The project's contributions to the establishment of a basic infrastructure to deliver core
HIV/AIDS interventions and to the development of a skilled cadre to deliver priority services, is
described in the following two tables.

* This contrasts with the total of 133 pregnant women who received prophylaxis in 2001 for prevention of mother-
to-child transmission. As highlighted in this Table, the project allowed a significant increase in coverage over its 6
years of implementation.

3.       Further, the large body of MAOP-financed studies, surveys and evaluations, included in Annex 9,
contributed to a major expansion of knowledge of the evolving HIV/AIDS situation in the country as well
as that of OVC, though crucial knowledge gaps remain. Among the most significant MAOP
contributions was the 2007 national sero-prevalence survey urgently needed to inform the National
Program. Its findings have contributed substantively to the design of the Second HIV/AIDS Project, and
strongly influenced that project's adoption of a more targeted strategy to combat the epidemic, focusing
intensively on the highest risk groups identified in that survey.

Public Sector Response (Component 1)

4.       This component focused on the following main areas: (i) establishment of HIV/AIDS focal sector
units within each line Ministry; (ii) preparation of HIV/AIDS Action Plans by all 30 public sector
institutions, including not only line the then 26 line Ministries but also the Office of the President, the
Senate, the National Assembly, and the University of Burundi; (iii) decentralization of the National
PES/NAC to the provincial, communal and local levels; (iv) conduct by public institutions of IEC
targeted to their employees, families of employees and sectoral constituents; and (v) guarantee of the
safety of the nation's blood supply and transfusions, including construction of the National Blood
Transfusion Center (completed in 2005), strengthening of 4 regional transfusion centers, training of both
professional and traditional health providers (including birth attendants), surveillance of blood donors via
5 centers, and provision of materials and equipment.

5.       Several new strategies were effected, including: (i) definition of an HIV/AIDS communication
strategy and a strategy for condom distribution by the Ministry of the Presidency; (ii) a guide for training
of peer educators and teachers on HIV/AIDS by the Ministry of Education; and (iii) a national strategy for
accelerating access to ARV, together with simplification, standardization and validation of ARV
treatment, consistent with WHO norms. The MAOP also catalyzed formulation and passage of several
new national policies, including: (i) a 2004 PMCT policy, with protocols distributed in all health facilities
offering PMCT; (ii) national condom policy in 2004; (iii) a national policy to protect PLWHA; and (iv) a
national policy to assist OVC and to protect the rights of orphans and widows.

6.       Key achievements over the project period by the central level are captured in the following tables.

Notes:

*At project launch in 2002, 8 line Ministries already had an HIV/AIDS Action Plan

**A Government restructuring in 2007 eliminated two line Ministries, with their responsibilities integrated into other public entities

***The Senate, National Assembly, Office of the President and University of Burundi also elaborated HIV/AIDS Action Plans

****Local Committees of the National AIDS Council already have been created but none are yet functioning pending mobilization of two animateurs per locality of which at least one must be a woman

Operationalization of the diverse Action Plans has been supported as well by other HIV/AIDS partner organizations, including notably BIT, UNICEF, UNESCO, WHO, ActionAid, and GTZ

7.           To help actualize the multisectoral approach promulgated in the National AIDS 2002-2006
Strategy, all public sector institutions benefitted from technical and financial support from MAOP or
other Program partners to develop and institute HIV/AIDS Action Plans. The public sector response was
rapid, with 100 percent of public institutions having annual Action Plans in place by project mid-term.
The intensive IEC efforts these institutions mounted reached in aggregate 308,065 civil servants, their

family and sector clients, as highlighted above. The intensity of effort varied strikingly between
Ministries, with the Ministries of Education and of National Defense accounting for 91 percent of all
beneficiaries reached, as also noted in the above table, albeit their employees and constituents were key
target groups to stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic,. Additionally, treatment solidarity funds were established
in public institutions and parastatal enterprises to support ARV treatment for PLWHA who were
employed in these entities.

8.      Performance under this component was exceptionally strong in terms of mobilization of CSO
participation as a major actor within the National AIDS Program, significantly exceeding original project
targets. The number of CSOs working in HIV/AIDS related activities increased from about 35 at project
appraisal, per the PAD, to over 500 at project closing. The project also promoted entry of new actors,
encouraged by access not only to financing but to also to technical assistance from proposal writing to
implementation and M&E. This TA notably was carried out by some relatively large, established CSOs
operative in HIV/AIDS as well as the Council and its decentralized structures. Access to grants and
capacity building also empowered communities to identify and respond to their own needs, thus creating a
more sustainable model over the long term to address HIV/AIDS.

9.      With the Credit reallocations, grants for civil society subprojects ultimately accounted for almost
half (47 percent) of total project disbursements--the largest expenditure category. Investments in this
component in aggregate were 13.8 billion BIF. The total 564 subprojects financed were well dispersed
geographically. This underscores the strong comparative advantage of CSOs to operate in communities
nationally, including many areas in which social unrest precluded delivery of public services. In
aggregate, 765,794 beneficiaries were served under this component over the project life. Almost 90
percent of the total number of subprojects financed over the project life served four key target groups:
PLWHA (34.2 percent); OVC (32.1 percent); youth (13.5 percent); and the general population (7.8
percent), as highlighted in the tables below.

10.     Existing documentation on this component focuses almost exclusively on the outputs achieved in
terms of number and distribution geographically and by type of beneficiary of projects and their general
performance and overall monitoring results, including those of financial audits. As the September 2006
QSA Panel noted, it was "unable to get a clear picture from project documentation, including ISRs, of the
results of targeted interventions or what worked and what did not in the efforts of NGOs and other
organizations supported under Component 2." Among the CSOs that received MAOP grant financing
under performance-based contracts signed with the NAC to deliver medical services, their operations
were carried out in close collaboration with public health centers and hospitals. Thus it is not possible to
fully disaggregate what portion of HIV/AIDS related medical services they directly provided. One proxy
for assessing the contribution of CSO activities is provided in a technical evaluation of subprojects
executed by CSOs. That evaluation, released in November 2008, and based on a sample of subprojects,

needs and the availability of resources from other donors, including UNICEF and DFID, to finance school fees in
those two years.

12.     The OVC subprojects were unevenly distributed across the country. This reflects in part the
concentration of project effort in the initial years until the Mid-Term Review in three pilot provinces--
Karuzi, Kayanza and Muramvya--particularly via the OVC component itself, which was expanded
nationally thereafter.

were placed over the project life; this contrasts with an estimated 77,000 children in-country who had lost
both parents. Moreover, the placement process moved exceptionally slowly, with the number of orphans
placed failing to increase over a few years, as revealed in M&E indicators.

Youth (The Cross-cutting Component)

14.      Activities targeting youth formed a centerpiece of the National AIDS Program. In the public
sector, youth-oriented activities were concentrated in two Ministries. Within the Ministry of Education,
the project supported:
(i)    Preparation of a personal life skills book for 3rd grade students, with a teacher guide, with 300,000
       copies distributed to school districts nationally, coupled with training of 1447 school directors and
       inspectors on the guide (financed in partnership with UNICEF)
(ii)   Training of 6322 5th and 6th grade teachers on this guide who then taught peer educators, also
       funded in collaboration with UNICEF
(iii)  Establishment of 972 Stop AIDS Clubs in secondary schools nationwide
(iv)   In the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture actions concentrated on prevention, participation and
       development of youth out of school, including:
(v)    Preparation of a personal life skills book
(vi)   Training of a pool of 30 youth to serve in advisory capacity at the national level and 510 youth to
       serve in provincial areas
(vii) Training of 4410 local peer educators (over 30 for each of the 129 communes) corresponding also
       to the number of youth centers operational nationally
(viii) Establishment of a National Network of Youth Active Against AIDS that functions via a national
       committee, 17 provincial committees and 129 communes. These committees assure the
       representation of youth in all institutional aspects of the AIDS Program including in the PES/NAC
       and in its decentralized provincial and community committees
(ix)   Promotion of youth centers, facilitated by preparation of a guide for creation and management of
       youth centers that helped mobilize 129 youth centers nationally

17.      That only 76 (13.5 percent) of the 564 subprojects (financed through civil society grants) went to
youth-targeted activities explains the relatively small impact of the project on youth, as revealed in the
following tables. On the other hand, many of the outputs did establish a strong institutional base for future
activities targeted to this key risk group. Of particular note in this regard are the National Network of
Youth Against AIDS which plays a critical advisory role to the National Program and the now extensive
national network of youth centers and Stop SIDA Clubs, established under project auspices. Also of note
is the existence of a cadre of 4410 peer educators across the nation trained with MAOP resources to help
expand youth knowledge of HIV/AIDS and promote the adoption of requisite attitudes and behavioral
practices to protect them against infection.

                            Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       In the absence of data for economic and financial analysis, this section adopts the IEG
methodology for evaluation of the first generation of MAP projects which bases the project economic and
financial results on the counterfactual of no assistance and particularly on its contribution to: (i) deepen
political commitment to contain the epidemic; (ii) expand and strengthen national and sub-national AIDS
institutions for the long-run response; (iii) mobilize NGOs to participate and reinforce their capacity to
provide prevention and care among high-risk groups most likely to contract and spread the infection; and
(iv) enhance the efficiency of the national AIDS programs.

Political Commitment

2.       The political commitment at the highest levels of the government to redress the epidemic is clear.
Combating HIV/AIDS is a strategic pillar of the Burundi PRSP. The Strategic Plan 2007-2011 provides a
widely recognized framework to sustain the national Program and delineates priority HIV/AIDS actions.
Creation of the PES/NAC reflected the priority being assigned to stopping the epidemic within the
national development agenda. Though the PES/NAC has further capacity strengthening needs, it is widely
recognized as a strong, decentralized autonomous body with a multisectoral mandate that is well prepared
to coordinate the National AIDS Program.

3.       Among many competing development priorities within the post-conflict setting, the government
has agreed to contribute US$3 million in its budget for the first year of implementation of the Second
HIV/AIDS Project, although to date only US$100,000 has been committed.

4.       Expanded and strengthened national and subnational AIDS institutions. The project's
investments in the National Council and its highly decentralized entities (provincial, community and local
Committees) have created an exceptionally strong and previously absent institutional base for effectively
and efficiently coordinating and advancing national program activities across the public and private
sectors. Project technical and financial support to public institutions via Component 1 have led to
establishment of HIV/AIDS sector units in all ministries and introduced the mandatory preparation of
HIV/AIDS Action Plans to mobilize each institution to play a role. These actions to substantially
strengthen the capacity of national public institutions reflect the government's recognition of the adverse
development consequences of the HIV/AIDS crisis and firm commitment to launch and sustain a solid,
multisectoral attack on it.

5.       Mobilization and strengthening the capacity of NGOs to provide priority services. As
highlighted previously, the dynamic public-private partnership for HIV/AIDS that emerged from the
project provides a substantially expanded network to provide quality HIV/AIDS services. Intensive
capacity building across the CSO sector has significantly improved their ability to design, execute,
monitor, and evaluate HIV/AIDS activities. It also has improved national monitoring of the HIV/AIDS
situation by compilation of data from the now extensive network of CSOs operating in the country. CSOs
consulted for this ICR revealed that MAOP filled critical revenue gaps to advance their work, such as
financing ARVs and medicines to treat OIs. Limiting subproject financing to predominantly direct costs
of HIV/AIDS programmatic interventions, maximized use of limited project resources.

6.       Enhanced efficiency. Numerous challenges exist to determining the actual efficiency of the
project with current data. One proxy measure of efficiency that may be considered is the extent to which
project funds were expended on appropriate interventions, contextualized and adapted to the needs of the
local communities to ensure resources were well spent. In this respect, the project empowered



                                                      43

communities to play stronger advocacy roles and to identify and respond to their own priority needs. A
key mechanism for doing this was by providing the decentralized committees with financing and with the
authority to approve and manage small subproject grants for community-based activities. It also
encouraged significant experimentation and innovation, one example of which was the introduction of
low cost models of service delivery, which filled important gaps in health promotion, and preventive and
curative care, as has been noted previously in this ICR.

    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE MAP1 COMPLETION REPORT (PMLSAO)

1.     The Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Control and Orphans Project (PMLSAO) started in October
2002 after a launch workshop conducted from October 15­18, 2002. The total credit was SDR
29,100,000 (US$36,000,000).

2.     The project development objective was to "slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general
population and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on families."

3. The project was divided into 16 programs and executed through five components, namely: (i)
Strengthening Public Sector Response to the Crisis (US$9.3 million); (ii) Increasing Participation
in Grassroots Organizations and Communities (US$13.4 million); (iii) Orphans Integration and
Education (US$7 million); (iv) Strengthening the Program's Strategic Formulation,
Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity (US$4 million); and (v) Project
Management (US$3 million).

4.     Program 1 sought to reduce high-risk sexual behaviors through Information, Education,
and Communication (IEC) activities. A national communication policy to change behavior was
formulated. IEC activities geared toward reducing high-risk behaviors that lead to HIV/AIDS
contamination were conducted in all AIDS prevention sectoral units. A number of them were
conducted for staff members themselves, while others targeted the population groups served by
the relevant sector, in the form of seminars, workshops, and radio or television broadcasts in
French and Kirundi.

5.     Supported by the project, IEC material and educational guides were produced and
training sessions organized for various groups, such as government officials and employees and
more specifically, inter alia, teachers, community facilitators, uniformed services, caregivers,
HIV testing counselors, women, youth, and sex workers.

6.     Special emphasis was placed on training the trainers and peer educators including youth,
uniformed services, sex workers, prisoners, displaced persons, child heads of households, and
female heads of households (Ministry for Cooperation). In schools, the Ministry of National
Education was able to promote awareness building through the Stop AIDS Clubs (972), while
the Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Culture organized a similar activity at youth centers in all
communes across the country (129).         Media practitioners also benefited from training in
advocacy. A national communication policy to change behavior was formulated within the
context of coordinating and standardizing IEC interventions.

7.     IEC activities were also conducted through civil society organizations (CSOs). The
project financed 163 subprojects for the various high-risk behavior groups, and religious groups
assisted greatly with prevention activities. The radio stations with the largest listenership were
also used to build awareness. In all, almost four million persons were reached by radio
broadcasts. Two studies were also conducted on the impact of Radio Culture broadcasts and


                                               48

another on knowledge, attitudes, and practices of members of religious groups toward HIV/AIDS
and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

8.      The "Youth Response" component is cross-sectoral in relation to the various other
components of MAP1. It helped achieve the first project development objective: "Slow the
spread of HIV/AIDS in the general population." The component's objective was to slow the
spread of HIV/AIDS in the youth population.

9.      At the outset, the youth component was not included in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD); it was incorporated during the implementation phase into the organizational chart of the
Permanent Executive Secretariat of the National AIDS Council [Secrétariat Exécutif Permanent
du Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA -- PES/NAC]. Given its cross-sectoral role, civil
society organizations and public sector entities supported the implementation of these strategies.
The Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Culture was called upon to provide leadership for other
sectors. Some of the activities conducted were surveys on girls' participation at youth centers;
support to link prevention activities to revenue-generating activities (RGAs) and the distribution
of condoms and IEC material; support for the operation of youth centers; and the training of
youth peer educators, all with a view to involving youth as actors and not as mere beneficiaries.

10.     Several additional interventions were conducted in collaboration with a number of
development partners, such as UNICEF, UNFPA, UNAIDS, and UNESCO. Activities were
conducted in and around youth centers, in schools, and through media campaigns and/or
entertainment events.

11.     The component focused on the package of prevention services including awareness
building, condoms, RGAs, and training. These activities were accompanied by the identification
and training of youth leaders, the standardization of prevention messages, peer education, and the
retraining of peer educators of over 3,870 boys and girls.
12.     A consolidated action plan for all stakeholders involved in directing the logical
framework of the project document was drafted at a participatory workshop. As a result, both
ministries with responsibility for youth (the Ministry of National Education and the Ministry of
Youth, Sports, and Culture) coordinated the prevention activities for youth through 972 Stop
AIDS Clubs and 129 youth centers, respectively. A survey of girls' participation was conducted.

13.     Program 2 focused on the promotion of condom use. A national condom policy was
formulated. Training in condom use was organized and male and female condoms distributed:
54.7 million male condoms in comparison to 102,730 female condoms from 2002­2008.

14.     Program 3 dealt with HIV/AIDS testing. Achievements included regular voluntary
counseling and testing (VCT) accreditation (266 VCTs in 2008), testing at VCT sites (791,050
cases tested from 2002­2008), the regular supply of reagents, and the organization of training in
pre- and post-test counseling at the various care facilities. Seventy-one civil society subprojects
were financed during the implementation of this program, of which 10 focused exclusively on
this area, and the other 61 focused simultaneously on other areas.




                                                49

15.     Program 4 sought to cover all health-related training in the area of STI diagnosis and
treatment. The project facilitated the training of 1,903 caregivers and the production and
distribution of 6,000 algorithms at care facilities. Twenty-one accredited associations helped
implement the program while 17 subprojects covering aspects of STI treatment were financed for
3,661 patients.

16.     Program 5 focused on reducing the risks of transmission by blood. The program
included the construction and equipping of the National Center for Blood Transfusion [Centre
National de Transfusion Sanguine CNTS], the purchase of equipment for the Regional Centers
for Blood Transfusion [Centres Régionaux de Transfusion Sanguine CRTS], and the supply of
care facilities with protective gear and material for the handling of blood exposure incidents.
With a view to further increasing blood transfusion safety, prevention guidelines were made
available. The quality and reliability of tests were routinely monitored at blood transfusion
centers while blood donors were recruited and retained, which helped to ensure that the blood
donor seroprevalence rate did not surpass 0.3 percent.

17.     Program 6 supported antenatal testing and the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV/AIDS (PMCT). Achievements of this program include the obtaining of
accreditation for PMCT sites (63), the production of IEC material, the training of service
providers (441) within the context of the PMCT, and the organization of briefing and awareness-
building sessions for government employees and associations. Five associations were supported
by the financing of 20 subprojects. A total of 5,660 women and 4,663 newborns benefited from
this program from 2002­2008.

18.     Program 7 dealt with psychosocial care for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
This activity was primarily organized and structured around civil society organizations with a
view to supplementing full medical care. A counseling guide for STI/HIV/AIDS was produced
and used for training, and 738 persons were trained in psychosocial care.

19.     Program 8 addressed prophylaxis, the diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic
infections (OIs), and the care continuum. The program provided medication for OIs and the
treatment of patients, in addition to training for caregivers in the treatment of OIs. A legal and
regulatory framework for home-based care was developed and 500 stakeholders were trained in
this area. In addition, 131,489 OI cases were treated at public, private, and community facilities.
More specifically, associations benefited from the financing of 55 subprojects. The purchase of
medication for OIs has continued.

20.     Program 9 dealt with the improvement of access to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for
HIV/AIDS. The results from this program are the establishment of new ARV sites, which
totaled 68 in 2008, care for 14,343 PLWHA in 2008 in comparison to 600 in 2002, 1,210 in 2003,
3,900 in 2004, 6,416 in 2005, 8,048 in 2006, and 10,928 in 2007.
21.     Health mediators were also provided: they serve as an interface between the physician
and the patient, and facilitate the continuity of care and observance of treatment. To support this
aspect of health care, CD4 counters were made available to users. In addition, treatment support
funds [caisses de solidarité thérapeutique] were established within government and parastatal




                                                  50

entities; however, the Military Support Fund [Caisse de Solidarité des Militaires CASSOM] is
the best organized and most efficient of them all.

22.     Program 10 focused on the promotion of health links - human rights, the protection of
People Living with HIV/AIDS, and the other vulnerable groups. In this context, Decree-Law No.
1/018 of May 12 was enacted and translated into Kirundi, while the ILO Code of Practice on
HIV/AIDS and the World of Work was disseminated to personnel at public, private and
community facilities. The Leagues of Human Rights and PLWHA associations and networks,
headed by the RBP+, have continued to advocate for the defense and protection of the rights of
PLWHA, orphans, and other vulnerable children.

23.     Program 11 was executed as a specific component for orphans and other vulnerable
children (OVC). Initially the program covered three provinces (Karusi, Kayanza, and
Muramvya). Its activities extended across the entire country because of the growing needs
increasingly expressed by the provinces not covered. It focused on the care of orphans and other
vulnerable children. One hundred and eighty-seven associations and groups received support. In
all 1,672 orphans were placed in families, while socioeconomic support activities for 32,281
families have helped keep children in school. Many more activities were conducted with a view
to better documenting the situation of orphans: a study on the situation of orphans in the pilot
zone (2003); identification of OVC across the country (2005); establishment of an OVC module
in the AIDS INFO database; formulation of the national policy for OVC (2005); and the
formulation of a national plan for OVC. With the expansion of activities, the program supported
the enrollment of 396,341 children, medical and nutritional care, and the protection of rights.

24.      Program 12 financed revenue-generating activities for the poorest PLWHA. Therefore,
within the context of reducing the impact and the other determinants of HIV, revenue-generating
activities were financed for poor PLWHA; 446 members of RGA committees were trained and
258 PLWHA benefited from socioprofessional reintegration.

25.     Program 13 focused its interventions on the strengthening of civil society organizations
divided into national, regional, and local associations, NGOs/nonprofit organizations, and private
sector organizations.

26.     As a result of the sponsorship approach, large associations (or groups) received support to
bolster community mobilization, and organized or sponsored groups of persons living with
HIV/AIDS through three projects. These groups currently operate in every commune in the
country and are estimated to be 129 in all, with approximately 8,000 members. The Burundi
Alliance against AIDS [Alliance Burundaise contre le Sida ABS] was financed to strengthen the
capacities of 85 member associations.

27.     In terms of the private sector, five subprojects geared toward awareness-building
activities and mobilization for voluntary testing and care in 55 companies were executed through
two large associations, namely the employers' association of Burundi, and the Greater
Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GIPA) Center. The activity allowed for the
establishment and strengthening of 30 of the 55 AIDS committees planned.




                                                 51

28.     Program 14 focused on strengthening capacities to formulate, coordinate, monitor, and
evaluate sectoral plans and decentralized action plans. In 2003, only eight ministries had
HIV/AIDS action plans. In 2005, each ministerial department had an action plan, along with the
Senate, the Office of the President of Burundi, and the University of Burundi. Ministries
received support for the formulation of action plans and eight of them were provided with
vehicles, while 20 received information technology and office equipment (computers and
accessories, and photocopiers). At the decentralized level, plans were formulated in provinces
(17) and communes (129).

29.     Program 15      focused on planning, monitoring and evaluation, and the information
management system. In 2003, a monitoring and evaluation system was developed and approved
at all levels. Users were trained to operate it. Standardized STI/HIV/AIDS data collection tools
were developed. A project planning, monitoring, and evaluation training module was also
developed, and trainers trained in this module. An AIDS INFO database, a documentation center,
and a CNLS website were established, while a macroeconomic impact study on HIV/AIDS in
Burundi and two seroprevalence studies were also conducted.

30.     Program 16 covered project coordination and management. It provided inputs for the
efficient implementation of the project. "Procurement" was the tool used for the acquisition of
goods and services, and the execution of works for the PMLSAO. As a result of frequent
disruptions in the supply of antiretrovirals and reagents, one of the causes of which was the
length of the supply procedures, an amendment to the credit agreement was signed on March 8,
2005 to allow for the acquisition of ARVs and other medical products at an estimated cost of less
than US$500,000 per contract, using the shopping procurement method.

31.     PMLSAO project expenses totaled US$42,292,558.82 with an allocation of 38 percent
for the public sector response, 19 percent for the civil society component, 14 percent for the
OVC component, 13 percent for capacity building, and 14 percent for project management and
coordination, respectively.

32.     Cumbersome administrative and protracted national procurement procedures were the
main causes of frequent disruptions in the supply of antiretrovirals and reagents. In order to
rectify this situation, IDA agreed to modify the procurement procedures. As a result, an
amendment to the credit agreement was signed on March 8, 2005 to allow for the acquisition of
ARVs and other medical products using the shopping procurement method.

Assessment of the Roles of Actors

33.     The objectives formulated in the project were relevant because they were tailored to the
problems they were intended to solve. At times, several of these objectives were not feasible,
because of their formulation and the lack of criteria for assessing the level of attainment.
Moreover, the lack of baseline data for specific indicators has not facilitated the assessment of
progress made.

34.     Implementation has at times been thwarted by the unavailability of funds on one hand,
and the lack of commitment on the part of a number of the actors on the other. The programs
were restructured at mid-term to ensure greater coherence between them.


                                                 52

35.     Youth were involved as actors and not mere beneficiaries. On average, 29 percent of the
CSOs' activities were initiated by the youth themselves. The activities of the AIDS Sector Units
[Unités Sectorielles de Lutte contre le SIDA USLS] that targeted the youth accounted for
approximately 16 percent, and those of the Provincial AIDS Committees [Comités Provinciaux
de Lutte contre le SIDA CPLS] accounted for 35 percent. This demonstrates the importance of
youth as a target group and as actors.

36.     Working through youth centers and Stop AIDS Clubs proved to be a good practice
although the decentralized administrative entities (schools and communes) need to assume more
responsibility for monitoring. The promotion of initiatives mobilized the support of the other
partners (UNICEF supported youth centers in eight provinces) and the management of the youth
centers by the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture.

37.     The contribution of the PMLSAO through the civil society component is significant
based on the current level of commitment shown by associations and the private sector to AIDS
prevention efforts.

38.     The assessment of the financial management of subprojects implemented by civil society
organizations and associations enabled the PES/NAC to determine to what extent the funds made
available to CSOs were used for the purposes stipulated in the Grant Agreements and in
accordance with these agreements.

39.     Likewise, the technical evaluation of the work done by associations revealed the benefits
provided to target groups by the activities of each subproject, especially the relevance in relation
to the PMLSAO objectives, the effectiveness and efficiency in the use of financial resources by
the PMLSAO, and the feasibility and impact of activities conducted for the target groups
indicated in the Burundi Action Plan for the Struggle against HIV/AIDS.


40.     With regard to the support for OVC, it must be acknowledged that the government has
worked hard to pilot the national OVC policy, formulate the national action plan for 2007­2011,
analyze the subprojects submitted by CSOs, and mobilize funds.
41.     CSOs have played the role of implementing agencies for activities on the ground and in
the analysis of OVC subprojects. They have been involved in advocacy for and the identification
of OVC. Religious organizations have been heavily involved in the care of OVC, either by
submitting and implementing subprojects, or by implementing subprojects submitted by CSOs.


Performance of the Bank and the Borrower

42.     The World Bank has played a leadership role in the financing of AIDS prevention
activities in Burundi. The other donors have followed the trail blazed by the World Bank by
adding their own contributions to those of the World Bank. As a result, a national entity was
organized and established (CNLS and its decentralized agencies).

43.     The supervisory missions conducted by the World Bank have enabled the strengthening
of the national entity's operational capacities, especially in terms of planning, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation, and management in general.



                                                  53

Lessons Learned

44.     Leadership and management style are determining factors for the optimal operation of the
entities and organizations involved in the HIV/AIDS response.

45.     A fully operational Management Information System (MIS) with a database is essential
for quality monitoring and evaluation that reflect the prevailing situation, and planning that is
based on objective information describing the real problems to be solved.

46.     Effective decentralization, aided and supported by the other development partners, has
proven to be a sure and effective means of providing national response coverage.

47.     Sound management of resources justified by the audit reports is an indication of the
confidence placed in the national project management entity and the professionalism of the
managers.

 Annex 10: Summary of Key Findings of the 2005 Evaluation of the Three-Province Pilot
                                     Project for Orphans and Vulnerable Children


1.         As the Bank required, prior to expanding the geographic coverage of this component beyond the
pilot provinces of Karuzi, Kayanza and Muramvya, the government undertook a 2005 qualitative and
quantitative impact analysis of the pilot activity based on a survey of 2602 beneficiaries, one-half of
whom were children birth to 18 years of age; and the other half heads of households where they resided.

2.         Multidimensional impacts of the pilot project were found that resulted in major overall direct and
indirect improvements in the lives of the beneficiaries of support provided via MAOP. A high degree of
satisfaction with OVC services provided was documented. Among the most significant impacts on the
OVC were: (i) an increased rate of schooling due to enrollment of new students, reintegration of those
who had interrupted education and pursuit of schooling by those who had left due to lack of resources; (ii)
reduced rate of grade repetition and school abandonment among assisted orphans compared to those not
assisted; (iii) acquisition of new technical/professional competencies via different workshops attended by
OVC who never attended school or dropped out previously; (v) improvements in the living conditions of
OVC due to economic support provided to host families, principally through increasing household
resources for home and nutritional improvements; (vi) increased identification and resolution of cases of
exploitation and abuse, principally through enhancing OVC knowledge of their rights, also leading to a
significant reduction in the occurrence of new cases. These findings, while encouraging, must be
interpreted with caution, as there was no baseline information regarding the vulnerability of the assisted
children prior to the project, as is crucial to determine actual impact.

3.         Importantly, the study found no health impact on beneficiaries. Widespread problems of access to
health care were indicated with many public and private health providers reportedly refusing to accept the
public health insurance mechanism (CAM) to pay for services rendered. The evaluation warned that lack
of access to health care placed orphans at high risk given their prevalent morbidity and mortality.

4.         Three groups were found to be the most vulnerable: children heads of households, abandoned
children including street children, and children infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.

5.         Overall the study recommended the continuation and expansion of coverage of the OVC
component. Among the main conclusions emanating from evaluation of the pilot provinces was that the
multidimensional demands orphans and their families face -- coupled with the generally high costs of
response -- demand improvements in performance of discrete interventions. With specific reference to
school support, it was suggested that the PES/NAC reorient funds previously allocated to payment of
school fees to other facets of school support also needed to ensure regular attendance. It also was
recommended that a better mechanism be put in place within the school system to monitor the academic
performance of those OVC.3 Subsidies provided for primary education and vocational training were
found to be especially important to encourage attendance, particularly as coverage under this component
was expanded to those 16 to 18 years of age--a highly vulnerable subgroup--as noted earlier in the ICR.
The subsidies went predominantly towards primary school fees, but funding was also needed for
associated requirements (e.g. uniforms and textbooks) whose costs in aggregate represented the major
category of expenditure within the OVC component. The evaluation revealed that these subsidies served



3Note: This was particularly important in terms of providing reliable data for the Project's Key Performance Indicator that sought measure
increases in the proportion of assisted orphans who advance to the next grade of primary school




                                                                       58

as strong incentives for school attendance, even though they went directly to the schools. Investments in
small-scale income generating activities and gardening to enhance the economic and nutritional well-
being of families and communities hosting orphans proved to be a powerful inducement for the social
integration of orphans, particularly among the poorest subgroups.

6.       In terms of the next phase of operations, it was urged that high priority be assigned to prevention,
treatment, and care and support to children infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. This should include
identification of those at highest risk in the community, provision of quality psychological and medical
care, including treatment of opportunistic infections and potentially ARV treatment; and refinement of the
HIV/AIDS program to respond to vulnerable children in general and OVC in specific.

7.       Specific suggestions to improve management of the component were for the PES/NAC to:
improve its collaboration with the OVC component-executing agencies, including helping them improve
their capacity; instituting a more rigorous selection process with a view toward obtaining a true
"professionalization" of executing agencies; identifying alternatives to the CAM to ensure OVC access to
health care and services; promoting children's rights, including strengthening the capacity of local level
committees to protect their rights; creating a national cadre who will respond to OVC needs; and
establishing and maintaining an interface between OVC activities and those to protect children against
vulnerabilities.

8.       It was further recommended that streamlined procedures be introduced to facilitate CSO
participation in OVC activities. The evaluators also suggested increased quality control of the component,
including conducting an internal audit of performance of all CSOs carrying out OVC projects to identify
the best and worst performers. This was viewed as crucial given the priority being attached to
accountability for use of grants. The audit would serve a dual purpose: it would cull poor performers
while also helping to inform the Council's Permanent Executive Secretariat about needed revisions to its
criteria to guide future selection of CSOs to deliver OVC services and, thus, enhance overall component
performance.

9.       These OVC pilot project findings were complemented by a subsequent independent technical
evaluation of all subprojects executed by CSOs. The November 2008 report of this later evaluation found
significant improvements in the status of orphans who were beneficiaries of the project financed grants,
including: a 58.8 percent rate of school attendance and reduction of school dropout; a 57.5 percent
improvement in the health status of the orphan and family; a 55.5 percent improvement in behavior; a
49.7 percent increase in new knowledge; and a 24.8 percent increase in family revenues/income.

             Annex 11: Achievement of Project Development Objectives (details)


1.      Achievement of the Project's two primary PDOs--slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS and
mitigating its effects--is rated "Moderately Satisfactory". The core KPIs outlined in Section 1.2
included four "outcome" measures. Of these, three sought to measure extent of achievement of selected
behavioral changes essential to slow the rate of new infections, as anticipated from project investments in
orphans' progression in primary school, as anticipated from Project-financed education subsidies and
other social and economic assistance provided to orphans and their host families. Two of the output
indicators sought to measure progress in creating selected essential pre-conditions for slowing the spread
of HIV/AIDS, while the third assessed extent to which orphans received crucial supports. All three
process indicators focused on execution of project-financed grants to civil society organizations to carry
out HIV/AIDS activities. Projected causal linkages between key activities the project financed, output
indicators and anticipated outcomes were reasonable.

2.      HIV prevalence appears to have stabilized or be declining. When ARV treatment began being
provided, it was generally agreed that HIV prevalence in the general population was no longer a viable
measure of HIV transmission (because prevalence could increase due to longer survival by PLWHAs
alone). Moreover, the 2002 national sero-prevalence survey used a different methodology from the 2007
survey, making comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, the survey data suggests that the prevalence of
HIV/AIDS may be at least stabilizing if not declining, In 2001, the sero-prevalence rate was 3.2 percent in
the general population 12 years of age and older while in 2007 the prevalence rate among people 18 years
of age and older was 2.97 percent. More importantly as a measure of HIV transmission, HIV prevalence
was 3.5 percent among those 15-24 years of age in 2001 and was found to be 3.1 percent among the same
age group in 2007.

3.       Data from seven sentinel surveillance sites monitoring patients continuously since 1999 and an
eighth site which resumed operation in 2005 suggest that HIV prevalence among pregnant women may
have declined between 2002 and 2007, as shown in Table 11.1. Clearly, these data must be interpreted
with caution. As with most surveillance data of this type there is considerable variability from year to year
and an apparent sharp rise in HIV prevalence rates in 2006 is troubling. , Nevertheless, the sentinel site
data provide some indication of trend and some encouragement that HIV prevalence is at least stabilizing.
The observed decrease in between 2002 and 2007 in the prevalence of syphilis among pregnant
women--one of the core project KPIs-- is also encouraging.

Slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS

4.       Behavioral change has occurred among some key groups. Comparison of 2001 and 2007
National Behavioral Survey data for two DCA outcome indicators reveals progress made in reducing
selected high risk behaviors by two target groups. The percentage of adults using a condom during
contact with a non-regular sexual partner rose from 12.7 percent in 2001 to 19.8 percent in 2007. Over the
same period, the percentage of girls 15 and under sexually active decreased from 32.5 percent to 21.5
percent. These data also reveal, however, that by the project's end, the proportion of the adult population
and of young girls at high risk of HIV infection was still quite high compared to other countries in the
Region..

5.       Increases in access to voluntary counseling and testing and preventive services (see Annex 2).
The more than four-fold increase in the number of VCT sites functioning between project start and
completion and almost 3000 persons trained in VCT have contributed to an almost seven-fold increase in
the number of persons tested and informed of their status in 2008 versus 2002 (see Annex 2). The number
of persons 15-49 years of age who were tested in 2007 and 2008, the only years for which disaggregated
data by age and gender are available, represented 3.69 percent and 5.72 percent of the total Burundi
population in that age group. By project end possibly 15-17 percent of Burundi's population had been
tested (if they were only tested once).

NOTE: The number of persons reported as tested in the above tables includes only those 15-49 years of age and
hence are less than those included in Annex 2 tables on beneficiaries of VCT which include all persons tested across
all age groups.

6.       Youth-oriented HIV/AIDS education scaled up significantly. The 4410 youth trained under
the project to serve as peer educators (over 30 for each of the 129 communes) creates a strong cadre with
substantial promise of reaching successive cohorts of youth with crucial information to impact their
behaviors and reduce the risk of infection. The project supported establishment of an extensive network of
sites to engage youth in HIV/AIDS education and dialogue, including 131 youth centers, covering all 129
communes, and 972 Stop SIDA Clubs dispersed nationwide.

7.       A wide public sector commitment to increasing HIV/AIDS awareness among their staff and
constituents. An important step toward slowing the spread of infection is the project's success in
mobilizing a truly multisectoral approach, with all 30 central level public sector institutions having
instituted annual HIV/AIDS Action Plans by project end, compared to only 8 with such Plans at the
project's inception in 2002. These Plans, heavily focused on IEC, over the project period reached in
aggregate 308,065 civil servants, their families and sector constituents, not only raising their awareness of
the epidemic but also of behavioral changes needed to protect against infection. (Annex 2)

8.       Improved safety and management of the nation's blood supply. A key goal of the NASP that
MAOP supported was to reduce HIV transmission through systematic screening of the nation's blood
supply. Over the project period, as noted below, the prevalence of HIV among those donating blood
appeared to fall although the fact that the prevalence was reported as exactly 0.40 percent from 2003 to
2006 raises questions of data quality.

9.       Massive distribution of condoms: Consistent with the project's approach of reaching the general
population with key preventive activities, over 52 million condoms were distributed over the life
of the project.

10.      Significant expansion of PMCT sites to serve both mothers and newborns. The number of
PMCT sites increased from 1 in 2002 to 63 in 2008, contributing directly to a ten-fold increase in the
number of pregnant sero-positive women treated over this same period (Annex 2). Despite this major
scale up of effort, unmet needs for PMCT are significant, with less than 8 percent of HIV infected
pregnant women covered by the project's end, as highlighted below.

coverage at project end remained far below needs, as shown below.

12.               Rapid expansion of ARV and OI treatment capacity: Establishment over the project life of 68
centers for ARV treatment, coupled with the expansion of home-based follow-up and care by CSO grant-
financed subprojects, training of providers in ARV treatment, and project financing of ARVs and other
drugs and supplies, have contributed to a 23-fold increase in the number of PLWHA under treatment from
600 in 2002 to 14,343 in 2008. The 43.7 percent (of 10 percent target ) ARV coverage rate attained in
2007, substantially exceeded the average of 30 percent for the Sub-Saharan Africa region.

Note: *the 43.7 percent coverage in 2007 is based on an estimated total of 250,000 HIV+ persons in Burundi in
2007 of which 10 percent or some 25,000 are clinically/biologically eligible for ARV treatment, consistent with
annual coverage targets in the 2007-2011 NASP. Recent data from the national census and the lower than expected
prevalence rates of the HIV/ADS survey suggest that in 2007 the number of HIV+ people was probably between
215,000-225,000.

15.      The investments in infrastructure and human resources permitted an increase in the number of
Burundians benefitting from priority services of the HIV/AIDS Program over the project life, as revealed
below. Of special note is the almost 700 percent increase in the number of persons receiving VCT and the
2291 percent increase in the number of PLWHA under ARV treatment. The increased access to ARV
treatment likely encouraged testing.

15.         As documented in a 2006 impact evaluation of key project-financed interventions in the three
pilot provinces in which the orphans' component initially was concentrated, these inputs generated
numerous positive outcomes for both orphans and their families. Among the most notable findings were
increased rates of primary school enrollment and reduced rates of repetition and dropout, with supported
orphans attaining much higher promotion and much lower school dropout rates than their peers who were
not orphaned. Notably, over the three school years from 2002-3 through 2004-2005--the focus of the
evaluation-- the number of orphans receiving school assistance almost quadrupled from 5245 in the 2002-
3 academic year to 19,565 in the 2004-5 academic year, the latter representing virtually the totality of the
estimated 19,800 orphans of primary school age in the three provinces in 2004-5. Importantly, by the
2004-5 academic year: (i) primary school enrollment of assisted orphans had increased to 98.8 percent
compared to an average enrollment rate among their non-orphan peers of 84.9 percent in the three pilot
provinces; (ii) assisted orphans' rate of promotion from one primary school grade to the next was 80.7
percent compared to a promotion rate of between 65.1 percent and 77.7 percent in the general school age
population in those provinces; and (iii) the rate of repetition was 16.97 percent and of dropout was 4.1
percent among orphans assisted under MAOP compared to average repetition rates ranging from 27.8 -
32.7 percent and of dropouts between 3.5 percent and 5.4 percent in the primary school age population in
the three provinces.       4  Moreover, although the overall numbers of orphans enrolled at the secondary
school level was significantly lower than those attending primary school, major advances also were
achieved in this key age group: the number of orphans assisted increased from 176 in the 2002-3
academic year to 1655 in the 2004-5 academic year, and their rate of promotion increased from 60.2
percent in the 2002-2003 school year to 83.4 percent in the 2004-5 school year.

16.         These advances contrast sharply with the findings of a 2003 social analysis in the pilot area
indicating that only 43.2 percent of orphans of school age were enrolled in school; that dropouts were
common due to lack of funds to pay school fees and other educational needs; low motivation to continue
schooling; halting of schooling, particularly by girls, to carry out domestic chores including caretaking of
brothers and sisters; interruption of schooling during the national conflict coupled with low reintegration

in schools by those older orphans; and non-enrollment of orphans because the support families, with
limited resources, had favored enrollment of their own children.

17.        Other important outcomes that the 2006 orphans component evaluation revealed included:
attainment of new vocational/technical competencies among older orphans attending project-supported
workshops; improvements in the living conditions of orphans as a result of project supported economic
and food supports to the families in which the orphans reside5; and increased identification and resolution
of cases of orphan exploitation and abuse, as highlighted in Annex 10.

18.        In summary, the above outcome indicators demonstrate progress made toward achievement of the
PDOs over a relatively short time period and under difficult country circumstances. These may be better
gauges of project performance than relying solely on changes in the 10 core KPIs for several reasons: (i)
original baseline values presented in the PAD and ensuing DCA for two of the core outcome indicators
were incorrect, thus significantly underestimating the magnitude of improvement expected in these
indicators by the end of the project;6 (ii) two KPIs related to new OVC initiatives7 for which there were
no baseline data and hence no solid basis for setting targets; and (iii) the low starting point from which
the MAOP embarked, with years of conflict contributing to the large proportion of the population with
limited, if any, access to HIV/AIDS information or to condoms or, importantly, to sites and trained
providers to obtain priority care and services such as VCT, PMCT, ARV, among other HIV/AIDS
associated health care needs. In aggregate, these factors strongly suggest that many KPI targets were
unrealistic. Based solely on DCA KPIs, only one of the four outcome targets, two of the three output
targets and one of the three process targets were fully met; and one process target was partially met..




5The number of households in which orphans resided reporting having just one meal per day fell from 39.7% before the MAOP support to
support families to 18.9% with MAOP support. Concomitantly the quality of the meal improved measurably in project-assisted households. This
underscores the contribution of the income generating activities to the overall well-being of orphans and their host families. Source: Etude
