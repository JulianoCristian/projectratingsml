Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The objectives of the project are to improve the management and conservation of Rio Grande do Sul's natural resources by
promoting an integrated strategy involving the adoption of sustainable land management and soil and water conservation
practices, and improving the income and living conditions of rural poor communities. This would be achieved through
actions involving (i) implementation of integrated natural resources management plans in microcatchments; (ii) supporting
poverty alleviation initiatives aimed at increasing incomes and access to basic services of rural poor communities; and (iii)
strengthening the overall capacity of public and private institutions responsible for natural resources management and
delivery of services to the rural areas.

3. Benefits and target population:
Overall expected benefits would include the sustainable enhancement of the environmental, social, and productive
conditions of a considerable portion of Rio Grande do Sul's rural areas, to be achieved through:
*  Improved management of the State's natural resources and increased soil productivity in an area of about 3.1 million
ha.
•  Increased access to basic social and income-generating infrastructure, services and training to almost 100,000 rural
poor households.
*  More effective presence of State and Municipal public institutions in rural areas, complemented by a greater
participation of the private sector in the delivery of services, and strengthened operation of selected public agencies
responsible for policy-oriented information and management of natural resources.
Project Targeting and Eligibility Criteria (See Annex 2b)
Beneficiary targeting: Rio Grande do Sul has approximately 2.1 million rural inhabitants, of which an estimated 360,000
families are small farmers, including 234,000 categorized as poor (i.e., incomes below 1.5 minimum monthly salaries
[SMM]). Of these, the project would be targeted to: (i) small farmers in microcatchments with soil limitations; and (ii)
rural poor households throughout the State. Within these two categories, the project is expected to reach a total of about
132,000 rural households, of which an estimated 98,000 would be poor and 34,000 would be small farmers.
Geographical targeting: Given that the most severe land management problems are concentrated in the northern and central
partions of the state, and in order to concentrate institutional resources, the Natural Resources Management Component
would be implemented within the boundaries of a pre-defmed priority area, representing approximately 45% of the total
area of the state. This area includes all 313 municipalities presenting the most severe soil erosion problems and the highest
concentration of small farmers. Although the majority of the state's rural poor are also located in the Priority Area, eligible
beneficiaries for poverty alleviation activities would not be restricted to the Priority Area, given that pockets of rural poor
households exist throughout the state. Based on this criteria for geographical targeting, all natural resources subprojects
and an estimated 80% of poverty alleviation subprojects are expected to be implemented within the priority area.
Eligibility Criteria: Project assistance would be provided to communities or groups of eligible beneficiaries. To be eligible
for project support, individual beneficiaries within the group would have to meet a series of easily verifiable criteria related
to holding size, living conditions and source of income. To be eligible for poverty alleviation subprojects, each household
within the group would: (i) own or farm a unit of up to one M6dulo Fiscal (MF) of land (an area ranging from 7 to 20 ha,
depending on agroecological conditions); (ii) reside permanently on the property; (iii) not require hired labor for production;
and (iv) not own powered agricultural machinery or vehicles. In the case of NRM, subprojects would be implemented
exclusively within microcatchments in the priority area. Eligible communities would be comprised of poor farmers living
within a microcatchment presenting soil degradation or erosion limitations and small farmers with a maximum area
equivalent..o 2 MFs.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 6 years
Executing agencies: State Secretariat of Agnrculture
Project Implementation: Assisted by a highly decentralized institutional support structure, involving councils at the
municipal level and technical staff of field offices, the SAA would establish an efficient and transparent mechanism to
channel technical and financial resources for the implementation of beneficiary-demanded investment subprojects to eligible
communities of rural poor and small farmers. The main instrument for providing financial assistance would be through
grants that would partially cover the costs of subprojects. In the case of income generating subprojects a pilot cost recovery
scheme would be tested during the first year of project implementation as part of a study on cost recovery (see Sections 8
and 20). For the natural resources management (NRM) component, subprojects would be implemented on the basis of a
package of investments identified in the Microcatchment Development Plans, prepared by all members of each
microcatchment assisted by public or private technical assistance. Poverty alleviation subprojects would be targeted to
communities of poor households, in most cases living within the same microcatchments implementing NRM subprojects.
Beneficiary group formation would be promoted and sponsored by public and private organizations, while subprojects
would be generated by demand, and prepared and implemented with support from technical assistance provided by the
project. All instutional and implementation arrangements are described in detail in the Project Implementation Manual.

Country: Brazil                                    Project Title: Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
The draft version of the Manual was reviewed by the Bank at appraisal, agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Manual would not be amended without Bank approval, while the final version of the Manual, satisfactory to the Bank,
would be condition of Loan Effectiveness.
Project management: The Project Management Unit (SEP), within the SAA, would be responsible for overall inter-
institutional coordination, project administration, monitoring of project implementation, and liasion with the Bank on
operational matters.
Project oversight: At the central level, project oversight would be the responsibility of the Project Council (CSP) a policy-
oriented entity comprised of three State Secretariats (Agriculture, Planning and Finance), one representative from the
municipal governments and two representatives from private beneficiary organizations (Federations of Farmers and Rural
Workers). At the local level, specific oversight of implementation activities will be conducted by the Municipal Council,
composed of members of the local government, and of representatives of the beneficiaries, private sector and NGO
community.
Accounting, financial reports and audits: The project's draft accounting plan was reviewed at appraisal and would
constitute an integral element of the computerized Management Information System, using tailor-made software to be
developed during the initial stages of project implementation. SAA, through SEP, would submit semiannual progress
reports to the Bank, including consolidated financial data. Extemal audit reports, prepared by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank would be submitted annually not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. In addition,
comprehensive physical audits of beneficiary subprojects would be conducted on a randomly selected sample of approved
subprojects by BANRISUL.
Monitoring and evaluation: A Monitoring and Impact Assessment Unit (UMA) would be established within the SEP.
Included in the semi-annual progress reports to be submitted to the Bank, SEP would include an update of the status of the
various indicators for project performance with information from BANRISUL regarding the control and supervision of
beneficiary subprojects. In addition, SAA would prepare and submit an Annual Operating Plan (POA) for Bank review in
the month of November of each year. As part of regular project supervision, joint SAA/Bank annual reviews would be
undertaken, including an in-depth Mid-Term Review, tentatively scheduled for August 2000. Independent evaluations of
the projects socioeconomic impact would be conducted jointly by the Foundation for Economic Studies (FEE) and the
Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project   Date of latest CAS discussion: June 27, 1996
Document Number:           R96-111-1
The project is fully supportive of the key objectives of the CAS, as discussed at the Board on June 29, 1995 and in the
progress report of June 27, 1996, including: (i) direct rural poverty alleviation by improving poor rural households' access
to water, sanitation and public services and ensuring a transparent resource allocation system to meet the basic needs of the
rural poor; and (ii) consolidation of natural resources management by strengthening the State's environmental capacity,
especially related to parks management, production practices, land titling; and monitoring and enforcement capabilities. To
this end, the project's key indicators would measure the impact on rural poverty alleviation and improvement in the
conditions of natural resources in the project area. While adapted to specific conditions to the State of Rio Grande do Sul,
the original concept for this project was modeled after the Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resources Management
Project for the State of Parand (Ln. 4060-BR), as well as the earlier, and highly successful Land Management Project in
Parana (Ln. 3018-BR). The project, as a lending operation which was built upon prior success, is an example of a
"repeater operation", as recommended in the CAS Progress Report.
The project is also fully consistent with the Bank's strategy for direct lending to Brazilian States. Due to its present
creditworthiness status, Bank lending in Rio Grande do Sul is contingent on the implementation of the ongoing public sector
reform program initiated by the current administration, that would be supported by a Bank project (State Reform Loan
approved March 4, 1997). The proposed project would represent a direct complement to the objectives of the State Reform
Loan, as it would address social issues arising in rural areas from the measures being implemented by the reform program.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Major issues currently confronting the State are:
* High concentration of poverty in the rural sector. More than 40% of the rural population lives in poverty, unable to
satisfy their basic needs. The majority of the rural poor are in the farm population. The incidence of rural poverty is
high and fuels the rate of rural migration which contributes to the State's metropolitan unemployment rate of 15%,
considerably higher than the national unemployment rate.
(see: "O Mapa da Fome", IPEA, Brasilia, 1993; and "Brazil: Poverty Assessment", June 1995);
*  Weak competitive position of the agricultural sector, its most important sector, which together with agro-industry,
represents 45% of the State's economy. While strategically positioned to take advantage of the market potential created
by MERCOSUL, expanded growth will require a substantial improvement in competitiveness. The increasing exposure
of Rio Grande do Sul's agricultural sector to international competition, along with the gradual withdrawal of
government support programs and declining productivity, has created an urgent need for the sector to increase its
efficiency and responsiveness to the demands of the domestic and international markets. (see: "Trade, Exchange Rate
and Agricultural Pricing Policies in Brazil", Report 10185, November 1991, "Adjustment and Poverty in Mexican
Agriculture", WPS 1494, August 1995.)
*  Natural resource degradation due to poor management which has resulted in widespread soil erosion, nutrient depletion
and fertility losses as well as water pollution due to inadequate agrochemical-chemical application and disposal.
Management limitations have contributed to the declining productivity and sustainability of the agricultural sector, as
well as increased environmental concerns. (see: "The Cost and Benefits of Soil Conservation: The Farmer's
Viewpoint", Lutz, Ernst, The World Bank Research Observer, vol. 9, n° 2 (July 1994), pp. 273-95); and
*   State's fiscal imbalance, caused by increasing decentralization of the provision of public services to the state level and
swollen public payrolls. (see: "Brazil: Structural Reform and Sector Policies", Report 13913-BR, June, 1995; "Brazil:
State Debt: Crisis and Reform" Report 14842-BR, November 1996; "State Capture and Fiscal Adjustment im Brazil",
PSD Paper 22, December 1995; and "Creditworthiness of the State of Rio Grande do Sul", LAIPS, August 1996).
To address these issues, the State government:
* is promoting increased participation of municipal governments in the delivery of social services;
* has been selected by the Federal Government as a priority state for both the "Solidaridad" and the Family Agriculture
(PRONAF) Programs;
* is improving its rural technical assistance efforts, including extension and research, aimed at increasing the incomes of
small and poor farmers;
* reestablished a targeted rural finance program designed to stimulate small-scale agricultural modernization and
diversification through financing of investments proposed by groups of farmers (condominios rurais); and initiated a
progra  of fiscal reform, including public payroll cuts, privatization of public enterprises and debt rescheduling.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
*  reducing the incidence of rural poverty through targeted investments designed to increase on-and off-farm incomes,
generate employment and improve the standard of living of poor farm households;
*  providing financial and technical assistance, as well as training, to small farm households to introduce sustainable
agricultural production practices, promote diversification into higher-valued crops and support investment in greater
vertical integration and new small-scale agro-industrial enterprises;
*   increasing the participation of the private sector by promoting strategic partnerships between the private and public
sectors, especially in the areas of extension, technical assistance, park management, and adaptive research; and
*   strengthening the State's capacity to promote both the preservation of natural resources among small and poor farmers,
oprovide effective support services in rural areas.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Realizing that the entire target population could not be reached with the available resources, the Bank and the State of Rio
Grande do Sul agreed to apply a well-defined targeting mechanism to enhance, to the greatest extent possible, the poverty
alleviation impact of these resources. Hence, it was decided to concentrate project activities in a priority region,
characterized by its relatively high degree of rural poverty and natural resource deterioration. To fuirther strengthen the

Country: Brazil                                      Project Title: Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
project's effectiveness, it was decided to focus the poverty alleviation activities on the poorest rural households living in the
project microcatchments in the priority region. This strategy would nevertheless allow the project to reach about 40% of
the target population.
Despite the State's interest in establishing an integrated strategy that would include support to social, environmental and
agricultural initiatives, the possibility of including an agricultural modernization component was discarded, given the more
urgent need to address the deteriorating environmental problems of rural areas, as a precondition to the promotion of
agricultural diversification initiatives. Instead, it was decided that project design would include small-scale diversification
initiatives, but exclusively targeted to eligible beneficiaries of the poverty alleviation component.
Given the socioeconomic conditions of potential beneficiaries, combined with the "public good" nature of most subprojects,
particularly those involving natural resources management, the alternatives of either implementing a full cost recovery
system, or providing financing to cover subproject costs only partially, were considered and eventually ruled out.
However, a cost-sharing arrangement based on a contribution of 20% of subproject costs by beneficiaries would be
required, while the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of all types of subprojects would be fully financed by the
beneficiary communities. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of the viability of implementing a cost recovery system
would be conducted during the early stages of the project, supported by a pilot initiative involving partial repayment of
investments for imcome-generati   subprojects.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in project design
As a result of the lessons derived from the Bank's two decades of experience in Brazil supporting rural poverty alleviation
[(POLONORDESTE (1975-84); Northeast Rural Development Program ( 1985-93); and the Poverty Alleviation Projects
(PAPPs) in Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe (since 1995)], and natural resources management (Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural
Resources Management in Parana; and Land Management Projects in Parana, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso), this
project has adopted: (i) a highly transparent decision-making structure, relying upon objectively verifiable beneficiary screening
criteria, beneficiary participation at all subproject stages, and investment selection criteria which emphasize economic and
environmental sustainability; and (ii) a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system to measure and improve project
pefformance, minimize resource deviations and document project impact and lessons learned.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The project reinforce the some of the key elements of the State's economic development strategy designed to reduce rural
poverty, protect the State's natural resource base, increase private sector participation and improve public sector efficiency.
The project would contribute to reduce the potential impact of the ongoing State Reform Program on rural communities,
and would consolidate and strengthen existing State initiatives in the rural sector. Despite its fiscal austerity program, the
State has demonstrated the priority accorded to rural development by increasing budgetary support to EMATER to improve
its rural extension work. Furthermore, financial commitment would be ensured by a series of implementation features,
including: (i) the establishment of a project account providing a readily available amount of counterpart funds; (ii) the
creation of a separate item for the project in the annual budget of the Secretariat of Agriculture and; (iii) the formal
intention of participating municipalities to contribute a significant share of the counterpart funding requirements for
subproject implementation, thus contributing to reduce the impact of the project on the State's financial resources. In
addition, the borrower has already prepared a series of key documents for project implementation, which were submitted for
Bank review and approval prior to loan negotiations, as follows:
*  draft legal documents for the establishment of the Project Executive Secretariat (SEP) incorporating the structure and
job description of the main positions;
*  draft agreement between SAA and BANRISUL including a detailed description of the operational procedures to be
implemented by BANRISUL for the transfer of project funds to be beneficiary communities and the subsequent
monitoring of subprojects;
* draft agreement between SAA and each participating agency, including EMATER, FEPAM, and EMBRAPA;
* final drafts of the Project Implementation Manual and Annual Operating Plan (POA) for 1997; and
* draft outline of the TOR for all evaluations to be conducted by the project (socioeconomic conditions of beneficiaries,
project impact on land and natural resources management, mid-term review) as well as consulting services and research
projects to be contracted during the first year of project implementation
12. Value added of Bank support
The Bank, with its extensive experience in poverty alleviation and natural resources management in Brazil and, most
recently, in southern Brazil, is uniquely qualified to support the Government of Rio Grande do Sul in its efforts to reduce
rural poverty by improving living conditions, stimulating the rural economy and promoting sustainable agricultural
production and agro-enterprises. The Bank's expertise in these areas contributed to the design of a highly decentralized
project based on participation of beneficiaries, who are targeted by means of simple and easily verifiable eligibility criteria
and will provide valuable guidance in project implementation and supervision. Because of its experience, the Bank advised
for: (i) subproject standardization, to facilitate the subproject cycle; (ii) cost-sharing arrangements, to ensure sustainability;
and (iii) a strong project monitoring and evaluation system.

Based on assumptions made of likely profiles of beneficiary demand, the internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the
project's natural resources management activities has been estimated at 21%. This rate of return is considered conservative
as it does not take into account the long-term benefits to farmers accruing from reduced soil run-off, nor does it capture the
"without-project" productivity losses due to declining soil fertility. Further, an analysis of a sample of likely off-farm
income-generating subprojects indicates that the IERRs would range from 15% to over 30%. Adequate returns from these
investments would be assured, as the project would finance only technically and economically sound proposals, i.e., IERR
exceeding 12%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital. In terms of sensitivity analysis, the calculations show that the
overall IERR of the project decreases from 21% to 16% and 16.8% when benefits fall by 10% or costs increase by 10%,
respectively. If both sensitivity analysis assumptions occured simultaneously, the project's IERR would remain at an
acceptable 11.7%.
Given the demand-driven nature of the project, estimates of the fiscal impact of the project were based on the actual taxes to
be generated by purchases made by the project. Although the cost benefit analysis results in a net fiscal loss during the
implementation period, this would be rapidly offset in the medium term by a considerable reduction in subsidies to the target
population, combined with a substantial increase in taxes generated by subproject revenues.

14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 4)           NPV=US$ 376.5 million; FRR=  33.3%
The overall financial rate of return (FRR) of the project's natural resources and income generation activities has been
estimated at 33.3%. Individual subprojects, selected from a sample of potential income-generation subprojects, show a
range of relatively attractive financial returns (see table in Annex 4), thus suggesting that potential beneficiaries would have
adequate financial incentives to participate in the project.
.... ................................................................................. ............... ..... ........................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment:
The project is technically sound, given that:
*  The basic constraints to improved natural resources management and the current living conditions of the rural poor have
been adequately diagnosed during preparation;and innovative and viable operational mechanisms have been selected to
address the identified constraints, both in terms of natural resources management and rural poverty alleviation.
*  Proven packages of appropriate technologies are readily available to project beneficiaries.
*  An effective network of support services from public and private sources, operating predominantly at the local level
would be established and strengthened.
The compliance of individual beneficiary subprojects with adequate technical and operational standards would be ensured
by a combination of factors, including technical support in the identification, preparation and implementation of proposals,
as well as the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, primarily based on a "physical and
technical audit" mechanism that would cover a representative sample of         subprojects
16. Institutional Assessment:
Despite the inherent risks of the highly decentralized nature of the two main components, the project is institutionally sound,
based on the following features:
*  Effective implementation of beneficiary subprojects would be ensured by the coordinated participation, particularly at
the local level, of three key entities: the Municipal Council (promotion and prioritization), EMATER (technical
support), and Banrisul (financial management and monitoring of subproject implementation). EMATER and Banrisul
currently maintain a network of adequately-staffed local offices in all municipalities of the State. Both institutions
would provide not only operational support to Municipal Councils and subproject beneficiaries at the field level, but
also direct linkage and managerial feedback to the Secretariat of Agriculture (SAA), through a well structured reporting
system to the Project Management Unit (SEP). The roles and responsibilities of each of the institutions participating in
the subproject cycle have been clearly defined during preparation, and described in detail in the Project Implementation
Manual, developed with the active participation of each agency.
*  Current weaknesses in the capacity of institutions involved in various aspects of natural resources management and
environmental issues would be addressed as part of the project. The project would strengthen the operation of selected
units within SAA, including the Natural Resources Department (DRNR). With regards to the management of selected
state parks and reserves; the Cadastre Department (DACC), to improve existing land titling operations; the agricultural
information system and GIS; and the Animal Health Department (DPA), to improve monitoring and inspection of

l livestock subprojects financed by the project. In addition, FEPAM, the State's Environmental Protection Agency,
would be supported to facilitate their role in the environmental screening of subprojects and training of project staff on
environmental issues.
*  Effective overall administrative and institutional coordination of the project would be provided by a Project
Management Unit, Secretaria Executiva do Projeto (SEP), which would be staffed by a team of highly qualified
professionals in managerial, technical and administrative disciplines. The core staff of the SEP would be sourced form
the Project Preparation Unit, thus ensuring adequate understanding of both project design and implementation
.requirements. At appraisal, the job descriptions for all managerial position     e SEP were reviewed by the Bank.
17. Social Assessment:
The project is expected to directly reach about 40% of the 234,000 poor smahllolder families, the State's target population.
Many of those not directly serviced by the project would benefit indirectly through greater rural economic activity and
employment opportunities, as well as improved soil and water conditions. However, once this project has been implemented
successfully, the government could consider expanding coverage to reach the entire target population (see Section 20:
Sustainability). While women are expected to participate in every project phase and component, specific training activities
have been tailored to accommodate their special logistic constraints.
An estimated 16,00 indigenous people are included among the rural poor in Rio Grande do Sul. These indigenous people
belong to two distinct ethnic groups, the Kaingang and the Mbya-Guarani, and scattered in some 30 communities, mostly
located in the northern area of the state. The Federal Government's Foundation for Amerindian Affairs (FUNAI) was
consulted on project design and agreed to provide the necessary support to ensure access and participation of indigenous
communities in project activities. A satisfactory Indigenous Participation Plan was designed and incorporated into the
Imleetation Manual.

18. Environmental Assessment: Environmental Category [ I A [X] B [1] C
Because of its strong natural resource management orientation, the project is expected to yield major direct and explicit
environmental benefits, particularly in soil conservation, and park and natural reserve protection. The project would not
involve: (i) deforestation; (ii) threat to biodiversity; (iii) construction of new roads or large water control works; or (iv)
negative impacts on ethnic groups. NGOs, regional commissions and state agencies, assembled in August 1996, concluded
that the project was environmentally sound. The environmental screening criteria for subprojects would be incorporated
into the Project Implementation Manual and reviewed by the Bank prior to loan effectiveness. The procedures for
incorporating environmental dimensions into the subproject cycle would vary with the subproject depending upon: (i) the
expected change in land use, with particular reference to rural roads; (ii) the degree of rehabilitation needed within
microcatchments; and (iii) the potential for the generation of point-source pollution. Federal and state legislation, applicable
to the project area, provides adequate environmental safeguards, applying environmental quality standards which meet Bank
requirements. Enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has been effective. Operational support to FEPAM and
EMATER, the agencies directly related to environmental assessment and management, is provided for in the project's

The preparation team designed the project with substantial input from discussions held with representative communities
concerning the socioeconomic needs and goals of the project's target population. The project would be primarily driven by
the beneficiaries, who would participate in the identification, preparation and implementation of subprojects. Beneficiaries
and their representatives would participate in the Municipal Council deliberations determining the subproject portfolio. In
addition, throughout project implementation, selected target communities would be monitored by means of participatory
rapid rural appraisals (RRA) to determine project progress and interim effects, and provide valuable feedback to improve
project performance. By requiring a high degree of beneficiary participation, an indirect project gain would be the
consolidation of civil society among the poorer segments of the rural sector. A comprehensive participation plan was
developed and incorporated in the Implementation Manual.
20. Sustainability:
The project would be fiscally, economically and environmentally sustainable. The comprehensive targeting mechanism
utilized during project preparation, the resulting eligibility criteria developed to screen project beneficiaries, combined with
the establishment of a rigorous individual graduation mechanism, and the expected substantial overlap of land management
and poverty reduction interventions, would ensure the overall sustainability of project actions. Based on estimates of the
State Reform Loan, the State's fiscal situation is expected to be sound enough to fully cover the loan's financial obligations.
In terms of replicability, the project is sustainable since expanding project coverage to the entire target population would
require an estimated US$550 million equivalent to about 1% of the State GDP (US$50 billion). The project would be
economically sustainable as only income generating subprojects with an IERR exceeding the opportunity cost of capital
would be considered for project financing. Furthermore, a cost recovery system could be introduced for income generating
subprojects, provided that a viable and sustainable mechanism can be identified during the initial stages of project
implementation. The draft TORs for a study on cost recovery options, combined with an assessment of the existing rural
finance system in the State were prepared and agreed upon during negotiations. By introducing sustainable natural
resources management practices, environmental sustainability would be a direct and explicit project benefit.

BRAZIL/Rio Grande do Sul
Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Detailed Project Description
1. Natural Resources Management - US$60.6 millien
This component would be targeted to small and poor farmers living within microcatchments located in the project priority
area. The purpose of the component would be to reduce land degradation and natural resources management introducing
sustainable soil and water conservation practices to groups of eligible farmers organized within the microcatclment. Based
on tentative demand projections, the component would directly benefit about 112,000 rural households in over 1,000
microcatchments, by providing grants to finance subproject proposals included in the Microcatchment Development Plan,
an integrated plan to be prepared by the group of beneficiaries in each microcatchment, with technical assistance from
EMATER-RS or professionals from private organizations (cooperatives, NGOs, universities, etc.). The main elements
expected to be included in the subprojects would include soil conservation infrastructure (terracing and contours, subsoil
ripping, gully control, vegetative strips, etc.), small farm equipment (direct planting machinery, minimum tillage
implements, subsoil plows, and inputs (lime), improvement and/or rehabilitation of roads within assisted microcatchments,
forestation of degraded areas and river banks, agro-chemical mixing and disposal facilities, and technical assistance.
2. Poverty Alleviation - US$96.4 million
This component would provide grants to finance up to 80% of the costs of social infrastructure and income-generation
subprojects targeted to groups of rural poor households predominantly living in the municipalities and microcatchments of
the project's priority area. It is estimated that poverty alleviation activities would reach about 85,000 poor families.
Eligibility of groups and individual households would be determined through a screening process, utilizing a set of poverty-
linked objectively verifiable criteria, conducted by local EMATER staff, and validated by the Municipal Councils. To
ensure that, despite the demand-driven nature of the project, the subprojects are adequately linked to project objectives, a
series of mechanisms for subproject selection, based on beneficiary and subproject eligibility, have been developed. The
component would finance subproject proposals prepared and presented by beneficiary groups, with assistance from public
or private sponsors. EMATER's field staff of EMATER would review proposals to ensure their technical, economic and
environmental soundness. The proposals would subsequently be presented to the Municipal Council which would confirm
the proposals for financing and submit them to the SEP, which would instruct BANRISUL to transfer the approved funds to
the beneficiaries.
Social Infrastructure subprojects would help improve the standard of living of rural poor families. According to
demand projections, the subprojects are expected to benefit more than 43,000 poor households by financing
investments in social infrastructure through grants, including installment of connections to provide household
electricity, improvement in residential water and sanitation services, and provision of community facilities.
Income-generation subprojects would help to increase household earnings, diversify income sources and provide
rural employment. The sub-component would benefit some 42,000 beneficiaries, and would finance on- and off-
farm subprojects involving diversification of production systems (small-scale livestock production, fish farming,
greenhouses, etc.) and establishment of cottage agroprocessing industries, craft and textile manufacturing facilities.

3. Support Services - US$20.1 million.
This component is designed to achieve the short-term objective of ensuring effective project implementation by providing
adequate support to subproject beneficiaries, as well as the longer-term objective of improving the performance of public
institutions and the participation of the private sector, in the delivery of support services to the rural sector. Activities to be
supported include:
Adaptive Research - US$3.0 million
This sub-component would finance research activities under direct-contract and competitive bidding mechanisms.
EMBRAPA, the national research organization with two centers located in Rio Grande do Sul, would be allocated
about 40% of the research budget to validate and transfer cost-effective production and soil conservation
technologies through a network of reference farms, representative of the project's target agro-ecological conditions
and beneficiaries. The remaining 60% of the adaptive research budget would be awarded through competitive
bidding to finance demand-driven proposals to other research agencies to investigate income generation and natural
resource conservation issues, according to the priorities identified by project beneficiaries.
Training - US$11.7 million
This sub-component would provide a comprehensive training program to both project beneficiaries and staff of
institutions involved in project implementation. Training for beneficiaries would be coordinated by EMATER,
while the training programs for executing agencies would be implemented by the Foundation for Human Resources
Development (FDRH). With regards to project beneficiaries, the training program would be complementary to the
extension activities envisaged, and would include the diverse elements of the subproject cycle (identification,
preparation and implementation), as well as addressing technical and social skill gaps needed for overall
improvement of quality of living and generation of income. The training activities are expected to be delivered both
on-site and residentially, depending on the nature of the specific training event and the constraints of beneficiaries.
For the residential portion of the program, the project would help to improve the infrastructure and specialized
equipment of existing training centers within the project priority area. The training component would involve an
estimated 3,600 on-site and 1,800 residential training events, involving about 54,000 and 26,000 beneficiaries,
respectively. Once the training centers are fully operational, the SAA plans to transfer the management and
administration of facilities to qualified local institutions, such as community organizations or farmer cooperatives.
Technical Assistance - US$5.4 million
In order to ensure adequate technical input in the identification, preparation and implementation of subprojects, the
project would provide technical assistance to beneficiary groups. This would involve the recruitment of locally-
based private consultants or institutions, as well as the support to be provided by public institutions, particularly
EMATER. In addition to private consultants, the component would finance the operational upgrading of
EMATER's field offices in the project priority area, including computers, office equipment, and vehicles, aimed at
supporting the various stages of the subproject cycle, providing technical support to the Municipal Councils, and
delivering improved extension services to project beneficiaries.
4. Institutional Development - US$11.5 million
Agricultural Information System - US$0.5 million
The project would support the establishment and dissemination of a comprehensive data base containing
information on agricultural production, producer and market prices, production cost, trade, as well as local and
intemational market demand.

Country: Brazil                                        Project Title: Natural Reaources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Institutional Strengthening- US$3.3 million
This sub-component would strengthen the operation of selected departments within SAA with direct responsibility
in project execution such as DACC, DPA, and SEN and of the State Environmental Protection Agency (FEPAM).
Specifically, the project would provide the necessary equipment to assist DACC in delivering land titling and GIS
services, DPA for the improvement of monitoring and inspection duties regarding livestock subprojects involving
livestock and SEN for the promotion of non-traditional exports among project beneficiaries. Support to FEPAM
would be aimed at the agency's participation in the environmental screening of subprojects as well as the
coordination and delivery of environmental training to project staff working in the field (EMATER extensionists,
municipal technicians, etc.).
Parks and Natural Reserves - US$4.3 million
This sub-component would provide support to DRNR aimed at improving the administration and management of
five of the State's parks and natural reserves (Espigdo Alto, lbirapuitO Litoral Norte, Rondinha, and Turvo). In
particular, the project would assist in the development and implementation of management plans for selected parks,
reclaim several hundreds of ha of "protected" land under effective protection and establish sustainable fee revenue
sources for park administration by attracting visitors with improved facilities.
Studies - US$1.0 million
The project would finance a series of studies that would contribute to the sustainability of project activities and the
improvement of the State's knowledge base for defining sectoral policies, as well as improving operational and
technical strategies in support of the rural community. Specifically, the need has been identified to conduct studies
in the areas of rural finance, cost recovery mechanisms, role and alternatives of small-scale farming within
Mercosul, and improvement of socioeconomic data collection and analysis on rural poverty.
Geographic Information System (GIS) - US$2.4 million
This sub-component would finance the hardware and software, as well as training of staff, necessary for the
establishment of a GIS, to strengthen Government capacity to monitor changes in natural resources use and
management.
5. Project Management- US$5.4 million
Project Executive Secretariat - US$3.3 million
Although the irnplementation of the project involves a limited number of institutions, the highly decentralized nature
of the project calls for the need to establish a unit responsible for coordination of project implementation and
administration, particularly to ensure adequate technical and institutional linkage in the operation of the subproject
cycle. The Project Management Unit (SEP) would be established within the Secretariat of Agriculture, reporting
directly to the Secretary, and would be comprised of a small group of highly qualified professionals in charge of
coordinating the delivery of project components, providing quality control and feedback, as well as a team of
experienced administrative staff, who would maintain and consolidate project finances and accounts, as well as
supporting all stages of the procurement process for the works, goods and services to be purchased under the
project. The core staff of the SEP would be sourced form the Project Preparation Unit, thus ensuring adequate
understanding of both project design and implementation requirements. At appraisal, the job descriptions for all
managerial positions within the SEP were reviewed by the Bank.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                         Page 18
Country: Brazil                                        Project Title: Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Through a combination of direct assistance, training and supervision, the SEP would ensure compliance by all
participating institutions with the procedures specified in the Project Implementation Manual, timely delivery of
project resources and services to beneficiaries, and adequate utilization of administrative, financial, procurement,
and reporting procedures. Given the State's limited experience with Bank operations, it is envisaged that
comprehensive training on Bank procedures for procurement and disbursements will be required for SEP's
managerial and administrative staff. With the exception of purchases for beneficiary-demanded subproject, the
SEP would be responsible for preparing the majority of bidding documents for the project and will also be
responsible for assisting staff of other participating agencies in the elaboration of all documentation required for
procurement of goods works and services under the project.
Monitoring and Evaluation - US$2.1 million
In order to provide adequate supervision of project implementation, as well as an assessment of the impact of
project interventions on beneficiaries, a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&E) would be
established and operated by the Monitoring and Impact Assessment Unit (UMA) within the Project Management
Unit. The MIA would be responsible for standardizing, coordinating, processing, consolidating and reporting on
the input and output data generated by the individual agencies, involved in project implementation. The most
critical aspect of the M&E system will involve the adequate monitoring of those components providing direct
assistance to beneficiaries (i.e. Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation). Given the
operational features of the subproject cycle (decentralized decision-making and implementation, direct financing of
beneficiary investments), Banrisul would be required to combine its role as financial agent responsible for
transferring funds to project beneficiaries with the monitoring of subprojects. The design of the comprehensive
monitoring system is based on a periodic inspection by a qualified team from Banrisul of a randomly-selected
sample of approximately 10% of approved subprojects. For each subproject selected, Banrisul would conduct a
detailed technical audit, involving on-site verification of, and/or compliance with, a series of key subproject
features, including: (i) beneficiary eligibility criteria; (ii) procurement procedures followed, and purchases made in
accordance with specifications of subproject proposals; (iii) sourcing and allocation of financial resources; and (iv)
assessment of subproject establishment and operation.
In response to its dual role within the M&E system, Banrisul would provide SAA with regular reports required for
the project's financial management, as well as specific reports on the physical audits conducted. Eventual
adjustments to subproject implementation procedures and/or specific actions resulting from the audits would be the
responsibility of SAA/SEP, in consultation with the Bank when changes to the Implementation Manual are
involved.
The evaluation of the overall performance and impact of the project will be coordinated by the SEP, and would
involve standard evaluation procedures complemented with beneficiary assessments. Operationally, the evaluation
of socioeconomic aspects of the project would be conducted by a specialized team sourced from two independent
institutions: the locally-based Foundation for Economic Studies (FEE) and the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV),
with extensive relevant experience nationwide. In addition, a more technically focused evaluation of the impact of
project interventions on natural resources would be conducted by EMBRAPA through the compilation and analysis
of the evolution of key soil and water indicators in microcatchments assisted by the project. Specific TOR for both
evaluations have been prepared while the implementation procedures would be fully described in the
Implementation Manual.

BRAZIL/Rio Grande do Sul
Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Targeting and Eligibility Cnrteria
Beneficiary targeting: The total rural population of Rio Grande do Sul is approximately 2.1 million inhabitants, of which
an estimated 360,000 families are small farmers, including 234,000 categorized as poor (i.e., incomes below 1.5 minimum
monthly salaries [SMM]). Of these, the project would be targeted to: (i) the small farmers living in microcatchments
featuring soil limitations and located within the priority area; and (ii) rural poor households throughout the State.
Consequently, the project is expected to reach a total of about 132,000 rural households, of which an estimated 98,000
would be poor and 33,000 would be small farmers. In terms of eligibility, small farmers would only benefit from soil and
water conservation investments within microcatchments, while poor households would be eligible for support for both
natural resources subprojects (if residing within an eligible microcatchment) and poverty alleviation subprojects.
Based on the available official demographic data, the proportion of small and poor farmers within representative
microcatchments surveyed during preparation, and the participatory assessment of expected beneficiary demand for
subprojects, the following breakdown of beneficiaries by component is estimated:
Component       Poor Households  Small Farmers    Total
Poverty & NRM     66,000                            66,000
NRM                13,000           34,000          46,000
Poverty            19,000              -            19,000
TOTAL              98,000           34,000         132,000
Geographical targeting: Given that the most severe land management problems are concentrated in the northem and central
partions of the state, and in order to concentrate institutional resources, the Natural Resources Management Component
would be implemented within the boundaries of a pre-defined priority area, representing approximately 45% of the total
area of the state. This area presents the most severe soil erosion problems and the highest concentration of small farmers.
Although the majority of the state's rural poor are also located in the priority area, eligible beneficiaries for poverty
alleviation activities would not be geographically restricted, given that pockets of rural poor households exist throughout
the state.. The priority area covers a total of approximately 14.5 million ha comprising five agroecological regions, 313
municipalities and about 68% of the rural population of Rio Grande do Sul. Due to the criteria utilized for geographical
targeting, all natural resources subprojects and an estimated 80% of poverty alleviation subprojects are expected to be
implemented within the defined priority area.

Country: Brazil                                             Project Title: Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Eligibility Criteria: Project assistance would be provided to conmmunities or groups of eligible beneficiaries in the form of
subprojects financed on a grant basis with the exception of a pilot rural finance scheme, involving partial cost recovery for
income-generating subprojects. To be eligible for project support, individual beneficiaries within the group would have to
meet a series of easily verifiable selection criteria related to holding size, living conditions and source of income. Regarding
size, eligible holdings would be screened using the M6dulo Fiscal (A47), a unit determined for each municipality, based on
the particular agroecological conditions of the area. In the project area, one MF ranges between 7 and 20 ha. To be eligible
for poverty alleviation subprojects, each household within the community or group would: (i) own or farm a unit of up to
one MF; (ii) reside permanently on the property; (iii) not require hired labor for production; and (iv) not own powered
agricultural machinery or vehicles. In addition to beneficiary eligibility, subproject eligibility would be determined, based
on a comprehensive set of criteria contained in the Project Implementation Manual (a condition of loan effectiveness),
including subproject size, amount requested by beneficiary, cost sharing contributions, utilization of standard designs for
infrastructure and absence of non-eligible features (i.e. land acquisition, road construction, destruction of forests). In the
case of NRM, subprojects would be implemented exclusively within microcatchments located in the priority area. Eligible
communities would be comprised of individual beneficiaries of the microcatchment, who would be: (i) poor farmers living
within a microcatchment presenting soil degradation or erosion limitations; and (ii) small farmers with a maximum area
equivalent to 2 MFs.

Main Assumptions:
1. Given the demand-driven nature of investments to be made by project beneficiaries, it is not possible to determine a
prion the axact composition of the overall investment program to be fimanced by the project. Some working hypotheses
of likely beneficiary choices were developed to estimate the intemal economic rate of return of the project's natural
resource management and income generating activities. Illustrative farm models and microcatchment areas were
developed to arrive at the estimated rate of return of natural resources management activities. As only activities identified
and presented by potential beneficiaries would be considered, an ex-ante determination of costs and benefits of income
generating investmrents would not be feasible. Consequently, economic return estimates for income generating activities
were based on a sample of investment sub-projects likely to be demanded by beneficiaries following the results of
participatory preparation work. Economic return calculations included the cost of incremental on-farm expenditure for the
adoption of improved natural resources management and sustainable agricultural production systems, the cost of
incremental investment in income generating subprojects, improved roads within selected micro-catchments, incremental
technical assistance to farmers, institutional strengthening, and the Project Executive Secretariat. The benefits considered
included increased production, lower farm costs, increased market sales, and reduced transport spoilage plus such benefits
as reduced road maintenance and water treatment costs. The intemal economic rate of return thus estimated (20.9%) is
conservative, since it does not take into account the long-term benefits to farmers accruing from reduced soil run-off and
erosion, nor does it capture "without project" productivity losses due to declining soil fertility. Regarding the project's
activities that would favor very poor farmers through basic infrastructure improvement, no rate of retum was calculated.
2. Poor farmers benefittng from both natural resources management and poverty alleviation activities (about 2/3 of poor
project beneficiaries) would have at least a two-fold increase in their income, which would bring them above the poverty
line. Poor household that would demand only natural resources management activites, are expected to generate an income
above the poverty line with their farming activites. The situation of poor households demanding only income generating
sub-project is uncertain, as the results will depend on the sub-project chosen. But, the demand-driven approach adopted

by the project, combined with strict criteria to assess the technical and economic viability of beneficiaries' proposals,
would ensure that the best investment alternatives are chosen for financing. Moreover, the analysis of a sample of likely
off-farm projects indicated that intemal economic rates of return for these investments would range from 14% to over
35%. Adequate retums from these investments would be assured as the project would finance only technically and
econornically sound proposals, i.e., those with internal economic rates of return (IERR) exceeding 12%, the estimated
opportunity cost of capital.
3. Pricing Assumptions: Price contingencies were excluded and base costs plus physical contingencies less taxes were
used for the IERR. The rate of exchange of the Brazilian Real is currently determined in the open market. Furthermore,
given the policy reforms and the opening of the economy that has been taking place in the last two years, trade restrictions
have been gradually lowered and domestic prices tend to correspond much closer to border economic values. For the
purposes of economic analysis, border prices were estimated for main tradable produced by the project, based on World
Bank projections. A conversion factor of 0.90 was used for rest of tradable and machinery and fertilizers, with the
exception of urea for which specific conversion factor of 0.82 was used. While the project would increase on-farm and
off-farm employment in the priority areas, unemployment and under-employment would not be eliminated. Therefore,
shadow prices for unskilled labor were estimated at 80% of the market wage rate, while for skilled labor, the market rate
was assumed to reflect its opportunity cost.
Switchin2 values of critical items:
Sensitivity Analysis: Analyses performed to measure the sensitivity of the IERR to the estimated benefits and costs of the
natural resources management activities indicated that if benefits were to fall by 10% from their expected estimates, the
IERR would be 16%. Similarly, were costs to exceed their expected values by 10%, the IERR would be 16.8%. Finally,
if both situations were to occur simultaneously, the IERR would fall to 11.7%. Furthermore, the IERR would exceed
12%, the assumed opportunity cost of capital, even if benefits were 17% below their expected value or costs were to
exceed their expected value by 20%. Were the stream of benefits to occur one or two years later than expected, the IERR
would be 14.7% and 11%, respectively.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods: All procurement for the implementation of subprojects for natural resources and rural
poverty would be undertaken directly by the beneficiaries, while procurement for participating institutions would be
concentrated in the SEP. Specific procurement arrangements summarized in Table A, are as follows:
a) Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$350,000 equivalent or more, and contracts for works estimated to cost
(US$5.0 million equivalent or more would be procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
b) Contracts for goods estimated to cost between US$100,000 and US$350,000 and contracts for works estimated
to cost between US$50,000 and US$5.0 million would be awarded through NCB procedures using standard bidding
documents (SBD) satisfactory to the Bank.
c) Contracts for the procurement of computers and vehicles estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$300,000 equivalent, may be awarded on the basis of international
shopping procedures.
d) Contracts for goods (other than computers and vehicles) estimated to cost less than US$100,000 would be
procured through local shopping up to an aggregate amount of US$43.0 million; small works under Income
Generating, Land Management or Social Infrastructure Subprojects costing US$50,000 or less, not exceeding
US$94.0 million in the aggregate, would be procured under lumpsum contracts awarded on the basis of at least
three quotations from qualified contractors in response to written invitations.
(e) Consultant Services would be contracted in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated August 1981.
Prior review thresholds (Table B): All contracts for goods estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more, and
all contracts for works estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review
of all documentation (LOI, TORs, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts). Bank prior review will not apply to
all documentation related to contracts for the employment of consulting firms and of individual consultants valued
at less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 respectively. These exceptions to Bank's prior review will not apply to
TOR's for such contracts sole-source selection of consulting firms, assignments of critical nature and amendments

Special Account
In order to facilitate disbursements, a special account in an amount of US$7,000,000 will be opened in
BANRISUL to be operated by SAA under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would
make an initial deposit of US$3,000,000 until withdrawals from the loan have reached US$12,000,000.
SEP would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or when 20%
the authorized allocation has been used, whichever occurs first. The replenishment applications will be
supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation of
the Special Account against Bank's records. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow Bank
procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank. Retroactive financing would be provided up to US$5,000,000 equivalent for eligible expenditures
made after December 16, 1996 or a date twelve months before the date of the Loan Agreement, whichever
is later.
