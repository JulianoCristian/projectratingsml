Some lessons learned included: a project like\n            this requires appropriate local resources. Technical\n            assistance can only help develop capacity if the right\n            resources are made available. This requires that the\n            implementing agencies be able to offer employment terms\n            which are competitive so as to be able to recruit and\n            maintain staff of sufficient caliber. Underlying issues must\n            be identified and dealt with up front. In the case of Ghana,\n            the question of contingent employee end of service benefits\n            significantly delayed progress on divestiture, while land\n            title continues to be a problem in many instances. For\n            performance contracts, too much emphasis was placed on the\n            documents instead of the institutional framework necessary\n            for the incentives and checks and balances to work. A\n            technical assistance project which is expected to undertake\n            a wide range of activities, tackle major issues and bring\n            about fundamental change will necessarily require\n            significant Bank supervision."}, "docdt": "1997-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
