MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 8.3 million (US$10.5
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with a 40 years maturity to help
finance a Public Enterprise Project.
2.       Background. A contributing factor to Ghana's economic decline
during the 1970s and early 1980s was the unsatisfactory performance of the
large state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector which consists of approximately
180 SOEs with majority Government ownership. When the Government
introduced its Economic Recovery Programme in April 1983, it recognized
that major SOE reforms were required and requested IDA assistance.
Following a UNDP-financ, d diagnostic survey in 1985, the Government set up
a task force which, in consultation with IDA, developed a comprehensive SOE
reform program. This program includes policy and institutional reforms to
ensure that SOEs operate in a more commercial manner, to reduce the
financial and managerial burden on Government and to increase SOE autonomy
and accountability. These SOE reforms are now a key element of the
Government's broader structural adjustment program which is being supported
by a structural adjustment operation (SAL) (Cr. 1777-GH, approved April 14,
1987). Under this program, the Government has embarked on a detailed
two-year action program to address the immediate problems and lay the
groundwork _ r longer-term reform of the sector.  The initial focus is on
establishing the appropriate policy environment for commercial operation by
all SOEs, strengthening the State Enterprises Commission (-EC) as
Government's SOE oversight agency to monitor and evaluate SOE performance,
targeting specific attention to 14 priority SOEs with major budgetary and
fiscal impact, and divesting non-priority SOEs. To initiate the program,
Government has: (i) approved new legislation and appointed new senior
management to strengthen the SEC; (ii) approved 30 SOEs for the first phase
of the divestiture program; (iii) established a Divestiture Implementation
Committee (DIC), chaired by the SEC Chairman, to manage the divestiture
program; (iv) initiated an exercise to clear arrears among priority SOEs;
and (v) initiated the preparation of corporate plans for priority SOEs.
3.       Project Objectives. The Public Enterprise Project will provide the
institutional support to implement the SOE reforms agreed under the SAL. In
particular, this will entail assistance to: strengthen the SEC to manage
the reform program (particularly to monitor and evaluate SOE performance);
improve management and performance in priority SOEs through technical
assistance, training, and the introduction of performance agreements; and
reduce the burden of the sector on Government through divestiture. The
project will also establish the basis for longer-term SOE reforms through
development of sector-wide SOE policies, institutional strengthening, and
development of restructuring measures in key SOEs.

4.       Prolect Description. The project will provide the assistance
needed to formulate and implement sector-wide SQE reforms and to initiate
managerial and operational improvements in key SOEs through an SOE
Restructuring Fund.  The sector-wide assistance includes: (i) support to
the SEC for management of the reform program, design and implementation of
a performance monitoring and evaluation system including performance
agreements (based on corporate plans) for 14 priority SOEs, and for further
assessment and development of SOE policy, legal and institutional reforms;
and (ii) advisory/consulting services for implementation of the first phase
of the divestiture program (30 SOEs). The SOE Restructuring Fund will
finance: (i) advisory services to selected SOEs for audits, corporate plans
and related diagnostic assessments to identify restructuring measures
required to achieve financial viability; and (ii) assistance to implement
operational and managerial improvements (such as MIS, audits, management
assistance, training and office equipment) in SOEs with forecast viability
and agreed corporate plans. Allocation of the Fund will be determined
semi-annually by Government on the basis of agreed criteria and procedures.
The project, to be carried out over seven years, is estimated to cost
US$11.6 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$7.5
million (65 percent). A PPF of US$400,000 has been utilized to finance
project preparation activities. A breakdown of project costs and financing
is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing steps and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are
provided in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6881-GH dated August 26, 1987 is being
distributed separately.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  At the Government's request, IDA
has taken the lead role in assisting it in the formulation of the SOE
reform program, which is an integral part of Ghana's structural adjustment
operation. In addition, the project will assist in co-ordinating and
strengthening the SOE-related measures being undertaken through other
IDA-financed sector adjustment credits and rehabilitation projects
involving priority SOEs. The project will also assist in developing
further SOE restructuring measures, which could form the basis for future
IDA-financed adjustment or rehabilitation credits.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Major initial SOE reforms have been agreed under
the SAL with conditions of SAL second tranche release including: initiation
of divestiture actions for 10 SOEs (including State Fishing Corporation);
approval of corporate plans for 10 priority SOEs; and preparation of draft
performance agreements for 4 priority SOEs (based on approved corporate
plans) and signature of a performance agreement for the Cocoa Marketing
Board. During project negotiations, Government has further agreed to:
(i) guidelines for Government-SOE financial transfers; (ii) guidelines for
cost recovery under the Restructuring Fund, with proceeds to be deposited
in a Revolving Account for further restructuring assistance; (iii) submit
for IDA review and comments by October 31 of each year, starting in 1988,
an annual progress review including detailed work programs for the SEC and
the DIC for the following year, as well as the list of SOEs to negotiate
performance agreements for the following year; (iv) prepare dossiers for
SOEs to be divested, setting out valuation, recommended divestiture



modality, legal issues, liabilities, etc., with five dossiers (including
State Fishing Corporation) to be completed by December 31, 1987; (v) review
the administrative arrangements for the divestiture program after one year
(by August 31, 1988) and agree with IDA on any charnges; (vi) undertake a
review of SOE pricing autonomy and market competition and sut.rA.t to IDA by
October 31, 1988 an action plan for review and implementation; (vii)
undertake a review of SOE legal instruments to assess whether changes are
necessary to increase SOE autonomy, and submit recommendations to IDA by
October 31, 1988 for review and implementation; (viii) submit a report to
IDA by Decmber 31, 1988 on progress in implementing SEC's performance
monitoring system, including recommendations on any changes to the
institutional arrangements vis-a-vis the SOE sector; and (ix) include an
adequate provision in the Government's annual budget starting in FY1988 to
finance SEC's recurrent expenses and the Government's estimated net
liabilities for the following year arising from divestiture and
redeployment of SOE staff. Conditions of effectiveness include: (i)
establishment of a full-time technical team for the divestiture program;
(ii) preparation of company dossiers for the first five SOEs to be divested
(in addition to the five noted above); (iii) opening of a Divestiture
Account to handle divestiture-related proceeds and liabilities; and (iv)
selection of a SOE reform program advisor and a divestiture advisor.
7.       Justification. The PE project will assist Government in achieving
a more atreamlined, efficient and commercially-oriented SOE sector with a
reduced iinancial and administrative burden on Government. In addition, SOE
accountability to Government will improve through strengthening of the SEC
and introduction of performance agreements. The project will also assist
with developing and initiating restructuring programs in priority SOEs to
improve their performance and profitability.
8.       Risks. The effectiveness of the project's support for divestiture
will depend on broader program considerations, such as the investor
climate, the attractiveness of the SOEs offered for sale, and credit
availability, which are being addressed under the SAL and other
policy-based operations. A second risk is that progress in project
implementation will depend upon the capacity of the restructured SEC to
manage the reform program and utilize effectively the services provided
under the project. Steps have been taken to strengthen the SEC and ensure
that there are adequate mechanisms in place to eAtMinister the project.
9.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend tnat
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
