Government's structural adjustment program. The project\n            involves several objectives including: strengthening the\n            State Enterprises Commission (SEC) to manage the SOE reform\n            program and monitor and evaluate SOE performance; improving\n            management and performance in priority SOEs; training and\n            the introduction of performance agreements; and reducing the\n            burden of the sector on Government through divestiture. To\n            that end, the project aims to provide sector-wide assistance\n            for: (i) strengthening the SEC to manage the reform program,\n            design and implementation of a performance monitoring system\n            including performance agreements; and (ii)\n            advisory/consulting services for implementing the first\n            phase of the divestiture program. In addition, the project\n            aims to finance a SOE Restructuring Fund to provide\n            assistance to selected SOEs for audits and corporate plans\n            to identify restructuring measures required to achieve\n            financial viability, and to implement operational and\n            managerial improvements."}, "docdt": "1987-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
