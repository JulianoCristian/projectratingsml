INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT ANID RECOM2-ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED IDAN
TO THE SOCIETEi NATIONALE DIINVESTISSEMENT IN TUNISIA
1.     I subrit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an arnount in various currencies equivalent to
U.S. $ 10 million to the Societ6 Nationale d'Investissement (S.N.I.)
in Tunisia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     The Societ6 Nationale d'Investissement (S.N.I.) was estab-
lished in 1959 as a government-controlled agency to provide equity
capital for new and expanding enterprises. Based on IFC studies
made in 1964 and 1965 on the invitation of the Tunisian Government,
a reorganization of SNI was started in 1965 and completed in 1966,
when SIl became a predominantly privately-owned development finance
company offering a full range of medium and long term finance
to the private industrial and tourist sectors. After this reor-
ganization, SNI emerged with a total shore capital of D 1.5 million,
($ 2.9 million) of which the Government holds 14%, foreign banking
and financial institutions 8%, private Tunisian shareholders 58%
and IFC 20Q. IFC's investment of D 300,000 was made in May, 1966.
At the same time the Bank made a loan of $ 5 million, SNI's sole
source of foreign exchange to date.
3.     In December, 1966, SNI and the Tunisian Government requested
a new loan from the Bank of $ 10 million. By then SNI had made loans
committing $ 3.2 million of the loan from the Bank and expected the
remaining $ 1.8 million to be committed within a few months. Disbur-
sement of the existing Bank loan is expected to take place in 1967 and
in the first half of 1968. In January and February 1967, a mission
visited Tunisia to re-appraise SNI. Negotiations for the proposed
Bank loan took place in Washington during June, 1967, with a delega-
tion consisting of Mr. Abdelaziz Mathari, President of SNI, and Mr.
14. Karoui, representing the Government.
Bank. IDA and IFC Operations
4.     The proposed loan, if approved, would be the Bank's fourth in
Tunisia and would increase the total amount lent to $ 34 million.
IDA has made three credits, totaling $ 24 million. The following
is a statement of the Bank loans and IDA credits as of June 30, 1967:

5.        With respect to Loan 380 TUN, delays in establishing an
autonomous Port Authority as required by the Loan Agreement put off
construction of Port facilities by one year. Since then part of
the lost time has been regained but, as already notified to the
Executive Directors, the Closing Date has had to be postponed from
June 30, 1967 until March 31 of next year.
6.        In addition to its investment in SNI, TFC invested in NPK-
Engrais, a phosphate fertilizer company, lending the company $ 2 million
for 10 years and buying 25% of its issued shares for $ 1.5 million.
Part of its loan has been sold at par, netting $ 17,600 and just over
a fifth of its holding of shares has been sold at par for $ 339,572.
7.        The Bank is presently considering projects for further
extension of the Port of La Goulette, expansion of water supply
systems and an irrigation project in the Medjerda Valley. The Bank
is executing agent, of the UNDP Transport Survey on which work will
start in the near future and which is expected to lead to further
lending, particularly for railroads.

Consultative Group for Tunisia
8.       There is a Consultative Group for Tunisia. At a meeting
held in December 1965, the Bank's representatives indicated that
the Bank and IDA would be ready to finance up to $ 100 million worth
of suitable projects in Tunisia in the years 1966 through 1968.
The latest meeting was held in Paris on March 16 and 17, 1967. It
discussed the Bank s report "The Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Tunisia" (AF 56-b), an earlier version of the report attached, and
the International Monetary Fund's report entitled "Tunisia - Recent
Economic Developments", and a "Rapport sur le Budget Economique de
1 Ann6e 1967" submitted by the Tunisian delegation.
9.       At this meeting the Bank's representatives informed the group
that in the interim between the two meetings $ 36 million of loans and
credits had been extended to Tunisia by the Bank and IDA and that a
number of projects wrere at various stages of appraisal. They expressed
the hope that the $ 100 million worth of lending for suitable projects
mentioned at the 1965 meeting would still hold good assuming the
availability of sound projects and continued improvement of general
economic policy and performance.
PART n: - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.      Borrower:        Soci6t6 Nationale d'Invastissement
Guarantor:       Republic of Tunisia
Amount:          The equivalent of U.S.$ 10 million in various
currencies
Purpose:         Financing by the borrower of the foreign
exchange costs of specific development projects
through loans and other investments for produc-
tive purposes to enterprises in Tunisia which
are privately controlled.
Amortization:    By semi-annual payments on May 1 and November 1.
The amortization schedule provides for repayment
beginning May 1, 1969 and ending May 1, 1985,
but is subject to amendment to correspond with
repayments to SNI by investment enterprises
benefiting from parts of the loan. Each part
of the loan will be repayable over a term
suited to the investment project in question
not exceeding 15 years from the date the loan
account is credited.



- 4 -
Interest Rate: Interest will be charged on each portion of
the loan at the Bank's current rate when it
is credited.
Commitment
Charge:        3/8 of 1% per annum of the undisbursed
balance of the loan
Prior Approval
of Projec-ts:  Projects requiring the use of more than
$ 100,000 of the loan will be subject to the
Bank's prior approval.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.     A report entitled "Re-appraisal of the Societ6 Nationale
dlInvestissement" (DB-35a) on the proposed project is attached.
12.     Industria:L and mineral production represents about 19% and
tourism about 2% of Tunisia's gross domestic product. While the
industry contribut;ion to total exports is still small, it is signi-
ficant for the ba:Lance of payments because many industrial products
are substitutes for imports and because industrial exports can be
expected to grow. Foreign exchange receipts from tourism have been
increasing very fast (about 60% per year since 1961) and contributed
15% of total foreign exchange receipts in 1965. There is room for
substantial further investments both in industry and tourism, and
the Government is making a genuine effort to encourage private
enterprise in these two fields.
13.     SNI is the principal institutional source of long term loan
and equity finance to private industrial and tourist enterprises in
Tunisia. Prior to its reorganization in 1965/1966, its activity was
almost entirely confined to promoting and making direct equity
investment in new enterprises. SNI's Policy Statement, contained
in Annex 2 of the Re-Appraisal Report, reflects the broadening of
SiNI's objectives after its reorganization. It now provides medium
and long term loans as well as equity investments. The Government
intends SNI to continue to be the principal source of long term
funds to private industry and tourism. As of December 31, 1966,
SNI long term resources amounted to D 6.2 million, i.e. D 2.3 million
in share capital and government grant, D 0.6 million in a government
interest-free subordinated loan, and D 3.3 million in other long term
loans, including the first Bank loan (D 2.6 million). Under the
first Loan Agreement with the Bank, SNI has agreed to limit borrowings
with a term of more than one year to an amount three times the sum of
its own equity and the subordinated government loan. The remaining
long term borrowing capacity of SNI is thus ample. SNI also accepts
call and term depcsits from some public enterprises and institutions.



At the end of 1966 these deposits arnounted to close to D 2 million
and were approximately matched by liquid assets. Finally SNI also
benefits from a four years' exemption from income tax and other taxes,
an annual subsidy for four years and a government guarantee permitting
SNI to sell, within five years, its previous equity investments at their
book value.
14.     SNI's performance has so far been satisfactory, and the rate
of loan approval has been higher than expected, amounting to D 3n2 million
(equivalent to about $ 6 million) over the period May, 1966 to May, 1967.
SI'I's capital structure is sound, and its profitability is expected to
develop satisfactorily. With the benefits of exemption from taxes and
the government subsidy of D 50,000 per year, net profit on share capital
was 10.3% in 1966 and is expected to rise to 16% in 1968. The special
tax status and subsidy will then be terminated.  Profits are therefore
likely to fall to about 1Q% on share capital in 1969 but are estimated
to rise again to about 13% in 1970 on the assumption that the projected
level of loan and investment activity is attained and that the program
of portfolio sales is carried out, as agreed under the five year
government guarantee mentioned above.  This level of profits would cover
the interest payable on SNI2s borrowings at least 1.7 times.
15.     SMI's progress in organization and administration has also
been satisfactory. Present management, consisting of the Managing
Director, the General Manager, and a foreign advisor, have undertaken
their responsibilities ably, and the quality of management is expected
to be maintained. In addition, measures further to improve project
appraisal and follow-up and accounting have been discussed with SNI
representatives and appropriate steps are to be taken to implement
them. In recognition of the progress made, the Bank agreed to raise
the size of individual commitments of the Bank's loan which may be
made on SNIs own authority without prior approval of the Bank. The
old limit was $ 50,000; the new is $ 100,000. With this new limit
about one-third of SNIts foreign exchange loans by number and about
80, by amount will still be subject to prior approval by the Bank.
16.     In the three-year period 1967-1969, it is estimated that total
private investment in Tunisia will amount to some D 14 million in indus-
try and some D 28 million in tourism. Balanced financing of this invest-
ment will require about D 24 million in loan capital (of which D 14 million
would be in foreign exchange) and D 18 million in equity capital. Taking
into account the uncommitted part of the first Bank loan at the end of
1966 and the amounts expected to be provided by supplier credits and direct
foreign loans, SNI would need $ 11 million until the end of 1969 to meet
foreign exchange requirements. During the same period, SNI is expected
to lend about D 2.4 million and make equity investments of about
D 400,000 to finance domestic requirements. Taking into account the sale
of shares in its portfolio under the government guarantee (see paragraphs
13 and 14), SNI would need about $ 2 million equivalent of additional
funds for these Dinar financings. Thus SNI would need about $ 13 million



- 6 -
altogether. The proposed Bank loan would provide $ 10 million exclusi-
vely for foreign exchange needs. An additional loan of about $ 3 million
is under discussion with the Swedish Government to cover the balance of
SNI's foreign exchange requirements as well as the local currency needs.
17.        As mentioned above, tourism has a growing importance in the
Tunisian economy and SNI, as an institution devoted to Tunisian develop-
ment, is expected to finance a substantial portion of all investments in
this field. SNIs portfolio will thus contain an increasing share of
loan and equity investment in tourist projects. SNI appreciates that
there are many risks in the tourist business and intends to exercise
caution when appraising tourist projects, and to keep th.se investments
under continuous review.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHPRITY
18.        The Draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SNI, the Draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, and
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article ITI, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement ara being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
19.        The Loarn and Guarantee Agreements would generally follow
the terms and conditions of those contained in Loan 449-TUN, dated
May 16, 1966.  However, in accordance with the recent decision of
the Executive Directors, the proposed loan would carry the Bank's
normal commitment charge, i.e. on the entire undisbursed amount. of
the loan starting 60 days after the signing of the Loan Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.        An econcmic report entitled "The Current Economic Position and
prospects of Tunisia" (Report AF-56c) dated March 10, 1967, is attached.
21         During the period 1960 through 1965 the gross domestic product
of Tunisia grew at a rate of 5.5% per year spurred by real fixed
investment averaging 24% of GDPo  At the same time, exports of goods
and services grew relatively little so that, despite high levels of
public and private long-term capital inflow, foreign exchange reserves
were run down rapidly through 1964. A devaluation at the end of that
year temporarily halted the deline in the country's external financial
position, bult 1966 brought a poor harvest and, though exports increased,
a reduction of over $ 20 million in net foreign assets. At the end



-7-
of the year gross foreign assets stood at $ 23 million and net foreign
assets were negative by about $ 25 million. Debt service in 1965
came to 13% of foreign earnings on goods and services, and the fact
that a substantial part of capital inflow in 1964, 1965 and 1966
consisted of supplier credits portended an even heavier burden in the
near future.
22.     At the end of 1966 and in the early months of 1967, the
Tunisian Government took a number of decisions, some of them in
connection with a Fund stand-by arrangement, to cope with the dete-
riorating financial situation. Perhaps the most significant of
them was a decision to reduce total new fixed investment from the
estimated D 127 million in 1966 to D 110 million in 1967. All the
cuts were to be made in investment by central government and by
public enterprises. Related was the government forecast that recourse
to supplier credits would be only $ 17 million in 1967 as compared
to $ 40 million and $ 20 million in 1965 and 1966, respectively.
At the meeting of the Consultative Group in March, 1967, the Government
affirmed its intention of improving performance in other respects
by: (i) adjusting its investment program more closely to economic prio-
rities, with special emphasis to be given to producing for exports;
(ii) encouraging private investment; (iii) increasing domestic
savings primarily through reducing the rate of growth of current
government expenditures; (iv) improving the investment planning
and general management of public enterprises.
23.     In June an economic mission visited Tunisia to update our
information on external debt and on the progress of the economy.
The mission found that Tunisia's progress in economic policy and
performance was in line with the Tunisian Government's policy and
statements to the Bank and the Consultative Group. In the light
of the Tunisian Government's intention to encourage private invest-
merit in the years immediately ahead, the kind of lending here pro-
posed would appear to be particularly appropriate and would permit
less recourse to supplier credits.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE IITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
24.     I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
25.     I recommenid that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
