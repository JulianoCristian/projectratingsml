F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's main objective was to assist the Government of Mexico in its efforts to
adopt a new model to improve the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture and the


                                                  ii
efficiency of irrigation water use, in both Irrigation Districts (Distritos de Riego, DR) and
Irrigation Units (Unidades de Riego, UR), that would include the development of
partnerships between the public and private sectors as well as effective institutional
collaboration within the public sector, plus the strengthening of a demand-driven
approach to investment decisions and financing. The Project aimed to achieve this
objective through: (i) the modernization of existing irrigation infrastructure to promote a
more efficient use of irrigation water within the framework of Integrated Irrigation
Investment Plans (IIIPs); (ii) increased productivity of irrigated agriculture and
diversification into high-value crops; (iii) consolidation of the transfer of irrigation
infrastructure to water users; (iv) institutional strengthening of water users organizations
to enhance their participation in the O&M of irrigation infrastructure as well as in
investment decisions; (v) consolidating the current cost recovery system for both
operating and capital costs; and (vi) establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation system.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The original PDO was not formally revised. In hindsight (as shown in paragraph 1.3.1 of
the main document), it should have been reformulated to lower the expectations
regarding competitiveness and crop diversification.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Key sectoral issues. During the 1990s, the agricultural sector in Mexico in general, and
the irrigation sub-sector in particular, were subject to drastic structural reforms, namely, trade
liberalization, elimination of most price interventions, constitutional reforms of land tenure, and
transfer of large parts of the country's irrigation infrastructure to water users. Agriculture's
performance was below its potential, and the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture was
constrained by the low level of technology used, the lack of modernization of its irrigation
infrastructure, and the lack of government incentives to crop diversification. This resulted in low
productivity in the irrigation sector and posed a major policy challenge, given that the Northern
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was to put the sector in open competition with
producers from Canada and the United States as of 2008.

1.1.2 Government strategy. A number of initiatives were adopted by the government to deal
with the sector's issues. In 2001, a new Rural Development Law was promulgated, which
provided the framework for future policy and institutional interventions in the sector.
Subsequently, a Rural Sector Development Plan was approved, which emphasized, among others,
competitiveness, on-farm and off-farm employment generation and regional development.
Regarding specifically the irrigation sector, the 2001-2006 National Hydraulic Plan (PNH for its
acronym in Spanish -- Plan Nacional Hidráulico) promoted the adoption of measures aiming to:
(i) increase the efficiency in the use of water in agriculture; (ii) promote the sustainable
management and development of water resources; (iii) improve the productivity of irrigated
agriculture; and (iv) complete the transfer of responsibility for operation, maintenance and
management of irrigation infrastructure to water users.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank involvement. The Integrated Irrigation Modernization Project
(known in Mexico as PMIR for its acronym in Spanish ­ Programa de Modernización Integral
del Riego) was designed to support government programs aimed at introducing a new model for
decentralization and allocation of public investment funds and at reducing the role of the State in
the irrigation sector, namely, the irrigation programs executed by the National Water Commission
(CONAGUA for its acronym in Spanish -- Comisión Nacional del Agua) and the Alianza Contigo
Program (PAC for its acronym in Spanish ­ Programa Alianza Contigo) executed by the
Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishery and Food (SAGARPA for its
acronym in Spanish ­ Secretaría de Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación).

1.1.4 This Project was preceded by three Bank-financed projects: the Irrigation and Drainage
Sector Project (IBRD Loan No. 3419), implemented from December 1991 to June 2000; the On-
farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement Project (IBRD Loan No. 3704), implemented
from February 1994 to March 2002; and the Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project
(IBRD Loan No. 4428), implemented from December 1998 to June 2003. The first two projects
supported the transfer of management responsibilities from CONAGUA to Water Users
Associations (WUAs) in the Irrigation Districts (DR for their acronym in Spanish ­ Distritos de
Riego), rehabilitation and upgrading of major and minor off-farm networks, and on-farm
improvements. The third project supported the predecessor of the PAC, the ALCAMPO Program,
which aimed to leverage private investments in agriculture by providing partial reimbursement to
producers for investment costs that they had incurred.




                                                1
1.1.5 The Bank's involvement in the modernization of the irrigation sector was justified on two
grounds. First, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico for the period 2002-
2005 (Report No. 23849-ME, April 23, 2002) identified that sustainable economic development
in Mexico was facing strategic challenges, including accelerating growth through
competitiveness, human capital development, balancing growth and poverty reduction with
environmental protection, and building an efficient, transparent and accountable government. The
Project sought to address several of these challenges and to contribute to: (i) improve Mexico's
overall competitiveness by enhancing the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture; (ii) improve
the income of the small irrigation farmers and thus reduce rural poverty; (iii) develop the
irrigation sector through the technical and financial support of economically viable and
environmentally sustainable investments; and (iv) improve the quality of government services by
bringing policymakers and final beneficiaries together.

1.1.6 Second, the Bank had considerable and extensive experience in irrigation development
projects and had been accompanying irrigation developments in Mexico for over 20 years.
Therefore, the Bank was well placed to assist the government in its efforts to adopt an integrated
approach to improve the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure and the competitiveness of
irrigation agriculture by complementing Federal (central) and State level government expertise,
establishing a system of effective coordination of irrigation related activities between
CONAGUA, SAGARPA and the State governments, and bringing lessons and insights from
related projects in other countries.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The original two-part Project Development Objective (PDO) as defined in the Legal
Agreement and the main text of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was to assist the
government in its efforts to adopt a new model to improve the competitiveness of irrigated
agriculture and the efficiency of irrigation water use.1

1.2.2 The PDO was expected to be achieved through: (i) the modernization of existing
irrigation infrastructure to promote a more efficient use of irrigation water within the framework
of Integrated Irrigation Investment Plans (PDR for their acronym in Spanish ­ Planes Directores
de Riego); (ii) the increased productivity of irrigated agriculture and diversification into high-
value crops; (iii) the consolidation of the transfer of irrigation infrastructure to water users; (iv)
institutional strengthening of water users organizations to enhance their participation in the
operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation infrastructure as well as in investment decisions;
(v) the consolidation of the current cost recovery system for both operating and capital costs; and
(vi) the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system.

1.2.3 The original key PDO indicators and their targets as defined in the Legal Agreement
include the following: (i) area rehabilitated or modernized in DR and Irrigation Units (UR for
their acronym in Spanish ­ Unidades de Riego, 458,000 ha; (ii) area with advanced irrigation
systems in DR and UR, 128,000 ha; (iii) area benefited with production intensification and
diversification actions, 128,000 ha; (iv) number of Limited Responsibility Societies (SRL for

1
    The two-part PDO described in the main text of the PAD and Legal Agreement is different from the
    four-part PDO described in Annex 1 Project Design Summary of the PAD, which reads as follows: (i)
    to improve the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture in both Irrigation Districts and Irrigation Units
    in Mexico using an integrated approach; (ii) to modernize existing irrigation infrastructure and
    improve water use efficiency; (iii) to promote diversification to high-value crops; and (iv) to
    consolidate transfer of irrigation infrastructure to water user's association.

their acronym in Spanish ­ Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada) created, 15; (v) number of
integrated irrigation investment plans or PDR prepared, 192; (vi) increase in water irrigation
conveyance and distribution efficiency, 26%; and (vii) increase in on-farm water irrigation
application efficiency, 18%. With exception of the last two indicators, they mostly refer to
Project outcomes.

1.2.4 In addition to the indicators listed above, the main text of the PAD lists the following
PDO related indicators (without target): (i) number of rehabilitation works demanded and
executed, (ii) area under diversification into high value crops, and (iii) number of water users
associations with financially sustainable operations.

1.2.5. The key PDO indicators listed in the main text of the PAD differ from those listed in
Annex 1 Project Design Summary and Annex 2b. Indicators in Annex 1 (without target) include:
(i) improvement of financial efficiency indicators of irrigated agriculture in Mexico; (ii) number
of DR and UR with modernized infrastructure, for DR located in areas with the over-exploited
aquifers, percentage of reduction in water consumption; (iii) indicators that show an increase in
the areas under high-value crops; and (iv) indicators that show the consolidation of the process of
transferring irrigation infrastructure to users, such as number of DR transferred, number of SRL
created, and hectares transferred. Indicators in Annex 2b include the indicators listed in the Legal
Agreement plus the following ones (without target): (i) increase in water resources availability;
(ii) savings in energy consumption; (iii) additional area experiencing diversification into high-
value crops; and (iv) increase in irrigation agricultural water productivity.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1 The original PDO was not formally revised. In hindsight, it should have been
reformulated to lower the expectations regarding competitiveness and crop diversification. From
the onset, it was clear that SAGARPA was not going to participate in the Project as originally
anticipated. SAGARPA lost interest in collaborating with CONAGUA in the implementation of
the Project when during negotiations it learned that the Bank loan would not be additional to its
budget.2 The design of the Project was based on the participation of and close collaboration with
SAGARPA. The implementation of crop diversification and intensification activities and the
promotion of improved marketing, through the ongoing programs of SAGARPA to boost
agriculture productivity, were considered critical for irrigation farmers to improve
competitiveness. Full participation of SAGARPA in Project implementation would have further
increased the impacts on diversification into high value crops and competitiveness.

1.3.2 Key performance and PDO related indicators adopted initially by CONAGUA
corresponded to those listed in Annex 2b of the PAD. While targets for some indicators were
defined in the Loan Agreement, other targets were set during the June 2005 supervision mission.
Several indicators remained without targets. Available targets were modified during the course of
Project implementation. Table 1 presents the complete set of indicators and final targets (when
available).




2
    In the case of Mexico, implementation of an externally financed program or project is done within the
    budget ceiling authorized by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to the implementing agency.
    Thus, external loans are part of the approved budget ceiling of the implementing agencies and are not
    additional to their budgets.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The potential target population, as anticipated at appraisal and described in the PAD, was
estimated at around 1.12 million irrigation farmers operating in both DR, about 530,000
producers, and UR, about 590,000 producers.4 Out of this target population, the PAD also

3
    From ISR#9, the target is reported as 20% by mistake.
4
    Key features of the infrastructure in the DR and UR are as follows. The construction of dams and canal
    networks in the DR was done by the government and was financed entirely out of budgetary resources.
    Part of the large infrastructure remains the responsibility of CONAGUA, which in turn receives part of
    the irrigation service fee charged to water users. In contrast, all of the infrastructure in the UR was
    developed by private agents and is under the responsibility of the WUAs. These WUAs do not pay any


                                                    4
indicates that about 110,000 farmers, mostly small producers with an average farm size of 5
hectares (ha), were going to be the direct beneficiaries of the Project. It should be noted that the
number of direct beneficiaries represented a small fraction of the target population. Table 2 below
summarizes the original target beneficiaries of the Project by component.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The Project was originally planned to be implemented over a period of 5 1/2 years (from
March 2004 to September 2009) and included the following four components:

1.5.2 Component 1: Modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure in irrigation
districts and irrigation units (PAD-estimated cost: USD406 million (76.9%); PAD-estimated
Bank financing USD242 million (79.9%)). This component aimed at improving the efficiency of
water distribution and consisted of demand-driven investment sub-projects to rehabilitate5 and
modernize6 irrigation infrastructure as well as to improve maintenance7 machinery and equipment
within the framework of PDR or existing Action Plans. The demand-driven investment proposals
were to be financed on the basis of a matching-grant system, although investment in those DR
that have not been transferred yet to water users would be fully financed by CONAGUA. Water
Users (WUs) were supposed to submit technically and economically viable proposals for the
rehabilitation and modernization of off-farm irrigation infrastructure. Eligible investments

    service fee to CONAGUA. At the time of the Project appraisal, it was estimated that of the 6.0 million
    ha under irrigation, about 3.2 million ha were located in 85 DR and 2.8 million ha in more than 44,000
    UR. According to the statistics of early 2009, of the 6.46 million ha under irrigation, about 3.5 million
    ha are located in 85 DR and 2.96 million ha in more than 39,000 UR.
5
    The term rehabilitation is understood as the collection of actions aiming to re-establish the original
    functional conditions of the headwork structures, conveyance canals, distribution networks and control
    and measurement structures.
6
    The term modernization is understood as the collection of actions aiming to introduce new
    technologies in the headwork structures, conveyance canals and distribution network, and control and
    measurement structures for the efficient management of water resources and improvements in the level
    of services to the farmers.
7
    The term maintenance is understood as the routine and minor works that need to be done on headwork
    structures, conveyance canals, distribution networks and control and measurement structures in order
    to maintain their usefulness. Maintenance and conservation are used as synonyms.


                                                     5
included: repairs or upgrading of main canals, pumping stations, main canal lining, installation of
tubes and pipes, main drainage networks and improvement of internal roads.

1.5.3 Component 2: Diversification and intensification of irrigated agricultural production
(PAD- estimated cost USD87 million (16.5%); PAD-estimated Bank financing USD38 million
(12.5%)). This component included technical and financial assistance for demand-driven
investment sub-projects prepared by WUs in DR and UR, within the framework of the PDR to
improve on-farm irrigation systems and water use efficiency.8 Activities under this component
included: on-farm and inter-farm irrigation infrastructure and equipment for intensive irrigation,
such as high and low pressure systems to facilitate intensive agricultural production; improved
on-farm drainage systems; and land leveling.

1.5.4 It was also expected that under component 2, Project beneficiaries would receive
financial support and technical assistance from the ongoing programs of SAGARPA to boost
productivity.9 Total resources expected to be leveraged from SAGARPA amounted to USD160
million to finance crop diversification sub-projects through capital investments, development of
human resources, strengthening of agro-industrial productive chains, and technology generation
and transfer.10

1.5.5 Component 3: Training and institutional development (PAD-estimated cost USD30
million (5.7%); PAD-estimated Bank financing USD18.60 million (6.1%)). This component
included support for the following activities: (i) strengthening of the WUs' technical, managerial
and financial capabilities to administrate and operate their respective irrigation systems as well as
to participate in the decision making process regarding investment financing, including, inter alia:
(a) training of directors, managers and staff of WUs and their associations, namely, Users Civil
Associations (ACU for their acronym in Spanish ­ Asociaciones Civiles de Usuarios) and SRL,11
(b) preparation of integrated irrigation investment plans for DR and UR, (c) provision of office,
information technology, agro-meteorological, and water consumption monitoring equipment; (ii)
carrying out of field visits to promote an exchange of experiences between WUs; (iii)
participatory assessment of WU-specific managerial, technical and other capacity strengthening
needs as well as training of farmers in areas identified in the above-mentioned assessment; (iv)
training of CONAGUA and SAGARPA's staff, including training of trainers on specific
management subjects, and on other subjects acceptable to the Bank; (v) upgrading of
CONAGUA's geographical information system to cover the total irrigated area of Mexico
constituting DR and UR, including an assessment of their information needs, system design and
development, design of mechanism to update data, and operation of the geographical system in
priority geographical areas; (vi) carrying out of studies for the improvement of the water
efficiency and management in DR and UR, and the development of water management policies
related thereto; and (vii) provision of office and information technology equipment for
CONAGUA.

8
     These are referred as technological improvements in irrigation aiming to satisfy the water requirements
     of the crops, so as to increase water productivity and agriculture production.
9
     SAGARPA's complementary programs also included under the PAC provided matching grants to
     support implementation of a number of farm and off-farm measures aiming to increase agriculture
     productivity, diversify production, and improve marketing capabilities.
10
     The additional resources in the amount of USD160 million to be leveraged from SAGARPA were not
     included in the original Project cost estimate.
11
     The WUs within the UR or the Irrigation Module (MD for its acronym in Spanish ­ Modulo de Riego)
     in the DR first need to adopt a legal status by registering as ACU, and then they are grouped into SRL.
     In the case of the DR, there is one SRL per DR.


                                                     6
1.5.6 Component 4: Project management (PAD-estimated cost USD2.0 million (0.4%); PAD-
estimated Bank financing USD1.40 million (0.5%)). This component was to provide critical
support for the following activities: (i) the operation of the Project coordination system; (ii) the
development and operation of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system, and (iii) the carrying
out of Project audits.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 Although no formal restructuring took place, a few substantial revisions were made to the
original Project components during the course of Project implementation with the objective of
aligning the Project activities with CONAGUA's programs supporting irrigation rehabilitation
and modernization. 12 This in turn facilitated monitoring of Project implementation.

1.6.2 The Project also expanded support to the following areas: (i) maintenance activities,
which were originally conceived to be under the responsibility of the DR but were considered
eligible under the Project due to the financial difficulties faced by WUs to finance part of the
investments during periods of severe droughts, namely during years 2004-2005; and (ii)
measuring devices to gain control of water diverted from superficial water sources, water
extracted from wells, and water delivered to water users at specific outlet points. The final Project
structure is presented below.

1.6.3 Component 1: Modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure in irrigation
districts and irrigation units (Actual cost: USD557.7 million; Bank financing: USD258.8
million). This component focused on improving the conditions and operational efficiency of the
DR and UR through repairs or upgrading of main canals; main canal lining; conversion of
conveyance systems from open canals to pressurized pipe; modernization of control structure and
installation of measuring devices; rehabilitation of barrages, wells and pumping stations;
improvements of main drainage networks and improvements of access roads. It included four
subcomponents: (i) rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure, (ii) maintenance
of federal irrigation infrastructure in irrigation districts; (iii) installation of measurement devices,
(iv) acquisition of machinery, (v) rehabilitation of machinery, and (vi) establishment of repair
workshops.

1.6.4 Component 2: Diversification and intensification of irrigated agriculture production
units (Actual cost: USD182.0 million; Bank financing: USD31.4 million). This component
focused on activities to improve on-farm irrigation systems and on-farm water use efficiency, so
WUs could achieve higher water productivity. It included two subcomponents: (i) on-farm and
inter-parcel infrastructure, and (ii) on-farm drainage and land leveling. In hindsight, the name of
the component should have been modified to better reflect the support provided.

1.6.5 Component 3: Training and institutional development (Actual cost: 31.7 million; Bank
financing: USD10.0 million). This component focused on strengthening the capacity of WUs to
manage the irrigation systems. It included six subcomponents: (i) formulation of integrated
irrigation investment plans, (ii) geographic information system, (iii) training courses to water
users, (iv) training courses to CONAGUA staff, (v) specific studies and events, and (vi) other
goods and services.


12
     They include programs directly implemented by CONAGUA and programs included under
     SAGARPA-PAC but administrated by CONAGUA.


                                                   7
1.6.6 Component 4: Project management. (Actual incremental cost: USD0.5 million; non-Bank
financing).This component focused on the establishment of mechanisms and systems to facilitate
implementation of Project in accordance with the agreed implementation plan and schedule and
to ensure coordination between CONAGUA, the State Governments, and the WUAs. It included
three subcomponents: (i) consultant services for monitoring and evaluation, (ii) acquisition of
equipment, and (iii) financial auditing.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Institutional arrangements. As indicated in paragraph 1.3.1, the institutional
collaboration between CONAGUA and SAGARPA envisaged in the Project design did not
materialize because of the lack of a legally binding cooperation agreement between them. The
legally binding agreement would have forced SAGARPA to collaborate with CONAGUA and
provide complementary support regardless of receiving additional budget. As a result, WUs that
benefited from irrigation improvements did not receive through the Project assistance from
SAGARPA to support diversification into high-value crops and intensification of irrigated
agriculture.13

1.7.2 Framework for identification of priority investment. Although the PDR were supposed to
define comprehensive investment packages at the irrigation district, module or unit levels that
would then be financed by the Project, a large share of the modernization works in the DR and
UR were done in the absence of these plans. Their preparation suffered considerable delays
because of limited budgetary allocation for non-structural activities, and as a result, the
arrangements agreed for the transition period (e.g., until the PDR were formulated) were followed
for most of the implementation of the Project. The formulation and adoption of PDR was not a
formal pre-requisite for the implementation of structural actions.

1.7.3 Implementation schedule. During the first two years of Project implementation, the
annual budget allocation for CONAGUA's programs on irrigation rehabilitation and
modernization infrastructure was substantially increased, which led to a faster disbursement of
the proceeds of the loan and a shorter period of implementation of components 1 and 2 (from 5
1/2 years to 4 1/2 years). Additional budgetary allocation, however, favored structural activities
over non-structural ones, which caused problems with the sequence of activities: first formulation
of PDR, then implementation of priority actions (structural and non-structural). As a result, many
of the irrigation modernizations works were done in the absence of the PDR. Civil works
implemented during the period 2003-2006 utilized most of the loan proceeds. Total loan
disbursement was completed on December 12, 2007, sooner than the original closing date of
September 30, 2009.

1.7.4 Activities carried out during the period 2007 and 2008 did not use external funding and
included the formulation of 30 PDR, the conduct of the MTR evaluation, the conduct of the ICR
evaluation and financial audits for years 2006 and 2007. The formal closing date of the Project
remained as originally scheduled, September 30 of 2009.14

13
     According to the WU surveys conducted as part of the MTR and ICR, about 30% of the interviewed
     WU reported to have received some (incipient) support for agriculture diversification and
     reconversion, but not necessary through the Project.
14
     It should be noted that a letter was submitted to the Government on September 16, 2009, notifying that
     the Project would be closed on September 16, 2009. Since the Bank cannot unilaterally advance the
     closing date, the notification was not implemented at the end, and the original closing date of
     September 30, 2009 was kept as the closing date of the Project.

1.7.5 Reallocation of loan proceeds. With regard to funding, a few reallocations of funds of the
loan proceeds were done during the course of Project implementation. Table 3 compares the
original allocation as described in the loan agreement and the revised allocation of the loan
proceeds at Project completion.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1   The key Project design features worth highlighting are listed below:

        ·   Adopting an integrated approach to the modernization of both irrigation
            infrastructure and irrigated agriculture was the main Project design consideration.
            Consistent with the objective of the Government program to modernize the irrigation
            sector and improve the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture, the main concern of
            the Project design was to provide assistance to irrigation farmers, namely farmers'
            organizations, to address the whole range of factors constraining improved
            productivity of irrigated agriculture, whether these are infrastructure or production
            related. This integrated approach called for effective institutional collaboration
            between CONAGUA and SAGARPA during Project implementation as well as
            development of partnerships between the public and the private sectors.

        ·   Project design incorporated lessons learned or reinforced from previous Bank
            involvement in agriculture and irrigation in Mexico, in particular that of the
            Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project and the On-Farm and Minor Irrigation
            Project. The main lessons from these projects were the following: (i) the need to



                                                9
            establish close links between actions oriented to infrastructure and those aiming at
            production improvements; (ii) past achievements in the transferring of irrigation
            infrastructure to water users should be consolidated; (iii) there is great advantage in
            including potential beneficiaries in the decision-making process regarding
            infrastructure investments and other project activities; (iv) technical assistance in the
            selection of appropriate technology becomes an important element in a program
            aiming at improved competitiveness of irrigated crops;15 and (v) the sector would
            benefit from a more decisive decentralization of CONAGUA, the development of a
            mechanism to monitor performance, and incorporation of issues of water resources
            availability and environmental issues.

        ·   Project design also attached considerable attention to environmental issues,
            particularly to the growing problems of water scarcity and overexploitation of
            aquifers. The mechanism introduced in Project design to address the issue of water
            scarcity and overexploitation of aquifers was the so-called Integrated Irrigation
            Investment Plan or PDR. The PDR was supposed to guide the DR's or UR's
            investments in irrigation modernization and rehabilitation supported by the Project
            taking into account the overall water balance. In addition, it was expected that an
            Environmental Assessment (EA) of each sub-project to be financed by the Project
            would be prepared during implementation as part of sub-project's formulation and
            approval process. Mitigation measures identified in the EA would then be
            incorporated in the respective PDR. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of
            the Project called for full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of "type 1" works
            in irrigation systems depending on overexploited aquifers, so as to avoid activities
            that would further worsen water availability.

2.1.2 Although the Project design was realistic and relevant, there were a few shortcomings
and limitations. The most relevant are presented below:

        ·   Project design assumed that SAGARPA was committed to cooperate in the
            implementation of Component 2 on diversification and intensification of irrigated
            agricultural production. While SAGARPA expressed its readiness to collaborate
            with CONAGUA in a number of activities in a letter addressed to CONAGUA, the
            document was not legally binding and was not sufficient for having SAGARPA's
            complementary programs to boost productivity to operate within the same areas
            supported by CONAGUA. Once SAGARPA learned that the Bank loan would not be
            incremental to its own budget, it lost interest to collaborate with CONAGUA in the
            implementation of the Project. As a result, water users in DR and UR benefitting
            from the Project did not systematically receive the expected technical and financial
            assistance to increase agriculture productivity, diversify production and/or improve
            their marketing capabilities. The signing of a legally binding "Agreement of
            Collaboration" between CONAGUA and SAGARPA, where common indicators are
            defined for both agencies regarding water productivity and agriculture productivity,
            satisfactory to the Bank should have been a condition for negotiation.

        ·   Project design also assumed that the PDR would be developed during the first year
            of Project implementation and that investments under components 1 and 2 of the
            Project would be guided by these plans. This assumption proved to be over-
            optimistic. By the end of 2005, less than 40% of the original target was achieved.
15
     This was supposed to be achieved through the collaboration between SAGARPA and CONAGUA.


                                                10
             Issues of timing and planning of the PDR as well as budgetary allocation should have
             received more attention during appraisal. Commitment of the federal government to
             financially support the formulation of the PDR should have been tested by asking
             CONAGUA to make budgetary allocation for this purpose as a condition of
             effectiveness or disbursement.
         ·   The Project aimed to target small (and potentially poor) farmers and assumed that
             would-be beneficiaries would be able to mobilize investment grants made available
             by SAGARPA under its boost agriculture programs to meet their co-financing
             requirements, and access CONAGUA's programs supported by the Project.
             Mobilization of additional resources from SAGARPA would have reduced the
             financial participation of the small farmers to less than 32%, which was the average
             contribution of the Project's beneficiaries. Since the collaboration between
             CONAGUA and SAGARPA was limited, SAGARPA's programs to boost
             productivity did not necessarily target their resources at farmers in the DR and UR
             supported by the Project. Even if SAGARPA and CONAGUA collaboration had
             materialized, it is questionable if indeed small farmers with limited financial
             resources and limited organizational capacity would have been reached by the
             Project. This raises the question of whether a design focusing on creating synergies
             between programs operating in the rural space in Mexico was sufficient to address
             the needs of the small farmers or whether other differentiated co-financing rules and
             training and capacity building programs would have had a much larger impact on
             reaching small farmers.16

         ·   Although the PAD identified eight critical risks, one of which was rated as
             substantial and seven as modest, a key potential risk associated with the lack of
             SAGARPA's cooperation was not identified at entry. Since CONAGUA and
             SAGARPA joined forces in the preparation of the Project, the Bank hoped that such
             cooperation would continue during the implementation phase and did not anticipate
             the possible withdrawal of SAGARPA. The Bank did not consider during Project
             preparation the limited leverage it had to influence such cooperation given that the
             loan proceeds were directed to support CONAGUA's programs only. During
             implementation this risk turned out to be substantial and resulted in the limited
             achievement of the second part of the PDO as explained in Section 3.




16
     It seems that the reference made in the PAD that the Project would improve access of small farmers to
     Project's benefits through special incentives for both off-farm and on-farm investments was not well-
     grounded. In actuality, small farmers did not receive special financial terms to participate in the
     Project.


                                                   11
2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 As indicated in paragraphs 1.3.1, 1.7.1, and 2.1.2, the lack of cooperation from
SAGARPA, which was very supportive of the Project during the preparation phase, made the
development objective related to increased competitiveness of irrigated agriculture (measured by
the increase in crop diversification) more difficult to achieve. CONAGUA's level of experience,
competence, technical as well as administrative capacity and commitment positively affected
Project implementation and explain the relative success of the Project, including the fast
disbursement of the loan proceeds ahead of schedule.

2.2.2 A few additional issues encountered during Project implementation were as follows: (i)
the limited budgetary allocation for non-structural measures, which caused delays in the
formulation of the PDR, in the implementation of the capacity building activities, and in the
strengthening of the geographic information system; (ii) the delays with the approval of
CONAGUA's annual budgets, which during the course of Project implementation were often
approved 6-7 months into the budget year, combined with the lack of multi-annual budgetary
allocation, contributed to the delays incurred in the launching of the PDR, to the repetition of the
procurement procedures the following year, and/or to changes in the procurement procedures
from Consultant Qualification to sole source basis; and (iii) the increased budgetary allocation for
structural measures during the first two years of Project implementation, which caused pressures
to implement a large share of the irrigation modernization works in the absence of the PDR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design. The design of the M&E was less than satisfactory. Although Annex 2b of the
PAD provided a list of well-chosen key indicators to monitor and evaluate performance, project
management and impacts/outcomes in terms of increased efficiency of irrigation use and crop
diversification, no indicators were included to monitor and measure competiveness of irrigated
agriculture per se. Actually, competitiveness of irrigated agriculture is a Project impact and
should not have been included in the formulation of the PDO. Furthermore, the readiness of the
implementation arrangements for carrying out the M&E functions of the Project was not carefully
assessed. The PAD indicated that a M&E system was already in place at the time of Project
approval, but it failed to indicate its scope and extent and its linkages with CONAGUA and
SAGARPA's own M&E systems. At the time of Project approval, CONAGUA's M&E system
did not have the capacity to produce the full set of indicators identified in the PAD. In hindsight,
greater attention should have been paid to making sure credible monitoring arrangements were in
place.

2.3.2 The PAD also acknowledged that key indicators would be incorporated to monitor and
evaluate the social and environmental impacts of the Project and that the proposed M&E
mechanisms would be improved to capture these impacts. However, these enhancements to the
Project indicators did not materialize. It is interesting to note that inclusion of environmental
indicators as part of the overall M&E system was done as a result of public consultations carried
out during the course of Project preparation, where participants indicated the need to include
indicators of efficiency, health, sustainability and water quality. In hindsight, concrete indicators
to measure environmental and social impacts should have been defined prior to approval and
should have become an integral part of the results framework of the Project.

2.3.3 Two additional shortcomings associated with the design of the M&E system were the
following: (i) the lack of a control group of non-beneficiaries and detailed baseline to assess a key


                                                 12
claim made on the PAD in support of the Project that the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture
was constrained by the low level of technology of irrigated agriculture, and the limited
investments in the modernization of irrigation infrastructure; and (ii) the lack of a precise
definition of the concept of high-value crops17 to assess the increased crop diversification (as a
proxy for increased competitiveness) of irrigated agriculture.

2.3.4 Implementation. During the course of the first three supervision missions, discussions
were held with CONAGUA on the extent and scope of the M&E system to be used under the
Project, including institutional responsibilities. Only around mid-2005, a final comprehensive list
of indicators was agreed with CONAGUA, which corresponds to a large extent to the list of
indicators included in Annex 2b of the PAD. However, as shown in Table 1, targets were missing
for important indicators.

2.3.5 Although during Project implementation there was early follow-up on M&E issues and
indicators related to improving irrigation efficiency were monitored, the Bank missed an
opportunity to emphasize the importance of the environmental and social indicators and the
outcomes on increased competitiveness. This shortcoming in Project implementation was
partially rectified by the time of the MTR evaluation and final evaluation review conducted by
the Borrower.

2.3.6 Dissemination. Although the dissemination of the Project's results outside Mexico was
relevant to the Borrower,18 efforts to disseminate the results and lessons learned from Project
implementation within Mexico were limited in scope. As pointed out by the Quality of
Supervision Assessment (QSA), mechanisms should have been found to widely disseminate
important findings and conclusions of Bank supervision missions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environment. Compliance with environmental safeguards was moderately satisfactory.
Although the Project is likely to result in significant environmental advances, the EMP's
requirements were not thoroughly complied with. Environmental screening and assessment were
carried out in accordance with the Mexican environmental legal framework. The EMP
procedures, however, had called for full EIA in "type 1" - or critically overexploited aquifer -
areas, so as to avoid activities that would further worsen water availability. Yet, EIAs were not
done for the sub-projects carried out in the following "type 1" DR: DR001 Pabellón in
Aguascalientes, DR037 Altar Pitiquito Caborca in Sonora, DR051 Costa de Hermosillo in
Sonora, DR066 Santo Domingo in Baja California Sur and DR084 Guaymas in Sonora. Mexican
environmental legislation did not require EIA for works carried out in existing infrastructure. 19 It
should be noted that the PDR prepared under the Project for these five DR have specifically
addressed sustainability issues, and have included structural and non-structural measures to
reduce water consumption to sustainable levels. In these cases, the implementation of the

17
     Because of this shortcoming, the Borrower came with its own definition of "high-value crops" when
     conducting the MTR and ICR evaluations. These were crops that showed gross revenue per hectare
     thirty-percent higher than the average gross revenue of all crops.
18
     The Project results were presented at various international events, including the 4th World Water
     Forum, which took place in Mexico in March 2006, the Water Tribune in Expo-Saragoza, Spain, in
     June 2008, and Bank-sponsored Water Week in 2009.
19
     The wording in the PAD regarding the environmental requirements, i.e., "that the EMP actions will be
     linked to the Mexican environmental legal framework and authority" made CONAGUA believe that
     there were no deviations between the EMP's requirements and the country's legal framework.


                                                   13
structural measures was guided by the PDR. Thus, actions supported by the Project in these DR
are expected to improve environmental outcomes in the medium term and achieve more than the
EMP requirements.

2.4.2 With regard to pest management safeguards, the Project was supposed to implement a
Pest Management Plan (PMP). Since CONAGUA followed the Mexican procedures with regard
to environmental assessment, pest management safeguard procedures were not implemented as
per the PMP. However, since international standards concerning the use of pesticides are applied
in Mexico, the rigor of health and safety measures have been assured.

2.4.3 Procurement. Three ex-post reviews of procurement activities related to the Project were
conducted during the course of Project implementation. The findings of these reviews indicated
that CONAGUA's procurement team was well-prepared and had the experience and expertise to
handle procurement-related matters. In comparison with other executing agencies in Mexico,
CONAGUA's performance in procurement was rated highly satisfactory by the Bank
procurement team. Despite the large number of contracts, the geographical spread of the Project
and the decentralized nature of implementation, CONAGUA managed to ensure harmony and
consistency across its regional and district units to conduct procurement according to Bank
guidelines and procedures.

2.4.4 Financial management and audit. In general, compliance with financial management was
satisfactory. Financial management systems and control in place were found reasonable, adequate
and reliable for managing and monitoring Project implementation. Financial management reports
were always submitted in a timely manner and were found satisfactory by the Bank. Special
financial management reviews conducted during Project implementation also concluded that
CONAGUA's financial management team had adequate experience and expertise.

2.4.5 However, during the course of two supervision missions, the Project received a
Marginally Satisfactory rating on financial management performance due to: (i) the delays with
the States' reporting and provision of required documentation, which caused slow progress in
disbursements for activities implemented in 2005, and (ii) the 45-day delay with the submission
of the 2005 audit report.

2.4.6 Compliance with auditing requirements was also satisfactory. During the course of
Project implementation, the Bank received satisfactory audit reports. Auditors' opinions were
always Unqualified and no major issues were identified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Many areas of Mexico face severe water scarcity. However, improving the efficiency of
existing irrigation systems by itself, while beneficial and indispensable, does not represent real
water savings in the hydrological cycle and does not guarantee the stabilization of overexploited
aquifers. On-farm irrigation improvements, reduction in irrigation distribution losses, and
application of water in the quantity and at the time demanded by the crops can increase water
consumption. Thus, modernization and technological upgrading of irrigation systems might
translate into less recharge to the aquifers and less return flows. CONAGUA is aware that
irrigation efficiency improvements by themselves are insufficient to address the increasing
problem of water scarcity. In line with the strategic directions defined in the 2007-2012 National
Water Program, CONAGUA is committed to link future efforts in irrigation modernization and
technological improvements with reductions in the net extraction of water, particularly in areas
where water resources are already overexploited.


                                               14
2.5.2 The PDR formulated and adopted under the Project by 83 DR and 32 SRL conforming
UR (representing 98% of the total DR's surface and 4% of the total UR's surface, respectively)
have proved to be very useful instruments to better orient both existing and future investments in
the sector. Since CONAGUA has institutionalized these plans as well as other management tools
supported by the Project, future support to the sector will be provided within the concept of
environmental sustainability. This will ensure that negative externalities associated with irrigation
technological improvements are fully addressed.

2.5.3 Around mid-2007, preliminary discussions were held between CONAGUA and the Bank
regarding a possible follow-up operation to further improve the performance of earlier
interventions in the sector. The new operation was going to assist CONAGUA in the formulation
and implementation of an integrated program to support the further implementation of the PDR
formulated and adopted under the Project accompanied by measures to reduce the net extraction
of water, considered indispensable to meet the growing environmental, urban and industrial
demands and to increase water productivity and overall water security. While at present the
Government is not considering requesting financial support from the Bank for a new operation in
the irrigation sector, there is a very good dialogue with CONAGUA on critical issues affecting
the sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The Project's dual development objective of improving water use efficiency and
competitiveness of irrigated agriculture was and remains highly relevant for Mexico. One of the
objectives of Mexico's National Development Plan of 2001-2006 was to achieve dynamic,
inclusive and sustainable economic growth that supports competitiveness, and improving water
use efficiency and productivity in the irrigation sector was seen as very important for growth. The
Project also responded well to four of the five strategic objectives of the 2002-2005 Bank's CAS
as detailed: (i) accelerating growth through competitiveness; (ii) human capital development; (iii)
balancing growth and poverty reduction with environmental protection; and (iv) building an
efficient, transparent, and accountable government.

3.1.2 Furthermore, the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period 2008-2013
still makes reference to the need to manage water resources in a sustainable manner, particularly
in the irrigation sector, which is the largest user of water resources accounting for about 77% of
overall water withdrawals.

3.1.3 Although the integrated approach sought to be promoted by the Project was consistent
with the stated dual development objective, the Project's design should have put more attention
on the following aspects: (i) the collaboration arrangements between SAGARPA and
CONAGUA, (ii) the time and resources needed for the formulation of the PDR, and (iii) the
implementation arrangements for the M&E system.

3.1.4 Planned Project activities to support farmers to convert their cropping patterns to high-
value crops (in terms of start-up and working capital to cover incremental production costs,
technical assistance to build capacity of water users in commercialization of high-value crops,
formal credit for supporting infrastructure, among others) did not materialize; and as a result,
there were no activities, outputs or outcomes directly related to agriculture competitiveness. In


                                                 15
retrospective, the Project objective should have been modified to reflect these changes. The
Project only had indirect impacts on the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture. By increasing
the security of water for irrigation, the Project induced WUs to adopt other technologies and
production methods.

3.1.5 With relation to the relevance of implementation arrangements, although the Project
supported existing government programs, the emphasis at the design phase was to rely on the
Bank's safeguards and fiduciary policies. During the course of Project implementation, and
consistent with the spirit of the CPS for the period 2005-2008, there was a shift towards Mexican
systems for financial management and audit across the entire Bank portfolio. Similarly, the
Project design relied on existing government institutions rather than on a specialized
implementation unit to carry out the Project activities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The Project has achieved its stated dual development objective despite the limited
participation of SAGARPA as noted in paragraphs 1.3.1, 1.7.1, 2.1.2 and 3.1.4. The rating is
considered satisfactory because: (i) overall so much has been achieved in terms of increasing
water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture, and (ii) while competitiveness was not and could not
be directly addressed (as point out in paragraphs 2.3.1 and 3.1.4), the achievements in terms of
increased output per hectare (as shown in Annex 3, net return to land per hectare seems to have
increased by 48% for schemes in DR and by 44% for schemes in UR) and increased water
productivity (as shown in paragraph 3.2.8, water productivity per cubic meter seems to have
increased by more than 100%), did indirectly increase the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture
in DR and UR. Some observations of the achievements are presented below.

3.2.2 Modernization of existing irrigation infrastructure to promote a more efficient use of
irrigation water. Through the successful rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation
infrastructure of 427,100 ha (comprising 308,000 ha in DR and 119,100 ha in UR) and the
adoption of improved on-farm irrigation application systems in 157,100 ha (comprising 127,300
ha in DR and 29,800 ha in UR) during the period 2003-2006, the Project20 has had a significant
impact on the efficient use of water.

3.2.3 Water efficiency improvements were in line with initial targets: 26% increase in water
conveyance and distribution efficiency and 18% increase in application efficiency (equivalent to
51% increase in overall water efficiency). According to the annual evaluations conducted by the
Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA for its acronym in Spanish Instituto Nacional de
Tecnología del Agua) of CONAGUA's programs in DR, the water conveyance and distributional
efficiency as well as water application efficiency have increased by 26%-34% and 39%-49%,
respectively, in the areas directly benefiting from the Project. (See Annex 5 for irrigation
efficiency improvements in DR). Similarly, according to the evaluations conducted by the Post-
Graduate College (Colegio de Post-graduados) of CONAGUA's programs in UR, the overall
water efficiency of UR directly benefiting from the Project increased by 20%-24%, when the
source was groundwater, and by 14%-37%, when the source was surface water. (See Annex 5 for
irrigation efficiency improvements in UR).

     It should be noted that the output and outcome indicators presented in this section also include those
     that resulted from activities executed in 2003, which were financed under retroactive financing.

3.2.4 The improvements in irrigation efficiency have allowed the DR to achieve modest
increase in crop intensity,21 to reduce their drought vulnerability and to a lesser degree to reduce
overexploitation of aquifers. A large share of the water savings estimated at 1,134 million cubic
meters (MCM) per year (equivalent to about 3.5% of the volume of water distributed to DR) has
been used to restore the reservoir levels even during drought years and improve the reliability of
water delivery to WUs, as shown in Figure 1. The DR066 Santo Domingo, Baja California, which
is totally dependent on groundwater sources, was able to reduce annual extractions from over 400
MCM to 150 MCM during the period 2002-2007. In the case of the UR, improvements in
irrigation efficiency have increased the availability of water resources by 49 MCM (or 347 m3
per hectare), which in turn has allowed UR to experience modest reduction in idle land and
modest increase in crop intensity.22

3.2.5 With the formulation and adoption of the PDR by 83 DR (covering about 3.44 million ha)
and 32 SRL (covering about 100,000 ha in UR), the Project has also made importance advances
in addressing water sustainability issues by the irrigation sector. CONAGUA has institutionalized
these plans and is committed to ensure consistency between the future support to be provided to
the sector and the actions stipulated in the PDR. This will ensure that actions to improve
irrigation efficiency and reduce water losses will not further worsen water availability.

3.2.6 Increased productivity of irrigated agriculture and diversification into high-value crops.
The improvements in conveyance, distribution and application efficiencies as well as
rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation schemes and capacity building and training of WUs
have increased the security of water for irrigation, which in turn has induced WUs to adopt other
technologies and production methods.

3.2.7 A comparison of the statistics of the DR maintained by CONAGUA between 2001-2002
and 2006-2007, that is comparing the period before the Project and after the Project, reveals that

21
     According to the statistics of the DR, the area under second crop has increased from 5% to 8% during
     the period 2002-03 and 2007-08.
22
     According to the annual evaluations conducted by the Colegio de Post-graduado, the idle land in the
     UR has been reduced from 26% to 17% in the case of schemes depending on surface water and from
     40% to 26% in the case of schemes depending on groundwater. The same evaluations also reveal that
     the area under second crop has increased from 9.5% to 13.0% in the case of schemes depending on
     surface water and from 6.5% to 9.5% in the case of schemes depending on groundwater.

the average yield increased annually by 0.2 ton per ha and that the sown and harvested areas with
high-value crops increased from 18.9% to 19.8% and 18.7% and 19.5%, respectively.23 These
trends are shown in Figure 2. The indicators of gross water productivity and land productivity24
monitored by CONAGUA, shown in Figure 3, also reveal that over the past seven years, the DR
have reaped slightly higher returns per cubic meter of water and per hectare of land in real terms.
These increases can be partially attributed to the Project.25

3.2.8 According to the annual evaluations of the irrigation systems directly benefited by the
Project conducted by the Colegio de Post-graduados and IMTA, the net water productivity has
increased by 60% in the case of DR and by 131% in the case of UR. (See Annex 5). A
comparison of the representative farm models "with" and "without" Project situations conducted
as part of the ICR,26 summarized in Figure 4, also reveals that the net water productivity has

     In addition to vegetables, fruits and some exotic crops, "high-value crops" also include alfalfa for hay
     and sugar cane. These two crops have experienced real price increases during the analyzed period.
24
     Gross water productivity is defined as the gross revenue per volume of water withdrawn. Gross land
     productivity in turn is defined as the gross revenue per hectare.
25
     In the absence of control group, it is not possible to attribute all increases to the Project.

     It includes 15 farm models for the DR and 10 farm models for UR.

attributable to the Project.

           Note. These weighted averages were calculated using the area of the DR and UR
           supported under the Project as the weights.

3.2.9 In the case of UR depending on groundwater, the Project has also contributed to energy
savings equivalent to 98.8 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year27 and pumping cost reductions 28up to
46% per irrigated area.

3.210  Farmers interviewed as part of the MTR and ICR have also indicated to have
experienced increases in physical yields as those presented in Annex 3.

3.2.11 As indicated earlier, diversification into high-return crops was slower than expected.
According to the survey conducted as part of the ICR report, whose findings regarding crop
diversification are summarized in Table 4, while a large percentage (72%) of water users in DR
that acquired water-efficient systems reported to have interest to diversify their cropping patterns,
only a small fraction (21%) reported to have actually done it. In the case of UR, although the
percentage of the water users that reported interest in crop diversification was smaller (37%),
probably because they were already practicing crop diversification, a similar fraction (22%)
reported that crop diversification took place. Using the results of the WUs survey, it is estimated
that the area under high-value crop increased by about 33,290 ha as a result of the Project. This
represents 26% of the original target (128,000 ha).

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

3.3.1 The efficiency of the Project is rated substantial. At appraisal, the economic rate of return
(ERR) for the entire Project at full development was estimated at 20.1%. At completion, the ERR
at full development was re-estimated to be about 17% using actual costs and assumptions about
improvements in water use efficiency, crop yields, output and input prices as well as crop patterns
consistent with the trends observed in the 15 DR and 10 UR evaluated as part of the ICR. Details
of the ex-post economic analysis are presented in Annex 3. The crop budgets developed as part of
the ICR also show increases in the net financial return per hectare, inclusive of cost of labor and
water costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The outcome of the Project is rated satisfactory based on its high relevance, the
satisfactory rating given to its efficacy since it achieved the intended two-part development
objective and the satisfactory rating given to its efficiency since it is expected that the Project will
achieve an acceptable economic rate of return of 17% at full development.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty. Although poverty alleviation was not a specific Project development objective,
the agricultural productivity gains achieved by the Project as well as the creation of employment
in irrigation (estimated at 807,000 daily wage-labor per year) have contributed to poverty
reduction. However, more could have been done, if the Project had had special rules and
procedures to reach poor farmers with small size lots. Poor farmers had fewer opportunities to
participate in the Project. Not only could they not meet the co-financing requirements to
participate in the Project (50% of the total investment cost), but also because of their limited
organizational capacity, they had limited access to information about the various components of
the Project.

3.5.2 Gender. Although there were no restrictions to the participation of women in any of the
activities supported under the Project, the vast majority of beneficiaries were male. Female
beneficiaries comprised about 19% of total direct beneficiaries in DR.29

3.5.3 Social development. From the social development perspective, particularly in those DR
and UR where the infrastructure was transferred to WUs or where ACU/SRL were created, the
Project empowered WUs to assume control over the management of their irrigation infrastructure.
In addition, the Project contributed to the capitalization of the WUs and increased their
productivity and income. The farm models developed as part of the MTR show substantial
29
     Annual evaluations of the irrigation district modernization Program conducted by IMTA reveal that
     women comprised 11%, 22%, 21% and 22% of direct beneficiaries during the years 2003, 2004, 2005
     and 2006, respectively.


                                                  20
increases in farm income. According to the results of the WUs survey and focus groups
conducted as part of the ICR, WUs in DR and UR located in the north, which received higher
support from the Project compared to other regions, reported substantial increases in their level of
income and quality of life. Once again, because of the absence of control groups, these increases
can only be partially attributed to the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4 Strengthening of water user organizations. The Project has played a very important role
in the consolidation of the transfer of irrigation infrastructure to WUs through the strengthening
of their associations. In the case of the UR, during the period 2004-2006, the Project supported
the establishment of 27 SRL and 392 ACU covering 101,160 ha and 24,486 WUs. In the case of
the DR, the Project supported the full transfer of DR019 Tehuantepec (44,074 ha) and the partial
transfer of DR003 Tula (51,925 ha). In total 15 ACU were established, covering about 67,465 ha
and 11,100 WUs. At Project completion, about 28,434 ha remained to be transferred to about
14,970 WUs.30

3.5.5 Planning irrigation rehabilitation, modernization and technology improvements in an
integrated manner. The Project supported the formulation of the PDR with the active
participation of WUs. At Project completion, a total of 105 PDR were formulated and adopted:
83PDR for DR and 32 for organized UR in SLR, surpassing the target value of 85. CONAGUA
has institutionalized these plans, and future investments in DR and UR will be guided by them.

3.5.6 Enhancing participation of WUAs in the O&M of irrigation infrastructure. At present,
the water fee paid by the WUs covers 100% of the required operation and management costs,
about 65% of the required maintenance costs in the case of DR and a share of the rehabilitation
and modernization investment costs. Under this Project, the average contribution of the WUs
towards the investment costs was about 32%. The remainder of the investment costs was covered
by the Federal Government (50%) and the state governments (18%). In the case of the DR, the
average ratio of annual revenues to required operation, maintenance and management costs has
increased from 77.5% in 2001 to 82.5% in 2008.31 Given the large variation among UR and the
fact that CONAGUA does not have access to data to assess their financial performance, it is
difficult to measure the ratio of cost recovery.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.7 It should be noted that the improvements in the efficiency of irrigation water use have not
represented "real" water savings in the hydrological regime and have not translated into the
stabilization of over-exploited aquifers. As indicated in paragraph 2.5.1, improving the efficiency
of existing irrigation systems, while being beneficial and indispensable, will not be sufficient to
solve the problem of water scarcity in Mexico. In fact, local water use efficiency improvements
reduce infiltration and operational "losses" in the water distribution systems and the field. They
may result in higher water consumption and less return flows to replenish water resources of the
area.32 Hence, while efficiency improvements should still be undertaken, they should take into

30
     The DR111 Baluarte-Presidio (covering 8,435 ha), which was supported by the Project, was
     transferred to WUs following Project completion.
31
     Maintenance costs are based on an annual diagnostic assessment conducted by CONAGUA to perform
     optimal maintenance.
32
     The evaluations of the UEAEE Program (CONAGUA 2006) show that water savings made through
     efficiency improvements in the UR were used for reducing the idle area and/or increasing double
     cropping, which increased water consumption.


                                                 21
account the need to reduce the net extraction of water (i.e., the water that is consumed through
evapo-transpiration -- the extraction minus the return flows), especially if the water resources are
already overexploited.

3.5.8 According to a detailed evaluation conducted by IMTA of the Project activities
conducted in the Delicias Irrigation District, all WUs are not taking advantage of the maximum
potential offered by the water-saving technologies supported by the Project. Some WUs seem to
have limited understanding of the use the new technologies, since limited technical assistance was
provided after the installation of the new systems, and limited financial incentives to use less
water, since the water charges at the level of the parcel are not always volumetric.

3.5.9 Although the PDR are essential elements for a rational allocation of the resources, special
attention will have to be paid to the potential adverse effects on vulnerable populations (including
those that depend on informal access of irrigation water) associated with the implementation of
measures to improve water conservation and sustainability or enforcement of water rights in
situations where there is over-exploitation or over-allocation33 of water resources within the DR
or UR. In these situations, it is recommended to carry out of a social assessment to identify
potential social impacts and mitigation measures. One innovative measure identified in the PDR
and already implemented in some DR, which seems to have insignificant impacts on vulnerable
and poor WUs, relates to the buying back of water concessions from WUs who previously were
renting them.34

3.5.10 Since the Project design did not incorporate the socio-economic differences among the
different regions in the country, WU in Northern states seem to have benefited more from the
Project than their counterparts in Southern states.35 Differences in land ownership (relatively
larger in the North than in the South), in educational levels of producers, in access to markets
(also relatively higher in the North than South) and inequalities within DR and especially among
neighboring UR within SRL have had a significant impact on the ability of WU to organize
productively and to demand program benefits. While these issues are well-recognized by the
government, the design of the Project did not incorporate specific measures and indicators to
make Project benefits and outcomes more equitable across the Federation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 A qualitative assessment of the social and institutional development impacts of the
Project was gathered though a perception survey conducted at the MTR; a perception survey
conducted at Project completion involving approximately 380 WUs in 15 DR and 10 UR; and 12
focus groups in 9 DR and 3 UR. Findings of the surveys are presented in Annex 6. A list of the
sample DR and UR for the latest perception survey and focus groups is available in Annex 7.
Main participants in the survey and focus groups were WUs as well as members of the WUAs
and SRL. The main conclusions of the qualitative assessments are summarized below.



33
     Over-exploitation refers to the situation where more water is allocated to the WUs during a period of
     time than can be sustained. Over-allocation refers to the situation where more water concessions have
     been issued in the system than can be sustained. This could arise from the over-dimensioning of the
     irrigation system. Many DR fall under this category.
34
     It is reported that these farmers were no longer using their water concessions. The lack of working
     capital to work their land forces then to engage in other economic activities different from agriculture.
35
     A rough distinction can be made between Southern and Northern states, although certain states in the
     central parts of Mexico (e.g. Hidalgo) may have high degrees of marginalization.

3.6.2 Participation of WUs in the planning, design, and implementation of works. According to
the qualitative survey, 72% of the respondents were familiar with the Project, 79% participated in
the elaboration of the PDR for their DR or SRL (in the case of UR); and 43% have served in
some capacity in the committee of their WUA (as president, secretary or treasurer). WUs reported
to have contributed on average 30% to the investment cost for the upgrading of the infrastructure.
Three DR, DR010 Culiacán (Chihuahua), DR019 Tehuantepec (Oaxaca), and DR041 Rio Yaqui
(Sonora), reported to have contributed more than 42%.

3.6.3 Beneficiaries' satisfaction with Project. In general, respondents expressed satisfaction
with the Project: About 83% reported to have benefited from the Project, 52% reported to have
directly benefited from the works carried out to reduce water losses and to have achieved
improvements in water efficiency of the order of 25%, and 43% reported to have directly
benefited from on-farm improvements and to have achieved 15% reduction in irrigation costs.
Only a small percentage of the respondents (3%) were not satisfied with the quality of the works.

3.6.4 Level of participation in and satisfaction with technical and managerial training. All WU
indicated they were aware of the training programs and had participated in some. Of those who
received training, all were satisfied with the quality of courses and instruction. WU also raised
demand for further training in water management and crop diversification. An evaluation of the
process and impacts of this training program was undertaken jointly by the IMTA and
CONAGUA. Evaluation results were not available at the timing of preparing this report.

3.6.5 Challenges to user participation. According to the survey, 60% of the respondents
reported lack of resources as the main obstacle to their financial contribution, and 25% mentioned
organizational problems within their WUAs as the main obstacle to participate in the Project.
About half of the respondents (53%) believed that the Federal government should invest a larger
share in the investment cost or introduce differentiated co-financing arrangements depending on
the capacity (both financial and organizational) of the WU.

3.6.6 Performance of WUAs. The fairness and efficiency of the WUAs were evaluated through
perception surveys. At the MTR stage, 90% of respondents believed that their WUAs were
delivering water fairly, yet also 90% recognized that despite the support provided by the Project
in the installation of measuring device and metering systems, there were not sufficient
measurement devices to ensure proper and precise delivery of irrigation water to each plot. About
85% of the respondents believed that the tariffs charged by the WUA did reflect the "real" and
fair amount required for the financial independence of the WUA. One of the main challenges to
the well-functioning of WUAs and participation of WUs in the O&M, as perceived by WU,
relates to their politicization. When WUs perceived links to a specific local governor, they don't
believe that their financial contribution would be used in a fair manner. According to the
qualitative assessment conducted at Project completion, WUs are conscious that the complete
transfer of responsibility to WUAs with adequate commitment and financial participation is a
long-term process (requiring "at least seven years" according to WUs of Tula, Hidalgo).

3.6.7 Variation in income and standard of living. Approximately 70% of interviewed WU in
DR responded that they have been able to invest in new agricultural equipment (tractor, vehicle or
other machinery) with a notable difference between northern and southern states. The three DR
with highest percentage of investment were DR010 Culiacan, Sinaloa (100%), DR011 Alto Rio
Lerma, Guanajuato (95%) and DR041 Rio Yaqui, Sonora (93%), while those who made least
investments were in DR003 Tula, Hidalgo (67%), DR035 La Antigua, Veracruz (64%) and
DR019 Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (31%). In UR, investments in new equipment were much lower ­
only 2% of the sample. A similar trend was noted for improvements in the household ­ 72% of all


                                               23
respondents reported having bought new domestic appliances, the highest percentage being in
DR010 Culiacan, Sinaloa (93%) and the lowest in DR019 Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (38%). In UR
only 14% of all respondents reported any household improvements.

3.6.8 Drawing on focus group discussions, WU in Chiapas and Oaxaca reported no increase in
income at all and mostly a continuation of the same economic status. By contrast all participants
in Michoacán and Jalisco reported an increase in income either due to change in crops
(Michoacán) or to more employment opportunities (Jalisco). Within the focus group in Veracruz,
there was a marked difference in income variation between a large livestock and pasture owner,
whose plot was modernized with sprinklers, and the rest of the participants - mostly sugar cane
producers who did not benefit from the Project. In general, the inequalities in income and access
to credit and technology are higher among UR compared to DR, due to the larger discrepancies in
farm size, more independent sources of water supply and lower incentives to organize.

3.6.9 It is also worth highlighting that for some WUs, especially those in UR where
organization levels are lower, becoming a beneficiary of the Project was financially challenging.
A WU from El Barril UR, San Luis Potosi noted "I had to go to the US to earn the money I was
asked to participate in rehabilitation of my well and water tubes." Other users also noted that
"they depended on remittances from their children to afford financial contributions for the
technology or inputs." Despite the socio-economic differences among interviewed users, the large
majority stated a desire to continue working in agriculture and believed that it is worth investing
in the sector. A minority of the respondents held non-farm employment (generally in small trade)
with the exception of Michoacán, where close to a 100% of respondents had additional
employment. It is also notable that Michoacán users reported by far the highest income increase
among the sample of UR.

3.6.10 Satisfaction with the technical and bureaucratic requirements of the Project. Producers
from the DR030 Valsequillo and DR003 Tula, where the majority of users have completed only
primary education, reported that the Operational Rules of CONAGUA's programs were difficult
to understand and they were unclear about the requirements to become beneficiaries.
Approximately 41% of interviewed users in UR and 27% in DR had only completed primary
education; 16% in both UR and DR had completed secondary education, and only 6% of users in
the UR sample, and 38% of those in DR had a technical or university degree. This finding points
to the need to consider targeted promotion and training for future irrigation programs in areas
where the majority of users have primary levels of schooling.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.1 The long-term sustainability of the Project outcomes appears likely as was also assessed
by the QSA. Increased water efficiency in the irrigation sub-sector in combination with the
institutionalization of the PDR to better orient both existing and future investments and non-
structural actions in the sector will contribute to the technical sustainability of the Project's results
by helping relieve the pressure to reduce irrigation water use from competing sectors. The
current Operational Rules of CONAGUA's programs aiming to support the
modernization of irrigation and/or on-farm technological improvements require that the
proposed investments are guided by the PDR. The Project has also strengthened the technical
and administrative capacity of the WUA and has increased the WUs' ability to pay higher water
tariffs, which in turn will enable WUA to better manage their irrigation infrastructure and cover
the operation, maintenance and management costs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank performance during preparation of the Project is rated moderately satisfactory
as was also assessed by the QSA. While the Bank team understood well the problems of the sub-
sector and tried to design a Project to bring about "effective institutional collaboration within the
public sector," namely between CONAGUA and SAGARPA, this collaboration did not
materialize. Furthermore, the Bank team did not identify SAGARPA's refusal to collaborate as a
potential risk. With regard to the results framework, the Project would have benefited
substantially, if the Bank team had given more attention to the design of a comprehensive and
credible M&E system that takes into account social and environmental indicators. Finally, the
Bank team should have been more realistic in estimating the time needed to formulate
participatory PDR.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.2 As rated by the QSA, the Bank performance in supervision is rated moderately
satisfactory. The Bank supervision missions were regular and instrumental in identifying critical
problems such as the need to formulate the PDR within an overall framework of environmental
sustainability and in bringing the benefits of international best practices. They were also effective
as learning tools because representatives from the different levels participated in the missions and
took back to their offices new insights and improved approaches. However, the focus of the
supervision missions was limited to the implementation of activities to increase water use
efficiency including the formulation of the PDR as well as disbursement, procurement and
financial management. Although the Bank identified at Project start-up that SAGARPA would


                                                   25
not participate in the Project, no corrective measures were introduced to address this substantial
change.

5.1.3 As noted earlier, the Bank also demonstrated flexibility in adapting implementation
arrangements to changing circumstances, namely in financial management and auditing.

5.1.4 While the Bank team tried to ensure that the Project implementation followed Bank
policies and procedures in environmental safeguards, procurement and financial management and
did not involve significant deviations from original design, the composition of supervision
missions fell short of expectations. The environmental specialist participated in only one
supervision mission. Despite the importance given in the design to the potential social impacts of
the Project, no sociologist expertise was included in any supervision mission.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.5 The Bank's overall performance is considered moderately satisfactory. The Bank's
performance fell short in not properly restructuring the Project to reflect the non-participation of
SAGARPA.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower's performance during preparation is rated moderately satisfactory.
CONAGUA and SAGARPA worked in closed collaboration with the Bank team in the
preparation of the Project. Both seemed committed to implementing an integrated approach to
support modernization of irrigation systems and technological innovation at the level of the
parcel. However, when SAGARPA learned that the Bank loan would not be additional to its
budget, it lost interest in collaborating with CONAGUA in the implementation of the Project.

5.2.2 The Borrower did not employ any other mechanism to pursue SAGARPA to play an
active role in Project implementation and to encourage collaboration with CONAGUA. Apart
from that, the Borrower provided full support and funding throughout the implementation of the
Project. However, as noted earlier, there were some issues that caused implementation delays.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 Throughout Project preparation and implementation, CONAGUA's performance is rated
satisfactory. CONAGUA is technically very solid, has considerable experience in implementing
Bank-financed projects, and has an excellent track record in carrying out procurement and
financial management related tasks. It ensured continuity in the team responsible for overall
administrative and technical coordination, who implemented the Project according to Bank's
fiduciary guidelines. The Project suffered from lack of baseline data for a well-functioning M&E
system. Delays in the formulation of the PDR were caused by limited budgetary allocation for
non-structural activities.


                                                26
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.2.4 The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory.
Notwithstanding the limitations pointed out above, the Borrower showed strong commitment to
the Project objectives during the preparation phase, and followed through during implementation.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1.1   The key lessons learned from the implementation of this Project are the following:

        ·   Modernization of irrigation infrastructure and on-farm technology improvements is a
            necessary but not sufficient condition to increase competitiveness in irrigated
            agriculture. Irrigation improvement interventions need to be accompanied by actions
            that support farmers and producers, particularly the small ones, in the areas of
            organization, financial management and commercialization.

        ·   For modernization of irrigation projects in Mexico aiming to have impacts on
            increased agricultural competitiveness, it is necessary to establish a common strategy
            between institutions such as SAGARPA and CONAGUA that forces them to work in
            the same DR or UR, setup a joint M&E system and report on the same indicators ­
            not only in terms of number of hectares with modernized systems and improved
            irrigation technologies, but also on indicators of agriculture productivity, labor
            generated, areas under high-value crops.

        ·   Modernization of irrigation projects, particularly within the DR and UR located in
            over-exploited aquifers and/or over-allocated surface water resources, should be done
            within an integral water resources management framework, where the water balance,
            the availability of the resource, and other users including environmental water needs
            are taken into account.

        ·   Particularly crucial for the optimization of benefits that could be derived from water-
            saving technologies is the provision of technical assistance to farmers as a
            complement to the on-farm investments for at least the first agriculture-year.

        ·   Since the Project appears to have benefited the already better-off farmers and/or
            agricultural producers, the greater Project absorption by small farmers and producers
            would require special targeting mechanisms, implicit eligibility criteria and special
            financial terms to participate.

        ·   When the target population is diverse, it is extremely important to gain a better
            understanding of the human development opportunities and services of WUs so as to
            assess their potential to access the assistance and support provided by the Project.
            Targeted training and promotion programs, where levels of education are
            predominantly low, are highly recommended.

        ·   For programs and projects designed to achieve increased competitiveness of irrigated
            agriculture, it is extremely important to have in place prior to their approval a


                                               27
            properly designed M&E system, including the setting up of control groups of non-
            beneficiaries, with a detailed baseline. In case the target population is diverse, it is
            equally important to establish a social baseline and indicators at the beginning stages
            (involving a social specialist on the Bank and/or counterpart side) to allow for a more
            consistent monitoring of variation in income, institutional challenges, and
            affordability issues as well as to desegregate project impacts on small and large
            landholders during evaluations at the baseline, MTR review stage and at closing.

        ·   Since irrigation modernization and technological improvements are medium-term, it
            is necessary to ensure that these programs and multiannual, so unnecessary delays are
            avoided.

        ·   PDR are essential tools, which need to be updated from time to time to define
            priorities in the sector. Their implementation needs to be accompanied by a detailed
            social assessment to assess the significance of adverse effects of conservation and
            enforcement actions on vulnerable populations and identify measures for their
            mitigation.

        ·   Innovative financial mechanisms need to be identified so WU can meet co-financing
            requirements.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by
Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1 The Borrower provided comments to the draft ICR, which are included in Annex 8. In
their comments, in reference to paragraph 3.5.9 of the draft ICR, the Borrower indicated that so
far, the implementation of measures to adjust water allocation in DR facing problems of over-
concession have not resulted in adverse impacts to WUs. WUs in DR005 and DR090 that
voluntarily participated in the Water Rights Adjustment Program (PADUA for its acronym in
Spanish) were not farming. They were engaged in economic activities different from agriculture
and were renting their water rights. Thus, giving up their water rights in exchange of financial
compensation did not cause adverse social impacts to them. In reference to paragraphs 2.5.1 and
3.5.7, the Borrower also acknowledged that the only way to stabilized over-exploited aquifers is
by limiting annual extraction to the annual natural recharge, and that the best way to achieve
groundwater-level recovery is to stop extracting water.

7.1.2 The Borrower also requested to make a minor adjustment in Annex 2, page 34, of the
draft ICR in order to clarify that the responsibility for financial and disbursement aspects of the
Project was under CONAGUA and NAFIN.

                     Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Components 1: Modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure in DR and UR
(Actual cost: USD557.7 million or 72.3% of Project costs)

Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure. Irrigation infrastructure was
rehabilitated and/or modernized over a total area of 427,100 ha (at an average cost of Mx$11,900
per hectare), comprising about 308,100 ha in DR and 119,100 ha in UR. A detailed breakdown by
year is shown in Table 2.1. The total rehabilitated/modernized area represents 93% of original
target. Works completed include: repairs or upgrading of main canals, rehabilitation of
distribution networks, main canal lining, conversion of conveyance systems from open canals to
piping, rehabilitation of drainage networks, and improvement of internal roads. Under this sub-
component, a total of 2,663 wells serving UR were also rehabilitated or replaced. Project
beneficiaries were involved in the identification, review, approval, implementation and co-
financing of the various Project activities. On average, beneficiaries co-financed 34% of the
investment costs.

The Project also financed the rehabilitation and modernization of large infrastructure under the
responsibility of CONAGUA, including 5 main barrages, 483 km of main irrigation canals, 18
wells, 6 pumping stations, 10 km of drainage canals and 63 km of access roads.

Maintenance of federal irrigation infrastructure in irrigation districts. During the drought years
(2004-2005), the Project provided financial support to affected ACU and SRL to carry out the
needed maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure in DR since the financial resources collected
through the tariff was below of the amount needed to perform proper maintenance of the system.
Overall, the Project financed the maintenance of about 80,000 ha at an average cost of Mx$2,000
per hectare.

Installation of measuring devices. Through the acquisition and installation of 12,090 measuring
devices (including 6,453 meters installed in UR) and/or modernization of control structures, the
Project has enhanced the capacity of the DR and UR to exercise better control over the use of
water. The states that received larger financial support for the installation of measuring devices to
control extractions from groundwater sources were: Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi, Puebla,
Guanajuato, Baja California, Aguascalientes, Oaxaca and Yucatan. These are the federal entities
where the majority of over-exploited aquifers are located.

Acquisition and rehabilitation of maintenance machinery and establishment of repair workshops.
The Project provided financial support to 478 ACU and 13 SRL of DR and 7 SLR comprising UR



                                                 32
to acquire machinery and equipment needed to carry out proper maintenance of their irrigation
infrastructure. In DR, a total of 315 large machines (including excavators, retro-excavators, dump
trucks, motor graders and bulldozers) were procured. In the case of DR, the Federal government
financed 50% of the cost, ACU or SRL 28%, and the state governments 22%. In the case of SRL
comprising UR, WUs financed 50% of the cost.

Component 2: Diversification and intensification of irrigated agricultural production
(Actual cost USD182.0 million or 23.6% of Project costs)

The Project financed activities to improve on-farm irrigation systems and on-farm water use
efficiency including lining of irrigation ditches, land leveling, drip irrigation, sprinkler and micro-
sprinkle irrigation and underground drainage. A total of 157,100 ha were benefited by the Project,
comprising 127,300 ha in DR and 29,800 ha in UR, at an average cost of Mx$12,600 per hectare.
A detailed breakdown of the on-farm improvement by year is shown in Table 2.2. The original
target was exceeded by 23%. The Federal government financed 50% of the investment costs and
the balance was financed by the ACU (in the case of the DR) or the SRL (in the case of the UR).

Component 3: Training and institutional development (Actual cost USD31.7 million or
4.1% of Project costs)

Formulation of integrated irrigation investment plans (IIIPs or PDR). Although the PDR were
conceived during the preparation phase as instruments to identify and prioritize structural and
non-structural actions aiming at improving the efficiency of water use and to increase water
productivity, their formulation faced considerable delay due to budgetary constraints and the slow
formation of SRL. At Project completion, a total of 105 PDR were prepared with the active
participation of beneficiaries ­ 83 for DR and 32 for SRL comprising UR in 16 states. At the end
of 2008, the information contained in 57 PDR comprising 2.48 million ha and 416,300 WUs
organized in 342 ACU has been captured in the PDR System (SIPLADIR for its acronym in
Spanish ­ Sistema de Planes Directores de Riego). The SIPLADIR aims at integrating
information of PDR formulated and adopted by all DR. CONAGUA has institutionalized the use
of the PDR for making investment decisions in the sector.

Geographic Information System. Activities under this sub-component were not performed as
conceived during Project design. Instead, CONAGUA extended agreements it had since 2001
with IMTA, Colegio de Post-graduados and the Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo to further
develop and install geographic information systems (GISs) in various DR and UR and train WUs
in their use. The GIS-based applications developed under the Project included: actualization of
users' census, geo-referencing of individual parcels and delimitation of DR and UR boundaries.
The Project financed acquisition of equipment and software and training activities. It is estimated
that 22 DR and UR covering 92,000 ha received support for the development of GIS-based
applications, which are being used as management tools.


                                                  33
Technical and managerial training to water users and CONAGUA staff. The Project provided
four types of training activities: (i) training in cascade ­ capacitación en cascada, (ii) training
targeted to new technicians and directives of SRL and ACU, (iii) specific training to WUs
focusing on operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation systems, and (iv) other events
such as annual congresses, forums and seminars.

With regard to the capacitación en cascada, CONAGUA implemented this progressive training
system in 2001 targeting initially only DR. During the first phase (period 2001-2002), about 460
personnel of CONAGUA were trained as instructors, who in the same period delivered training to
a total of 4,853 WUAs' committee members. The idea behind this progressive scheme was to
maximize the number of WUs trained by training an increasing number of instructors. Thus,
during the period 2004-006, the program was expanded to cover DR and UR and the average
annual numbers of trained WUs increased from 700 to 4,800. In some cases, the training to WUs
was conducted jointly with ANUR. While training was performed primarily by CONAGUA
personal, ACU covered the expenses associated with the transportation, per-diem and hotel
accommodations of the instructors delivering the training and/or the participation of the WUs in
the training activities.

At the time of Project closing, about 20,996 persons were trained (18,367 WUs and 2,629
CONAGUA staff). During the period of the Project, 851 training events were organized for WUs.
A detailed breakdown of training activities and beneficiaries by year is presented in Table 2.3.

Training was delivered on the following themes: irrigation planning and distribution of water;
volumetric allocation; hydrometrics and statistics; maintenance of DR and MR; operation, control
and maintenance of machinery and equipment; weed control; legal framework and by-laws of
ACU and SRL; modernization of irrigation infrastructure; pressurized irrigation; drainage
management; and installation of measuring devices. Training was delivered primarily to members
of the organizing committee of WUAs and SRL, who were expected to communicate essential
information to all WUs. Given the high turnover among Committee members (usually 1-3 years),
there was a need for conducting continuous training. Training was also provided to WUs of UR
regarding the establishment and functioning of SRL. It is estimated that about 2,274 WUs
participated in this activity.

Under this component, the Project also supported the formulation of 46 operation and
maintenance manuals for DR, the full transfer of DR019 Tehuantepec and the partial transfer of
DR003 Tula to WU, and the creation of 27 SRL conforming UR.

Component 4: Project management (Actual incremental cost USD0.5 million or 0.1% of
Project costs)

This component focused on the establishment of mechanisms and systems to facilitate Project
implementation in accordance with the agreed implementation plan and schedule and to ensure
coordination between CONAGUA, the State Governments, and the WUAs. It included three
subcomponents: (i) consultant services for monitoring and evaluation, (ii) acquisition of
equipment, and (iii) financial auditing. Project management was done by CONAGUA staff. The
Financial Resources Management Unit (Gerencia de Financiamiento) of CONAGUA and the
Nacional Financiera (NAFIN) were responsible for overall financial and disbursement aspects,
and the technical coordination was under the responsibility of the General Irrigation Infrastructure
Sub-Division (Subdirección General de Infraestructura Hidro-agrícola) of CONAGUA.

             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic Analysis

During Project preparation a cost-benefit analysis was conducted based on a sample of productive
investments most likely to be demanded by the beneficiaries following the experience of the
earlier projects implemented with Bank assistance in the irrigation sector in Mexico. The PAD
estimated an economic rate of return (ERR) of 20.1%, a benefit-cost (B/C) ratio of 1.325 and a
net present value (NPV) of Mx$2,856.4 million for the Project as a whole. Assumptions
regarding yield increases were conservative. Individual productive investments eligible for
Project support were expected to generate ERRs ranging from 29% to 100%.36

The economic analysis carried out for this ICR confirms the economic viability of the Project
with an overall ERR of 17%, a B/C ratio of 1.29 and a NPV of Mx$2,017 million at full
development. The economic analysis was done with the help of detailed crop budgets and
representative farm models illustrating typical farming situations in 15 DR and 10 UR. The crop
budgets for the pre-existing technology (without the Project) and the new technology (with the
Project) were developed on the basis of statistics of the DR and UR collected by CONAGUA,
annual evaluations of the irrigation programs conducted by IMTA and the Colegio de Post-
graduados, and information contained in the PDR. In some cases, data were obtained directly
from the field. Information was corroborated during the course of focus groups conducted as part
of the ICR. The analysis uses the same assumptions made during the ex-ante evaluation, namely,
a 12% annual discount rate, a 20-year evaluation period, the inclusion of all investment costs, and
operation and maintenance costs equivalent to 1% of the capital outlays.

Economic costs. With regard to the costs, total Project expenditures in Mexican pesos from 2003
to 2008 were converted to 2007 prices using consumer price index published by the Bank of
Mexican. The stream of investment costs in constant 2007 prices is shown in Table 3.1. Since the
costs shown in Table 3.1 were inclusive of taxes, a conversion factor of 0.87 was used to reflect
expenditures net of taxes.

Yields. Table 3.2 presents the average physical crop yields for the "with" and "without" Project
situations in surveyed DR and UR. In this analysis, it is assumed that the increases in yields were
due to the rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation systems (which have increased the
security of water for irrigation), on-farm technological improvements and better technical and
managerial capabilities of WUAs. Given the lack of control group of no-beneficiaries, yield
increases might overstate Project benefits.

Cropping patterns. Cropping patterns for the "with" and "without" Project situations prepared on
the basis of the representative farms are shown in Table 3.3. Some observations are in order. In
the case of the DR, the area under grains experienced a 7% decrease, the area under fodder an 8%
decrease, the area under fruits and vegetables an 8% increase, and the area under cotton a 54%
increase. In the case of the UR, the area under fodder experienced a 3% increase, the area under
grains a 9% decrease, the area under sugarcane a 10% increase, and the area under citrus a 40%

Net financial return per hectare. The net financial returns per hectare above all variable and
production costs for the "with" and "without" Project situations were estimated for the 15 DR and
10 UR based on the representative farm models and crop budgets. The results in constant 2002
prices are presented in Table 3.4. Based on these results, the net returns to land per hectare seem
to have increased by 48% for schemes in DR and by 44% for schemes in UR.

Economic benefits. The following assumptions were made to derive the economic benefits. First,
domestic prices of inputs and outputs were assumed to correspond to their border economic
values. Second both electricity subsidies (about Mx$2,200/ha in the case of UR) and the
PROCAMPO financial support (about Mx$850/ha) were removed from the net financial revenues
for the "with" and "without" Project situations. Third, no further changes in yields and/or
cropping patterns were expected to occur after 2008. Fourth, the weighted average economic
returns were extrapolated to the overall area modernized by the Project (about 308,000 ha in DR
and 119,000 in UR). Fifth, 3% of the sown area was not harvested in both DR and UR. Sixth, a
12% of the area in DR was left idle, which was consistent with current trends. And seventh, the
idle area in UR was reduced from 31% to 19%, between 2003 and 2008, which was also
consistent with annual evaluations conducted by CONAGUA. The resulting annual agricultural
benefits for the "with" and "without" Project situations in constant 2007 prices are presented in
Tables 3.5 and 3.6.

Aggregated benefits and costs. The streams of aggregated benefits and costs used in the
calculation of the internal ERR, B/C ratio and NPV of the overall Project at full development are
presented in Table 3.7. Replacement costs of off-farm investments are included after year 10. The
ERR, the B/C ratio and the NPV at 12% discount rate were estimated at 17%, 1.30 and Mx$2,082
million (in 2007 prices), respectively. These values confirm the economic viability of the
investment.

Financial Analysis

In the case of the financial analysis, the PAD estimated a financial rate of return (FRR) of 50.5%
and a net present value (NPV) of Mx$6217.0 million, assuming a discount rate of return of 12%.
At the time of appraisal, it was estimated that the level of subsidies to be provided under the
Project for the various on-farm and off-farm investments would reach about 50% of the total
investment costs.

The financial analysis carried out for this ICR shows an overall FRR of 47%, a B/C ratio of 2.77
and a NPV of Mx$5,940 million (at a discount rate of 12%). This analysis includes only the
investment costs covered by the users, which represent 32% of the overall financial costs of the
Project. The remaining 68% are subsidies from either the Federal government or the state's
governments. The streams of financial costs and benefits used in this financial analysis are
presented in Table 3.8.

                 Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results
SUMMARY OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY CONDUCTED IN OCTOBER 2007

In October 2007, as part of its MTR evaluation, a perception survey of members of the directive
boards of the ACU and/or SRL of the surveys. The survey indicated that the Project impacts were
substantial. A summary of the key findings from this survey are presented below.

Dissemination of the Project and its benefits

   ·   Interviewed water users knew about the Project and its components and participated in
       the formulation of the PDR. They also shown a good understanding of the content and
       extend of these plans.
   ·   Interviewed water users considered the main problem related to their infrastructure the
       general deteriorated stage of main channels and control structures, followed by the
       conveyance and distribution losses caused by the low efficiency of the irrigation system.
   ·   Interviewed water users reported to have contributed 50% of the investment costs, and in
       40% of the DR, the users were supported by the state governments. In no DR, users
       received direct support from municipal governments to co-finance their contribution.

Structural actions supported by the Project

   ·   The structural actions mentioned more often by the interviewed water users were lining
       of channels and rehabilitation of control structures, followed by piping and rehabilitation
       of measurement stations.
   ·   All DR acquired maintenance (or conservation) machinery.
   ·   In 85% of the DR, there existed pressurized irrigation systems.
   ·   In only 50% of the DR, land leveling and actions to improve saline soils took place.
   ·   Interviewed farmers knew well the procurement procedures and participated in the
       process and the supervision of the works.

Factors associated with agriculture production

   ·   Water users made mostly use of technical assistance provided by input retailers. All
       interviewed water users indicated having included specialized technical assistance within
       their PDR.
   ·   In 30% of the DR, promotional programs for agricultural diversification and reconversion
       (to high-value crops) took place and actual diversification/reconversion was assessed as
       incipient. Interviewed water users expressed high interest in this type of programs but
       indicated to know very little about specific programs that provide financial support.
   ·   Interviewed water users indicated that livestock has acquired great relevance, and in
       many cases, it is the main economic activity.
   ·   Interviewed water users reported low prices of agriculture commodities and delays in
       obtaining technical support for commercialization as the main problems faced.
   ·   Interviewed water users reported the existence of warehouses, storage facilities and agro-
       industries in some of the regions where the DR are located.




                                                50
Operational, maintenance and administration aspects

   ·   About 90% of the interviewed water users mentioned that their associations delivered
       irrigation water on time, and indicated this to be the reason why no major problems have
       been reported in the distribution of water to the level of the parcel.
   ·   About 90% of the interviewed farmers acknowledged that their association does not
       conduct adequate measurement of the water delivered since the modules do not have
       measuring devices at the level of the parcel.
   ·   In 100% of the associations, paying for the services before the water is delivered was
       reported as a common practice. Almost no association provided credit for the services.
   ·   About 85% of the interviewed farmers indicated that the fee charged by the association is
       adequate and the fee represents the "self-financing" budget according to the concession
       title.
   ·   In 80% of the associations, the service fee was assessed according to the number of
       hectares irrigated, and in the remaining 20%, the fee was assessed according to the
       volume of water delivered.
   ·   In 90% of the associations, interviewed farmers mentioned that their metering and control
       structures were deteriorated or out of services.
   ·   In 100% of the associations, interviewed farmers included the rehabilitation and
       modernization of their metering and control structures as well as the installation of
       measuring devices in their parcels in their PDR.

   Non-structural actions and strengthening of the organizations

   ·   All associations reported to have participated in the capacity building activities and
       acknowledged CONAGUA and ANUR as the intuitions that provided the training.
   ·   Water users reported to have paid no fee for the training programs. The associations in
       turn reported to have contributed in the organization of the courses by covering the travel
       costs of the instructors.
   ·   About 40% of the associations have sent their employees to training courses outside the
       courses sponsored by CONAGUA.
   ·   All interviewed water users indicated to have received training in the non-structural
       actions included in the PDR.
   ·   All interviewed water users mentioned that the support received has influenced in
       obtaining higher yields and higher profits, and confirmed to have received financial
       returns from the activity implemented.
   ·   About 95% of the interviewed farmers confirmed that the modernization promoted
       improved water use and indicated to be satisfied with the results obtained, with the
       quality of the works, and acknowledged that more still needs to be done.
   ·   About 98% of the interviewed farmers confirmed to be satisfied with the preparation of
       the PDR, and actions included. They also indicated that the consulting assisting them in
       the elaboration of the PDR conducted a detailed evaluation and analysis with the users in
       the preparation of the PDR.

Perceptions about the impacts of the Project

   ·   Interviewed water users linked the modernization and rehabilitation of the irrigation
       systems with the higher crop yields. They acknowledged the benefits of the support
       received.


                                               51
    ·   The capitalization of the WUAs was reported as one of the main benefits of the transfer
        and the strengthening of their institutional capacity.
    ·   Interviewed farmers linked the improvements in their living conditions and their
        wellbeing to the support received.

SUMMARY OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY CONDUCTED IN APRIL-MAY 2008

Knowledge about the Project

About 92% the interviewed water users in the DR indicated to have knowledge about the project,
and to have participated in its implementation. In the case of the UR-SRL, only 34% indicated to
have knowledge about the Project and only 28% reported to have participated in its
implementation.

Knowledge about the benefits of the Project and the contribution of the users

About 92% of the interviewed water users in DR reported to have knowledge about the works
supported by the Project and to know their level of financial contribution. In the case of the UR-
SRL, only half of the interviewed water users reported to know the benefits of the Project and to
know their level of contribution.

Knowledge about the PDR

About 70% and 53% of the interviewed water users in the DR and UR-SRL, respectively,
indicated to have participated in the formulation of the PDR, to know the final document and its
characteristics.

Awareness about the problems faced with water availability

About 65% and 95% of the interviewed water users in the DR and UR-SRL, respectively,
indicated to be aware of the problems faced by their association with the availability of water
resources. About 93% and 66% in the DR and UR-SRL, respectively, indicated to know of an
action supported by the Project to improve the situation.

Water users benefiting directly by the Project

About 40% of the interviewed water users in the DR indicated to have directly benefited from the
on-farm irrigation improvements, and an additional 9% indicated to have benefited from
communal works. The perception of the water users regarding water use efficiency is that it has
improved on average by 25.6%.

In the case of the UR-SRL, about 75% of the interviewed water users indicated to have directly
benefited from the on-farm irrigation improvements and communal works. The perception of the
water users regarding water use efficiency is that it has improved on average by 24%.

In the case of the DR, about 42% of the water users acquired on-farm irrigation systems or
leveled their land to improve in-field applications. About 33% reported that the water cost was
reduced on average by 16.7%.



                                               52
In the case of the UR-SRL, about 75% of the water users acquired on-farm irrigation systems or
leveled their land to improve in-field applications. They also reported that the water cost was
reduced on average by 14%.

Systems installed to improve in-field applications

About 42% and 49% of the water users in DR and UR-SRL, respectively, reported to have
installed pressurized systems, namely drip irrigation. Of the other gravity irrigation technologies,
40% of the users in DR favored land leveling and piping and 28% favored multi sluice-gates
(multicompuerta).

Improved on-farm irrigation and crop shifting

Although 39% and 52% of interviewed water users in the DR and UR-SRL, respectively, reported
improvements in-field application, and 28% and 19% reported interest to shift to diversify their
crops, only 8% and 11% actually did it. The majority retained their traditional crops and
mentioned to know little about the production and commercialization of vegetables and other
high-value crops.

Capacity building

In the case of the DR, about 62% of the interviewed water users reported to be aware of the
training activities provided by CONAGUA, while 43% reported to be aware of the training
activities provided by ACU.

In the case of the UR-SRL, about 23% of the interviewed water users reported to be aware of the
training activities provided by CONAGUA, while 24% reported to be aware of the training
activities provided by ACU.

Factors that impacted the implementation of the Project

The main problems reported by the interviewed water users (both DR and UR-SRL) in relation to
the implementation of the works had to do with the limited funds from the federal and state
governments and their limited financial capacity to cover their contribution (50% required by the
Project). They also indicated that without government support, it would be impossible to make
improvements in the irrigation systems.

An additional factor reported by the water users in UR-SRL relates to the limited organizational
capacity of the SRL and small size of plots.

Quality of the works

About 65% of the interviewed water users indicated that the quality of the Works was satisfactory
and only 3% reported that it was unsatisfactory.

Migration

In general terms, the interviewed water users perceived that the migration from rural areas to
urban areas remains the same. Some reported that they needed to migrate to the city to work and
save money to later be used to participate in the Project.

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR

Objetivos

El principal objetivo del PMIR fue el de contribuir a lograr la viabilidad del sector de riego en
México y elevar los niveles de bienestar de los usuarios, mediante el mejoramiento de la
eficiencia en el uso del agua y el incremento de la productividad agrícola de riego, utilizando una
estrategia integrada que se vincule a la demanda de los beneficiarios, con mecanismos que
aseguren la participación coordinada de instituciones y usuarios. Los mecanismos para lograrlo
fueron: (i) mejorar la productividad del agua, la tierra y la infraestructura en los sistemas de riego,
mediante la reconversión productiva, la tecnificación, rehabilitación, conservación adecuada y
uso eficiente de la infraestructura, con criterios de sostenibilidad ambiental; (ii) apoyar el
fortalecimiento y la consolidación de las organizaciones de usuarios en los DR y UR; y (iii)
fortalecer la capacidad institucional de la CONAGUA y las instituciones locales, para el
desempeño coordinado de sus funciones en los DR y UR.

Componentes

Para la implementación del Programa, fueron formulados y estructurados las siguientes
componentes que incorporan las diversas acciones necesarias en su desarrollo: (i) modernización
y rehabilitación de DR y UR; (ii) reconversión e intensificación de la producción bajo riego; (iii)
desarrollo institucional; y (iv) gestión del Programa.

Operación del Programa

El PMIR agrupó el conjunto de programas hidroagrícolas operados por la CONAGUA, que se
ocupan de impulsar los trabajos de rehabilitación y modernización de los DR y UR, tanto bajo su
modalidad de ejecución federalizada, mediante transferencia de recursos a los Gobiernos
Estatales para ser operados en los Fideicomisos de Fomento Agropecuario Estatal, en los cuales
hay una participación CONAGUA 50% y Estados, Municipio y/o Usuarios 50% de la inversión,
como aquellos programas que ejecuta directamente la CONAGUA, que abarcaron gran parte de
las acciones de desarrollo institucional y gestión del programa, así como componentes de obra en
algunos DR no transferidos totalmente y los afectados por prolongadas sequías. La operación del
Programa en la etapa en la cual aún no se habían elaborado los PDR, se ajustó a los Planes de
Acción en el caso de los DR y en los Diagnósticos Conjuntos para las UR.

Así pues, el PMIR comprendió la operación de los siguientes programas de inversión:

    ·    Programa Alianza para el Campo (PAC): (i) Rehabilitación y Modernización de DR; (ii)
         Desarrollo Parcelario en DR; (iii) Uso Eficiente del Agua y la Energía Eléctrica en UR; y
         (iv) Uso Pleno de la Infraestructura Hidroagrícola en UR.
    ·    Ejercicio Directo: (i) Rehabilitación y Modernización de DR; (ii) Uso Sustentable del
         Agua en la Cuenca del Río Bravo; y (iii) Uso Sustentable del Agua en la Cuenca Lerma-
         Chapala.

Posteriormente se incorporaron los siguientes programas por medio de ejercicio directo: (i)
Medidores en Fuentes de Abastecimiento; y (ii) conservación y operación de DR.




                                                  56
Con lo anterior se buscó consolidar los procesos de modernización y tecnificación de la
agricultura bajo riego que se habían venido dando a través de la operación de los programas
señalados y de la participación de los usuarios de DR y UR organizados en ACU y en su caso, en
SRL, induciendo una más estrecha relación con los programas de apoyo a la producción,
integración de cadenas de producción y comercialización, entre otros, que opera la SAGARPA.
El Programa se planteó en un inicio con la participación de la SAGARPA en acciones de
reconversión de la producción bajo riego, sin embargo, esta dependencia decidió no participar
formalmente, de tal manera que su intervención, se concretó a través de los componentes del PAC
que son de su responsabilidad.

Cumplimiento de los objetivos

La modernización de la infraestructura de riego existente para promover un uso más eficiente del
agua de riego en el marco de los PDR. Se obtuvieron logros muy satisfactorios en cuanto a la
modernización de la infraestructura de riego con una consecuente mejora en la eficiencia en el
uso del agua. Las metas físicas cuantitativas de esta componente fueron alcanzadas en la mitad
del tiempo esperado. La modernización y la rehabilitación de la infraestructura de conducción y
distribución del agua, así como la adopción de sistemas modernos de aplicación de riego
parcelario, con un enfoque de complementariedad, fortaleció el manejo integral y sustentable del
agua en los proyectos ejecutados en los DR y UR. En alguna medida el Programa logró
encaminar las acciones de modernización reguladas mediante una mejor gestión integral del agua,
y promovió la adopción de instrumentos de control, herramientas y sistemas que permiten otorgar
un mejor servicio de riego a los usuarios y operar el agua con mayor eficiencia.

Incrementar la productividad de la agricultura de riego y la diversificación hacia cultivos de alto
valor. Los logros alcanzados referentes a la reconversión hacia cultivos de alto valor son poco
satisfactorios. No se definieron metas cuantitativas ni cualitativas, por lo que no existió una base
para comparar en todo caso el avance en el objetivo de reconversión de la producción. Las
acciones tendientes a la conversión de la producción tuvieron que haber sido acompasadas con un
componente específico para subsidiar mas allá de la modernización y la rehabilitación de la
infraestructura, el fortalecimiento organizacional y empresarial de los usuarios, y afianzado con
acciones que fomentaran el comercio (la comercialización), el acceso a mercados y nichos,
acceso a financiamiento, etc. Fue evidente la falta de coordinación con la SAGARPA, para
complementar las acciones de modernización, con acciones de fomento productivo, y sin
embargo, la sola tecnificación y modernización, de alguna forma logró inducir al usuarios para
adoptar otros tipos de tecnologías y de prácticas de producción con los cuales se han obtenido
mejores rendimientos.

Consolidar la transferencia de la infraestructura de riego a los usuarios del agua. La
transferencia es una política del Gobierno con más de 16 años de proceso. Prácticamente el 90%
de la infraestructura que domina la totalidad de la superficie de los DR fue transferida antes de
1998 y actualmente la transferencia como tal, se encuentra al 99% en el caso de los DR. En el
caso de las UR se logró integrar a un número considerable de Unidades en ACU o en SRL.
Durante el periodo de implementación del PMIR, la CONAGUA continuó con el Programa de
Transferencia de los DR, logrando concluir parte de los pendientes. En el periodo de ejecución se
logró concluir con la transferencia del DR 019, Tehuantepec y se avanzó al 50% en el proceso en
el DR 003, Tula, prácticamente el último Distrito que falta por transferir completamente. Por otra
parte, la CONAGUA fortaleció y apresuró el proceso de organización de las UR, proceso que
comprende la integración de las ACU y de las SRL. Este va caminando con resultados
importantes y con la clara disposición y convencimiento de los usuarios de las UR para
organizarse, visto que para fines de operación de la infraestructura, para realizar una mejor


                                                57
gestión y lograr acuerdos que, les beneficia a los usuarios fungir como Asociaciones y
Sociedades. Durante la ejecución del PMIR, la CONAGUA mantuvo y mantiene funciones
permanentes de seguimiento y supervisión de las ACU conformadas y vigila el desempeño de las
mismas. La Comisión promovió acciones concretas en apoyo a la transferencia y a la
consolidación de la misma, como la capacitación a los directivos y usuarios y asesoría y
supervisión técnica de la reglamentación de los DR, de las ACU, y para la conformación de SRL.

Consolidar institucionalmente las organizaciones de los usuarios del agua para realzar su
participación en la operación y mantenimiento de la infraestructura de riego así como en
decisiones de inversión. Durante el periodo de ejecución del Programa se desarrollaron
instrumentos de gestión integral y se adoptaron instrumentos y herramientas que coadyuvaron
para lograr un mejor control de la gestión del agua, como los SIG, sin embargo, estos
instrumentos tuvieron una difusión limitada. La capacitación a directivos fue un factor interesante
que propone la continuidad en la gestión de las Asociaciones. En ese aspecto, se logró una
sinergia con asociaciones civiles (ONG'S) como la Asociación Nacional de Usuarios del riego
(ANUR), o la Asociación Nacional de Especialistas en Irrigación quienes han tenido una
participación activa en los programas de capacitación, a través de eventos como, simposios,
conferencias y congreso. La CONAGUA mantuvo, durante la ejecución del Programa, una
comunicación importante con centros e instituciones de investigación como el Instituto Mexicano
de Tecnología del Agua (IMTA), o con el Colegio de Postgraduados (COLPOS) y diversas
universidades regionales, quienes ejecutaron en convenios varios estudios importantes
relacionados con el desarrollo de herramientas de gestión, en el nivel institucional como en el
ámbito de las Asociaciones de Usuarios, en DR y UR.

Consolidar el sistema de recuperación (cobro) de los costos de la operación y de capital. Las
acciones relacionadas con el proceso de consolidación institucional implicaron desarrollar a las
organizaciones con base en el reforzamiento de las herramientas de gestión disponibles. La
sustentabilidad de las acciones y obras de modernización se fundamenta en el grado de
consolidación y de solidez que alcancen las organizaciones, como administradoras y gestoras de
los sistemas de riego. En ese sentido, se observaron importantes logros, debido a que el proceso
de transferencia en los DR alcanzó un nivel de mayor madurez y el proceso de desarrollo de las
organizaciones impulsado por la CONAGUA, tuvo mayor dinamismo, a través de los programas
de apoyo que repercuten en la consolidación de las ACU.

Establecer un sistema integral de supervisión y evaluación del Programa. La CONAGUA
ejecuta en todos los niveles, actividades de monitoreo y de evaluación de los programas
ejecutados por la institución en el marco del PAC mediante convenios realizados con
instituciones de investigación y mantiene directamente en los DR y en las Direcciones Locales,
en el caso de las UR, las funciones de supervisión: de la ejecución de obras y del desempeño y
actuación de las Organizaciones de Usuarios. El PMIR contribuyó para que un parte de la
CONAGUA, trabajara y colaborara más de forma integrada en su ejecución, en las áreas de
ejecución en los DR y UR, en la relación con la organización y participación de los usuarios en
los procesos de planeación a través de los PDR. Por lo que se refiere al monitoreo de la gestión
del Programa, la CONAGUA, contó con la Subgerencia de gestión y Evaluación de Proyectos
con Crédito Externo, que demostró una alta capacidad y probidad técnica en la gestión de
programas financiados parcialmente con crédito externo. Las operaciones administrativas y de
control de los desembolsos, así como de auditorías, contrataciones y otras asignaciones,
recuperaciones y de supervisión. La estrategia adoptada de evaluación y seguimiento en global,
debe ser considerado satisfactorio, pues se probó, a pesar de la ausencia de un sistema específico,
la capacidad institucional para realizar la supervisión, evaluar y dar seguimiento a los programas
financiados con crédito externo y de "ejecución normal", y si bien la implementación de esos


                                                58
procesos de seguimiento no es específica para el PMIR, los sistemas vigentes implementados por
la CONAGUA cumplen muy efectivamente con los fines de evaluación y seguimiento de la
gestión, no así para los fines de evaluación de impactos del PMIR.

Logros concretos

De la modernización y rehabilitación de los sistemas de riego

    ·   El avance logrado en términos de ejecución de las inversiones programadas rebasó el
        100%, por lo que se considera muy satisfactorio el cumplimiento del objetivo en cuanto a
        la modernización de la infraestructura de riego con una consecuente mejora en la
        eficiencia en el uso del agua.

    ·   Las metas físicas cuantitativas de esta componente se alcanzaron en la mitad del tiempo
        esperado,.

    ·   La modernización y la rehabilitación de la infraestructura de conducción y distribución
        del agua, así como la adopción de sistemas modernos de aplicación de riego parcelario,
        con un objetivo integral, fortaleció el manejo completo y sustentable del agua.

    ·   En alguna medida el Programa logró encaminar las acciones de modernización reguladas
        mediante una mejor gestión integral del agua, y promovió la adopción de instrumentos de
        control, herramientas y sistemas que permiten otorgar un mejor servicio de riego a los
        usuarios y operar el agua con mayor eficiencia.

Por lo que respecta a la reconversión y fortalecimiento de la competitividad de la agricultura de
riego:

    ·   El cumplimiento de este objetivo es poco satisfactorio, específicamente en lo que se
        refiere a la reconversión hacia cultivos de alto valor, pues por la naturaleza técnica del
        PMIR, hicieron falta programas de acompañamiento y la participación de SAGARPA,
        con sus programas de fomento a la reconversión. Las acciones tendientes a la conversión
        de la producción deben ser acompañadas con un componente específico que incluya
        apoyos mas allá de la modernización y la rehabilitación de la infraestructura, con un
        enfoque de complementación, para el fortalecimiento de la organización empresarial de
        los usuarios, y afianzado con acciones que fomenten el comercio, el acceso a mercados y
        nichos, acceso a financiamiento, etc.

    ·   Para el cumplimiento se hizo evidente la falta de coordinación con la SAGARPA, para
        complementar las acciones de modernización, con acciones de fomento productivo, y sin
        embargo, la sola tecnificación y modernización, de alguna forma logra inducir al usuarios
        a la adopción de otros tipos de tecnologías y de prácticas de producción que logran la
        obtención de mejores rendimientos.

    ·   Como lo muestran las distintas evaluaciones revisadas de los programas de
        modernización a cargo de la CONAGUA, ejecutadas: de los análisis técnicos se observó
        una tendencia indudable a la mejoría, fueron la base para mejorar la productividad del
        agua y de la tierra en la agricultura con riego, medida en pesos por metro cúbico y
        toneladas por hectárea, respectivamente.




                                               59
Con respecto de la consolidación de las organizaciones:

    ·   Casi concluido el desarrollo del proceso de la transferencia en los DR, la CONAGUA
        privilegió acciones orientadas a la consolidación de las organizaciones mediante acciones
        de capacitación y de fortalecimiento de la gestión del agua a través de la promoción de
        sistemas y herramientas que permitieron realizar una mejor operación, medir y llevar
        mejor control de la gestión de la organización y de la operación, en general.

    ·   En suma, la modernización y rehabilitación de la Infraestructura transferida ha sido
        importante, de tal forma que contribuyó a la consolidación de la transferencia de la
        infraestructura a los usuarios, fortaleció la confianza de los usuarios en la organización y
        promovió la adopción de sistemas integrales de gestión y medición.

Sustenabilidad esperada y plan futuro

La CONAGUA, aun cuando concluyó el financiamiento de PMIR, mantendrá el cumplimiento de
los objetivos del Programa ya que no solo están contenidos en el Plan Nacional de Desarrollo y
por lo tanto en el Plan Nacional Hidráulico 2006-2012, sino también sus tareas se han constituido
en actividades cotidianas para el cumplimiento de objetivos institucionales. Esto es quizá el
mayor de los resultados del PMIR pues continuará su ejecución con los programas presupuestales
de la Subdirección General de Infraestructura Hidroagrícola, que fueron los que enmarcaron la
actuación de los objetivos y estrategias del PMIR. Se espera que con las acciones realizadas con
el PMIR, sirva de detonante de acciones que logren fortalecer la participación efectiva de los
beneficiarios en todo el proceso de maduración del Programa, quienes han contribuido con
recursos en el financiamiento de las obras, y participan en los programas de capacitación.

El programa o las acciones de modernización se verán frenadas, sino no se contempla fomentar
en los usuarios un cambio de mentalidad, proclive al desarrollo organizacional e incorporar a la
par, sistemas de gestión que favorezcan la capitalización de las organizaciones. En el logro de la
sustentabilidad esperada deberán incorporarse otros agentes involucrados en el desarrollo de las
organizaciones ya que, en último término son las AU quienes han alcanzado niveles importantes
de desarrollo, si bien diferenciado, manifestando su grado de tecnificación, de capitalización, de
gestión en general y de desarrollo empresarial.

Esta diferenciación implica que los requerimientos de acciones de fortalecimiento son distintos
para cada caso y de ello se deduce que las acciones de modernización impactaron de forma
distinta de acuerdo al nivel de cada DR o UR. Sin embargo, con el PMIR se evidenció que las
organizaciones lograron niveles de capitalización que permiten llevar a cabo una gestión efectiva;
al menos en una gran parte de las organizaciones encuestadas.

Competitividad de la actividad agrícola

Deberá implementarse políticas públicas del sector agropecuario que permitan coadyuvar al logro
de la competividad agrícola en forma integral, que no fue atendida totalmente por el Programa,
por la participación de las acciones de SAGARPA y que puede afectar en el corto plazo la
sustentabilidad, y se refiere a la implementación conjunta de programas de acompañamiento que
coadyuven en la consolidación de los procesos de producción, de financiamiento, desarrollo de
proyectos integrales, estrategias para conformar microempresas, acceso a otras fuentes de
financiamiento, apoyos efectivos para la comercialización o infraestructura para ello y apoyo para
la capacitación empresarial en general.



                                                60
La observación general es que de no lograrse una estrategia integral de acompañamiento a la
modernización no se avanzará en los procesos de competitividad. Por tanto es necesaria a
concurrencia de todos los agentes que incluyen en el desarrollo, a través de la política pública,
para cumplir con lo dispuesto en el PND. Es necesario que se desplieguen más herramientas
técnicas con un enfoque en los individuos para impactar en las organizaciones. Es decir que para
dar sustentabilidad a los programas hoy, es imprescindible otorgar el valor y el reconocimiento al
individuo procurando al tiempo, el desarrollo de las organizaciones.

Para lograr sustentabilidad de las inversiones, sin embargo, son necesarios cambios y acciones
adicionales, pues existen temas particulares y situaciones que presentan mayor dificultad y que
requieren ser atendidos en el proceso de madurez del programa.

Estas situaciones particulares presentan retos en sí mismos. De estos destacan: (i) convencimiento
del gobierno federal de que es necesario implementar mecanismos de coordinación de los
programas y recursos federales y estatales para maximizar los beneficios esperados; (ii) mediante
incentivos procurar incrementar la participación económica de los productores, conforme a las
reglas de operación de los diferentes programas presupuestales, con el fin de obtener los
beneficios esperados en tiempos menores; (iii) promover con más eficacia la participación
económica de los gobiernos estatales y municipales, para la realización de las obras necesarias;
(iv) impulsar nuevos esquemas financieros que permitan eficientar técnicamente y
financieramente la ejecución de nuevos proyectos; mas allá de las propuestas de los bancos de
segundo piso y de los esquemas conocidos que han generado resultados limitados y selectivos --
es decir, se requiere implementar un verdadero esquema creativo de financiamiento privado de
proyectos basado en instrumentos de ingeniería financiera, orientado en la participación colectiva,
con fondos de garantía, creación instrumentos de participación, etc. aprovechando las sociedades
constituidas (SRL) que tienen soporte de capital; (v) redimensionar las zonas de riego en función
de la disponibilidad de agua; y financiar proyectos alternativos para los usuarios que cedan sus
derechos de uso de agua; (vi) fortalecer las organizaciones de productores agrícolas, promoviendo
mas la capacitación en las ACU con una orientación empresarial; (vii) que la federación convenga
mayor intervención de los gobiernos estatales para que apoyen en la solución de problemas
sociales y políticos que se presenten en el ámbito hidroagrícola; y (viii) fortalecer al individuo,
incrementado sus capacidades y promoviendo acciones de acompañamiento que fomenten la
actividad empresarial.

Desempeño del Banco

El BIRF participó conjuntamente con el gobierno de México a través de la CONAGUA, en el
proceso de concepción, integración y puesta en marcha del Programa, pero principalmente
propició la concepción desde el punto de vista técnico para sustentar la viabilidad de las acciones
propuestas, con apoyo de recursos para la contratación de estudios específicos y consultores
propios y externos. Fueron aplicados conocimientos importantes rescatados de lecciones
aprendidas, reforzadas con la experiencia de la implementación de los programas precedentes, en
particular del Sectorial de riego y Drenaje y del Programa de Desarrollo Parcelario.

Durante la etapa de ejecución del Programa, la función más importante del BIRF fue realizar
actividades de evaluación y seguimiento, con la debilidad de no reorientar las acciones
correspondientes a la SAGARPA.

Cabe mencionar que durante el desarrollo del Programa, se dio el cambio del Oficial del
Programa por parte del BIRF, y no obstante, se observó continuidad en el desempeño del Banco,
y por consiguiente en la implementación del Programa. Es importante destacar que el nuevo


                                                61
Oficial del Programa, aportó una visión propia de gestión integral del agua, lo que dio por
enriquecer el contexto estratégico de integralidad en el manejo del agua de riego, en el marco del
uso sustentable que promueve CONAGUA, sin considerar la participación de la SAGARPA en el
mismo.

Derivado de nuestro análisis destacan los siguientes aspectos: (i) el BIRF aceptó la flexibilización
establecida en el MOP para los diferentes procesos de adquisición, lo que permitió una operación
ágil, eficaz y oportuna; (ii) en la etapa de preparación, promovió asistencia técnica de expertos y
elaboración de estudios especiales; (iii) orientó sus políticas de desarrollo en el mismo sentido de
las políticas públicas nacionales evitando conflictos; y (iv) se pudo implementar un Programa de
manera exitosa en virtud de que se adecuaron a los diferentes programas existentes en la
CONAGUA para el ejercicio y/o ejecución del PMIR.

Desempeño del Agente Financiero (Nacional Financiera, S.N.C.).

La SHCP designó a NAFIN como Agente Financiero del gobierno federal y por mandato se le
designaron las actividades de asesoría, supervisión y seguimiento en el ciclo integral del
Proyecto, desde la identificación. Preparación, evaluación Ex-ante, Negociación, Ejecución
(bienes, obras y servicios), Desembolsos, Auditorías y revisión Ex-post. Derivado de la
calificación otorgada por el BIRF a la CONAGUA, en su capacidad institucional para la
ejecución de proyectos con financiamiento del BIRF, se simplificaron los procesos
administrativos de ejecución como son las adquisiciones, por lo que no hubo la necesidad de una
supervisión tan estrecha por parte del Agente Financiero. En lo que se refiere al proceso de
desembolsos NAFIN tramitó 34 solicitudes de conformidad con los gastos aceptables y
autorizados en las categorías de inversión correspondientes, sin hacer comentarios al respecto.
NAFIN dio trámite oportuno a los compromisos contractuales, informes de seguimiento
financiero e informes semestrales.

Desempeño del Organismo Ejecutor (CONAGUA)

La coordinación del PMIR se conformó, utilizando la estructura organizacional y de personal de
la CONAGUA. La coordinación general en términos administrativos estuvo a cargo de la ex
Gerencia de Financiamiento hoy Gerencia de Recursos Financieros teniendo también la
responsabilidad de las relaciones con el BIRF y el Agente Financiero. La coordinación técnica
quedó a cargo de la GDR quien se encargo de las relaciones con las diversas Gerencias de la
Subdirección General de Infraestructura Hidroagrícola. La Revisión expost de los procesos de
contratación establecida en el MOP permitió el ejercicio rápido y expedito del préstamo. La
CONAGUA es considerada como una de las agencias ejecutoras de programas financiados con
recursos del BIRF, con mejor desempeño en contrataciones, al conseguir que los organismos de
cuenca y direcciones locales mantengan un alto grado de uniformidad en la realización de
contrataciones con financiamiento del Banco.

Lecciones aprendidas

    ·   Los PDR demostraron ser una herramienta trascendente ya que los usuarios participaron
        y entendieron la importancia de la planeación y de la programación en un esquema
        metodológico novedoso.
    ·   Los aciertos importantes del Programa se conjugan en los conceptos de "integración" y
        "participación".




                                                62
·   El concepto de modernización toma relevancia a través del Programa, demostrando ser el
    instrumento, mediante el cual se lograrán los objetivos sobre uso sustentable del agua del
    gobierno; objetivos descritos en el Programa Nacional Hídrico.
·   Se demostró que los usuarios conocen a fondo la problemática propia y han alcanzado un
    grado de madurez tal, para expresar sus propias necesidades, que su intervención en la
    toma de decisiones en cuanto a los planes futuros de desarrollo de sus DR y Unidades fue
    muy importante y considerada por las autoridades.
·   La CONAGUA cimentó o consolidó los procesos de gestión, conjuntando esfuerzos de
    los recursos humanos disponibles y logró un compromiso hacia el Programa de todas las
    áreas ejecutoras en el nivel nacional. Esto se ha traducido en un alto nivel de eficacia en
    la ejecución de los programas o sub-proyectos y de todas las obras en su conjunto.
·   Se demostró que la Capacitación ha logrado promover conocimientos a los usuarios,
    tanto en temas técnicos como en sistemas de gestión integral, lo que ha repercutido en un
    proceso de crecimiento más acelerado en las organizaciones (de desarrollo organizativo).
·   Quedó evidenciado que un programa de desarrollo técnico y tecnológico, sin un
    programa paralelo de desarrollo centrado en el desarrollo; los individuos, en las
    organizaciones y las inversiones realizadas pierden sustentabilidad.
·   En cuanto a los funcionarios del BIRF, el propio Banco, deberá cuidar la manera en la
    que realiza los cambios de los mismos, con el propósito de que se le hubiera dado
    continuidad a los compromisos originalmente planteados, sobre todo en la ejecución del
    componente 2 del Programa.
·   En próximos programas no se deberán incluir componentes que incorporen a ejecutores
    que no estén en la mesa de negociación.
·   Para lograr un mayor impacto en los objetivos planteados, es necesario contar con una
    estrategia de acompañamiento con otras instituciones.
·   La planeación conjunta entre autoridad y usuarios fortaleció la vinculación entre ambos;
    cuyos efectos se plasmaron en el logro de acuerdos más fluidos sobre las inversiones
    necesarias para los DR y UR y la toma de decisiones más eficaz.
·   A decir de los usuarios, su inclusión en la toma de decisiones durante el proceso de
    formulación de los PDR, propició en ellos un mayor grado de conciencia sobre los
    impactos de la rehabilitación y modernización y un sentido de corresponsabilidad con la
    CONAGUA.
·   Los PDR resultaron ser una herramienta que favoreció el establecimiento de metas sobre
    una base sólida, reduciendo el nivel de incertidumbre.
·   El fortalecimiento institucional de las Organizaciones de Usuarios, fue parte esencial para
    el desarrollo del sector agrícola de riego.
·   Se mejoró sustancialmente en el aspecto de la asistencia técnica para la selección de
    tecnología apropiada, con la participación activa de los productores. Hecho que se
    convirtió en un elemento trascendental del Programa, el cual tuvo como uno de sus
    objetivos el mejorar la competitividad de los cultivos regados.
·   La CONAGUA es una entidad con bastante experiencia y uno de los mejores ejecutores
    con programas financiados con Crédito Externo.
·   Se le otorgó la confianza a la CONAGUA por la experiencia obtenida con otros
    préstamos, por parte del BIRF para revisión ­Ex-post del Programa.
·   El esquema de ejecución a la demanda aplicado al PMIR fue una experiencia exitosa, ya
    que la participación de los beneficiarios tanto en el proceso de programación y ejecución
    de las acciones, como la inversión, contribuyó al buen desarrollo y a un ejercicio más
    eficiente de los recursos.
·   La simplificación de los procesos de adquisiciones por parte del Banco, permitió una
    ejecución rápida y oportuna del programa.
