risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: modernization of irrigation\n            infrastructure and on-farm technology improvements is a\n            necessary but not sufficient condition to increase\n            competitiveness in irrigated agriculture. Irrigation\n            improvement interventions need to be accompanied by actions\n            that support farmers and producers, particularly the small\n            ones, in the areas of organization, financial management and\n            commercialization. Modernization of irrigation projects,\n            particularly within the DR a (Irrigation Districts or\n            Distritos de Riego) and UR (Irrigation Units or Unidades de\n            Riego) located in over-exploited aquifers and/or\n            over-allocated surface water resources, should be done\n            within an integral water resources management framework,\n            where the water balance, the availability of the resource,\n            and other users including environmental water needs are\n            taken into account. Particularly crucial for the\n            optimization of benefits that could be derived from\n            water-saving technologies is the provision of technical\n            assistance to farmers as a complement to the on-farm\n            investments for at least the first agriculture-year. Since\n            the project appears to have benefited the already better-off\n            farmers and/or agricultural producers, the greater project\n            absorption by small farmers and producers will require\n            special targeting mechanisms, implicit eligibility criteria\n            and special financial terms to participate. Since irrigation\n            modernization and technological improvements are\n            medium-term, it is necessary to ensure that these programs\n            and multiannual, so unnecessary delays are avoided."}, "docdt": "2010-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
