irrigated\n            agriculture and the efficiency of irrigation water use, in\n            both Irrigation Districts (Distritos de Riego, DR) and\n            Irrigation Units (Unidudes de Riego, UR), that would include\n            the development of partnerships between the public and\n            private sectors as well as effective institutional\n            collaboration within the public sector, plus the\n            strengthening of a demand-driven approach to investment\n            decisions and financing. The project has the following four\n            components: Component 1) will finance demand-driven\n            investment sub-projects aimed at improving the efficiency of\n            water distribution to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation\n            infrastructure as well as to improve conservation and\n            maintenance machinery and equipment within the framework of\n            IIIPs. Component 2) will support demand-driven investments\n            subprojects prepared by water users in irrigation districts\n            (DR) and irrigation units (UR), within the framework of\n            IIIPs, and presented to their respective local project\n            authorities for financing. Under this component, the\n            project, through CNA will provide technical and financial\n            assistance to beneficiaries to improve on-farm irrigation\n            systems and water use efficiency, but at the same time,\n            through an agreement with SAGARPA, project beneficiaries\n            would receive financial support and technical assistance\n            from the ongoing government program Alianza Contigo to\n            increase agricultural productivity, diversify production and\n            improve their marketing capabilities. Component 3) the\n            objective is to strengthen water users' associations\n            and improve their technical, managerial and financial\n            capabilities to administer and operate their respective\n            irrigation systems as well as participate in the decision\n            making process regarding Integrated Irrigation Modernization\n            Project (PMIR) investment financing. Component 4) A Project\n            Coordinating System (PCS) will be established within\n            National Water Commission (CNA's) General Irrigation\n            Infrastructure Sub-Division (Subdireccion General de\n            Infraestructura Hidroagricola, SGIH). Its main\n            responsibilities will be the coordination of the activities\n            that will be executed under the project, monitoring and\n            evaluation, carrying out of audits, supervise the\n            preparation of the Integrated Investment Plans, and the\n            preparation of the Annual Operating Plans and the periodic\n            reports to the Bank on project activities."}, "docdt": "2003-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
