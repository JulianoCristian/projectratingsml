During its follow-up visit to Nigeria in January\n            2007, the Panel noted disagreement regarding some major\n            issues, such as the cause of pollution of the lagoon and\n            alleged damage to fisheries, serious concerns regarding the\n            valuation of assets and procedures for compensation, and a\n            lack of information regarding the implementation of the\n            Project. As stated in the original eligibility report, the\n            request and the requesters meet the eligibility criteria set\n            forth in the resolution that established the Inspection\n            Panel and the 1999 clarifications. The Panel believes that\n            these important questions regarding the Bank's alleged\n            failure to comply with its own policies and procedures and\n            possible harm to the requesters can only be addressed in the\n            context of a Panel investigation."}, "docdt": "2007-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
