outcome rating of the West\n            African Gas Pipeline Project for Ghana was judged to be\n            moderately satisfactory. The Bank and borrower performance\n            ratings were moderately satisfactory. The risk to\n            development outcome was moderate.  Several lessons were\n            learned.  For cross-border energy projects, both supply-side\n            and demand side risks need to be carefully assessed and\n            their potential impact quantified. Risk analysis should\n            typically go beyond those faced by the private partners, and\n            should focus directly on the specific risks to the project\n            development objectives.  Careful assessment of political,\n            community, and social issues in large infrastructure\n            investments should be considered and identified and\n            adequately taken into account. The institutional framework\n            for large multi-country projects, like the West African Gas\n            Pipeline (WAGP), requires a careful balancing of interests\n            and responsibilities of different stakeholders. The risks,\n            responsibilities and incentives of all these stakeholders\n            need to be appropriately allocated for the success of the\n            project. The scope and conduct of supervision of a\n            transformational regional project should be comprehensive\n            regardless of the instrument used and amount of Bank\n            support. Economic and financial evaluations should assume a\n            wider range of commodity prices and other variables. Capital\n            intensive, cross-border energy infrastructure projects\n            should have stronger commercial underpinnings. The WAGP was\n            conceived as an Economic Community of West African States\n            initiative, with Nigeria playing a dominant role in\n            exporting natural gas to its smaller neighbors in the\n            region. The project, therefore, had strong regional\n            political support. However, while an elaborate contractual\n            framework was developed, the commercial provisions were\n            rarely enforced by the signing parties. At the time of\n            project sanction, WAGP prices were very attractive relative\n            to domestic process. The main lesson is that upstream gas\n            prices should be structured so that gas exports maintain\n            their competitiveness vis-a-vis competing domestic sales."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
