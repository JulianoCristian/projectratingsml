Under\n            WAGP, risk mitigation is provided through an International\n            Development Association (IDA) Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG)\n            of US$50 million, with respect to gas purchases of\n            Ghana's Volta River Authority (VRA), a Guarantee from\n            the Multilateral Investment and Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of\n            US$75 million, and commercial insurance to back the credit\n            risk of VRA. On April 27, 2006, the Inspection Panel\n            received a request for inspection on the project. The\n            request was submitted by the Ifesowapo Host Communities\n            Forum of the WAGP Project through their representatives from\n            Olorunda Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria.\n            Additionally, the Panel received a letter from Friends of\n            the Earth Ghana (FoE-Ghana), expressing their support for\n            the request and asking to be included among the requesters.\n            The Host Communities Forum and FoE-Ghana represented local\n            people living in Nigeria and Ghana, and were recognized as\n            the requesters. The requesters from Nigeria's Delta\n            Region were mainly concerned with the project's impact\n            on gas flaring reduction and with the safety of an existing\n            pipeline to which WAGP was to be linked. The requesters and\n            affected communities living near the gas pipeline in Nigeria\n            complained mainly about the low compensation rates received\n            for their land. Those living in southwestern Nigeria, where\n            the pipeline goes under the sea, claimed that the\n            construction process would hurt their fishing enterprise.\n            The requesters from Ghana were concerned about inadequate\n            consultation regarding the project's economic\n            viability, the pipeline's safety, and its impacts on\n            coastal fisheries."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
