           Olorunda local government area of Lagos state, Nigeria. The\n            management responded to the claims in the request on June 6,\n            2006. In its report to the Board on July 7, 2006, the panel\n            refrained from recommending an investigation. The panel\n            stated that it expected to be able to make a determination\n            by end 2006 and noted that this would also allow management\n            more time to demonstrate that it was taking \"adequate\n            steps to follow the Bank's policies and\n            procedures\" as required by the resolution that\n            established the panel. The Board approved the panel\n            recommendation on July 27, 2006, on a non-objection basis.\n            In its final report and recommendation, dated March 1, 2007,\n            the panel recommended an investigation to the Board of\n            Executive Directors, which was approved on March 13, 2007.\n            On April 25, 2008, the panel issued its report outlining the\n            findings of the investigation. Management appreciates the\n            panel's clear and thorough presentation of its\n            findings. This report responds to the findings of the panel.\n            The second section provides background and the status of the\n            Project; the third section summarizes the findings of the\n            panel; the fourth section addresses special issues emerging\n            from the panel's investigation report; the fifth\n            section includes management's action plan; and the\n            sixth section contains the conclusion."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
