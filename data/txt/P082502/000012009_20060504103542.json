This Project aims to deliver gas from\n            Nigeria via an approximately 680 kilometer pipeline across\n            south western Nigeria, to a terminal point at Takoradi,\n            Ghana, constructed by the West African Gas Pipeline Company\n            (WAPCo) which would pass through, and be placed on the lands\n            of 23 communities with an overall population of 140,000,\n            including the 12 communities making this Request. According\n            to the Request, the Project is designed to substitute\n            natural gas from Nigeria, for alternative fuels used in the\n            power, industrial, mining and commercial sectors in the\n            Republics of Ghana, Benin and Togo, and to promote regional\n            integration in support of economic growth. The Requesters\n            believe that the Project will cause irreparable damage to\n            their land, and destroy their livelihoods. They state the\n            Bank did not comply with a number of its policies and\n            procedures, such as OPBP 4.12. on Involuntary Resettlement,\n            OPBP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, OPBP 10.04 on\n            Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations, and OPBP 13\n            -05 on Project Supervision. The Project Appraisal Document\n            (PAD) states that \"the World Bank Group participation\n            (IDA and MIGA) will provide financial risk mitigation to\n            allow the proposed Project to proceed, support the\n            implementation of regional and national frameworks and\n            actions required to kick start the development of gas\n            markets in Ghana, Benin, and Togo, and more broadly, provide\n            comfort to all stakeholders regarding Project preparation\n            and implementation standards.\" For these purposes IDA\n            has entered into Project Agreements with WAPCo and N-Gas,\n            respectively, that contain several covenants,\n            representations, and warranties that both WAPCo and N-Gas\n            \"have acted and will continue to act in compliance with\n            applicable World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard\n            Policies and anti-corruption policies.\" The Panel will\n            determine whether the Request meets the eligibility criteria\n            set out in paragraphs 12 to 14 and shall make a\n            recommendation as to whether the matter should be investigated."}, "docdt": "2006-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
