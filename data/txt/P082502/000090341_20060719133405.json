In Management's view, the\n            Bank has endeavored to ensure that West African Gas Pipeline\n            Company (WAPCo) follows the guidelines, policies and\n            procedures applicable to the matters raised by the request\n            but acknowledges that further work will need to be done on\n            safeguards supervision, as explained above.
