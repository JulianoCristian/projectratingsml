On June 30, 2008, Management submitted its report\n            and a detailed Management Action Plan (MAP), developed in\n            response to the Inspection Panel's Investigation\n            Report. The MAP acknowledged gaps in three key areas: (a)\n            social impact assessment and mitigation measures; (b)\n            environmental assessment and mitigation measures; and (c)\n            project supervision. On August 5, 2008, the Executive\n            Directors discussed the above reports and endorsed the MAP\n            proposed by management. The Board also asked that management\n            report on the progress in implementing this action plan in\n            six months. This progress report is being submitted to the\n            Board in response to that request. The project is also\n            expected to strengthen its work on livelihoods and to\n            complete the socio-economic database required to redesign\n            the Community Development Program (CDP) and livelihood\n            restoration. West African Gas Pipeline Company (WAPCo) has\n            increased its budget for CDP sub-projects; and improved its\n            outreach to local and traditional leaders and affected\n            villages. These measures will contribute to effective\n            implementation and address outstanding issues."}, "docdt": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
