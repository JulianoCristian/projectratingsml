The project closing date is extended by\n            six months from March 31, 2012 to September 30, 2012.  The\n            extension of the closing date is to allow for time needed to\n            negotiate and sign a contract for the procurement. The\n            extension will adequately compensate for the compounded\n            delays that affected the processing of the pending\n            consultant contracts, which was beyond the implementing\n            agency's control.
