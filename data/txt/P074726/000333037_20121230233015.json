The extension is necessary to provide\n            the Borrower the additional time needed to complete all due\n            diligence and obtain the Bank's no objection to proceed\n            with contract signing of the engineering design study of\n            Bogota's first metro line. Contingent upon signature of\n            the contract within the 6 month extension, the project\n            closing date will be extended for additional 15 month to\n            implement the study. There is also some possibility that the\n            current negotiations could be terminated and negotiations\n            with the second ranked firm could be initiated, in which\n            case it is possible that the Borrower will need additional\n            further time to get a signed contract. This will be the\n            seventh extension of closing date for this project for a\n            total of 68 months."}, "docdt": "2012-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
