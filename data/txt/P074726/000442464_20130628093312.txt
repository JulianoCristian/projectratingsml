A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes derive from the client request with regards to additional
time required to fully achieve in finalizing the advanced design for the First Line of the
Bogota Metro Line (PLMB) and extend the project closing date. This extension of closing
date is a 15-month extension from June 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014.

2.      On December 2012, a 6-month closing date was granted to allow the Borrower to
have additional time to complete all due diligence and obtain the Bank’s No Objection,
negotiate and sign the contract of the engineering design study of PLMB. The Borrower
has informed the Bank on May 9, 2013 that the contract has been negotiated and signed.
The value of the contract is 9,586,711 euros plus COP$ 36,094,604,109.12 (approx.
US$33 million, not including taxes), where the Bank will finance around 50%.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     This is the eighth extension of closing date for this Project, the first extension was
made from October 31, 2007 to October 31, 2008, the second one was made from
October 31, 2008 to June 30, 2009, the third one for the AF loan, from June 30, 2009 to
July 31, 2011, the fourth one from July 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012, the fifth one from
March 31, 2012 to September 30, 2012, the sixth one from September 30, 20012 to
December 31, 2012 and the seventh from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

4.      Loan Status.       The progress towards achievement of the PDO is rated as
moderately satisfactory given that the objective of the entire project (original plus the
additional financing) is attainable. Presently there are no outstanding audit reports, and
the latest audit report was satisfactory. Neither this Loan in particular, nor Colombia in
general, is subject to an ongoing suspension of disbursements.

5.      Disbursements. The additional financing loan has disbursed US$ 8.35 million to
date.
           a. Project Component A: Improved Mobility, which finances the advanced
              engineering design for Bogotá’s first metro line has yet to disburse. The
              procurement contract has been negotiated and signed.
           b. Project Component B. The AF did not continue financing this Component


                                             3
           c. The Project Component C: Institutional Development, which provides
              technical assistance to Bogotá’s Urban Development Institute (IDU) and
              SHD (Cadastre) are now fully committed.

6.     Achievements to date. BUSP’s AF main achievements to date include the
following:

Component A: Improved Mobility. The Project, with the AF loan will finance the
advanced engineering design for Bogotá’s first metro line. The study will be carried out
approximately over a 15-month period. The contract has been negotiated and signed.

Component B: Urban Upgrading. The AF did not continue financing this Component.

Component C: Institutional Development. The achievements under this component
can be summarized as follows: (i) organizational redesign and institutional strengthening
of the Cadastre Unit, including the processes of cadastral update and conservation, and
the design and implementation of a geographic information system to generate spatial
data of Bogotá; and (ii) definition of the road users costs to be managed by IDU for
Bogotá, and implementation of the evaluation tools of Road Networks (RONET).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.     On May 17, 2013 the Borrower sent a letter to the Bank requesting a 15-month
extension of the closing date. This extension will allow the implementation of the
consultant contract for study of the engineering design of the Bogota First Metro Line
(PLMB). This extension of closing date is a 15-month extension from June 30, 2013 to
September 30, 2014.

8.     The project meets the following conditions:

     (a) The project objectives continue to be achievable within the new time frame;
     (b) The performance of the Borrower and the project implementation unit is
         satisfactory;
     (c) Neither the loan in particular nor Colombia in general is subject to an ongoing
         suspension of disbursements; and
     (d) No audit reports or audit reports not satisfactory to the Bank are outstanding for
         the project.
