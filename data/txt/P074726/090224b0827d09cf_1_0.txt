                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Projects are: (i)to improve quality of life of low income families (estratos 1 and 2) by increasing access, coverage, quality, reliability, and inter-
                         agency coordination in the provision of water, sanitation, transport and related basic services; (ii) to improve city's mobility by providing better access to the public
                         transport system, and improving road safety, traffic management and transport planning; and (iii) to strengthen the institutional and administrative framework for an
                         efficient and sustainable delivery of urban services throughout the city.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         This AF finances the scale-up of the original Project's Component A: Improved Mobility, which consists of the conceptualization and detailed engineering studies of the Integrated
                         Mass Transit System for the city, including Bogotá's first underground metro line; and Component C: Institutional Development, which includes technical assistance to the City

                         the studies according to contract scope. Bogota will amend the design studies contract to allow additional studies to be done since the original location of the train depots has been
                         moved to a further location due to soil problems in the original location and land availability issues, and hence the project now requires an operational 4 kilometer link to reach to the
                         depot. This amendment will extend the duration of the contract and increase the scope and will be covered with local resources. The consortium has already started working on this
                         extension.

                         The city administration is programming an open forum to present the results of the study in October, 2014.

                         The Metro project will continue his preparation where the Bank will provide through different instruments (Grants, advisory services) support to the two main stakeholders (Nation and
                         City of Bogota) in different aspects like financing structuring, institutional set up, project management). The results of the study are being published and the city is planning on
                         advancing towards project structuring and bidding stages using the designs as main input for these stages.

                         The rest of project's components has been accomplished and some of them with high innovation and state of the art information. The achievements under the Institutional
                         Development Component are complete and in quality highly satisfactory for the Team, and can be summarized as follows: (i) organizational redesign and institutional strengthening of
                         the Cadastre Unit, including the processes of cadastral update and conservation, and the design and implementation of a geographic information system to generate spatial data of
                         Bogotá; and (ii) definition of the road users costs to be managed by the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano (IDU) for Bogotá, and implementation of the evaluation tools of Road Networks
                         (RONET), which continues its implementation and is rated satisfactory.

                         The implementation and PDO rating is Moderately Satisfactory.
