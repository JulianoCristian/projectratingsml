                         transport system, and improving road safety, traffic management and transport planning; and (iii) to strengthen the institutional and administrative framework for an
                         efficient and sustainable delivery of urban services throughout the city.

                         Overall, the Project is progressing in a satisfactory manner. An Additional Financing (AF) of US$ 30 million was approved in October 2008 and became effective on June 26, 2009.
                         This AF finances the scale-up of the original Project's Component A: Improved Mobility, which consists of the conceptualization and detailed engineering studies of the Integrated
                         Mass Transit System for the city, including Bogotá's first metro line; and Component C: Institutional Development, which includes technical assistance to the Urban Development

                         Institute (IDU) for road administration system and support to Bogotá's Cadastre Unit for enhanced cadastral management and institutional strengthening.

                         The conceptual design study of Bogotá's metro is finished. The District is moving forward to contract the detailed engineering designs of Bogotá's first metro line. The study will be
                         carried out approximately over an 18 month period. The award of such contract and launch of the study has been delayed for various reasons including: (i) ongoing discussions

                         between the Government of Colombia (GoC) and the District of Bogota (DB) on general project issues; and (ii) delays in the review and completion of the procurement process.

                         The achievements under the Institutional Development Component can be summarized as follows: (i) organizational redesign and institutional strengthening of the Cadastre Unit,
                         including the processes of cadastral update and conservation, and the design and implementation of a geographic information system to generate spatial data of Bogotá; and (ii)
                         definition of the road users costs to be managed by the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano (IDU) for Bogotá, and implementation of the evaluation tools of Road Networks (RONET).

                         The loan has been extended until September 30, 2012. If the District sign the detailed engineering design study above mentioned before this date, the Bank will further consider
                         extending the closing date of the the loan during the period of the execution of this contract.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Borrower requested an eighteen-month extension of the closing date of the Project (July 31, 2011) to finance (and carry out) the detailed engineering studies for Bogota's first
                         metro line, since this study will take approximately 18 months and the contract award process has been delayed. The Bank has granted an eight-month extension to the loan (March
                         31, 2012) to allow the Borrower to finalize the award of the contract for the engineering design of Bogota#s first Metro line. Due to the change of the local administration and the joint
                         commitment between the GOC and The city of Bogotá to move forward with the implementation of the study, the Bank extended again the closing for six months (September 30,
                         2012). In case that this contract is successfully awarded, the Bank will further consider extending the closing date of the loan by an additional eighteen months in order to facilitate
                         completion of activities under this contract.
