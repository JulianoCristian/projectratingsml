1.    The closing date for the Colombia, Additional Financing (AF) Loan to the Bogota
Urban Services Project, Loan Number 76090-CO, P074726, will be extended by six
months from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

2.      This AF loan finances the design of the first line of a proposed Metro for Bogota.
The current status of the implementation of the Bogota Urban Services Project is
moderately unsatisfactory due to the delay in starting with the design study. This delay is
due to the enhanced due diligence associated with such a large sized contract. The client
has been responsive to the Bank’s observations during the different phases of the contract
negotiation process. The project objectives continue to be achievable within the new
time frame.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to provide the Borrower the additional time
needed to complete all due diligence and obtain the Bank’s No Objection to proceed with
contract signing of the engineering design study of Bogota’s First Metro Line. Contingent
upon signature of the contract within the 6 month extension, the project closing date
would be extended for additional 15 month to implement the study There is also some
possibility that the current negotiations could be terminated and negotiations with the
second ranked firm could be initiated, in which case it is possible that the Borrower
would need additional further time to get a signed contract.

4.    This will be the seventh extension of closing date for this Project for a total of 68
months.
