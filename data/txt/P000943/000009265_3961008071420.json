Assistance Credit Project has two objectives.  The first is\n            to promote the growth of an efficient, competitive, well\n            regulated, non-bank financial sector and an efficient\n            payments system in order to: 1) increase the mobilization of\n            domestic savings in both formal and informal sectors; 2)\n            facilitate the flow of international capital into Ghana\n            through better financial intermediation; and 3) supply\n            financial services competitively to the economy.  The second\n            objective is to create an environment conducive to greater\n            private sector activity and support the successful\n            implementation of the divestiture program for state owned\n            enterprises (SOE) and the three largest state-owned\n            commercial banks.  The project addresses identified gaps in\n            the non-bank financial sector including: capital markets\n            institutions such as the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE),\n            Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC), and the Bank of\n            Ghana (BOG), and contractual savings institutions, such as\n            National Insurance Commission (NIC), State Insurance\n            Corporation (SIC), Ghana Reinsurance Organization (GRO), and\n            Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).  The\n            project also provides for associated financial\n            infrastructure (domestic payments system) and capacity\n            building in the non-bank financial institutions sector and\n            diagnostic studies at the Ministry of Finance to enable the\n            Government of Ghana to prepare strategies for future actions\n            in expanding the provision of financial services to rural\n            and informal sectors."}, "docdt": "1995-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
