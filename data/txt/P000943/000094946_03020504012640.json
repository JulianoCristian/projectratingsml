The main lessons address\n            the following. Projects of this nature should consider two\n            main areas - strengthening of regulatory agencies, and\n            improving payment systems - so as to better manage project\n            components, and beneficiaries, moreover, limiting the number\n            of components, to obtain satisfactory results, as proven by\n            this operation. During the mid-term review, project\n            performance indicators were redefined, which enabled\n            progress monitoring, an issue that needs to be discussed in\n            detail with beneficiaries, to ensure the value of\n            indicators, and its acceptance. Such well defined indicators\n            also insulates the implementation of the project from\n            political interference, an issue which could have been\n            prevented had the indicators been in place early on.\n            Furthermore, procurement of large, and complex information\n            technology systems, and equipment needs to be revisited by\n            the Bank, in particular, the project could be used as a case\n            study towards developing a necessary procurement expertise.\n            Procurement delays caused irreparable harm to project\n            implementation; ideally, project design should address key\n            procurement issues, to improve development impacts. Finally,\n            project coordination should be mainstreamed within\n            implementing agencies, based on the years of experience with\n            the Africa Region's policy, and, policy dialogues\n            should remain engaged beyond the immediate component objectives."}, "docdt": "2002-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
