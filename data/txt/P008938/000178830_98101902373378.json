Adjustment Loan\n            Project will be in further support of Turkey's January\n            1980 stabilization program, and measures initiated and being\n            implemented since then in areas critical to restoring\n            economic viability. These policies provided the basis for\n            the Structural Adjustment Loan I (Loan No, 1818-TU) and its\n            Supplement (Loan No. 1915-TU). The policy measures which\n            provide the basis for this new loan are in the areas of: (a)\n            macroeconomic policies - domestic resource mobilization,\n            export promotion, and import liberalization; (b) supply-side\n            policies - public and private investment, energy and\n            agriculture; and (c) reform of the State Economic\n            Enterprises. The loan will finance high priority imports\n            leading to fuller utilization of productive capacity in\n            agriculture and industry. For agriculture: fertilizer raw\n            materials and intermediate products ($200 million). For\n            industry: raw materials and intermediate products ($100\n            million). The main risks relate to possible political\n            developments in Turkey which might impede the\n            Government's determination and efforts to carry out the\n            policy reforms designed to restore domestic and external\n            financial equilibrium."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
