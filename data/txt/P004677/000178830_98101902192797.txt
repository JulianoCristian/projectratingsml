INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A FIPTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US $28.6 million to
help finance a fifth highway project.  The loan would have a term of 24
years including 4h years of grace, with interest at 7¼ per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
.2.       A basic economic report on Thailand's Third Five-Year Plan
(1972-1976) was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1972
(Report No. EAP-28).  This is now being updated by an economic mission
which visited Thailand in September 1972;  the mission's preliminary
findings and conclusions were contained in my report and recommendation
on a proposed loan for a telecoDununications project (P-1126) distributed
to the Executive Directors under cover of a memorandum from the Secretary
(R72-211 dated November 2, 1972).  The section on the economy is reproduced
in Annex II, and follows the Country Data.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATICUS IN THAILAND
3.        My report and recormendation, referred to above also set out
past Bank Group lending in Thailand and discussed the Bank Group's strategy
for    Thailand and the projects which are expected to come forward for
your consideration in the next two years.  The relevant section has been
revised to reflect a few small chags which have occurred since then and
is included in Annex I.
PART III - THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
4.        The growth of the transportation sector in Thailand to meet the
needs of the rapidly developing Thai economy over the last ten years has
been impressive.   The pattern of expansion has been dictated by the dominant
position of Bangkok, Thailand's principal port and business center and the
need to link Bangkok to the outlying regions.  To accommodate the flow of
goods and people between Bangkok and the rest of the country, several systems
have evolved with Bangkok at the center.  There are about 10,400 km of
national highways, 5,900 km of provincial (feeder) roads and about 35,000 km
of local roads.   The railways consist of about 3,770 km of meter gauge track.



-2-
The waterways include about 1,600 km of canals and rivers navigable in the
wet season and about 1,100 km in the dry season.   Don Muang, Bangkok's
airport, handled about 1.5 million internatimnal and domestic passenger
movements in 1970, of which about 1.2z,million were international traffic.
Domestic aviation is not yet an important carrier of freight or passengers.
The port at Bangkok handles about 80% of Thailand's international sea traffic
and about 40% of its coastal traffic while several minor ports serve mainly
the needs of the Southern region.
5.        Road freight traffic increased by about 15% a year from over
1,000 million ton-km in 1960 to 3,900 million ton-km in 1970 (short hauls
in 1970 are estimated at 3,000 million ton-km).   Railroad carload freight
has grown at an average of 5% a year rising from 1,200 million ton-km in
1960 to 2,200 million ton-km in 1970.   During the period 1961-1970 the
motor vehicle fleet grew at an average annual rate of 19% and about
738,000 vehicles were registered in the country in 1970.   During this period
the railways began a modernization program and nearly 50% of the railways
is now dieselized.
6.        For the most part the system has developed along rational lines
and no significant misallocation of transport investments has so far occurred.
However, in view of the very rapid growth of the transportation system it is
not surprising that a number of transport problems have developed. In the
first place the rapid growth of Bangkok and its central location in the system
has created serious traffic congestion in the city and the movement of heavy
trucks in Bangkok during daylight hours has been restricted.   Solutions to
this problem are being sought. A two-phase Urban Transport Study, financed
with the assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany, began in 1971. The
first phase which is nearly completed will seek short-term solutions to
relieving traffic congestion while the second phase, due to be conpleted in
1974, will recormend a long-term program for providing adequate transport in
the city including possibly a rapid transit system. Another aspect of this
prcblem is the need to divert part of the traffic to a second and deep water
port.    A study, financed with the help of the Netherlands, was recently
completed on the feasibility of developing a port at Laem Krabang, about 120
km from Bangkok.   This study is being complemented by a study, financed with
help from USAID and due to be completed early next year, on converting
Sattahip, an existing military port about 50 km further south of Laem Krabang,
for civilian traffic.   A United Kingdom-financed study is also examining
the possibilities for containerized cargoes.   A second problem concerns
road-rail coordination.    With the development of the highways road transport
has become the predominant mode for freight transport, replacing the railways
However, it is probable that some uneconomic diversion of traffic has taken
place, aand the railways are now in a better position to concentrate on
increasing the efficiency of their long-haul operations and are taking steps
to modernize their equipment, improve their scheduling and adjust tariffs
to meet the challenge of road transport.   Finally, it appears that the
possibilities offered by the waterways network for low cost transport have
been neglected.   Attention needs to be given to the benefits which could be
obtained from allocating more water and funds for improved navigation against
competing claims of power production, agriculture and industry.
7.        Government investment in transport during the Third Five-Year Plan
(1972-1976) is estimated at about Bt 21 billion, or about 20% of development
expenditures.   Roads are planned to absorb about Bt 16.6 billion, railways



-3-
Bt 2.5 billion with the balance about evenly divided between inland water-
ways and ports and civil aviation.  The largest increase in the Third
Five-Year Plan is for investment in provincial (feeder) roads. The greater
emphasis on provincial roads is well justified in view of Thailand's need
to expand and diversify agricultural production for export, but the transport
ihvestment plan as a whole is being revised to reflect more closely economic
priorities and a more reAlistic schedule for project preparation.  However,
if full benefits of constructing new provincial roads are to be achieved, a
considerable effort will be required to improve inter-sectoral planning.
Recent organizational changes in the Government hold out promise that improve-
ments in planning may be possible.  The main departments concerned with
agricultural planning and project implementation have been brought under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and the Department of Highways (DCH)
has been moved into the Ministry of Communications, bringing all modes of
transport except construction and maintenance of inland waterways under the
Ministry's direction.   The Ministry of Communications also intends to
implement the principal recommendations on organization and planning of the
Transportation Sector Review carried out last year by the Bank.  A transport-
ation policy and planning committee and a transport planning unit will be
set up.   These changes should go far to improve sector plaiming and
investment decisions as well as inter-modal coordination.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
8.        The project is part of Thailand's Third Five-Year Social and
Economic Development Plan (1972-1976).  It would be the fifth highway project
to be financed with the help of a Bank loan in a series of Highway Projects
beginning in 1963.   It was identified in the course of the Bank's on-going
assistance for the development of Thailand's transport system.
9.        Appraisal of the project began in Thailand in OctoberA/ovember
1971, but could not be completed until September 1972 as the four provincial
roads included in the project were redesigned, at the Bank's suggestion, to
reduce their costs.  The proposed loan was negotiated in Washington from
October 25 to November 2, 1972.  The Government delegation was led by H.E.
Ambassador Anand Panyaranchun assisted by Dr. Sirilak Chandrangsu, Under
Secretary of State, Ministry of Communications.
Project Composition
10.       The project comprises the following main items:
(a) the construction and improvement of the following
three national highway sections totalling about
285 km:-
1) Don Muang - Bang Pa In - Saraburi (about 83 km)
2) Siracha - Rayong (about 72 km)
3) Langsuan-Suratthani (about 130 km, including
about 20 km of access roads)



(b) the construction and improvement of the following four
provincial (feeder) roads totalling about 387 km:-
1)  San Sai-Phrao (about 81 km).
2) Chieng-mai-Doi Saket-Mai Suai (about 133 Ian)
3) Suphanburi-Chainat (about 99 Ian)
4) Khao Daeng - Ranot (about 74 kn);
(c) feasibility studies by consultants of about 1200 km of
provincial roads of which about 800 km will be selected
for detailed engineering, if justified;
(d) a highway maintenance study by consultants including
recommendations for the purchase of urgently-needed
maintenance equipment to be financed out of the proposed
loan,
(e)  technical assistance by consultants to the Department
of Highways (DOH) in planning, executing and maintaining
highway projects and training its professional staff;
and
(f) technical assistance to the Ministry of Communications
in setting up a transport planning unit in the Ministry.
11.       Details are in the report entitled "Appraisal of a Fifth Highway
Project - Thailand" (No. PTR-126a) which is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary is provided in
Annex III.
12.       Feasibility studies of the first two national highway sections
were carried out by consultants financed out of Loan 455-TH (Second High-
way Project) and the third by consultants financed by USAID;   the detailed
engineering of all three highway sections was financed out of Loan 626-TH
(Fourth Highway Project).   The four provincial roads were selected from
a feeder road study carried out by consultants financed out of Loan 341-TH
(First Highway Project) and detailed engineering was carried out by consult-
ants financed out of Loan 535-TH (Third Highway Project).,
13.       This is the first time that the Bank has financed the construction,
as opposed to the engineering of provincial roads in Thailand.   This develop-
ment accords with the large increase in investment in such roads envisaged
by the Government's Third Five-Year Plan (see paragraph 7 above).
Project Execution
14.       Except for the technical assistance to be provided to the Ministry
of,Communications in setting up a transport planning unit, responsibility for



-5-
the execution of the project rests with DOH.   DOH, which has successfully
carried out similar projects, will be assisted by consultants in the
supervision of construction and improvements works and in carrying out the
highway maintenance study and the feasibility studies and detailed engineer-
ing of additional feeder roads.   DOH will also be assisted by consultants
in planning, executing and maintaining highway projects as well as in
training its professional staff.    In addition DOH will select, in consult-
ation with the Bank, three members of its staff for overseas training in
fields for which there are inadequate training facilities in Thailand. All
construction and improvement works are expected to be completed by mid-1977,
feasibility studies of feeder roads by late 1974 and detailed engineering by
late 1975; orders for maintenance equipment are expected to be placed in
mid-197h.
15.       The Ministry of Communications intends to set up a transport
policy and planning committee by December 31, 1973 on which the Ministries
and Agencies primarily concerned with transport matters will be represented.
The committee will be served by a transport planning unit in the office
of the Under Secretary of Communications which will prepare transport
policy papers and formulate sector investment programs for the Committee's
consideration; the transport planning unit will also establish a transport
information system to provide adequate data for decision making on transport
matters.   Consultants will assist the Ministry in organizing the transport
planning unit and implementing the transport information system.
Cost Estimates
16.       The estimated cost (including import duties) of the project is
$58.6 million equivalent including about $8.0 million for contingencies;
the estimated foreign exchange component is $28.6 million. Detailed cost
estimates are provided in Annex III.
17.       The proposed loan of $28.60 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the project (49% of total project costs) and the
balance of the funds required for the project would`ibe made available by
the Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
18.       To avoid delays in executing its highway improvement program, to
spread the administrative burden of contract supervision and to- take advantage
of as much of the 1971/1972 dry season as possible, the Governmentssought
the Bank's agreement to award three contracts (two contracts on the Don Muang -
Saraburi section and one contract on the Siracha-Rayong section) totalling
$17 million and to include an amount in the proposed loan to cover the
estimated foreign exchange costs of these contracts up to the date that the
proposed loan was presented to the Ececutive Directors.   These contracts
were awarded between November 197l&ad-Ap_ril 1972, after international com-



-6-
petitive biddirg.   The total amount of retroactive financing required up
to mid-December 1972 is $4 million and this amount'is included in the proposed
loan.
19.       All remaining civil works contracts and all contracts for the
purchase of maintenance equipment will be awarded after international com-
petitive bidding.   A preference of up to 15% or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is lower, will apply to bids from local manuifacturers on
maintenance equipment.   Thailand has no agreements giving preferential
tariffs to any foreign country.   Disbursement out of the loan would be
for 45% of the total costs of road construction and improvement works, the
foreign exchange costs of consultants and overseas training, and either the
CIF costs of imported maintenance equipment, or 65% of the price of such
equipment if procured through local dealers.   It is possible that local
manufacturers might win some contracts for maintenance equipment.    In that
case, the loan would be disbursed against the ex-factory price and some
small amount of local expenditure financing would be inv6lved.
Justification
20.       The project will support the Government's strategy of improving
transportation. to and within regions distant from the congested area around
Bangkok.   It will stimulate the development of these regions by providing
opportunities for more economic activities in these areas and ease the flow
of farm and forestry products and minerals for export and the' reverse flow
of imported and locally manufactured products to the regions.   Indirect
economic benefits (which have not been included in the calculation of the
economic rates of return for the various sections of road) can also be
expected to flow from the easier access to remote areas which some of the
project roads will offer to Government agencies.   The main benefits will
consist of savings in vehicle operating costs which are expe'cted to' be
passed on to producers and consxmers in the form of lower transport costs.
Military traffic (which is not expected to constitute more'thani a small
part of total traffic on any road)' was excluded from'the calculation of the
rate of return of the project roads.'  The justification for the various
parts of the project is summarized in the following paragraphs.
21.       The Don Muang - Saraburi highway section' is one of the most heavily
trafficked sections of the important North-South axis.   Traffic on this
section has been increasing at the rate of 14-24% a year.   On the basis
of savings in vehicle operating costs alone, the economic rate of return on
this section is estimated at 22%.   The Siracha-Rayong highway section in the
South-East region -will provide a more direct, link from Centr'al Thailand to
the area of the coastal town of Rayong.   It bypasses the military port of
Sattahip.   Military traffic from Sattahip destined for the North - East
travels by a separate direct route.   Industry, tourism and agriculture in
the area served by the highway will benefit by reducing travel distances
and relieving congestion.    The economic rate of return considering only
vehicle operating costs is estimated at 18%.o   The Langsuan2-Suratthani high-
way section is part of a future direct highway route down th'e'eastern coast
of the Kra Isthmus in the Southern region;  the completed highway will
shorten travel distances and' link major population centers.  Opening'this



-7-
highway section will relieve the State Railways of less-than-carload freight
and local passenger traffic and enable it to close uneconomic stations and
to handle the remaining traffic more efficiently.   The savings in vehicle
operating costs are expected to yield an economic rate of return of 14%.
22.       The San Sai-Phrao and the Chiengmai-Mai Suai roads will help bring
about new agricultural development in their influence areas by providing all
weather roads to Chiengmai, the second largest city in Thailand, reducing
distances and vehicle operating costs.   These roads could facilitate the
Government's efforts to win the loyalty of more hill people and to offer
attractive economic alternatives to the cultivation of opium poppies.   The
economic ratesof return for these two roads are estimated at 12 and 13%,
respectively.   The Siiphanburi-Chainat road will serve a highly developed
area, with a population of 120,000, within the Northern Chao Phya irrigation
area.   The road will reduce travel distances and reduce vehicle operating
costs.   The economic rate of return based on savings to existing traffic
only is estimated at 14%.   The Khao Daeng-Ranot road will provide an all
weather road serving a population of about 100,000.   The area is primarily
agricultural serving Songkhla and Haadyai the principal cities in the
southern region.   On the basis of savings in vehicle operating costs the
economic rate of return is estimated at 13%.
23.       Under the least favorable combination of circumstances, the
economic rate of return is unlikely to fall below 10% for any of the highway
sections or provincial roads included in the'project with the exception of
the San Sai-Phrao road, the economic return of which, again on the basis of
savings in vehicle operating costs, might fall from 12 to 9%. Nonetheless,
this road is justified as it will provide the neighboring population with
access to education, health and other social services.
2h.       The maintenance of national highways and provincial roads has'in-
proved in recent years, but inadequate attention has been given to longer
term (periodic) maintenance needs and the preparation of a national maintenance
program.   The procurement of a limited amount of urgently-needed maintenance
equipment and the inclusion of a road maintenance study in the project will
assist the DOH improve its maintenance operations.
25.       The benefits of the other items included in the project are not
quantifiable but should lead to increased efficiency in the administration
of highways and the transport sector.
PART V - LEGAL INSrRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
26.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Thailand and the
Bank  the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft loan agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans for highway
projects.
27.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.



-8-
PART VI - RECONMENfDATlMN
28.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan h71-TH, First Education Project (Vocational Education)
As a result of incomplete bidding for tools and scientific
equipment, the closing date of Loan h71-TH was postponed a second time to
allow for re-bidding;   the first postponement was necessary due to delays
in appointing experts under bilateral assistance.   It is expected that
tile project will be satisfactorily completed before the new closing date
of August 31, 1973.
Loan 51h-TH, Sirikit Dam Project
The work on the project has been practically completed.    The
closure of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971.   The reser-
voir is expected to be filled to full retention capacity this month. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US $78 million, as against
US $76 million at appraisal (+2.5%).   Substantial increases in the principal
civil works contract (+4%), which resulted from unforeseen adverse foundation
conditions, have been compensated by savings on other items. Loan disburse-
ments are expected to be completed about 6 months prior to the closing date
of the Loan, June 30, 1973.
Loan 535-TH, Third Highways Project
The project has been largely completed.   At the request of the
Highways Department the closing date of the loan has been extended by a
period of six months until March 31, 1973, to allow for the completion of
work, the settlement of outstanding payments on construction contracts
already carried out and the payment of consultants costs for completing the
design of feeder roads to be constructed under the proposed 5th highways
project.   Government intends to request cancellation of $4.0 million of
undisbursed amount of loan which is not required for the project.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highways Project
Construction of the project is on schedule and within the cost
estimates.
Loan 655-T¶, First BDAT Power Project
Work on the project is on schedule.   The Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (MDAT) has placed orders for equipment but is not
required to make substantial payments until it is shipped.
Loan 702-TH, Third Batngok Port Project
As mentioned in paragraph 13 of the report, construction of this
project began 18 months behind schedule.   The delay was mainly caused by



Annex I
Page 4
the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and its consultants to
pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate bids which were
complicated by currency realignments.
Loan 790-TH, South BangkDk Thermal Unit No. 4 Project
The loan became effective on January 27, 1972. Similarly with
Loan 655-TH, MAT has placed orders for equipment for which payment is not
yet due.
Loan 822-TH, Second Educatimn Project (Kasetsart University)
The loan was declared effective on August 22, 1972. There has
been some delay in appointing the campus planners but construction is expected
to be completed and work begin in the immediate future.

Extract from President's Report and Recommendation on a
Proposed Loan to the Telephone Organization of Thailand (R72-241).
D.   BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
1.        Since 1950  Thailand has received 24 Bank loans amounting to
$403.0 million net of cancellations.   The greater part of Bank assistance
has been for transportation ($154 million), irrigation ($69 million),
power ($91 million) and for a multi-purpose power and irrigation project
($66 million).   Two loans have been made for education and one for industry.
The President's Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan of $37 million
for a telecommunications project was distributed to the Executive Directors
on November 2, 1972.    In general Bank-financed projects have been carried
out in accordance with expectations.   Construction of the Third Bangkok
Port Project, financed under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months behind schedule.
The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of
Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents
and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
2.        The bulk of Bank and IDA len'ding for the immediate future and
possibly for the next few years will be directed towards helping Thailand
meet its infrastructure needs, and the Bank will address itself particularly
to priority areas such as the expansion of domestic and export agriculture,
education, social improvements including family planning, and regional pro-
jects to achieve a wider distribution of development benefits.   One of the
main'functions of the Resident Mission in Bangkok will be to assist the
Government in developing projects in these fields.    IDA financing, while
softening the overall terms of our lending, will be employed to support
Thailand's efforts to tackle the problems of its less favored regions.
Some financing of local costs in appropriate cases will enable the Bank to
participate morb fully in basic developmental projects in agriculture,
education and social improvement.    A Consultative Group for Thailand,
which is chaired by the Bank met last in February 1972 and tIh next meeting
is tentatively scheduled for March 1973.
3.        During the balance of the current fiscal year, I expect to present
for your consideration loans and credits to assist the financing of six pro-
jects in Thailand.   Negotiations for the first IDA credit to Thailand, in
an amount of about $15 million for a third education project, are expected
to begin within the next two months.    A $5 million credit for the Chao
Phya (Central Plain) irrigation improvement project is under consideration.
A loan of about $37 million to help finance the modernization program of
the State Railways and a loan of about $40 million for the Bangkok water
supply project are also being considered.   The Asian Development Bank is
also considering a loan for the Bangkok water supply projact.   A Northeast
crop improvement project and the Pitsanuloke irrigation project are
scheduled to be appraised shortly.   Projects which are under consideration
for FY 1974 include the multipurpose power and irrigation Quai Yai project,
as well as seed multiplication, agricultural credit, industrial finance,
industrial estates, port development and Northeast urban infrastructure.
The Government of Japan, which in April 1972 signed a credit agreement with
the Government of Thailand, has expressed an interest in participating in
the financing of the telecammunications project, as well aa the railways
project, the Bangkokc water supply project and the Quai Yai project.

h.        On December 31, 1971 Bank loans outstanding to Thailand amounted
to $238.2 million representing 31% of the country's total external debt
of $773 million.   The level of Bank/IDA commitments is expected to increase
substantially over the next five years but should not exceed 30% of the
projected external debt.   Japan, which provided $60 million to help finance
the Second Plan (1967-1971), has, as noted above, agreed to provide about
$210 million for the Third Plan.   Other lenders to Thailand, notably the
US and the Asian Development Bank, are planning to increase their commitments
under the Third Plan.
5.        Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand look reasonably good and
an IFC mission is in Thailand to appraise a project for the expansion of a
synthetic fiber plant.

Extract from President's Report and Recommendation on a Proposed Loan to
the Telephone Organization of Thailand (R72-241).
THE ECCNOMY
1.        An economic mission visited Thailand for four weeks in
September 1972 to update the basic report on Thailand's Third Five-Year
Plan (1972-1976) that was distributed to the Executive Directors in
January 1972 (EAP-28).   The mission's preliminary findings and con-
clusions are as follows.
2.       GDP growth has been around 6 percent a year in real terms during
1970, 1971 and 1972, a significant slowdown compared with the average
annual growth of 9 percent daring the preceding four years.  The most
notable developments have been an absolute decline in private construction,
which was partly offset by large increases in expenditures of the public
sector (more than 10 percent in 1971 and again in 1972).
3.        The chain of events underlying production performance appears
to have been as follows.   After growing slowly for several years, exports
of goods and non-factor services showed unexpectedly large increases in
1971 (10 percent) and 1972 (13 percent) due to strong world demand for some
of Thailand's main export commodities and revival of services to the US
military.    As noted above, expenditures of the public sector for consump-
tion and investment also rose rapidly. However, the incremental incomes
thus generated were initially saved -- there is a lag of about 6 months in
the response of private consumption to changes in income and a lag of about
18 months in the response of private investment.  Imports therefore stag-
nated in 1971 and began to rise only in the first half of 1972, mostly for
consumption purposes.   In addition, import demand was dampened by price
increases resulting from the Government decision in 1971 to peg the baht
to the US dollar, thus in effect devaluing the baht with respect to the
currencies of some of Thailand's main trading partners, Japan and Western
European countries.  Rapid export growth  and slow import growth strength-
ened the balance of payments.   Theexternal resource deficit declined
from $317 million in 1970 to an estimated $165 million in 1972.  An inflow
of external capital, of which most was private and up to one third was short
term (attracted by interest rate differentials between Thai and foreign
money markets) raised foreign exchange reserves from $767 million at the
end of 1970 to $920 million at the end of August 1972.  On the domestic
side, the marked slowdown in private investment and the simultaneous strong
rise in private saving led to high liquidity in the economy, which was
reflected in the position of commercial banks.  Liquidity in the banking
system was further increased by the lack of flexibility in the interest
rate policy and lending practices of commercial banks.
4.        With a strengthened balance of payments and private investment
showing clear signs of improvement, the outlook earlier this year for econ-
omic performance in 1973 was bright.  However, a drought last summer is
expected to affect adversely the production and export in 1973 of rice,
kenaf and especially maize.   Merchandise exports are expected to show
only a very small increase and the same is expected of services to the US
military.   This will come at a time when private investment will respond
strongly to previous increases in incame.  Demand for imports is therefore



Annex II
Page 4
likely to rise sharply and to put pressure on the external position. A
reserve loss of at least $50 million is forecast for 1973 despite a rising
inflow of external private capital to finance private imports of equipment
and durables.  However, the high level of foreign exchange reserves can
be safely reduced and this will help the eoonomy ride out the setback in
agriculture, which hopefully will not occur again next year.
5.        The recent trend in budgetary savings is a cause for concern.
Tax revenue increased rapidly in fiscal 1972 (9 percent) and measures were
taken to raise additional revenue in fiscal 1973.  However, Government
spending on current account is rising even more rapidly mainly to meet
the needs of security, education and debt service, as well as to provide
for an increase in Government salaries in fiscal 1973.  As a result the
current budgetary surplus has been virtually eliminated, and capital ex-
penditures have been curtailed in fiscal 1972 and 1973 to keep the budget
deficit within limits compatible with price and external stability.  It
is urgent for the Government to review its current spending and eliminate
those items which lead to excessive growth;  some were identified in last
year's basic report.  However, the Government is not well prepared to
undertake such a review, which would in any case be a lengthy process. In
the meantime, additional tax revenue~.: will be needed, and the Bt 2 billion
target for this objective in the Third Plan (10 percent of 1973 tax revenue)
is a strict minimum for the remainder of the Plan period.
6.        Thailand began its Third Five-Year Plan on October 1, 1971 aiming
at GDP growth of 7 percent a year. As noted, GDP growth was below target
in 1972 and may be so again in 1973.  The expected stagnation of exports
in 1973 may lead to another cycle of slow growth in domestic demand as happened
in 1970-72.  kJether the target growth rate can be achieved or exceeded in
late years of the Plan. period will depend above all on the success of
Government efforts to promote production, particularly for export. Hence
the necessity for the Government to press on with the adninistrative reforms
that would make its support of private production activities more effective.
7.        This is particularly true in agriculture.  Beyond any doubt
supply is the bottleneck in the expansion of agricultural production and
exports; world demand for most Thai ccanmodities is strong and expanding.
A number of crucial policy changes and development projects designed to
relieve the production bottleneck were listed in last year's basic report
and agreed upon with the Thai authorities.  But the first year of the Plan
has seen few steps towards implementation.  In fact, it is reported that
the promotion of agricultural export products and import substitutes (maize,
soybean, silk, shrimp, livestock, coconut, tobacco and cotton) was held back
by insufficient budgetary allocations. A major reorganization of services
dealing with agriculture is about to be made.  It is hoped that when the
reorganization is implemented the Ministry of Agriculture will be in a posi-
tion to increase the effectiveness of its assistance to farmers.
8.       In manufacturing, the situation is more promising. Fiscal incentives
to exporters have been introduced and are being used.  Authorization for
the establishmeiit of duty free zones for export is imminent.  More importantly
perhaps, several subsectors (for instance, textiles, cement, food processing



Annex II
Page 5
and wood working) are finding export markets profitable, and receive
assistance from the Government in their efforts to penetrate external
narkets.   The ambitious Plan targets for exports of manufactures are
likely to be exceeded.   Still, the collaboration between Government and
industrialists could be improved further.   For instance, maritime freight
rates seem to be excessive and thus to reduce the price competitiveness of
Thai manufactures abroad.   There is a need for close coordination between
the Government and Thai exporters to negotiate rate reductions with the
Conference shipping lines serving the port of Bangkok.
9.        In addition to difficulties in production, problems of financial
management remain.   The need for an increased tax effort has already been
highlighted.   There is also a need to develop domestic financial institu-
tions which would mobilize long-term savings domestic&Jly and abroad for
the financing of private investment.   This issue hinges essentially on
changes in taxation and regulations that would eliminate the existing dis-
crimination against financial institutions other than commercial banks.
In particular, institutions specializing in the financing of agriculture,
small industries and residential construction should be encouraged as they
could help raise the level of investment in these sectors by offering more
suitable terms and services to borrowers.    Similarly, there is a need
to develop domestic institutions which would borrow on favorable terms
from official sources of external capital for onlending to private investors
to finance equipment imports.   These institutions could in part replace
foreign suppliers' credit and thus help reduce the growth of Thailand's
external debt service liabilities.
10.       The proposed loan for the fifth highway project is part of the
Government's program of external public borrowings during the Third Plan
period. This program, which calls for commitments of official loans
totalling about $900 million in 1972-1976, was accepted by the Consultative
Group for Thailand in February 1972. After nearly one year, some slippage
may be observed due to delays in project preparation, particularly in
agriculture.   Preparation of suitable projects will require a great deal
of effort, and the Bank resident mission, which arrived in Bangkok on
October 15, will be able to help.
11.       Notwithstanding the recent improvement in the balance of payments
the above borrowings and the private borrowings required to cover the prospective
external resource deficit, while maintaining exchange reserves at a safe level,
are expected to push external debt service obligations slightly above 20 percent
of goods and non-factor services exports by 1976 compared to 17 percent in
1971.    Longer-term prospects are for a further increase of the debt service
burden.   Nevertheless, Thailand has a considerable margin of creditworthiness
for borrowing on conventional terms. The growth of debt service can be mitigated
by softer terms on the official loans sought by the Government (for instance,
IDA financing is proposed for a forthcoming education project), and especially
by taking steps as explained in paragraph 10 to replace a part of suppliers'
credit by more favorable official loans to finance private equipment imports
in future.
