through corporate\n            and financial restructuring and physical rehabilitation. In\n            order to ensure sound management of the refinery, the\n            Government has established Bangchak Petroleum Company, Ltd.\n            (BCP), a fully autonomous and commercial company, to operate\n            and manage the refinery. The Government appointed a strong\n            board of directors and a managing director who is BCP's\n            chief operating officer. In addition, a management and\n            operations team from Caltex Petroleum Corporation (US) was\n            appointed for in-line positions directly under the managing\n            director. The Bangchak Oil Refinery Restructuring Project\n            covers the physical rehabilitation of the refinery,\n            operations and infrastructure improvement, energy\n            conservation and engineering and management assistance. A\n            study will be undertaken to determine further modifications\n            required to ensure that the product mix of all refineries in\n            Thailand will be in balance with the projected demand\n            profile for petroleum products in the country."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
