BANGCHAK OIL REFINERY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:      Bangchak Petroleum Company Ltd. (BCP)
Guarantor:     Kingdom of Thailand
Loan Amount:   US$85.0 million equivalent
Terms:         15 years including 5 years of grace at Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Guarantee Fee: 10% of Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description:   The proposed project supports the Government's program to
make the Bangchak oil refinery financially viable through
corporate and financial restructuring and physical
rehabilitation. In order to ensure sound management of the
refinery, the Government has established BCP, a fully
autonomous and commercial company, to operate and manage the
refinery. The Government appointed a strong board of
directors and a managing director who is BCP's chief
operating officer. In addition, a management and operations
team from Caltex Petroleum Corporation (US) was appointed
for in-line positions directly under the managing director.
The proposed project covers the physical rehabilitation of
the refinery, operations and infrastructure improvement,
energy conservation and engineering and management
assistance. A study will be undertaken to determine further
modifications required to ensure that the product mix of all
refineries in Thailand will be in balance with the projected
demand profile for petroleum products in the country.
Risks:         The project does not face any significant risks that would
impede its efficient implementation. The technologies that
will be used are commercially proven. Comprehensive repair
and maintenance and staff training programs are provided for
in the project. Environmental safeguards have been
incorporated in the project through (i) infrastructure
improvements to minimize the oil sludge being dumped into
ponds; and (ii) installation of a new sulphur plant to lower
discharge of sulphur oxide. Marketing and distribution
systems in Thailand are well-coordinated. BCP's corporate
and financial structure is sound and adequate measures are
provided in the project to maintain the company's satis-
factory performance.

BANGCHAK OIL REFINERY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Royal Thai Government (RTG) has requested Bank assistance for
the financing and implementation of the Bangchak Oil Refinery Restructuring
Project (the Project). The Project will (i) assist the Government in
carrying out a progran of physical, organizational, manageplent and
financial restructuring of the state-owned Bangchak Oil Refinery (BOR);
(ii) reduce the cost of meeting the petroleum requirements of Thailand in
the short- to medium-term; and (iii) determine the modifications required
in Thailand's refineries to balance national demand and supply of petroleum
products in the long-run. BOR is expected to play a pivotal role in the
development of Thailand's refinery subsector. Under the provisions of the
Fifth National Economic and Social Development Plan (1982-1986), RTG
attaches highest priority to investments in the energy sector to promote
efficient use of available resources and thereby reduce the country's
dependence on energy imports. In the petroleum sector, the rationalization
of the country's oil refining capacity is an important objective towards
which the Project is expected to make a significant contribution. This
Project is also regarded by the Government as a model for future reforms of
state economic enterprises in Thailand.
1.02      The proposed Project is an integral part of RTG's program of
corporate and financial restructuring, and physical rehabilitation of BOR.
This program, which is aimed primarily at making the refinery financially
viable, was developed and is being implemented closely with the Bank.  As a
first step, BOR, which had been run in the past as a Government dependency
under the Ministry of Defense, has been established as a fully autonomous
and commercial company. The company, known as the Bangchak Petroleum Co.,
Ltd. (BCP), will be responsible for the refinery's management and
operations and the implementation of the Project. The refinery's past
accumulated losses, which were then financed by the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT), have been paid off through PTT's issuance of 20-year
floating rate notes of up to US$145 million guaranteed by the Government.
The Government will be fully responsible for the servicing of the notes.
In addition, BCP has obtained a credit line of up to US$120 million to
support its working capital needs. A total of US$126 million was provided
as equity by RTG (US$82.5 million), Krung Thai Bank, a Government-owned
commercial bank (US$7.5 million), and PTT (US$36 million). This Project,
which covers the physical rehabilitation of BCP, will complete the
restructuring program, and will be instrumental in setting the refinery on
the path of financial viability. The physical rehabilitation will have a
total installed cost of US$121.1 million. Including interest during
construction, total financing required will amount to US$143.8 million, of
which US$127.2 million (88%) is in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank
loan of US$85 million, which will be the first Bank operation in the
refinery subsector in Thailand, will provide 59% of the financing
requirements, or 67% of the foreign exchange needs. The balance of US$58.8



-2-
million will be provided through suppliers' credits (US$30.8 million),
commercial banks (US$13 million), and equity contributions from the
Government (US$7.5 million) and Krung Thai Bank (US$7.5 million).
1.03      The establishment of BCP as an independent commercial entity is
regarded as a first step to attract private equity into the refinery.
Various private companies were approached by the Government in connection
with equity financing for the new company. However, these companies
declined to provide equity at this time in view of the poor physical state
of the refinery. After the refinery has been rehabilitated and made
financially viable under the proposed Project, it is expected that the
private sector will participate in a subsequent project involving the
installation of secondary conversion facilities. A feasibility study to
determine the most economic conversion configuration is included in the
proposed Project.
1.04      The Project was identified by a Bank mission to Thailand in
September 1982. It was prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and BOR with
the assistance, at various stages, of Lummus Operating Associates (US),
Chiyoda Chemical Construction Co. (Japan) and Mitsubishi Oil Co. (Japan).
The Project was appraised in November-December 1982 by Messrs. J.R. Gamba
(Chief), L. Wijetilleke, and Ms. P. Urbano (IND); Mr. J. Correia Da Silva
(LEG); and Messrs. T. Gunawardhana and S. Valaisathian (Consultants).
Appraisal follow-up missions visited Thailand in 1983 and 1984 to finalize
the institutional and Project implementation arrangements.
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Introduction
2.01      Over the last two decades, Thailand has been almost totally
dependent on imported petroleum for its primary energy requirements. In
1980, imported petroleum accounted for about 76% of the country's total
energy requirements; hydroelectricity provided 3%; coal/lignite, 3%; fuel
wood and charcoal, 11%; and bagasse, 7%. The import bill for petroleum in
1980, which amounted to US$2.6 billion, represented 31% of total imports
and absorbed 45% of the economy's export earnings. The availability of
large quantities of natural gas since 1981, however, is expected to have a
major structural impact on energy sources in the 1980s. Natural gas use
has already lowered the share of primary energy supplied by petroleum from
82% in 1970 to 56% in 1983. By 1985, with increased production of natural
gas and the completion of an ongoing liquified petroleum gas project, the
share of petroleum in total energy requirements is expected to fall even
further. This rapid decline in share will affect principally the demand
for fuel oil, which will be replaced with natural gas, and to a lesser
extent gasoline, high-speed automotive diesel oil and kerosene. The
resulting change in demand profile for petroleum products cannot be
economically met by the existing refineries unless appropriate changes in
their production pattern are made. The Thai Oil Refinery Company (TORC),



-3-
which has the same distillation capacity as BCP, has already embarked on a
refinery modification project, which includes a hydrocracker. Esso
Refinery, on the other hand, recently completed a project which only
expanded its crude distillation capacity with no change the yield pattern.
BCP's current plans include only the rehabilitation of existing facilities
supported by this Project. Even after the completion of these projects, a
deficit in middle distillate products and a surplus in fuel oil are still
projected in the future. In order to balance national supply and demand in
the future, it is therefore necessary for Thailand to consider adding
secondary conversion facilities. Techno-economic studies to establish the
optimal conversion scheme are included in this Project.
B. Historical Energy Consumption
2.02      Over the past decade, consumption of primary energy in Thailand
increased at an average annual rate of 9.6%--from 5.4 million tons of oil
equivalent (toe) in 1970 to 14.4 million toe in 1980--as shown on the
following page.  Growth of energy consumption was fast during much of the
1970s as a result of rapid growth in and structural transformation of the
economy.  The latter included the expansion of commercial agriculture with
heavier reliance on truck transportation and a rapidly expanding road
network, rapid growth of the industrial and service sectors, and higher
personal incomes leading to more intensive private use of energy for
automobiles, air conditioners, lighting and home appliances. The continued
growth in energy consumption was also due to the fact that domestic energy
prices were not adjusted in line with the escalation of international oil
prices which occurred in the 1970s. Since domestic energy resources
remained underdeveloped, most of the growth in energy demand spilled over
into rapidly expanding energy imports (mostly petroleum). In 1978, energy
imports accounted for 21% of total imports and absorbed 28% of export
earnings. After the second oil shock, the share of Thailand's energy
imports in total imports increased to 31%, and 45% of the economy's export
earnings were required to finance energy imports alone in 1980. In recent
years, the Government initiated a series of steps to reduce oil consump-
tion: more rational pricing policies were implemented and energy
conservation measures were introduced. These measures, along with the
development of indigenous energy sources, especially natural gas and
lignite, have succeeded in reducing the share of petroleum fuels in total
energy consumption from 83% in 1978 to 76% in 1980 and further to 56% in
1983.
2,03      The structural transformation of the economy in the 1970s
resulted in significant changes in the sectoral composition of energy
consumption. With the rapid expansion of the country"s road network, the
transportation sector continued to account for the greater share of total
energy consumption. Through special legislation and regulations for energy
conservation introduced since 1978, however, the sector's share in total
energy consumption declined from 34% in 1977 to 31% in 1983, as shown
on the following page. The power sector, on the other hand, increased its

share from 20% in 1977 to 23% in 1983. This increase was brought about by
the availability of larger quantities of coal and lignite for power
generation. The domestic, commercial and service sectors more than doubled
their combined share in consumption from 9% in 1977 to 25% in 1983 in
direct response to higher personal incomes which allowed increased private
use of energy. The industrial sector's share declined from 28% in 1977 to
14% in 1983 due principally to more efficient energy utilization.

2.04      Prospects for reducing Thailand's depeadence on imported energy
in the 1980s are good.  The Governmunt's policy is to reduce Thailand's
dependernce on imported energy by (a) expanded development of indigenous
energy resources such as natural gas, lignite and hydro; (b) continuing to
pursue rational pricing policies; and (c) conservation programs.  Based on



- 5 -
the development of the natural gas and lignite resources proven to date and
on the continued expansion of its hydro potential, the Government estimates
that Thailand can reduce its share of imported energy for power generation
from about 71% in FY81 to less than 20% in FY90. However, except with
substantial increase in the natural gas and lignite reserves or development
of international hydro potential, Thailand will re-emerge in the l990s as a
major importer of energy for its power sector. In transportation and
industry, the other large energy consuming sectors, the prospects for
converting to other energy forms are rather limited. Thus, there is a need
to curtail energy demand and encourage greater energy conservation. This
matter is discussed further in paras 2.12 to 2.14 below.
C. 
1.   Natural Gas
2.05      Proven and probable economically recoverable natural gas reserves
in Thailand are currently indicated to be about 5.5 trillion cubic feet
(tcf), of which about 3 tcf are proven and under development. These
estimates have been revised downward from those made previously, as field
performance now indicates that the recoverable fraction of in-place
reserves will be far lower than originally expected, and, in fact, lower
than that for most gas fields in. other countries. Latest data suggests
that the ultimate economically recoverable reserves (including those yet to
be discovered) could be in the range of 12-24 tcf. By the end of this
decade, natural gas production is expected to reach some 550 million cubic
feet per day (MMCFD), equivalent to some 6 million toe per annum, About
40% of the projected total power generation could be thermal stations using
natural gas, thereby reducing substantially fue' oil demand.
2.   Oil
2.06      Exploration in Thailand has recently led to expectations of
domestic production of oil and natural gas liquids beyond what was thought
possible when the Fifth Plan was prepared. Proved economically recoverable
reserves of petroleum liquids (oil and gas condensate) are presently
estimated at about 140 million barrels (bbls). Current production is about
30,000 barrels per day (bpd). Subject to continued efforts and timely
development of future discoveries, production in 1990 is expected to range
between 30-45,000 bpd. The ultimate liquid resource, including that yet to
be discovered, could be in the range of 0.7-1,5 billion bbls based on
present information. In addition to these crude oil deposits, there are
oil shale deposits in Tak Province near the Burmese border with an
estimated yield of about 10 million toe per year. The Department of
Mineral Resources (DMR), with the assistance of the Federal Republic of
Germany, has initiated studies to determine the technical feasibility and
economic viability of developing these oil shale resources. However, at
current and projected crude oil prices until the end of this century, oil
shale development is unlikely to be economicaily viable in Thailand.



-6-
3. Lignite Reserves
2.07      Recent drillings indicate that Thailand's lignite deposits are
substantially larger than previously anticipated. However, lignite is
relatively uneconomical to transport because of its high moisture and ash
content, while its tendency to decompose and self-ignite in open air makes
it unsafe to store. Hence, in Thailand as elsewhere, lignite is used
almost exclusively for large-scale pit head power generation. The
presently known lignite reserves totalling 859 million tons are located at
Mae Moh (814 million tons), Krabi (20 million tons), Li (10 million tons)
and various other locations. About 350 million tons of the reserves at Mae
Moh are measured and sufficient to sustain a total generating capacity of
1,725 MW for about 25 years. By 1990, about 25% of the total power
generation of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is
expected to be from lignite-fired thermal stations.
4. Hydro Potential
2.08      The total hydroelectric potential of Thailand's rivers is
estimated at about 9,300 MW, not including the potential of 25,000 MW from
the international rivers (Mekong and Salween), whose development is at
present unlikely due to major political and social obstacles. About 1,380
MW of hydropower capacity are now in operation, 2,100 MW are under
construction, and about 2,500 MW in 25 projects are in stages of
identification or feasibility study. Mini-hydro potential, estimated at
about 3,290 MW, exists at over one hundred sites. According to current
plans, hydropower production will increase at an average annual rate of
about 7% from 1985 onwards and is expected to supply about 35% of
electricity generation in 1990.
5. Other Energy Resources
2.09      Thailand's other energy resources include fuelwood and possibly
geothermal energy. Fuelwood resources, once plentiful, are rapidly
depleting and deforestation is becoming a serious problem. Geothermal
exploration is being carried out by EGAT in the northern part of Thailand
near Chiang Mai.
D. Projected Commercial Energy Balance
2.10      Over the last two decades commercial energy consumption
(petroleum, hydro and lignite) increased at an average rate of 12.4% p.a.
from 1.6 million toe in 1960 to 16.6 million toe in 1980. GDP growth
during that period averaged 7.4% p.a., indicating an average energy demand
elasticity with respect to GDP of about 1.68. However, this elasticity
dropped substantially from a high value of 1.85 in the early 1960s to 1.2
in the late 1970s. Energy consumption trends since 1980 have shown further
weakening of the relationship between GDP and energy demand growth, as has
been the case elsewhere in developing and industrialized countries alike.
Assuming that conservation measures are carried out effectively, including
continued timely adjustments of domestic energy prices in line with any



future increases in international prices, and that as a result the energy
efficiency of the Thai economy will further improve, this elasticity is
projected to drop to about 1.0 during the next 10 years. GDP is projected
to grow at 6.1% p.a. during 1985-90 and at 6.0% p.a. between 1990-95, while
total energy consumption growth during 1985-95 is estimated to be about
6.1% p.a., as shown on the following page.
2.11      The relatively modest energy consumption growth is expected to be
accompanied by a significant structural shift in the composition of energy
sources during the 1980s. The most significant change would be the
increased availability of domestic natural gas which will displace
petroleum sources used by industry and for electricity generation. On the
basis of reasonable assumptions regarding likely gas availability and
utilization, gas consumption is projected to increase its share in total
commercial energy consumption from 10% in 1983 to 21% in 1985 and 24% by
1990. Lignite consumption is also expected to post a rapid growth rate
during the 1980s in line with increases in domestic production capacity and
power generation requirements. Oil consumption, in contrast, is projected
to increase at a slow rate of 3% p.a. during 1985-90 compared to 8% during
1970-83. As a result, the share of oil in total primary commercial energy
demand would drop from 76% in 1980 to 64% in 1985, 57% in 1990, and 46% by
1995. This projected decline in share reflects the significant substitu-
tion of fuel oil and diesel oil (about 5 million tons and 0.6 million tons
per year, respectively, by 1990) by natural gas and lignite for power
generation.
E. Scope for Energy Substitution and Conservation
2.12      The Government has exerted efforts to improve energy demand
management mainly through pricing policies and regulatory measures. In
energy pricing, RTG has generally followed a policy of passing on to the
consumer increases in energy costs by way of general price increases and
specific taxes on higher consumption. Special legislation and regulations
for energy conservation introduced since 19751/ include: (i) instructions
to Government agencies to reduce oil and electricity consumption by 10%;
(ii) regulations to reduce use of electricity during peak-hour periods;
(iii) traffic laws aimed at reducing traffic bottlenecks in Bangkok; (iv)
regulations to reduce business hours of gasoline service stations; (v)
restrictions on purchases by the Government of automobiles with engine
capacities higher than 1300 cc; and (vi) concessions, in the form of
exemptions from import duties and business taxes on import of energy saving
equipment, extended by the Board of Investments to promote energy
conservation in industries. In addition, public education campaigns are
conducted by the Government and industrial organizations to develop
awareness of energy conservation.

2.13      The energy conservation achieved so far has been mainly through
avoidance of waste and adoption of "in-house" improvements by energy
users. Such improvements consist of low-cost simple changes in procedures
and practices of energy utilization such as pre-heating of boiler water,
plugging of leaks, and changing of thermostat settings. Subsequient stages
of conservation would require modifications to equipment as well as to
industrial processing configurations to improve energy efficiency. These
would include repair/modifications/replacements of ancillary equipment,
installation of additional equipment to recover waste-heat, changes to
plant lay-outs and improvements to enable the use of more economical fuels
such as coal or natural gas. Although further energy conservation would
require greater efforts and additional investment, substantial energy
savings would result in the overall economy. Review of energy utilization
practices and the energy efficiencies obtained in various sectors of the
economy indicate that the potential exists to realize energy savings of as
much as 20-25% in the fature2/.

2.14      In recognition of the potential for achieving additional energy
conservation, the Government is keen on imnproving its programs and policies
in energy conservation and has formulated an Energy Conservation Plan for
1982-86. The Plan envisages: (i) completion of detailed energy audits of
600 factories; (ii) as part of its structural adjustment program with the
Bank, establishment of an Energy Conservation Center as a joint venture of
Government and private industry to provide technical services for conserva-
tion; (iii) monitoring of energy use of large industrial establishments;
(iv) provision of incentives for energy conservation in industry; and (v)
introduction of an Energy Management Law to better regulate energy-use in
the country. While the formulation of the Plan constitutes an important
step towards improving the energy conservation performance of the economy,
its successful implementation will require experience and capabilities in
the field of energy conservation of a level substantially higher than -hose
available in Thailand.  Further Bank assistance in this field will be
necessary.
F. Energy Pricing Polic
2.15      Until 1978, Thailand's domestic energy price adjustments were
restrained in order to encourage economic development. Since then,
however, the Government has increased energy prices (by 160-180% between
1978-82) to reflect international price developments. Electricity tariffs
have also been raised and broadly reflect the marginal cost of power
generation, being set at levels that generate a financial rate of return of
about 8% on revalued assets.
2.16      Thailand has established the price levels for its commercial fuel
on an individual basis and the pricing system is not fully coordinated
across the energy sector. The introduction of natural gas on a large
scale, the development of a major lignite mine and changes in petroleum
product prices (paras 3.17-3.19 below) are leading to substantial changes
in energy consumption and investment patterns. The Government, with the
assistance of consultants, has recently completed two closely coordinated
energy pricing studies to rationalize the pricing policies across the whole
energy sector and to provide for the efficient utilization of the energy
resources. The final reports and policy implementation will shortly be
reviewed between the Bank and the Government.
G. Institutional Framework
2.17      Overall responsibility for planning and investment decisions in
the energy sector is vested in the National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB) in the Prime Minister's Office. However, specific energy
planning and energy policy formulation functions are scattered among
several Government ministries and agencies. In addition, several
committees and sub-committees deal with energy and petroleum related
policies. Given this complex organization, it has not been easy to
coordinate energy sector activities and policies in a systematic manner.
The Government is aware of this problem and has, as a first step, selected



- 10 -
the National Energy Administration (NEA) in the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Energy to undertake, in consultation with other concerned
agencies, the responsibility for (a) monitoring energy sector studies and
programs, (b) evaluating those which are completed, (c) proposing
appropriate measures for implementation, and (d) identifying areas for
further investigation. The NEA will complete the initial stock-taking of
these studies and prepare a medium-term energy strategy to achieve the plan
objectives and targets. Subsequently, this agency for policy coordination
will be retained on a continuous basis so that shifts in the energy sector
are taken into account in further strategy formulation and implementation.
2.18       The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in the Ministry of
Industry handles the technical and legal aspects of all mineral activities,
including oil and gas exploration and exploitation licensing arrangements,
and is also responsible for non-power lignite mining. The Ministry of
Industry is responsible for setting ex-refinery prices and taxation policy,
and for the ministerial control of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT). The Ministry of Commerce sets margins between ex-refinery and
retail prices and the minimum oil stocks to be maintained. The Ministry of
Defense, through its Defense Energy Department (DED), manages small oil
fields and operates a pilot refinery at Fang. Prior to the establishment
of BCP (Chapter IV), the Bangchak refinery was operated by the Defense
Energy Department. The Ministry of Science, Technology and Energy is
responsible for NEA and for non-conventional energy. The Prime Minister's
Office and the Cabinet take a direct interest in determining retail prices
of petroleum products. The Prime Minister's office is also responsible for
EGAT, the largest state-owned enterprise. In addition to power generation,
EGAT is responsible for exploration and development of lignite for use in
power plants. Retail distribution of electricity under the Metropolitan
Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
are controlled by the Ministry of Interior. Other institutions involved
include the Budget Bureau which controls budgetary aspects of locally
funded costs. An organization chart for the energy sector is shown in
Annex 2-1.
H.   Bank Participation in the Sector
2.19      The Bank has taken an active role in support of the Government's
development objectives and policy reform in the energy sector through loans
for exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and
structural adjustment. The first loan to the oil and gas subsector was
made in July 1978 for the preparation and engineering of a gas pipeline
project. This was followed by a $107 million loan in December 1979 for the
pipeline construction. A subsequent loan of $90 million was approved in
June 1982 to help finance the construction of a gas separation plant and
associated facilities for the marketing and distribution of LPG. The
project also included a large technical assistance component covering
training for PTT's staff, strengthening PTT's institutional capabilities,
and various studies for PTT's investment programs and energy policy
formulation. In addition, a US$33 million loan to PTT for the development,



- 11 -
jointly with Thai She'll, of oil and gas reserves in northern Thailand is in
an advanced stage of preparation.
2.20      In the power and lignite subsector, the Bank has made eleven
loans to EGAT and its predecessor totalling $542 million to help finance
power plants and transmission facilities and three loans totalling $130
million to PEA to finance accelerated rural electrification projects. The
first seven EGAT projects have been completed satisfactorily. Good
progress is being made with the other EGAT and PEA loans. A further loan
was made to EGAT in 1980 for lignite production. The Bank approved in
April 1984 a loan of US$59 million for a second lignite project. In
relation to policy reform in the energy sector, the Bank has supported
various technical assistance programs including an extensive energy pricing
study and energy conservation measures through two structural adjustment
loans. In addition, the Bank is working closely with NESDB and NEA on
energy pricing and strategy formulation which would form the basis for the
energy component of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
III. PETROLEUM PRODUCTS SUBSECTOR AND ISSUES
A. Consumption and Supply of Petroleum Products
3.01      As noted earlier, petroleum products consumption grew at a rapid
pace in the 1970s as a result of increased industrial activity, fast growth
in the service sectors and higher private use of automobiles, air
conditioners, lighting and home appliances. Consumption increased at an
average annual rate of 11% over the period 1970-75 and 8% over 1975-80, as
shown in the following page. Consumption of gasoline increased at a high
rate of 13% p.a. during 1970-75 as a result of the rapid expansion of the
country's road network and insufficient price adjustments (para 2.02).
With the price corrections and conservation measures introduced since 1978,
the increase in gasoline consumption has slowed down to 6% p.a. Consump-
tion of diesel oil, on the other hand, increased at an average rate of 6%
p.a. during 1970-75 and 9% p.a. during 1975-80. This growth pattern
reflects the increase in farm mechanization as well as higher diesel oil
use for mass transportation and power generation during the period. Diesel
oil also continued to dominate the petroleum fuels consumption profile with
about 36% share by 1980. Fuel oil consumption grew at 13% p.a. during
1970-75 and 10% during 1975-80, but with its substitution by natural gas it
registered a drop of 6% p.a. during 1980-83.
3.02      The shifts in the consumption profile reflect the changes that
have occurred in the sectoral use of petroleum. The sectoral consumption
of petroleum products in 1981 is shown on page 13 of this Report. In 1981,
the transportation sector accounted for 42% of total petroleum fuels
consumption, followed by the industrial sector with 31% (18% from direct
use and 13% indirectly through power use). Consumption in the transport
sector increased at an average annual rate of 7% during the 1970s. Since

1979, however, consumption has declined slightly partly in response to the
economic slowdown and partly due to gains in fuel efficiency brought about
by increased fuel prices, progressive taxation of engine capacity and shift
in fleet composition towards fuel-efficient models. Direct petroleum
product consumption in the manufacturing sector developed similarly as in
the transport sector, increasing at an average annual rate of 4% during the
1970s, then witnessing a slight decline in absolute terms since 1979 as a
result of a slowfdown in industrial activity and improvements in the
sector's energy efficiency. The sector relies most heavily on fuel oil.
Future growth in industry will in part draw on domestic gas resources to
replace present fuel oil use and to support expansion of industrial
development into new areas, especially as feedstock for fertilizer and
petrochemicals.
3.03      Substantial reductions in petroleum product consumption have been
observed since 1979 in all major sectors of the Thai economy (overall
consumption decreased by 4% from 1979 to 1982). The scope for further
reductions in consumtption across the sectors depends on each sector's
capability to (a) substitute natural gas and coal/lignite for oil,
especially in industry and power generation, and (b) reduce energy
intensity in petroleum fuels used for transportation (gasoline and diesel),
agriculture (diesel) and industry (fuel oil).
3.04      Thailand imports almost all of its petroleum requirements.  In
recent years, the country imported an average of about 10 million tons of
crude and oil products per year which, in 1978, cost about US$ 1 billion,
By 1980, the oil import bill had almost tripled to US$2.6 billion,
primarily as a result of the second oil shock.  The volume of petroleum
imports (of which 25% was in the form of refined products) grew at an
average annual rate of 9% over 1970 to 1980, For t7ae future, however,
projections of Thailand's commercial energy balance (para 2.J0) indicate
that between 1985 and 1990, oil imports would grow at a substantially
slower pace of about 2% p.a. In proportion to total commercial energy

3.06       As noted, future consumption of petroleum products is projected
to increase at a slower pace as a result of more extensive substitution of
natural gas and lignite mainly for fuel oil in industry and power
generation, and higher efficiency in etnergy use across the sectors. Total
consumption is projected to increase at average annual rates of 3% during
1985-90 and 2% during 1990-95.  The growth rates registered in the past



- 14 -
were 11% (1970-75) and 8% (1975-80). Gasoline consumption is projected to
decline at a rate of about 4% p.a. up to 1985 as the trend for substituting
gasoline with LPG in motor cars continues and additional energy efficiency
measures in the transport sector are implemented. Mid-distillates
consumption, on the other hand, is expected to maintain its rapid growth at
a rate of about 8% p.a. up to 1985 then level off at an average annual
growth of 4% up to 1995. By 1990, about 0.6 million tons per year of
diesel oil used by EGAT for power generation is expected to be replaced
with natural gas, and another 0.2 million tons per year by LPG in the
transport sector. As for fuel oil, its consumption is projected to decline
sharply at a rate of about 8% p.a. during 1985-90 due to increased
substitution by natural gas. By 1990, nearly 5 million tons per year of
natural gas would replace energy that would have otherwise been provided by
fuel oil.
B. Projected Petroleum Products Balance
3.07      Total production from Thailand's four refineries (TORC, Esso,
Bangchak and Fang) currently amounts to about 8 million tons per year
(tpy). By 1988, even after completion of TORC's hydrocracking facilities,
the rehabilitation of Bangchak and the expansion of Esso (paras 3.14 and
3.15 below), substantial product imbalances are still expected to occur, as
shown below:
Thailand - Projected Petroleum Products Balance, 1987-95

3.08      The above projections indicate that late in the 1980s, large
imbalances between supply and demand will develop, with substantial
deficits in mid-distillate products and surpluses of fuel oil. The above
production is projected on the basis of light Saudi Arabia crude oil;
should crudes get heavier, as generally expected in the 1990s onwards,
the net yield of mid-distillates will decline with corresponding increase
in fuel oil, thus exacerbating the projected imbalances. The Government,
therefore, needs to analyze in detail possible options to minimize
economically the above imbalances. The main options available to Thailand
to balance demand and supply in the long run are to: (a) increase crude
distillation capacity; (b) install secondary conversion facilities to
convert the surplus low-value fuel oil into premium value mid-distillates;
or (c) import deficit products and export surplus fuel oil. The proposed
Project will provide financing to help the Government evaluate these
options and determine the one most economically advantageous to Thailand
(para 5.09).

C. Petroleum Subsector Organization
3.09      Overall responsibility for planning and investment decisions in
the petroleum refining sector is vested in the National Petroleum Policy
Committee (NPPC) which was appointed by the Cabinet in March 1981.  The
NPPC, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, sets policies and targets for
the development of the petroleum industry and the pricing of petroleum
products.  It appoints sub-committees as needed for performing assigned
functions.  Currently, there are two sub-committees: (i) sub-committee on
procurement planning, pricing and compensation of petroleum products; and
the sub-committee on refinery expansion.
1. Exploration and Production
3.10      The exploration and production of petroleum in Thailand is
undertaken by both the Government and the private sector. Exploration,
both inland and offshore, is done primarily by private concessionaires.
Exploration activities are monitored by the Department of Mineral Resources
in the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of Defense currently produces
crude oil at a rate of 150-400 barrels per day from 17 wells at Amphur Fang
in Chiang Mai Province.
2. Refining
3.11      Thailand has a total refining capacity of 9.8 million tpy which
is distributed among four refining companies as follows:

(in million tons per year)

3.12      TORC is a joint venture between PTT and the private sector each
of which owns 49% of TORC's equity; the Crown Property Bureau holds the
remaining 2%. The main private shareholders are Shell Company of Thailand
Ltd. and Caltex Oil (Thailand) Ltd. which are the local subsidiaries of the
respective international oil companies. TORC is operated under an
operating and service contract with Shell. The Esso refinery is fully



- 16 -
owned by Esso Eastern, Inc., a subsidiary of Exxon (US), while the Fang
refinery, which is operated by DED primarily as a pilot plant, is owned by
RTG. The recent operating performance of the three major refineries is
shown in Annex 3-1 and summarized on the following page.
3.13      Over the last two years, the Bangchak refinery has operated below
its rated capacity, Bangchak's capacity utilization during this period
averaged 78% while TORC and Esso averaged 99% and 108%, respectively. TORC
and Esso have consistently followed a satisfactory repair and maintenance
program. In addition, they have supplied a wide range of technical and
training services to their refineries and staff. Bangchak, in contrast,
has made inadequate repair and maintenance of its processing facilities
resulting in a reduction in crude throughput from 65,000 barrels per
calendar day (bpcd) to 45,000 bpcd. Furthermore, Bangchak's general
operations have weakened with the departure in 1981 of Summit management
personnel (para 4.01 below). With regard to the refineries' product yield,
Bangchak accounted for about 46% of the total fuel oil produced in the
two-year period, while TORC and Esso accounted for only 23% and 31%,
respectively. The low fuel oil production in TORC is primarily due to the
existence of secondary conversion facilities, including a 6,500 bpcd fluid
catalytic cracker (FCC) and a 12,000 bpcd visbreaker. The FCC unit allows
further production of about 4,000 bpcd of high quality liquid distillates
and 600 bpcd of LPG, while the visbreaker yields about 1,500 bpcd of
blendable distillate products. Bangchak and Esso, on the other hand, are
simple in configuration and have no secondary processing facilities for
conversion of fuel oil to middle distillates.
3. Refinery Expansion Plans
3.14      In 1980  the Government, through PTT, requested Bank assistance
to review the proposal by TORC to expand capacity and install an additional
FCC unit at the TORC refinery. The Bank subsequently financed a Refinery
Study to establish the optima] configuration that TORC should have to help
balance the national demand and supply for petroleum products in the long
run.  The study was carried out by Lummus (US), a major petroleum refinery
consultant and engineering firm, It was then reviewed extensively by the
<overnment, as well as the Bank in view of the refinery's interrelationship
with sectors in which the Bank is actively involved. The consultant
developed a linear programming model to determine the optimal product mix
and additional processing capacity at the Bangchak, TORC and Esso
refineries under various supply scenarios. The economic rentability of the
TORC proposal was then calculated over the project's 15-year life. At the
request of the Government, Bank staff calculated  economic rates of return
and net present values at 10% and 20% discount rates for several selected
scenarios.
3.15      The above review established significant economic advantage in
installing a hydrocracker at TORC, rather than the originally proposed FCC
or other secondary conversion alternatives. Following detailed
discussions, TORC decided in favor of a hydrocracker and designed the
conversion project along the lines recommended.  The project now includes a
high vacuum unit and a hydrocracker to increase production of distillate

products by about 1.0 million tpy. Foster Wheeler (US), the managing
contractor selected for the project, is currently doing the necessary
front-end engineering. The hydrocracker is expected to be on stream by the
end of 1988. A further project component proposed by TORC, which consisted
of the installation of a 3.25 million tpy crude distillation unit has been
shelved due to financing constraints. Esso, on the other hand, recently
completed an expansion project which increased its crude distillation
capacity from 2.25 million to 3.25 million tpy. Esso's project does not
include any secondary conversion installations.
4. Marketing and Distribution
3.16      Marketing and distribution of petroleum fuels are handled by
Shell, Esso, Caltex, and PTT. Approximately 10 million tons of petroleum
fuels per year are marketed in Thailand, as shown on the following page.
The four companies plus Mobil, which distributes only kerosene in southern
Thailand, together operate through about 2,500 dealer outlets. Shell has
700 outlets (28%); Esso, 625 (25%); Caltex, 375 (15%); PTT 575, (23%); and
Mobil, 225 (9%). The Bangkok metropolitan area consumes about 33% of the
total petroleum fuels distributed in Thailand. The central region consumes
30%, the north 10%, northeast 12% and the south 15%. Transportation of
petroleum fuels is done mainly by sea and rail. There are no product
pipelines except for a 5 km pipeline from the Bangchak refinery to EGAT.
The existing distribution network is adequate.

D.  Petroleum Product Pricing
3.17      Petroleum product prices are fixed by the Government at the
ex-refinery level through the Ministry of Industry, and at the retail level
through the National Petroleum Policy Committee. Ex-refinery prices are
set on the basis of Singapore posted prices. Singapore prices are
converted into Baht using the floating exchange rate and are reviewed
monthly. Excise and municipal taxes are levied on petroleum products;
taxes on gasoline currently amount to about 42% of the retail price and 15%
on diesel and kerosene. The Oil Stabilization Fund, established by the
Government in 1974 as a price stabilization mechanism, collects
contributions from refineries for petroleum product sales. Presently, net
compensation is paid to refineries for kerosene and fuel oil sales. The
current structure of petroleum product prices is shown below.

3.18      Retail petroleum product prices in Thailand generally compare
well with prices elsewhere in the region, as shown below. Most petroleum
product prices are significantly higher compared to CIF prices.

While domestic retail prices of both gasoline and diesel oil are
substantially higher than international prices, significant distortions
nevertheless exist in the relative price structure of these two products.
The domestic price ratio for regular gasoline and diesel is 1.6 while the
international price ratio is about 1.0. Relative price distortions may,
over time, encourage uneconomic decisions for energy investments and
inter-fuel substitution. Under Sal I and II, petroleum product prices were
reviewed and adjustments were recommended to reflect more accurately the
structure of international prices and domestic refining costs. Discussions
with the Government on this issue are continuing and are likely to result
in steps being taken during 1985 to reduce or remove remaining price
distortions and subsidies.
3.19      As to the ex-refinery price structure, the Lummus study (para
3.15) established that financial incentives exist for the refiners to
minimize fuel oil production and invest in secondary conversion facilities
in Thailand. The present ex-refinery diesel oil price is about US$5.46/bbl
higher than the fuel oil price; such price difference, however, is still
about 40% below that generally available to refiners elsewhere in the
region who have similar conditions of surplus fuel oil supply and
increasing middle distillate demand. The present price structure is not
likely to materially affect the viability of the Project and the refinery,
but inter-product price relationships need to be examined closely if
refineries are to shift production in line with projected energy demand.
Such an analysis is also covered by the energy pricing studies mentioned in
para 3.18 above. In connection with this Project, agreement has been
reached with the Government that it will continue to set ex-refinery prices
which would (a) allow the refineries, operating efficiently, to meet their
expenses, service their debts, and earn a reasonable rate of return on
capital employed; and (b) be reasonably competitive internationally.

F. Government Policies in the Subsector
3.20      In recent years, RTG has been paying increasing attention to the
development of the energy sector, and of the refineries subsector in
particular, pursuant to the objectives and strategy of the Fifth National
Development Plan (para 1.01). RTG intends to promote and introduce
measures, including price adjustments and modifications in refinery
configuration, to correct supply/demand imbalances for petroleum products
in the long run. The private sector refineries are expected to continue to
play a major role in the subsector including the Bangchak refinery (para
4.05 below).
IV. PROJECT SPONSOR
A. The Bangchak Petroleum Company, Ltd. (BCP)
1. Background
4.01       The Bangchak refinery was constructed in 1964 with an initial
capacity of 5,000 bpcd. After incurring losses during the refinery's early
months of operation, the Ministry of Defense, which then operated the
refinery for the Government, transferred the management and operation of
BOR to Summit Industrial Corporation (Panama), a private sector company,
through a 15-year lease contract awarded in 1965. Controversies during the
latter years of the lease arrangement led to the deterioration of relations
between Summit, its workers and the Government. The lease expired in March
1981 and the Ministry of Defense assumed management and operation of the
refinery. In addition, PTT was made responsible for crude procurement,
distribution of finished products, and financing of ail operating and
administrative requirements of the refinery including crude, salaries and
wages, taxes, financial expenses, equipment and spares, etc.
4.02      The above arrangement, which completely divided financial from
operating responsibilities within the Bangchak refinery, did not prove
beneficial either to Bangchak or to PTT. There was no evidence of
efficient resource management or a program to develop new and better
sources of funds. During BOR's first full year of operations under DED,
total operating and administrative expenses (excluding cost of crude and
interest charges) increased from US$10.22/ton in the first quarter to
US$13.14/ton in the last quarter. The total refinery costs, including
interest expenses, increased from US$28.47/ton to US$40.15/ton (summary
financial statements for BOR for 1981-83 are shown in Annexes 4-1 and
4-2).  The above increases were in part due to the decline in quantity of
crude processed from 0.66 million tons in the first quarter to 0.55 million
tons in the last quarter owing to mechanical problems. The heavy interest
charges were the inevitable consequence of operations based totally on
short-term borrowings, and the wide gap between credit terms for crude
purchases (29 days) and refined product sales (at ieast 57 days) which had
to be financed at market rates. In its three-and-a-half years of operations
under the DED/PTT arrangement, the refinery accumulated losses of more than



- 21 -
US$120 million. At the same time, the carrying of short-term liabilities
amounting to at least US$200 million in its books for BOR had weakened
PTT's liquidity position, and has contributed to slowing down efforts
assisted by the Bank to transform PTT into a financially viable entity.
2.  Corporate Restructuring
4.03      Upon the Government's request, the Bank prepared an extensive
analysis (Project File E) of the institutional problems of the Bangchak
refinery and the corporate and financial framework on the basis of which
operations of the refinery should be carried out in the future. The
analysis identified three major problems resulting from the joint PTT/DED
management arrangements: (i) refinery operations did not have managerial
and legal autonomy nor commercial orientation, and therefore failed to
provide sufficient inducement for higher efficiency; (ii) direct financial
accountability was diffused between Bangchak and PTT, and financial
planning, management and control for the refinery were lacking; and (iii)
the refinery had a very precarious financial situation since no funds have
been provided permanently to support operations. The analysis then
developed alternative arrangements aimed at solving these problems and
ensuring that sound financial planning, management and control are carried
out.
4.04      Four alternative institutional set-ups were identified for the
refinery: (i) consistent with the provisions of the revised PTT Act,
transfer the refinery to PTT as a division and have PTT fully responsible
for its operations; (ii) organize a state enterprise to manage and operate
the refinery; and (iii) establish a commercial company with (a) total or
majority private ownership or (b) majority Government shareholding. The
transfer of the refinery to PTT was considered a sub-optimal solution
because of PTT's already highly diversified operations (natural gas, crude
oil procurement, petroleum product marketing and soon, petrochemicals) and
thinning management capabilities. Organizing a state enterprise to manage
the refinery was not considered favorable since the provisions of the
current law for state enterprises, which entail many bureaucratic
processes, would limit the enterprise's commercial and corporate
flexibility.
4.05      The establishment of Bangchak as a commercial company with total
or majority private ownership was the most desirable option. However,
discussions by the Government with private companies have indicated that,
given the current poor physical state of the refinery, the private sector
will not be interested in participating at this time.  After the refinery
has been rehabilitated and made financially viable under this Project, it
is expected that the private sector will be prepared to participate in the
subsequent larger project which would involve the installation of secondary
conversion facilities. (This conversion project will be stuidied under the
proposed Project, but preliminary calculationis suggest that it will be
sufficiently attractive to encourage participation by the private sector.)
The Bank believed that the establishment of a new company to be oDerated
urder the provisions of Thailand's Civil and Commercial Code and with



- 22 -
shares held by the Government, PTT and local banks was the optimal solution
at this stage. Such a set-up would ensure autonomy of operations and
commercial orientation, as well as facilitate effective operating and
financial planning, management and control. Such a solution will also
permit the transfer of shares held by the Government and local banks to the
private sector whenever feasible.
4.06      A detailed analysis was also prepared to establish the initial
balance sheet of the new company. This analysis included projections of
the likely financial position of the refinery as of a cut-off date,
estimates of the refinery's permanent working capital requirements, and
development of schemes for working capital financing and disposition of the
refinery's debts and accumulated losses. The operating relationship of the
new company with PTT was also analyzed. PTT should continue to procure
crude oil for the new company until such time as the new company has
developed its own expertise in crude procurement. With regard to product
marketing, PTT already has a full staff, the infrastructure and a well-
developed network for efficient product distribution. PTT, therefore,
should continue product marketing for the new company.
4.07      The Government concurred with the above basic recommendations and
a high-level committee was created by the Cabinet to review the proposals
and recommend the appropriate institutional, legal and operating set-up for
the refinery. This committee proposed a corporate and financial restruc-
turing package along the lines recommended by the Bank, including the
establishment of an autonomous commercial company to run and manage the
refinery and implement the Project. Upon inception, however, the company
would be owned fully by the Government, PTT and Krung Thai Bank, a
Government-owned commercial bank, in view of the private sector's deferment
in participation given the refinery's current state (para 4.05). The
company's incorporation statutes allow private sector participation in the
future. Measures, such as appointment of a strong commercially-oriented
board of directors, were developed to safeguard the company's autonomy and
commercial viability given the company's proposed initial ownership.
4.08      The restructuring package was approved by the National Petroleum
Policy Committee in May 1984 and by the Cabinet in June 1984. In November
1984, The Bangchak Petroleum Company, Ltd. (BCP) was incorporated as a
limited company under the Civil and Commercial Code. A strong
commercially-oriented board of directors, as well as a managing director,
was also appointed by the Cabinet. BCP now has full responsibility and
accountability for all aspects of refining activities, including crude oil
procurement and refined product sale to marketing companies (PTT). It is
completely autonomous, having its own system and procedures for all aspects
of its operations, including procurement and staff hiring and compensa-
tion. BCP will receive policy guidance from the National Petroleum Policy
Committee and, although fully Government-owned, is exempted from orders,
rules, regulations and Cabinet resolutions governing state enterprises.
The transfer of the refinery staff and assets to BCP was completed in early
April 1985. Agreements covering crude procurement and refined product
sales (para 4.09) were signed between PTT and BCP also in April 1985. To



- 23 -
facilitate the Bank's continuation of its assistance in strengthening the
refinery's corporate and financial framework, BCP will inform the Bank of
changes in its statutes which may impair the company's operations or
financial viability.
3.   Financial Restructuring
4.09      Based on the current level of operations, the permanent working
capital requirements of the the refinery, from which the financial
structuring of BCP was developed, was estimated at US$111.1 million (Annex
4-3). The crude and refined product inventories include buffer quantities
and legal requirements. The prevailing credit terms for product sales and
crude purchases are 57 and 29 days, respectively. PTT has committed to
reduce its payment period to BCP from 57 days to about 45 days to eliminate
the heavy financing burden to BCP. It is necessary, however, to further
reduce such payment period to about 30 days. To achieve such a reduction,
agreement was reached that the Government will submit to the Bank by
November 1, 1985 proposals to improve the payment practices of state
agencies and enterprises (which are PTT's main customers) for petroleum
product purchases. Thereafter, the Government will implement such
proposals taking into account the Bank's comments. Such proposals would
include interest penalties on delayed payment in order to allow the
refinery to service the short-term borrowings needed to finance the extra
level of receivables.
4.10      BCP has structured its initial financial position to fully meet
its permanent working capital requirements on one hand, and allow adequate
liquidity and leverage positions on the other. Of the US$111.1 million
permanent working capital required, US$51 million was provided through
equity contributions from PTT (US$36 million), the Ministry of Finance
(US$7.5 million) and Krung Thai Bank (US$7.5 million). The balance of
US$60.1 million was provided through a US$120 million revolving credit
facility obtained by BCP for working capital purposes. BCP has undertaken
an initial level of current liabilities that provides a security margin of
50%, i.e. a current ratio of 1.5:1. On this basis, in addition to US$38
million of trade payables, BCP can carry as much as US$60.1 million in
short-term borrowings and still maintain a current ratio of 1.5:1. In
addition, PTT has issued 20-year floating rate notes of up to US$145
million, guaranteed by the Government, to refinance the refinery's past
accumulated losses. The notes will be serviced fully by the Government.
The sources and uses of funds for the restructuring of BCP, including
financial and physical rehabilitation, are shown on the following page.
4.11      The financial restructuring, along with the physical
rehabilitation under the Project, will have a significant positive impact
on the financial position of the refinery. The financial restructuring
will refinance the refinery's permanent working capital with equity funds,
thereby reducing significantly the company's financing expenses. Through
the physical rehabilitation program, the Project will reduce operating
costs, achieve energy savings, and increase capacity utilization. When the
Project is completed, net sales are expected to increase from US$511



- 24 -
million in 1985 to US$951 million in 1989. Net profit after tax, which has
been negative in the last three years, is expected to become positive and
reach US$12 million by 1990. Beyond 1990, when interest charges on
long-term borrowings begin to decline, net profit after tax is expected to
rise faster, reaching US$33 million by 1995. WiLh improved profitability,
the refinery will be able to attract private capital to facilitate the
financing of a possible secondary conversion project to be executed later
on. The financial projections of BCP are given in Chapter VII.

4. Operations and Management
4.12      Efficient operation and management of the refinery are central to
the financial viability of BCP under its new corporate structure. To
support its Board of Directors and Managing Director, BCP has appointed a



- 25 -
management and operations team from Caltex Petroleum Corporation (US) for
line functions in the refinery. The Caltex team of nine is composed of the
Refinery Manager, the Operations, Maintenance, Engineering and Technical
Services Managers, the Process, Purchasing and Maintenance Planning
Superintendents, and Refinery Special Projects Coordinator. The team's
scope of work (detailed terms of reference are shown in Annex 5-1) includes
provision of direct operating and management services, continuing technical
back-up services, and material and procurement services. The management
and operations team will also prepare a detailed training program for
refinery personnel for review and approval by the Bank, and provide the
services of a Training Manager to implement and monitor such training
program. Under the program, it is intended for up to 25 senior technical
and managerial staff to be sent abroad to attend seminars/courses (over
six-month periods) and visit foreign refineries to improve their knowledge
techniques of re'inery operations and management. A training center will
be established and formal classroom instructions provided for the junior
staff.  The formal instruction for both senior and junior staff will be
combined with on-the-job training to be provided by the technical
assistance personnel.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives and Scope
5.01      The main objectives of the Project are to assist the Government
in improving the operations of the Bangchak refinery through a program of
physical, legal, organization, managerial and financial restructuring;
reducing the cost of meeting the petroleum requirements of Thailand in the
short- to medium-term; and determining the modifications and/or expansion
required in Thailand's refinery subsector to balance national demand and
supply for petroleum products in the long run. These objectives will be
achieved through the following Project components: (i) physical.
rehabilitation of the Bangchak refinery to increase capacity utilization to
design levels and improve its operations; (ii) implementation of energy
conservation measures to optimize process unit operations; (iii)
improvement of the refinery infrastructure including provision for flood
protection; (iv) project engineering, supervision and management assistance
to help BCP in the implementation of the rehabilitation, energy conserva-
tion and infrastructure upgrading programs, and training to improve the
technical and managerial capabilities of the refinery staff; and (v)
carrying out of a techno-economic study to determine further modifications
required to ensure that the yield pattern of refineries in Thailand will be
in balance with the demand profile for petroleum products in the country.
B. Rationale for Bank Participation in the Project
5.02      The Project is an important element of the Bank's assistance in
the development of Thailand's energy sector. Through extensive preparation
work for the Project, the Bank has been instrumental in assisting RTG in



- 26 -
formulating and implementing an appropriate institutional, legal, manage-
ment and financial framework for the Bangchak refinery. The Bank's
participation has ensured that refinery operations are carried out on an
autonomous and commercial basis and that specific operating and financial
accountabilities are established within the company. These institutional
improvements, as well as the higher operating and financial efficiency to
be achieved under the Project, would make the refinery attractive for
private investment in the future. With improved management and operations,
the refinery should be able to fulfill its share of the responsibility for
the development of the refining subsector in Thailand. The Government also
regards the restructuring of the Bangchak refinery into an autonomous
commercial company as a model for future restructuring of other state
economic enterprises in Thailand. Participation in this Project will,
moreover, put the Bank in an excellent position to be intimately involved
with RTG in rationalizing the demand for and supply of petroleum products
in Thailand. From the viewpoint of financial management, the Bank can play
an important role in turning the Bangchak refinery into a financially
viable enterprise. Furthermore, the Bank is in a good position to advise
BCP in acquiring suitable modern technology which the refinery needs
badly. Finally, the Bank can ensure, through an appropriate technical
assistance and training package included in the Project, that the local
staff would be in a better position to operate and manage the refinery.
C. Project Description
1. Refinery Rehabilitation
5.03      This component will support investments to increase operating
efficiency and improve product yield. Worn-out equipment will be repaired
or replaced and additional equipment will be installed to improve operating
efficiency and reliability. Among the equipment to be repaired or replaced
are rotating equipment, pumps, compressors, pressure vessels, heat
exchangers, fractionation trays, and cooling towers. In addition, the
thermal cracker and visbreaker units, which were converted to crude
distillation service in the early 1970s, will be restored to their original
design basis to increase production of mid-distillates. These investments
are consistent with those envisioned for secondary conversion facilities,
should the studies included in this Project (para 5.09) determine them to
be economic. Tank instrumentation will be upgraded while storage tanks
will be repaired and painted for weather protection. The generation and
supply of utilities will undergo extensive rehabilitation under the Project
to balance steam and electricity generation and consumption, and capture
about 27 tons per hour of low pressure steam (valued at about US$5.0
million per year) which are currently vented. Steam turbines that could be
driven with high and medium pressure steam from waste-heat boilers will
also be installed to eliminate 1.5 megawatts of purchased electricity.
Treatment of cooling water will be incorporated to ensure that the water is
of acceptable quality and would not cause fouling and plugging of heat
exchanger tubes.



- 27 -
2. Energy Conservation
5.04      Energy consumption and processing losses in the refinery have
ranged from 5 to 6 volume percent of crude oil processed, as compared to
about 3.5 to 4.0 percent norm for a similar but energy-efficient refinery.
This is due to the low efficiency of process heaters, poor recovery of heat
from process streams, and utility losses such as steam leaks and flaring of
hydrocarbon gases. Most of the equipment were designed and built prior to
1973 when minimization of capital costs at the expense of higher energy
consumption was the prevailing engineering design philosophy. The current
average efficiency for the process heaters at the refinery is about 65%
compared to about 90% which is the current industry norm for similar
equipment. The refinery has no heat recovery equipment such as air
preheaters and waste-heat boilers; these will be provided under the Project
to monitor gas flow in flare lines, and by proper maintenance of safety
relief valves. In addition, steamlines insulation will be replaced, saving
about 25% of the steam consumed.
5.05      Operations of other process units will also be improved with
considerable economic benefits to the refinery.  These improvements include
optimization of the hydro-desulphurization (HDS) unit and of the naphtha
reformer, as well as increased recovery of LPG.  The design capacity of the
HDS unit is 0.8 million tpy.  If the refinery is operated at the proposed
debottlenecked capacity of 3.0 million tpy, the required capacity of the
HDS unit will be 1.0 million tpy. Currently, naphtha, kerosene and diesel
oil are hydro-desulphurized. The throughput to the HDS unit, which is a
high energy consumer, will be reduced by treating kerosene in a Merox unit
which will be installed under the Project. The Merox unit, which consumes
very little energy, will reduce the refinery's hydrogen requirement and
consumption of utilities. The naphtha reformer currently operates at a
pressure of 450 psig. A more reactive catalyst can be used at lower
operating pressure (about 250 psig) to increase hydrogen production. The
required catalysts and instrumentation are included in the Project. The
gas concentration plant loses considerable quantities of LPG to the fuel
gas system due to inadequate ancillary equipment. The operating
temperatures and pressures of the de-ethanizer and absorber are too high
while the operating pressures are too low. Under the Project, repair and
replacement of equipment as well as installation of additional coolers and
pumps will be provided to reduce LPG losses.
3. Infrastructure Improvement
5.06      The refinery infrastructure includes in-plant roads, drainage and
sewer facilities, and staff accommodation, besides port and associated
pipeline facilities, and utilities supply networks. The refinery is
adjacent to the Chao Phya River and is surrounded by a canal. An internal
system of drains and floodgates control river water from inundating the
refinery during high tide. A floodgate at the outlet of the canal together
with a timber barrier and pumps help to eliminate accumulated water. The
refinery location is virtually an island plateau surrounded by a network of
connected water courses. This, combined with the low permeability of the



- 28 -
soil, necessitates almost the entirety of the rain water falling within the
refinery catchment area to be lifted out. In additio-a, the current
location of the staff housing facilities inside the refinery perimeter
fence is inappropriate, posing security and safety hazards to both the
refinery and the residents. A program to improve the refinery infrastruc-
ture is included in the Project. This includes: (i) land drainage, sewer
rehabilitation, and floodwater control; (ii) rehabilitation of in-plant
roads and street lighting; and (iii) relocation of the staffi housing
facilities into an area owned by BCP located south of the battery limits.
4. Project Engineering, Supervision and Management
5.07      As mentioned (para 4.02), a management and operations team from
Caltex has been appointed under the Project for line functions in the
refinery.   This team will also assist BCP in selecting a Consulting
Engineering Firm (CEF) (Annex 5-2) to provide the design and engineering
required for the refinery rehabilitation and energy conservation
components, as well as the design basis for all civil works and equipment
and materials to be purchased. In addition, the CEF will prepare the terms
of reference for the general contractor (GC) for the installation of
equipment and start-up of installed equipment or facilities, assist BCP
in the selection of and contract negotiations with GC, and supervise the
work of the GC. The CEF will also assist BCP in the procurement of
equipment and materials and provide on-the-job training to local
personnel. About 670 man-months of CEF services will be required. The
appointment of the CEF, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5. Staff Training
5.08          Within the first four months of its assignment, the
management and operations team will prepare a training program, and provide
the services of a Training Manager. This nrogram wl-l comprise both formal
and informal instruction. The formal instruction for both senior and
junior staff will be combined with on-the-job training to be provided by
the technical assistance personnel; it is therefore expected that the
majority of the instructors will be from the management and operationis team
and CEF staff who will perform the training function as part of their
regular schedule. A training center will be established and formal
classroom instructions provided for the junior staff.  The training program
will be submitted to the Bank for review and approval by December 31, 1985.
6_ Feasibilitv Study
5.09      This component will determine the modifications in configuration
and/or exparnsion required in thie -efinery subsector to balance national
demand and supply for petroleum products in the future. The feasibility
study will be carried out in two phases:  Phase I will review the current
and projected demand for oil products, the installed and planned refining
facilities, the utilization of natural gas and other indigenous energy
sources and the extent to which these will affect future demand for liquid



- 29 -
petroleum fuels, and the availability of crude oils to Thailand. Phase I
will also include process design configuration for likely secondary
conversion options, cost estimates, and financial and economic evaluations
of these options. Phase II of the study will commence only if Phase I
identifies a process configuration which will be economically justified and
provided that Phase I establishes that the necessary conversion facilities
should be located at the Bangchak refinery. Phase II will carry out
further work on the selected secondary conversion option including basic
engineering, more detailed capital and operating cost estimates, complete
financial and economic evaluation, and preparation of biddi-nig documents.
The feasibility study would be carried out in accordance with the terms of
reference (Annex 5-3) agreed with the Bank. The National Petroleum Policy
Committee will establish a panel composed of relevant Government
departments, agencies and enterprises to review Phase I of the study. By
December 31, 1986, BCP will submit Phase I of the study to the Bank for its
review along with the comments of the panel. The total study will require
about 245 man-months of technical assistance. The consultants will be
in place by June 30, 1986.
D.  Environmental Considerations
5.10      While the refinery does not appear to be discharging any liquid
or solid wastes harmful to the environment, oil sludge, somae of which
contain lead from the gasoline tanks, is nevertheless being dumped into
ponds within the refinery battery limits. The existing sulphur plant has
not been operational for several years and is beyond rehabilitation. Gases
containing hydrogen sulphide are therefore incinerated and, in the process,
discharge substantial quantities of sulphur oxides into the atmosphere. In
addition, hydrogeneration and desulphurization facilities are not available
for treating heavy oils in which a substantial portion of sulphur in the
crude ultimately ends up and gets dispersed throughout the country. The
Project will improve the environmental safeguards of the refinery through
the installation of a new sulphur plant and the ponds witnin the refinery
battery limits will be cleaned as part of the infrastructure improvement
program. The refinery modification feasibility study will also identify
additional measures required to ensure that the refinery conforms to accep-
table environmental protection standards (i.e. the Bank's environmental
guidelines for petroleum refining and sulphur dioxide emissions) and
further improve the quality of gaseous and other effluents.
E. Project Organization and Implementation Arrangements
1. Responsibilities for Project Implementation
5.il    The implementation of the Project will be the responsibility of
BCP. The management and operations team (para 4.12) will provide
operations and management services, as well as training of refinery staff.
It will also assist BCP in the selection of the Consultant Engineering Firm
and the consultants for the secondary conversion feasibility study. The
Consulting Engineering Firm (para 5.07) will provide engineering services
for the rehabilitation and energy conservation components, as well as



- 30 -
supervision of the physical implementation of the Project. It will also
assist BCP in the selection of the general contractor and the procurement
of all equipment and materials required under the Project.
2. Organizational Structure and Staffing
5.12      The BCP organization chart is shown in Chart 1.  The key staff
needed to work with the Caltex team for continuing refinery operations are
already in position. However, two issues will require proper resolution:
(i) specific allocation of in-line and advisory positions in the new
organizational structure, covering both BCP and technical assistance
personnel; and (ii) readjustment/reduction of the current number of
personnel (570) in the refinery, to a level compatible with operational
requirements (about 350). Agreement has been reached that by September 30,
1985, detailed proposals for (i) and (ii) will be submitted by BCP to the
Bank for review and comment, and that such proposals thereafter be
implemented taking into account the Bank's comments.
3. Implementation Schedule
5.13      The physical rehabilitation covered by the Project will be
implemented over a period of four years. The Project Implementation
Schedule agreed upon with BCP is shown in Chart 2. The management and
operations team from Caltex will be in place by June 1985. BCP is
currently reviewing proposals for the engineering services required for the
rehabilitation, energy conservation and infrastructure improvement
components of the Project. The Consultant Engineering firm is planned to
be appointed in August 1985. The general and civil works contractors will
be appointed within the next six months following the appointment of the
Consultant Engineering Firm.   Civil works, construction and erection for
the above Project components will require 17-22 months. As for the
refinery modification feasibility study, Phase I will be completed in about
6 months, while Phase II will require 9 months.
F. Monitoring and Reporting
5.14      BCP will be required to submit to the Bank quarterly Project
progress and procurement status reports within 30 days of the end of each
quarter. In addition, within six months after the closing date of the
Project, the company will prepare and furnish to the Bank a completion
report on the Project, dealing with its implementation, initial operation,
and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost Estimate
6.01      The total financing requirements of the Project, including
physical contingencies, price escalation and interest during construction



- 31 -
are estimated at US$143.8 million equivalent, of which US$127.2 million is
in foreign exchange, as shown below. Costs include identified import
duties and applicable local taxes of about US$8 million.

6.02      Base cost estimates are expressed in December 1984 prices and
were developed based on (i) the BOR Refinery Rehabilitation Study
undertaken in 1982 by Bangchak along with Lummus Operating Associates (US);
(ii) the evaluation prepared by Chiyoda Chemical Engineering and
Construction Co. Ltd. in December 1982 based on the refinery inspection
conducted in November 1982; (iii) the review of (ii) by Mitsubishi Oil Co.
of Japan in September 1984; and (iv) the study conducted in December 1982
by Bank consultant on BOR's infrastructure requirements. Estimates include
contingencies amounting to US$28.8 million, or 31% of the base cost.
Physical contingencies were calculated at 10% of the base cost. Price
contingencies are based on projected international and local price
increases for (i) foreign costs of 8% in 1985, 9% in 1986, 1987 and 1988,



- 32 -
7.5% in 1989 and 6% thereafter; and (ii) local cost of 8% in 1985 and 7%
thereafter. Project engineering, supervision and management will require
about 1,275 man-months of consultant services; this will comprise: (i) 670
man-months of engineering services (para 5.07); (ii) 360 man-months of
management and operations services (para 4.12); and (iii) 245 man-months
for the feasibility study (para 5.09). Interest during construction
includes a 10% guarantee fee over the standard Bank lending rate.
B. Financing Plan

6.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$85 million will cover about 59% of
total financing requirements and 67% of the foreign exchange costs of the
Project. The items to be financed under the proposed Bank loan are shown



- 33 -
on page 35 of this Report. Bank financing of interest during construction
in relation to the Bank loan, amounting to US$10 million, is proposed. BCP
will borrow an additional US$30.8 million in the form of suppliers' credits
and US$11.4 million in term loans from commercial banks to finance the rest
of the foreign costs. The local costs would be financed through equity
funds from the Government (US$7.5 million)and Krung Thai Bank, a
Government-owned commercial bank (US$7.5 million), and term loans from
commercial banks (US$1.6 million). The proposed Bank loan will be extended
to BCP for 15 years including 5 years of grace at the standard Bank
interest rate. BCP will pay the Government a guarantee fee of 10% and will
bear the foreign exchange risk. The suppliers' credits are expected to be
for 10 years at 8% interest per annum, with principal repayment to begin
six months after Project completion. To ensure the availability of
necessary resources to complete the Project in a timely manner, agreement
has been reached with the Government that it will meet any cost overrun or
shortfall in funds needed to finance the Project.
C. Procurement
6.05      Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:

- 34 -
6.06      All equipment and materials contracts to be financed by the Bank
will be procured in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.
International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for procurement of
individual items costing over $200,000. This will represent about 70% of
the total contracts for equipment and materials. Equipment proprietary to
the process design, estimated to cost US$1.9 million (about 2% of the Bank
loan), will be procured on the basis of prices negotiated with original
equipment suppliers; small items costing less than US$200,000 up to an
aggregate amount of US$3.2 million, will be procured through limited
international tendering (LIT) after solicitation of quotations from
qualified suppliers from at least three Bank-eligible countries. To the
maximum extent possible, identical or similar items shall be grouped
together for the purpose of bidding and procurement. For purposes of
evaluation and comparison of bids for the supply of goods under ICB,
qualified domestic suppliers will be allowed a preference of 15% of the CIF
price or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower.
6.07      Civil works contracts for construction of training facilities,
offices, workshops, maintenance and laboratory buildings, and
infrastructure improvement totalling US$9.9 million and representing about
23% of works contracts, will be awarded after local competitive bidding.
None of these civil work contracts will exceed US$2.0 million and are not
likely to attract interest from foreign bidders. The Bank will finance the
design and supervision of civil works, which amounts to about US$2.0
million, or 5% of the total contracts. Bidding packages for these works,
as well as for goods over US$300,000 will be subject to the Bank's prior
review of procurement documentation. Arrangements for local contracting
are satisfactory and contractors' capabilities are considered appropriate
for the timely and efficient completion of these works. Local competitive
procedures are satisfactory. Consulting services (engineering, management
and studies) will be awarded in accordance with bank guidelines on the use
of consultants.
D. Disbursements
6.08      An estimated schedule of loan disbursements is given in Annex
6-1. Loan disbursement is expected to be completed by June 30, 1990. The
rate of disbursement is based on historical disbursement profiles for
industrial projects in the region and in Thailand, as well as on the
characteristics and the implementation schedule of each Project component.
Disbursements on contracts under categories (a), (b) and (e) costing less
than US$100,000 will be made against statement of expenditures. All other
disbursements will be fully documented. A special account to assist the
company in meeting expenditures in a timely manner will be opened with an
initial deposit of US$4.0 million. Retroactive financing of up to US$1
million to cover mobilization and other payments after January 1, 1985 to
the Caltex management and operation team is proposed. The proceeds of the
Bank loan will cover, net of taxes and duties, the following components.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Basis of Financial Projections
7.01      The detailed assumptions used in the financial analysis are shown
in Annex 7-1. Proforma financial statements were prepared in current US$
assuming that the difference between the international and domestic infla-
tion rates will be accounted for in the foreign exchange rate adjustments
undertaken by the Government periodically.
1.   Production
7.02      With the rehabilitation investments included in the Project, the
utilization of the refinery's crude distillation capacity is expected to
increase from 70% to 90% by 1990, and 95% by 1992 and the succeeding



- 36 
years. The restoration of the thermocracker and the visbreaker will enable
the processing of the entire Phet crude production which is estimated to be
sustained at 20,000 bpd. In addition, substantial improvements in product
yield are expected to result from the energy conservation investments such
as the incorporation of heaters, pumps, overhead condensers, as well as the
processing of a higher quantity of the lighter Phet crude. The comparative
product yield and net production with and without the Project are shown
below-

a/ Crude mix: 38% Arab light, 27% Arab medium and heavy, 35% Phet
and condensates.
7.03      With the Project, the refinery net product yield is expected to
increase from 94 volume % to 96%. Furthermore, the restoration of the
visbreaker is expected to enable the conversion of about 2,300 bpcd of fuel
oil into middle distillate products which are increasing in demand. In
addition, about 30,000 tpy of sulfur is expected to be recovered through
the upgrading of the refinery's desulphurization facilities. Sulfur is a
basic raw material in the manufacture of compound fertilizers. The
Government is currently reviewing the feasibility of a fertilizer complex
in the Eastern Seaboard industrial estate in the south for which sulfur
imports from Saudi Arabia are planned.  If not consumed domestically, the
sulfur that could be recovered by the refinery has a wide export market,
e.g., India, and could yield a netback value of about US$3.6 million per
year in real terms.
2. Crude and Product Prices
7.04      The cost of crude used in the analysis was based on the weighted
average price currently paid by Thailand of about US$28.3/bbl. This price
was assumed to decline in real terms by 6.8% in 1986, and increase by O.9%



- 37 -
p.a. during 1986-90 and 4.9% p.a. during 1990-95, in accordance with Bank
projections. As mentioned earlier, ex-refinery prices are set by the
Government on the basis of Singapore posted prices.  These prices are then
converted into Baht at the floating exchange rate. The Government uses
this pricing mechanism to encourage refineries in Thailand to operate as
efficiently as those in Singapore. Given the close association of local
and Singapore prices, the ex-refinery prices used in the financial analysis
were calculated on the basis of the product/crude ratios projected for
Singapore/Bahrain. These ratios are discussed in Chapter VIII.
3.  ProcssnanFixed Costs
7.05      The processing costs per barrel of crude are based on the current
level of expenses, as follows: chemicals, US$0.08; power, US$0.06; lead,
US$0.14; and transhipment, US$0.23. Labor cost amounts to about US$3.5
million per year. This was assumed to increase by 20-30% in real terms and
be in line with the pay scales in the industry in Thailand. Repairs and
maintenance costs on new equipment were calculated at 1.5% of project cost;
those on existing equipment were estimated at US$2.7 million per year.
Depreciation was calculated on straight line basis over 15 years.
B. Financial Projections
7.06      The profitability of the refinery is expected to improve
substantially with the implementation of the Project. The Project is, in
fact, expected to turn around the refinery into a financially viable
enterprise capable of yielding increasing profits. Details of the
financial projections for the BCP with the Project are given in Annex 7-2
and summarized on the following page.
7.07      The Project will have a significant positive impact on the
financial position of BCP. In 1990, the first year when full benefits from
the Project will be earned, net sales are expected to reach US$1,119
million. The increase in net income over the years up to about 1990, when
interest payments on the Bank loan and suppliers' credits are most onerous,
will be modest but steady. Coverage of annual debt service requirements
will be sufficient. With improved operations, the fund generation
capability of BCP will be significantly enhanced. The liquidity and
leverage position of BCP will also continue to be strong with the Project.
To safeguard BCP's financial position, agreement was reached with BCP that
it will: (i) maintain a current ratio of no less than 1.1 until December
31, 1988, and 1.2 thereafter; (ii) not incur any long-term debt if, after
incurring suciL debt, the debt/equity ratio of BCP will exceed 60/40; (iii)
not incur additional debt if, by so doing, the projected debt service
coverage will fall below 1.2 times until December 31, 1988, and 1.3
thereafter; and (iv) not make any repayment in advance of maturity in
respect of any of its outstanding debt which would materially and adversely
affect its ability to meet its financial obligations. In addition,
agreement was reached with BCP that it will not make, during the
implementation of the Project, any investment in fixed assets (other than



- 38 -
the implementation of the Project, the ongoing and already approved
projects and for maintenance purposes) in excess of US$5 million in any
year without prior Bank approval.

D.   Financial Rate of Return
7.08      The cost and benefit streams for the incremental financial rate
of return calculation are expressed in real terms as shown in Annex 7-3.
The after-tax return is satisfactory at 21%. Results of sensitivity tests
are shown below:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return, %
1.   Base Case                                     21
2.   Capital Costs up to 20%                       17
3.   Capacity Utilization down 20%                 16
4.   Two-Year Project Delay                        15
5.   Combination of (2) and (3)                    14
7.09      The above sensitivity tests indicate that variations in capital
costs, capacity utilization and implementation period will not
significantly affect the financial return of the Project. Even under the



- 39 -
worst case of 20% increase in capital costs combined with attainment of 20%
less capacity utilization than assumed, the Project financial rate of
return is still satisfactory at 14%. The financial rate of return is about
7 percentage points lower than the economic rate of return, which is
calculated at 28% in Chapter VIII. The difference lies primarily in the
additional expenditures in import duties and taxes that BCP would have to
pay to the Government for the importation of goods required for the
Project. In any case, the financial return from the Project will lead to
adequate cash flow for BCP in order to meet its financial obligations and
maintain a healthy financial position.
E.   Risks
7.10      The Project does not face any significant risks that would impede
its efficient implementation. The technologies that will be used are
commercially proven and will be supported by qualified and experienced
firms. Comprehensive repair and maintenance and staff training programs
are provided for in the Project to ensure that the refinery is operated
satisfactorily in the future. Marketing and distribution systems in
Thailand are well coordinated. The corporate and financial structure of
BCP is sound, and adequate measures are included in the Project to maintain
such soundness.
F. Financial Reporting Requirements
7.11      BCP will be required to submit to the Bank annual financial
statements and reports examined by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank within six months of the end of the accounting year. BCP will give
prompt attention to audit exceptions and recommendations. The company will
also be required to submit quarterly financial statements within 60 days
after the end of each quarter.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01      The costs and benefits used in the economic analysis are in March
1985 US dollars. The economic capital cost of the Project was derived from
the financial capital cost, excluding interest during construction, after
deducting import duties and local taxes on imported equipment and other
items. The profile of expenditures was assumed at 10% in 1985, 22% in
1986, 29% in 1987, 24% in 1988, and 15% in 1989. The economic cost of
crude was based on the weighted average CIF price currently paid by
Thailand which amounts to US$28.1/bbl. The crude mix planned for 1985-95
is comprised of Arabian light (38%), medium (13%) and heavy (13%), Phet
crude (29%) and condensates (7%). Economic processing costs were estimated
at US$0.42/bbl. Incremental savings from lower fuel and losses (para 7.02)
were calculated at 2.0 volume % and valued at fuel oil equivalent.



- 40 -
8.02      The annual economic benefits that will be derived from the
Project will come mainly from increased production of refined products
resulting from higher capacity utilization and improved product yields, and
savings from lower energy consumption. The rehabilitation and debottle-
necking component will help arrest further mechanical deterioration of the
two crude distillation units. It will also increase to and stabilize
capacity utilization at 95%. Without the Project, capacity utilization is
expected to drop from 70% to about 60% by 1989 and 55% by 1991. The
incremental throughput and production resulting from the rehabilitation and
debottlenecking component are shown in Annex 8-1 and summarized below for
1989, 1991 and 1992:
Incremental Throughput and Production
(Volume im mmbbls; value in March 1985 US$ million)
Throughput             Production a/
Volume    Value        Volume    Value
1989               5,9    159.6           5.9      175.2
1991               8.3    236.7           8.2      261.0
1992               9.5    283.6           9.4      272.1
a/ Excluding sulphur.
8.03      Thailand will continue to import premium-value mid-distillate
products even after the TORC conversion project (para 3.14) comes on stream
in 1989. Surplus fuel oil, on the other hand, will continue to be exported
at depressed prices. To help minimize the net cost of procuring the oil
requirements of the country, BOR's yield of mid-distillate products could
be optimized with the refinery's existing configuration either by
processing lighter crude oils or by spiking--where refined products are
added to crude oil to increase the total yield of mid-distillate products
and reduce residual fuel oil--or a combination of both. Processing the
optimum crude mix is an on-going refinery task. Given the types of crude
oil currently processed by BOR and the rehabilitated refinery facilities,
it is estimated that spiking up to 10% of crude feed could also be
achieved. Spiking would result in savings estimated at about US$5 million
per year up to 1990 in real terms. These savings would come from
reductions in costly mid-distillate imports and low-netback fuel oil
exports.
8.04      Since Thailand is expected to continue to be a net importer of
refined products, the economic values assigned to the incremental
production were based on projected Singapore FOB product prices. These
product prices were calculated from the product to crude price ratios
projected by Bank staff. The projected ratios are substantially lower than
those which prevailed in the past. For instance, price ratios between



- 41 -
regular gasoline and crude during the last 10 years averaged 1.45,
fluctuating from a high of 1.82 in 1979 to a low of 1.21 in 1984. The
ratios forecasted for 1990 and 1995 are 1.22 and 1.30, respectively. The
historical and projected price ratios, as well as the projected FOB and CIF
product prices used in the analysis are shown in Annex 8-2.
B. Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
8.05      The economic rates of return for the Project were calculated in
March 1985 US dollars as shown in Annex 8-2. The Project has a satis-
factory ERR of 28%. Upon completion of the Project, the refinery as a
whole is estimated to yield an ERR of 23% when compared to the alternative
of importing the refined products. Results of sensitivity tests are
summarized as follows:
Sensitivity Analysis on Economic Rate of Return
1.  Base Case                                                 28
2.  Capital Costs up by 20%                                   25
3.  Capacity Utilization down 20%                             24
4.  Delay of two years in Project implementation              22
5.  Combination of (2) and (3)                                21
6.  Combination of (2), (3) and (4)                           16
8.06      Variations in capital costs, capacity utilization and implementa-
tion period will not materially affect the Project's economic rate of
return. A 20% increase in capital cost or a 20% fall in maximum capacity
utilized reduces the rate of return to a still favorable 24-25%. Indeed, a
two-year delay in Project implementation combined with a 20% increase in
capital costs and attainment of 20% less capacity than expected still
results in a good 16% rate of return. A sensitivity analysis on the ERRs
using the depressed product prices now prevailing in Western Europe was
also carried out. Under this scenario, the Project and the refinery yield
satisfactory ERRs of 22% and 16%, respectively.
C.   Foreign Exchange Savings
8.07      By 1990, the Project is expected to allow additional production
of 7 million bbls of refined products with an estimated annual gross import
value of US$214 million in real terms. Net of crude, imported chemicals
and foreign debt service, the Project will generate over its 15-year
economic life net foreign exchange savings of about US$480 million in March
1985 prices (or about USS30 million per year). Details of estimated
foreign exchange savings during 1990-2000 are shown in Annex 8-3.

THAILAND - BANGCHAK OIL REFINERY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS TEAM
I.   Background
1.        Thailand has a total oil refining capacity of 195,000 bpcd
distributed among three major refineries as follows: Bangchak Petroleum
Co., Ltd. (BCP), 65,000 bpcd; Thai Oil Refinery Co. Ltd (TORC), 65,000
bpcd; and Esso Standard Thailand Ltd., 65,000 bpcd. TORC is a joint
venture between the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the private sector
while Esso is fully owned by Esso Eastern, Inc. BCP is fully
Government-owned.
2.        Actual production from the three refineries amounts to about
158,000 bpcd. By 1989, when TORC's 17,000-bpcd hydrocracker goes on
stream, total production is estimated at 233,000 bpcd. Even with increased
production, however, substantial deficits in mid-distillates are still
expected to occur. Fuel oil production, on the other hand, will continue
to be in excess of demand. Balancing national supply and demand could be
achieved largely through rationalization of the country's refining capacity
to which BCP could contribute significantly. However, the current state of
BCP's facilities and the limited technical capabilities of the staff
preclude the refinery from efficiently performing its role in the
rationalization program. BCP has, therefore, launched a rehabilitation/
rationalization project aimed at improving the overall performance of the
refinery. The project, which will be implemented with technical and
financial assistance from the World Bank, consists of five components: (1)
rehabilitation of the Bangchak refinery to restore its mechanical
integrity, increase capacity utilization to design levels and improve its
operations; (ii) implementation of energy conservation measures to optimize
process unit operations; (iii) improvement of the refinery infrastructure
including safeguards to plant and equipment against flooding; (iv) training
to improve the technical and managerial capabilities of the refinery staff;
and (v) techno-economic study to determine further modifications required
to ensure that the refineries' yield pattern will be in balance with the
projected demand profile for petroleum fuels in the country. BCP wishes to
engage the services of an experienced operating firm for the overall
management and operations of the Bangchak refinery and to implement
component (iv) above.
II. Objectives
3.        The operating firm will provide a management and operations team
to:
(a) Bring current refinery operations to international levels;
(b) Provide continuing technical back-up support;



- 52 -                           ANNEX 5-1
Page 2 of 3
(c) Upgrade refinery management, operating and technical skills;
(d)  Assist BCP .o review the rehabilitation project; and
(e)  Provide material and procurement services.
III. Scope of Work
4.        The management and operations team will, inter alia:
(a)  Review the operations of all departments of the refinery,
including general management, finance and accounting, personnel
administration, and operating and support services; as well as
the organizational structure of the company, current staffing
structure, experience and qualification of staff, reassignment of
personnel, and training needs. A team of the operating firm's
specialists in refinery management, finance and accounting,
personnel administration and manpower planning, operations,
engineering, maintenance and inspection, and training will be
required to spend a period of about two weeks to undertake the
review;
(b)  Upon completion of the review mentioned in (i) above, submit to
BCP a preliminary report covering the organization and plan of
work to meet the objectives given above, and implement the
recommended plan;
(c)  Provide and establish technical reference libraries including
design guide, manuals, codes, basic practices, safety practices,
etc;
(d)  Recommend appropriate computer facilities and establish an
adequate technical information and data management system;
(e)  Make available crude oil assay data from parent company and
develop/institute a LP model to optimize crude oil selection and
refinery production;
(f)  Provide an annual refinery performance audit by a selected team
of specialist drawn from the parent company's staff;
\g)  Provide, through senior management and technical personnel
seconded to BCP, advisory and direct operating services to
administer and establish efficient and modern refinery management
and operating practices;
(h)  Assist BCP in the selection and appointment of management and
technical perscnnel, including the development of personnel
administraticn system and procedures;



- 53                             ANNEX 5-1
Page 3 of 3
(i) Develop and implement a training program for senior and middle
management and technical personnel. The training program will
need to be developed within four (4) months together with an
implementaion schedule;
(j)  Review the refinery rationalization, energy conservation and
rehabilitation programs; and
(k)  Provide, from the operating company's head office and through the
placement of a specialist at the Bangchak Refinery, procurement
services for materials and spares.
5.        The management and operations team will comprise of an
appropriate number of specialists to act in executive positions, including
a Manufacturing Manager. The Manufacturing Manager will be responsible for
refinery operations for a period of two years. The option to retain the
Manufacturing Manager for another tiwo years should be available to BCP.
The Manufacturing Manager, in consultation with the company senior
management, will determine how the specialists will be deployed, the
schedule for training of BCP personnel, and the Dersonnel to succeed those
specialists who will be occupying in-line positions including the
Manufacturing Manager.
6.        The management and operations team will be required to within,
(i) four months, provide all necessary operating manuals and systems; and
(ii) eighteen months of mobilization, to have in place BCP staff in all key
in-line positions and demonstrate that refinery operations can be carried
out efficiently essentially by BCP personnel.
7.        If the management and technical assistance company fulfills the
stated objectives of the management and technical assistance program, BCP
will enter into an annually renewable technical hack-up service contract.

bpcd; and Esso Standard Thailand Ltd, 65,000 bpcd. TORC is a joint venture
between the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the private sector while
Esso is fully owned by Esso Eastern, Inc. BCP is fully Government-owned.
2.        Actual production from the three refineries amounts to about
158,000 bpcd. By 1989, when TORC's 17,000-bpcd hydrocracker goes on
stream, total production is estimated at 233,000 bpcd. Even with increased
production, however, substantial deficits in mid-distillates are still
expected to occur. Fuel oil production, on the other hand, will continue
to be in excess of demand. Balancing national supply and demand could be
achieved largely through rationalization of the country's refining
capacity to which BCP could contribute significantly. However, the current
state of BCP's facilities and the limited technical capabilities of its
staff preclude the refinery from efficiently performing its role in the
rationalization program. BCP has, therefore, launched a rehabilitation/
rationalization project aimed at improving the overall performance of the
refinery. The project consists of five components: (i) rehabilitation of
the Bangchak refinery to restore its mechanical integrity, increase
capacity utilization to design levels and improve its operations; (ii)
implementation of energy conservation measures to optimize process unit
operations; (iii) improvement of the refinery infrastructure including
safeguards to plant and equipment from flooding; (iv) training to improve
the technical and managerial capabilities of the refinery staff; and (v)
techrio-economic study to determine further modifications required to ensure
that the refineries' yield pattern will be in balance with the projected
demand profile for petroleum fuels in the country. The Project will be
implemented by BCP with financial and technical assistance from the World
Bank. BCP wishes to engage the services of a Consultant Engineering Firm
to assist in the implementation of the above rehabilitation/rationalization
project.
II, Objectives
3.        The Consultant Engineering Firm will be engaged to:
(a) provide design and engineering services for the refinery
facilities rationalization, rehabilitation and-energy
conservation components;

THAILAND - BANGCHAK OIL REFINERY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE REFINERY MODIFICATION STUDY
A. Background
1.        Thailand has a total oil refining capacity of 195,000 bpcd
distributed among three major refineries as follows: Bangchak Petroleum
Co. Ltd. (BCP), 65,000 bpcd; Thai Oil Refinery Co. Ltd. (TORC), 65,000
bpcd; and Esso Standard Thailand Ltd., 65,000 bpcd. TORC is a joint
venture between the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the private sector
while Esso is fully owned by Esso Eastern, Inc. BCP is a commercial
limited company owned by the Government and the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand.
2.        Actual production from the three refineries amounts to about
158,000 bpcd. By 1989, when TORC's 17,000-bpcd hydrocracker goes on-stream
and Esso's distillation capacity is increased to 65,000 bpcd, total
production is estimated at 233,000 bpcd. Even with increased production,
however, substantial deficits in mid-distillates are still expected to
occur. Fuel oil production, on the other hand, will continue to be in
excess of demand. Balancing national supply and demand could be achieved
largely through rationalization of the country's refining capacity to which
BOR could contribute significantly. However, the current state of BOR's
facilities and the limited technical experience of the staff preclude the
refinery from efficiently performing its role in the rationalization
program. BCP has, therefore, launched a rehabilitation/rationalization
project aimed at improving the overall performance of the refinery. The
project, which was identified by BCP with the assistance of technical
consultants, will be implemented by BCP with technical and financial
assistance from the World Bank, consisting of five components: (i)
rehabilitation of the BOR refinery to restore its mechanical integrity,
increase capacity utilization to design levels and improve its operations;
(ii) implementation of energy conservation measures to optimize process
unit operations; (iii) improvement of the refinery infrastructure including
safeguards to plant and equipment against flooding; (iv) training to
improve the technical and managerial capabilities of the refinery staff;
and (v) techno-economic study to determine further modifications required
to ensure that the refineries yield pattern will be in balance with the
projected demand profile for petroleum fuels in the country. BCP wishes to
engage the services of engineering consultants to carry out the
techno-economic study in (v) and assist the company in implementing the
resulting recommendations.
B. Objectives
3.        The Refinery Secondary Conversion study will:
(a) Review the demand for and supply of petroleum fuels in
Thailand up to 1995, taking into account the availability of



- 60 -
ANNEX 5-3
Page 2 of 7
indigenous natural gas, coal and hydropower, and the
Government's energy conservation program;
(b)  Identify and evaluate the options available to Thailand to
balance petroleum product supply and demand in the future,
including import/export of deficit/surplus products and
installation of conversion facilities such as hydrocracker,
fluid cracker or thermal cracker in the various refineries
in the country;
(c) Determine the option which gives Thailand the most economic
benefit;
(d) Prepare a comprehensive and documented compilation of data
regarding the recommended option for the BOR refinery; if
recommended option is installation of conversion facilities,
data would include technical descriptions of conversion
scheme, implications on offsites and utilities, cost
estimates with reliability of + 15% including the basis of
such estimates, and possible sources and terms of financing,
including suppliers' credits;
(e) Prepare detailed plans for engineering, design and
implementation, including project management, procurement,
construction and supervision, cost control, project
scheduling, plant start-up, etc   and prepare bid documents
for the selection of the Engineering Contractors; and
(f) Provide technical advisory services during project
implementation.
C. Scope of Work
4.        The proposed study will be carried out in two phases:
Phase I shall comprise, inter alia:
A. Petroleum product demand and supply:
(1)   Review of available information on energy consump-
tion in Thailand with particular emphasis on extent of
demand served by petroleum fuels; review of past trends

crude oil prices, interfuel substitution programs,
natural gas substitution, level and structure of
taxation (customs duties, sales and excise taxes)
including individual product pricing and
cross-subsidization policies, and general economic
conditions in the country; and



- 61 -
ANNEX 5-3
Page 3 of 7
(2)   Review of available energy demand projections (NEA,
PTT, NESDB) and extent to which development of
indigenous energy would effect future demand for
petroleum fuels, particularly in the industrial sector
and develop demand projections for petroleum products
up to the year 1995.

equipment life, cost of operation and the environment;
(2) Evaluation of options available to the country's
various refineries, particularly the BCP refinery, to
meet the country's petroleum fuel requirements up to
year 2000. Assumptions and any new facilities/units
associated with each option should be clearly
identified. The options considered shall include, but
not be limited to:
(a) Operation of BCP refinery with its existing
configuration. Evaluation of this option shall
include detailed review of existing configura-
tion and evaluation of extent to which the
refinery could meet future demand by processing
other types of crude oils likely to prove
economically beneficial, and identification of
any bottlenecks that could prevent the

ANNEX 5-3
Page 4 of 7
processing of such optimum blends of crude oils
not excluding refined products if this be
considered necessary to meet future needs;
(b) Evaluation of alternative processing
configurations such as hydrocracking, fluid
catalytic cracking and thermal cracking for
integration into the existing refinery; and
(c) Possible modification in the other refineries
in the country.
(3)   Detailed description of each configuration considered
for the BOR refinery, including technical flexibility
of each unit in the configuration, efficiency, and
product quality and yields compared to those of recent
units elsewhere;
(4)   Capital and operating cost estimates (in adequate
detail and broken down into local and foreign exchange
costs) based on preliminary engineering design for each
option; the estimate should include any additional
utilities, ancillary facilities and infrastructure
required to ensure efficient operations of each option
considered;
(5)   Preparation of implementation schedule and estimates of
annual disbursements for each option; and
(6)   Economic analysis of options considered and ranking of
options in terms of economic benefits to Thailand.
Assumptions used in analysis should be included.
Phase II will be carried out only if Phase I concludes that
modification of the refinery configuration at BCP would result in
substantial economic benefit to Thailand. Phase II shall
be limited to the BCP refinery and shall include, inter alia:
A.   Project and engineering design package:

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production
1.        Capacity utilization of the crude distillation units is expected
to increase from the current 70% to 95% by 1992 and the succeeding years.
In addition, refined products yield is expected to improve from 94 volume %
to 96%. The comparative volume of net production and product yield with
(1992) and without (1985) the Project are shown in Chapter VIII. The crude
mix and the financial cost per barrel of crude used in the analysis are as
follows:
March 1985 Actual
Financial Cost
Volume %               US$/bbl
Arabian Light                   37.8                    29.82
Arabian Medium                  13.3                   28.23
Arabian Heavy                   13.3                    26.83
Condensates                      6.7                   27.49
Phet Crude                      28.9                    27.19
100.0                   28.29 a/
a/ Weighted average at 600F.
2.        The processing costs per barrel of crude used in the analysis
were based on the current level of expenses, as follows: chemicals,
US$0.08; power, US$0.06; lead, US$0.14; and transhipment, US$0.23. Labor
cost amounts to about US$3.5 million per year. This was assumed to
increase by 20-30% in real terms and be in line with the pay scales in the
industry in Thailand. Repairs and maintenance costs on new equipment were
calculated at 1.5% of project cost; those on existing equipment were
estimated at US$2.7 million per year. Depreciation was calculated on
straight line basis over 15 years.
B. Sales
3.        The ex-refinery product prices used in the analysis were the
March 1985 levels, as follows:
USS/bbl
LPG                                   30.64
Premium Gasoline                      36.88
Regular Gasoline                      33.76
Kerosene/Jet Fuel                     35.68
Diesel Oil                            34.42

THAILAND - BANGCHAK OIL REFINERY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
1.        The economic rates of return for the Project are calculated in
March 1985 US$. Project life was assumed at 15 years with a terminal-value
credit of 10%.
B. Benefits
2.        The annual economic benefits that will be derived from the
Project will come principally from: (a) increased production of refined
products resulting from higher capacity utilization; and (b) savings from
lower energy consumption. The Project will increase to and stabilize
capacity utilization of the crude distillation units at about 95%. The
incremental throughput and production after completion of the project are
as follows:
Comparative Crude and Product Slate--Before and After Project, 1990

a/ Based on design capacity of 23.725 mmbbls/year.
3.        The economic value assigned to the incremental production and
fuel savings were based on the Singapore/Bahrain product to crude price
ratios projected by the Bank and shown in Annex 8-2. The full benefits
from the incremental production and full savings are expected to

Page 2 of 2
be earned by 1990. In addition to production of higher volume of refined
products, about 30,000 tpy of sulphur is expected to be recovered through
upgrading of the desulphurization facilities. The netback value to
Thailand of sulphur exports is estimated at US$120/ton in March 1985 terms.
C. Operating,Costs
4.        The economic cost of crude was based on the weighted average CIF
price currently paid by Thailand and amounts to about US$28.1/bbl. The
cost of crude was assumed to decline in real terms by 6.8% in 1986, and
increase by 0.9% p.a. during 1986-90 and 4.1% during 1990-95, in accordance
with Bank projections. Other operating costs considered in the economic
analysis of the Project include chemicals and utilities and repairs and
maintenance incremental to the Project.
D. Capital Costs
5.        The economic capital cost of the Project was derived from the
financial capital cost, excluding interest during construction, after
deducting import duties and local taxes on imported equipment and other
items. The phase of expenditures was assumed at 10% in 1985, 22X in 1986,
29% in 1987, 24% in 1988, and 15% in 1989.
