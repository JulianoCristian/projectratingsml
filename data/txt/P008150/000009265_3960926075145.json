and with needed\n            technical assistance to implement key elements of the\n            Structural Adjustment Program.  The studies and technical\n            assistance activities are designed to define policy options,\n            prepare medium-term strategies, and strengthen and\n            reorganize key public sector management functions.  The\n            technical assistance project plans to finance the cost of\n            the studies which will be carried out over the period\n            1987-88 and which will provide the analytical framework and\n            lead to action programs in various areas covered under the\n            Structural Adjustment Program. Specifically, it supports (a)\n            social security finances and administration, (b) fiscal\n            reform, (c) public investment programming and (d) capital\n            market improvements.  In addition, the project provides for\n            (e) an administrative reform study and an (f) an import\n            tariff review."}, "docdt": "1987-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
