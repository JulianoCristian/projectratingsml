Starting from 1993, the World Bank\n            provided 6 loans totaling United States (U.S.) 1083.4\n            million dollars for the development of Ukraine's main\n            state institutions. 1993-1999, the institutional loan\n            project was implemented (the total cost of the project was\n            U.S. 44 million dollars; the World Bank loan is 27 million).\n            In 1994-1996, the rehabilitation loan project was\n            implemented (U.S. 500 million dollars). Within the framework\n            of these projects, consultancy and advisory services were,\n            in particular, rendered, equipment was purchased for the\n            Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and other government\n            institutions, the National Bank of Ukraine, and the state\n            property fund; foreign currency was also provided for\n            purchasing critical-import goods; the budget received\n            support for strengthening the system of social protection of\n            the poorest strata of the population. This loan is aimed at\n            resolving some problem issues of Ukrainian reforms and,\n            specifically in the area of fiscal and financial discipline,\n            regulatory policy, forming and protecting of ownership\n            rights, and achieving of social stability. For project\n            implementation, a series of programmatic adjustment loans\n            are to be provided, aimed at achieving the efficiency of the\n            government performance. The project supports the Ukrainian\n            government's efforts to build up the functional and\n            computerized treasury system which is expected to increase\n            the efficiency of the budget execution and ensure its\n            implementation in full scope and more controllable cash\n            flow. The project supports the state tax\n            administration's efforts to develop and introduce a\n            single system of state registration of tax payers at\n            Ukraine's tax bodies, and a system of supervising the\n            calculation and receipt of payments, as well as\n            reorganization of the tax service by the functional principle."}, "docdt": "2004-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
