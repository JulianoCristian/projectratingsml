development objectives were moderate, the\n            project outcome was extremely positive. Key lessons learned\n            included: This project helped to establish a broad\n            constituency for economic reform, built up significant\n            implementation capacity within the Government, and\n            demonstrated the importance of institution building using a\n            flexible approach. Government \"ownership\" of the\n            project is an important factor: when the Government adopted\n            a comprehensive structural reform program and restructured\n            the project, its commitment was enhanced. Limited and\n            focused programs, particularly pilots, are effective tools\n            for launching reforms in politically sensitive areas.\n            Intensive supervision by experienced Bank staff is a key\n            factor for institution building in new member countries.\n            There was flexibility in project design and redesign during\n            implementation. Procurement was delayed because of the long\n            learning curve in comprehending and internalizing\n            transparent and open bidding procedures. There is\n            deep-seated cultural and political bias against foreign\n            consultants which often leads to contractual disputes and a\n            slowing down of project implementation. Using a centralized\n            project implementation unit at the ministry of economy\n            slowed down implementation due to poor communication between\n            the PIU and the beneficiary agencies."}, "docdt": "1999-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
