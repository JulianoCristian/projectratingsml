                    CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                                   ARMENIA

Recipient            Republic of Armenia
Implementing Agency  Ministry of Finance
Financing Data       IDA Credit of SDR 40.4 million (US$ 60 million equivalent)
Operation Type       First Development Policy Operation (DPO-1)
Main Policy Areas    In view of the global economic crisis, the DPO supports the
                     Government's two strategic objectives of (i) mitigating Armenia's
                     vulnerability   to    the current    shocks    and   (ii)  strengthening
                     competitiveness for post-crisis recovery and growth over the medium
                     term. To mitigate vulnerability the operation will support the
                     Government in managing the impact of the global crisis by maintaining
                     a sound macroeconomic and fiscal framework while protecting the poor;
                     and strengthening the management of education, health, and social
                     protection programs. To strengthen competitiveness for recovery and
                     growth, the operation will assist the Government in improving
                     economic competition and the business climate; strengthening the
                     regulatory environment in infrastructure; improving competitiveness
                     through the sustainable use of energy and natural resources; and
                     improving public sector efficiency and effectiveness.
Key Outcome          The key outcome indicators (detailed in the operation matrix) include:
Indicators           protection of the poor and vulnerable during the crisis; strengthened
                     management and financing systems in health and education; reduced
                     cost of doing business; enhanced competitiveness of Armenian firms;
                     strengthened regulatory frameworks for infrastructure services;
                     improved effectiveness of public financial management; and enhanced
                     fiscal space due to improved revenue administration.
Program Development  The principal purpose of the proposed Development Policy Operation
Objective(s) and     (DPO) program (2009-2011) is to provide support to the Government of
Contribution to CAS  the Republic of Armenia to address vulnerabilities, particularly in the
                     context   of   the global    economic crisis,       while strengthening
                     competitiveness for more rapid growth in the post-crisis period.
Risks and Risk       The proposed operation is subject to several risks of domestic and
Mitigation           external origin. In the current crisis context, the main risk is a deeper
                     and protracted global recession that would seriously damage Armenia's
                     economy and erode its growth prospects. There are a number of risks
                     that could emanate from a more severe crisis. First, a more severe crisis
                     could compromise Armenia's fiscal position in the short and medium
                     terms, leading to a higher risk of debt distress and limiting
                     implementation of the SDP. Second, the economic crisis could lead to
                     deterioration in the political environment, if the social situation is
                     exacerbated by higher employment in key sectors (mining and
                     construction) and in hard hit regions, and if return migration from
                     Russia and elsewhere aggravates tensions. Third, the crisis may pressure
                     the Government to resort to suboptimal measures in the form of
                     protectionism    and    subsidies.   These    measures    would    erode
                                          iii

                              competitiveness and undermine the macro-fiscal framework, leading to
                              a high and burdensome debt level. Current economic conditions could
                              also embolden resistance to some reforms, including, for example,
                              implementation of stronger environmental regulations.

                              To manage risks, the Bank is pursuing a number of mitigation measures.
                              First, the Bank is holding a continuous policy dialogue with the
                              Government on macroeconomic issues as well as policy responses and
                              tradeoffs. The robust relationship between the Government and the
                              Bank ensures frank and clear policy discussions at the highest levels.
                              The Bank has intensified its macroeconomic monitoring such that
                              projections are updated at least on a monthly basis, and regularly
                              discussed with the Ministry of Finance. Second, the Bank is engaging in
                              close collaboration, including parallel missions, with the Fund. Third,
                              the Bank is providing complementary technical assistance in key areas,
                              such as social protection, public financial management (including
                              revenue administration), and private sector development.

                                PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
               PROPOSED FIRST DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
                               TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

                                      I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The principal purpose of the proposed Development Policy Operation (DPO)
program (2009-2011) is to provide support to the Government of the Republic of
Armenia to address vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of the global economic
crisis, while strengthening competitiveness for more rapid growth in the post-crisis
period.1 This is the first in a proposed series of three annual operations. The proposed First
Development Policy Operation (DPO-1), an IDA credit of US$ 60 million equivalent, is
anchored in Armenia's Sustainable Development Program (SDP) of October 2008.2

2.      The bedrock of crisis management must continue to be a macroeconomic
framework that supports fiscal and external balance, including appropriate exchange
rate management, while preserving debt sustainability over the medium term. Although
Armenia entered this difficult economic period from a position of strength--a low fiscal
deficit (less than one percent) and low public debt (about 17 percent of GDP) in 2008--fiscal
sustainability and debt management are becoming even more critical. The vulnerable must
also be protected from external shocks, which have already become manifest in higher
unemployment and lower remittances, and will lead to imminently higher poverty rates.

3.      In addressing vulnerability, the DPO program will support the Government to
protect the poor and support greater human capital development. Reducing vulnerability
depends on safeguarding spending for social safety nets while also improving targeting so that
program coverage of the poor and vulnerable can be broadened more efficiently and
effectively. Further developing human capital depends on intensifying reform of the tertiary
and the preschool sectors, and deepening health financing and service delivery reforms.

4.      In improving competitiveness, the DPO program will assist the Government to
alleviate private sector and governance constraints. Thus, the DPO series proposes to
focus on high impact reforms aimed at public sector modernization and private sector
development. Priority reforms need to span both the public and private sectors and focus on
the following to unlock growth potential, alleviate the human capital constraint, and reduce
corruption: strengthening the business environment through lower business registration and
inspection costs; improving corporate governance; modernizing the regulatory framework in
telecommunications, mining, and energy; reducing compliance costs through tax and customs
reform; and improving efficiency and accountability in public financial management through
system reform and strengthening incentives in the civil service.

5.      The economic context, however, introduces an additional challenge in the short
term--managing the crisis effectively and efficiently while mitigating the impact on the
poor. The DPO program will also assist the Government in withstanding the global economic

crisis by adopting a sound, short term policy response package. Economic vulnerabilities have
been accentuated by the global financial crisis and recession. The crisis has exposed within
Armenia policy and institutional weaknesses that heretofore appeared relatively benign, but
now pose as more significant shortcomings. Armenia is seeking support from its international
partners, including the Bank to develop, finance, and implement mitigating measures that
reflect its development strategy and help to preserve the considerable gains in poverty
reduction, while addressing longer term policy and institutional weaknesses.3

6.      The DPO, as an important component of the new Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS), is necessary to undergird the reform agenda by focusing the policy dialogue on
results, prioritizing measures within and across sectors, and reinforcing political
momentum to tackle difficult issues. The DPO series provides an opportunity to deepen and
accelerate the reform agenda, particularly as it pertains to the challenges of competition and
governance in Armenia. The DPO series also builds on the lessons of the PRSC series (2004-
2007), crystallized in the Implementation Completion Report (March 2009). As concessional
ODA declines and Armenia takes its place among middle income countries, and as the
external environment is likely to continue to be challenging for some time, the rate of reform
will need to be accelerated to so that the country can compete in a much more demanding
global arena. The DPO, as a high level policy dialogue instrument, will also support
implementation of the project portfolio in key areas.

7.      As it has unfolded, the crisis has exposed weaknesses in the policy and
institutional spheres. As diverse firms--from the IT to mining sectors--close their doors or
idle their capacity in response to the crisis, existing weaknesses, whether in infrastructure
provision, the regulatory environment, or basic business management procedures, become
more costly in terms of lost opportunities. With the steep decline in revenue over the past few
months, the already low level of revenue to GDP has become even lower and a more tightly
binding constraint on the Government's ability to implement its policy agenda. The
Government's attempts to rapidly reorient expenditure and plan new investment projects
exposes the weaknesses in the public financial management system, including the ability to
appraise capital projects. The global crisis has made clear that Armenia needs to redouble its
efforts to improve revenue mobilization, to create a level playing field for all economic
agents, and to deliver the public goods vital for development.

8.      The crisis thus reinforces Armenia's objective of moving decisively to implement
a robust second generation reform program. The set of `first generation' reforms that
served Armenia well--by removing the binding constraints to growth and poverty reduction
at that time--has been followed up by reforms laid out in the SDP, which will need vigorous
political and administrative support. The SDP provides an overarching framework and
promises a catalogue of measures that will revitalize growth and accelerate poverty reduction.
In addition, accelerating long-standing reform commitments in key areas will be critical for
successful recovery in the post-crisis world. The proposed DPO program aims to bring
together and prioritize these reforms into a coherent package that will provide the cornerstone
for the second generation of policy and institutional reforms needed to diversify, broaden, and
sustain growth and poverty reduction over the medium term.

9.       More specifically, the DPO aims to help Armenia transition to a new post-crisis
growth model by alleviating the known binding constraints to growth. The large body of
analytical work on the Armenian economy arrives at a solid consensus on the most binding
constraints to growth: (a) the weak conditions for fair competition, (b) high administrative and
regulatory costs to firms, (c) insufficient and low quality infrastructure, (d) the shallow nature
of financial intermediation, and (e) under-investment in human capital (see Armenia - The
Caucasian Tiger, World Bank, 2007; and Armenia: Choices in Development Policy, 2008-
2012, World Bank, 2008). The hypothesis underlying the DPO series is that addressing these
five economy-wide constraints is critical to move Armenia to a new growth model. Table 1
links the binding constraints to the needed reform areas in the DPO. While the new post-crisis
growth model would have to look rather different from the current one--as many aspects of
the current growth model will likely be untenable after the crisis--it is not advisable for the
Government to pick specific sectors for preferential treatment but rather to create the
framework for the private sector to make better choices. Broadly speaking, the new model
would likely need to: exhibit greater diversification of exports, move higher up the value
chain in exports, and make greater use of innovation to enhance productivity.

                                      II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

10.      Armenia's independence in 1991 was followed by a severe economic contraction
and armed conflict with Azerbaijan, at the same time that the country was still coping
with the impacts of a major earthquake. The consequences of these factors were
devastating. In response, Armenia developed and put in place a stabilization strategy, which
proved successful. Armenia then began developing and implementing important structural
reforms to recast the respective roles of the state and private sector. This structural reform
program liberalized trade and prices, established the legal framework for a market economy,
privatized most small- and medium-sized enterprises, and reduced the Government's
intervention in the economy. Macroeconomic stability was restored and maintained, as annual
GDP growth average 5.5 percent (1994-2000). By the early 2000s, this approach had settled
into a reasonably coherent strategy, reflected in the country's first PRSP.

11.      The last CAS period (FY05-08) was characterized by relative political stability,
but the situation is changing. This stability was reflected in the continuity in office of the
President of the Republic and of a stable coalition in parliament that provided strong backing
for the reformist agenda laid out in the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of 2004.
                                                    3

However, the presidential elections in 2008 led to unresolved tensions with the opposition.
This has also negatively affected perceptions of some of Armenia's longstanding international
partners, who would like to see decisive action to improve the credibility of the electoral
process, strengthen mechanisms of voice and accountability, and improve governance.
Despite introduction of some measures in public administration (including tax and customs)
and the judicial sector, some enforcement of measures has been weak, and the effectiveness of
some measures taken has been poor. Fundamental political economy difficulties such as the
enforcement of conflict of interest legislation on public officials, ministers and
parliamentarians, checks to the power of powerful business interests in evading customs and
tax payments, exercising some de facto monopolies in imports and internal distribution and
distorting competition conditions, remain to be seriously addressed. Transparency
International currently lists Armenia as 108th out of 180 countries in its 2008 Corruption
Perception Index, falling from 99 in 2007.

12.     Current political tensions may be further aggravated by the economic decline,
which is fueling social discontent. According to a recent poll, 70 percent of those surveyed
feel that they have been affected by the crisis, while around 50 percent believe that the
situation will further worsen. The solution of complex regional political issues, including
relations with Turkey and resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Azerbaijan,
would require decisive but potentially divisive action, which could further affect internal
political stability (as evidenced by the recent withdrawal of the Dashnak party from the
coalition due to disagreement about the potential rapprochement with Turkey).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN ARMENIA
13.     Armenia has a strong history of sustained economic reform, the results of which
have been an impressive growth record. Armenia has had the highest policy reform (CPIA)
ranking of all IDA countries for the past several years, with its average economic cluster
rating at 5.5. Economic growth accelerated after 2000, helped by a positive external
environment and an improving business environment. Annual average growth rates of 12
percent were achieved from 2001 through mid-2008, which led to a fall in poverty from over
half of the population in 1999 to about 25 percent and an even sharper fall in severe poverty
from 21 percent to around 3 percent.

14.     However, starting in the mid-2000s, economic vulnerabilities emerged.
Dependence on remittances and capital flows grew in these years amid a slowdown of growth
in the tradable sector in general and exports in particular. Construction and services became
the largest contributors to growth. Furthermore, since 2007 substantial real exchange rate
appreciation led to a widening of the trade and current account deficits. While the fiscal
position was relatively prudent, the period of double digit economic growth did not translate
into sufficient improvement of structural fiscal position, which was largely a result of weak
revenue administration.

15.     Ending a period of high and accelerating growth, GDP growth in 2008 slowed to
6.8 percent, from around 10 percent in the first three quarters of 2008. Growth became
negative in the fourth quarter of 2008, marking the first quarterly decline since 1994. The rate
of decline has accelerated since then, reaching -9.7 percent in January-April of 2009. The real
estate sector, the largest contributor to growth in recent years, has experienced a severe
contraction, as has metallurgy and mining. Other sectors (e.g. Armenia's small but growing IT

                                               4

industry) are also under stress. Unemployment rose sharply, as numerous copper and
molybdenum mines closed, putting further pressure on the rural economy, social safety nets,
and tax receipts alike. Twelve-month inflation declined to around 3 percent by April 2009,
from its highest level of around 12 percent in August 2008, due to a sharp decline in fuel and
food prices. Slowing economic activity has put further deflationary pressures on prices, and
the exchange rate adjustment of March 2009, which resulted in depreciation of approximately
twenty percent, did not result in a substantial one-off increase in prices.

16.     Recent economic data confirm that 2009 will likely post a deep contraction. The
Government's current projections show a contraction of around 9.5 percent in 2009, with slow
recovery beginning in 2010 (see Table 2). Given the global nature of the crisis and the
complexity of the interconnections in the global economy, economic projections for the DPO
period are characterized as highly stochastic. The state of the Russian economy, given
Armenia's reliance on remittances from Russia and strong trade linkages, will be an important
factor for Armenia's economic outlook for the medium term. However, it is possible that the
recovery of the global economy and recovery of the Russian economy in particular, will
translate into a recovery of the Armenian economy only with a significant lag, thus
prolonging the domestic recession.

17.     Armenia's external balance has deteriorated substantially since 2007 with the
current account deficit exceeding 11 percent of GDP in 2008 and the trade deficit
exceeding 25 percent of GDP. Exports started to decline in volumes in 2006, but poor export
performance was masked by favorable prices for non-ferrous metals, the main export item for
Armenia. Import growth, on the other hand, was very strong and driven by remittances, FDI,
commercial banks' external borrowing, and real exchange rate appreciation. The drastic
deterioration of the external environment in the last quarter of 2008 resulted in a more than 40
percent decline in exports in the first quarter of 2009 (in USD terms). The slowdown in
imports began in January 2009, and it is projected that the current account deficit will adjust
in USD terms, although as a percent of GDP it will worsen in 2009-2010 before starting to
adjust in 2011.

18.     A marked slowdown in remittances--a major transmission channel--is
occurring in light of the close economic and investment linkages with Russia. Armenia is
one of the most highly remittance-dependent economies in the ECA region. Remittances, at
about US$ 1.7 billion estimated in 2008, accounted for more than 14 per cent of GDP.
Remittances are also highly dependent on the Russian economy, where more than ¾ of
remittances originate. The decline in remittances in the first quarter of 2009, at around 30
percent, sharply contrasted with their average annual growth from 2004-2008, which
exceeded 30 percent. Remittances to Armenia are expected to decline further, and could
decline by as much as 20 percent this year. FDI is also expected to drop significantly in 2009.

19.     The Government's response to the crisis has had four prongs: (a) reverting to a
market-determined exchange rate to ensure balance and stability; (b) reducing lower priority
spending to partially off-set revenue reductions while raising additional external financing to
cover the higher deficit; (c) strengthening financial sector surveillance and stability; and (d)
supporting employment through increased ODA-financed capital spending and provision of
state aid to selected firms.

20.     The de facto peg to the dollar was abandoned on March 3, which led to a one-off
twenty percent devaluation of the dram. Gross foreign reserves had declined due to the
Central Bank's interventions to support the dram by more than 40 percent over the preceding
five months. Although the policy of the de facto dollar peg may have temporarily shielded the
financial sector, but at the cost of delaying the necessary adjustment, it exacerbated external
imbalances as the dram continued to appreciate between October 2008 and February 2009 in
both nominal and real effective terms.

21.     The Armenian banking system remains well capitalized (on average, the capital-
to-asset ratio is 27 per cent), the open foreign exchange position is small, and recent
stress tests show that the banking system is robust. Overall, public confidence in the
banking system remains intact. Though financial intermediation is shallow, there has been
growing bank reliance on external borrowing to fund high credit expansion in recent years ­
the loan to deposit ratio is around 140 percent (end-2008), up from 80 percent at end-2006. At
the same time, the share of dram loans to total loans dropped while the share of dram deposits
declined more sharply to 30.1% from 46.4% at the end-2008. The financial system adapted
well to a large, sudden shift of deposits into dollars. However, as a consequence, the
availability of dram credits has dried up, which suggests the Access to Finance for Small and
Medium Enterprises Project to provide medium term liquidity to SMEs is especially timely.



                                                7

22.     The recent economic slowdown has increased banks' exposure to a number of
risks, however. Rapid growth of credit in the past few years, largely collateralized by
household mortgages and consumer lending, has increased banks' vulnerability to the decline
in real estate prices. External exposure has become a source of both foreign exchange and
roll-over risks for those banks without a strong foreign parent. Against the backdrop of a
slowing economy, banks' share of NPLs has almost doubled from 2.4% at end-2007 to 4.4%
at end-2008, though is still relatively low in comparison to similar countries.

23.     Although Armenia entered this difficult period from a position of strength--a
low fiscal deficit and low public debt (at about 17 percent of GDP) in 2008--the
Government has had to make significant changes to the 2009 budget. The 2009 budget
and the medium-term expenditure framework for 2009-2011 were based on growth
projections of 8-9 percent per annum. In addition, projections of the revenue envelope were
based on the expectation of a sustained increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio. However, not only
have revenues declined in nominal term in the first four months of 2009 (and are now
approximately 30 percent less than the estimates for the period), but the tax-to-GDP ratio has
also declined, raising concerns about revenue administration. It is projected that tax revenue
for the year as a whole will be at least 25 percent below the nominal projections for 2009. In
response the Government issued a decree in March to delay lower priority expenditures until
the last quarter, freezing about 10 percent of the total 2009 budget (and 16 percent of the
capital budget). A revised budget, reflecting a mix of proposed fiscal adjustment and
additional external financing, however, has not yet been prepared for the National Assembly,
due to uncertainties in the external and policy environments.

24.     The revenue shortfall, the greater need for social protection expenditures, and
the increased need for deficit financing, are the main challenges that Armenia's budget
is facing in 2009-2010. Even after suspending expenditures planned for 2009, the deficit-to-
GDP ratio may reach 6 percent in 2009, in contrast to the 1 percent projected before the crisis.
The Government has already drawn down its precautionary savings accumulated in the CBA
over 2001-2007 to finance additional deficit spending in the amount of 2 percent of GDP.

25.     The Government has been proactive in taking sufficient measures to fill the fiscal
and external financing gaps. Budget support from the Bank ($60 million) and ADB ($70-
$80 million) are needed to help close the gap, and discussions are at an advanced stage.
Significant additional funding was secured via a loan from Russia in May for US$ 500
million, which will be used to finance countercyclical infrastructure expenditures and SME
development over 2009-2010. The Government has also requested budget support from the
IMF, which, if provided could be the largest source for fiscal and balance of payment
financing in 2009-2010 (see Box 1), and discussions to augment the SBA are at an advanced
stage of consideration, with a Fund Board decision likely by end-June. These resources will
likely shield the budget from further cuts in 2009 and provide greater fiscal space in 2010.

                                      Box 1: IMF Stand-By Arrangement

        The March 2009 28-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) is aimed at addressing
        Armenia's exceptional financing need, which is a result of the large shocks it is
        experiencing to both the current and capital accounts. Under the Fund's policy on
        exceptional access, Armenia satisfied four substantive criteria: exceptional balance of
        payments pressure in the capital account; sustainable debt position; ability to regain
        access to private capital markets; and a strong economic policy program. The SBA
        involves frontloaded and exceptional access from the Fund of 400 percent of quota (SDR
        368 million, or about US$ 544 million, of which $350 million is planned to be disbursed
        in 2009). The main objective is to help the authorities provide a sufficient liquidity buffer
        to the banking system and preserve import coverage at a desirable level, while sending a
        powerful signal to markets. Conditionality focuses on measures critical to address
        macroeconomic vulnerabilities, reflecting the importance of continued reforms in the
        financial sector and public finance. The Government recently requested additional
        financing via budget support in 2009-2010.


26.      Given recent developments on the external financing front, Armenia is planning
to maintain a large fiscal deficit in 2010 as well (Table 3). The fiscal deficit is projected at
around 6 percent of GDP in 2010, a level which will allow the Government to maintain public
spending at roughly the same level as 2009. Armenia may need to undergo substantial fiscal
adjustments starting in 2011 to reverse its rapid debt accumulation in 2009-2010, which
reinforces the importance of revenue measures, including improving tax administration, for
fiscal sustainability.

27.     In response to the crisis the Government is also accelerating planned
infrastructure project implementation by means of increased externally-financed capital
spending (including the IDA Fast Track Facility projects). Accelerated project
development and implementation, as a counter-cyclical measure, is intended to generate
employment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks, and lay the basis for growth-enhancing
productivity gains. The largest of the accelerated projects is a social housing project in the
earthquake affected area (projected 0.7 percent of GDP in 2009). Among other large projects
under development are: the Iran-Armenia railway, the North-South road corridor to link
Armenia with Georgia and Iran, and a nuclear power plant.

28.     The new externally-financed capital spending, however, is somewhat off-set by
the reductions in domestically financed capital spending effected by the March decree.
With the possibility of significant budget support in 2009, the Government intends to restore
projects cut from its public investment program to ensure completion of most on-going
projects and to create employment opportunities in both urban and areas. The Government
also plans in DPO-2 and DPO-3 to establish a public investment appraisal system to ensure
proper economic and financial appraisal.

29.     The Government has established a Rapid Response Committee to provide firm-
level support (state aid) to companies in distress. A number of initiatives have been already
approved by the Government (Box 2), and there are additional measures under consideration.
Recognizing the risks associated with `picking winners,' the Government is developing a
safeguards framework that ensures that: (a) contingent liabilities of Government guarantees
are estimated and incorporated in the fiscal framework; (b) the committee operates according
to a known budget constraint, so that trade-offs with other budgetary spending are explicit; (c)
cost-benefit analyses are prepared; (d) all sources and uses of funds are on-budget and are
consistent with Government public financial management procedures; and (e) measures are
temporary and limited.

                             Box 2: Rapid Response Committee State Aid

   Since its establishment, the Rapid Response Committee has reviewed numerous applications from
   private companies for state aid. Only 5 projects have been approved by the Government thus far,
   including a loan to a copper company, subsidies and bank guaranties for a fruit processing
   company, and small equity participation in software and organic food companies. The total fiscal
   cost of these operations is around US$ 20 million. In addition, the Government announced its
   readiness to allocate a total of US$ 50 million in bank guarantees to ailing construction
   companies, but no decision has yet been made.


30.     In conclusion, the Government's overall macroeconomic policy framework is
adequate for this operation. Starting from a strong position going into the crisis, the
Government has taken appropriate and measured policy actions to adjust as proactively as
possible to the global crisis. Though fiscal deficits and the debt level are increasing rapidly,
Armenia entered the crisis from a position of strength, with a large amount of fiscal space that
could be deployed to support counter-cyclical measures. The Government's overall package
of anti-crisis measures is focused on protecting the poor while allowing for fiscal and external
adjustment in a sustainable manner. The most significant risk to the sustainability of the
macroeconomic framework over the medium term would be excessive non-concessional
borrowing, especially if it is invested in projects with uncertain economic returns in the
                                                10

context of an extended global slowdown. This will need to be monitored closely through the
DPO program.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
31.     The economic outlook for the medium term will depend on many external and
domestic factors, all of which are characterized by a great deal of uncertainty. Continued
economic contraction among Armenia's main trading partners and host countries of
Armenia's migrant workers, especially Russia, remains the key risk for economic recovery.
The pace of recovery will also depend on international prices for non-ferrous metals.
Recovery in the flows of international credit is also important for restoring access to capital
for Armenia's financial institutions. However, Armenia's economic performance will also
depend on domestic factors, such as the extent of adjustment in the construction sector, which
contributed around 27 percent of GDP in 2008 (half of which is residential construction), and
has now become very vulnerable in light of slowdown in remittances, the weak real estate
market, and worsened access to credit. Therefore, even if the external environment recovers
quickly, there are underlying forces that may delay Armenia's recovery.

32.     Developments in imported energy prices and domestic tariffs for gas and
electricity also pose risks to medium-term growth and poverty reduction agenda. The gas
agreement with Russia allowed Armenia to receive natural gas at preferential prices until
2009. However, Armenia will gradually move to international prices in 2009 and 2010, which
will substantially worsen Armenia's terms of trade and will force further adjustments in the
economy that is still highly energy inefficient by international standards.

33.     The debt outlook has been very favorable with a low risk of debt distress.
Armenia's external public and publicly-guaranteed debt fell from 33 percent of GDP in 2004
to around 15 percent by end-2008, which was supported by a prudent borrowing strategy and
strong economic growth coupled with sharp and sustained exchange rate appreciation.
However, the present economic environment poses risks that may undermine Armenia's debt
sustainability.

34.     Enhanced external financing to manage the downturn, given the low level of debt,
is warranted even on commercial terms, but it places a higher burden on debt
management and public investment appraisal. Armenia's borrowing in the near term will
largely be on commercial or near commercial terms; and ODA is becoming less concessional.
Armenia's transition to a less concessional debt structure means that debt levels should be
within prudential limits and public investments selected so that growth impacts are
maximized. Armenia's debt outlook would deteriorate if large infrastructure projects do not
adequately strengthen Armenia's debt repayment capacity through accelerated economic
growth and increased export receipts.

35.     Preliminary projections show that due to new borrowing in 2009 and 2010, the
ratio of Armenia's external public debt-to-GDP may reach 44 percent by 2011, largely
driven by the expected large increase in bilateral and multilateral borrowing at near
commercial terms. If the economy recovers, and in the absence of further major shocks, the
debt to GDP ratio may return to 30 percent over the medium term. However, large shocks
(e.g., exchange rate depreciation, a prolonged contraction, and/or shocks to output, the current
account, and interest rates), could push Armenia's debt to GDP ratio closer to 50 percent
(Figure 1). Although this debt level does not pose a high risk of distress, it does represent a
                                               11

rapid and significant rise in the debt burden, indicating the need for Armenia to continue its
policy of prudent external debt management. External developments remain uncertain and
Armenia's revenue level is relatively low, indicating that debt repayment capacity could
remain limited. In addition, public revenues remain small relative to GDP, which would also
affect debt repayment capacity if the country's indebtedness continues to grow.

TRENDS IN POVERTY AND POVERTY IMPACT OF THE CRISIS

36.     Economic growth has resulted in falling poverty: the incidence of poverty fell
from around 56 percent in 1998 to about 35 percent in 2004 and further declined to 25
percent in 2007.4 These developments are attributable to strong reform efforts in transition,
steps taken to create an improved business climate, as well as a sharp increase in real wages,
private transfers from abroad, and rising social transfers made possible because of an
increasingly strong fiscal position. Extreme poverty declined even faster, from about 6.4
percent in 2004 to less than 4 percent in 2007. Moreover, poverty has become shallower and
less severe as the poverty gap and the severity of poverty have declined considerably faster.
Armenia is on track to achieve most, if not all, of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
by 2015, despite the recession and rise in poverty projected for 2009-10 (Table 4).

37.     However, despite these remarkable achievements, 25 percent of the population­
about 800,000 people­are still poor, including around 120,000 of extremely poor
individuals, and significant pockets of poverty still remain. A recently completed poverty
mapping report highlighted the striking disparity in poverty rates across the regions. The
spatial disparities in poverty incidence and the pace of poverty reduction suggest that the
benefits of recent economic growth have not been evenly distributed across the country.

38.      The contraction in growth, however, is directly affecting poverty developments.
As real GDP growth falls, the incidence of poverty would increase. Micro simulations of the
cumulative impact of the crisis through lower GDP growth, labor market effects, the exchange
rate adjustment, and lower remittances suggest that poverty could increase by about 5.2
percentage points between 2008 and 2010 (Figure 2). The projected poverty incidence in 2010
of about 28 percent is higher than the 2006 level of 26.5 percent, implying that the poverty
reductions recorded between 2006 and 2008 would be more than fully offset by the crisis. The
increase in the poverty gap would be more pronounced as the already poor become poorer.
The projected poverty gap in 2010 would be as large as the level in 2004.




5Armenia continues to exceed these goals as the girl/boy ratio in primary and secondary education was 104 and
105, respectively, in 2007.

39.     The extreme poverty incidence and poverty gap would both increase by a
substantially larger margin. The levels of extreme poverty indices in 2009 and 2010 could
easily surpass their corresponding levels in 2004 (Figure 3). As a result, an estimated 149,000
people could fall below the extreme poverty threshold in 2009 and another 31,000 could be
added in 2010. The number of the extreme poor in 2010 could exceed that in 2004 by about
77,000 people.

40.     The key factors driving the poverty impact are the sharp contractions in growth,
employment, and remittances. On the employment side the increase is driven by the
disproportionately higher impact of the financial crisis on construction and mining. From
March 2008 to March 2009 the official registered unemployment rate increased from 6.3 to
6.6 percent, which roughly translates into about 5,000 jobs lost. However, the registered
unemployment rate is much lower than the survey-based unemployment rate (including the
informal sector), which is estimated at just under 30 percent of the labor force. Remittances,
which are a key determinant of poverty reduction in Armenia, accounted for 55 percent of
income for those who reported receiving them. With almost 80 percent of Armenia's migrant

                                                           14

workers in Russia, remittances are highly dependent on developments in the Russian
economy, especially in construction. Regionally, rural areas and Yerevan stand to lose the
most from declining remittances. Lastly, the exchange rate adjustment may also play a role.
While imported final consumption goods constitute only 20 percent of the consumption
basket, as much as 40 percent of the local production of the consumer goods is directly
affected by the exchange rate adjustment as their production relies on imported inputs.

41.     Given the likelihood of significantly higher poverty in 2009 and 2010, and the
accelerated rate at which this will occur, the Government would like to devote additional
resources for social safety net (SSN) programs. The poverty projections, albeit indicative
estimates, highlight the need for mitigation measures to lessen the burden on households
vulnerable to the crisis. Armenia's poor already rely substantially on government transfer
schemes, particularly on the targeted Family Benefit (FB) program. The FB program is an
appropriate vehicle for delivering such support to existing beneficiaries as well as to those
households that may become eligible due to the economic crisis.

42.     The Government increased funding for the FB program by 10 percent in 2009
and is protecting that funding from any reductions. The estimates of additional resources
that would be needed to cushion the impact of the crisis through additional spending on social
protection programs are based on the poverty incidence and gap simulation exercises.
Accordingly, about AMD 22.4 billion (or 0.8 percent of the projected 2009 GDP) would be
needed to fully mitigate the impact of the crisis on the overall poor. The corresponding figure
for mitigating the impact on the very poor alone would be about AMD 10.7 billion (0.3
percent of 2009 GDP). Given Armenia's highly constrained fiscal space, however, emphasis
is being placed on protecting current SSN allocations and recycling resources saved from
improved targeting in SSN programs.

  III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

43.     The "Sustainable Development Program" (SDP), approved by the Government in
October 2008, is Armenia's second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The SDP has four
key goals covering the period 2009­2021 (with specific medium term targets indicated in
2009­2015): reducing poverty, including the elimination of extreme poverty; ensuring human
development; decreasing corruption and improving public management; and deepening
economic growth and accelerating development of lagging regions.6 The SDP puts forth in
detail the Government's medium term reform agenda, focusing on: (a) economic growth and
diversification aimed at deepening competition and fostering private sector development; (b)
public sector reform that improves civil servants' performance through better incentives and
stronger conflict of interest management while strengthening core systems such as the
judiciary, public financial management, and e-government; (c) human development through
improved management and financing in health and education, with strengthened social
protection programs, including pensions; and (d) infrastructure services through higher public
investment and better regulatory approaches. Given the crisis, the SDP is now being
reformulated. Nevertheless, the central reformist thrust of the SDP and guiding principles for
future policy developments are expected to be reaffirmed.




6The Joint Staff Advisory Note was discussed at the Board on December 2, 2008.
                                                     15

44.    The SDP process largely benefited from the institutional framework created after
the approval of PRSP-1. The partnership arrangements, which consisted of the PRSP
Steering Committee, Working Group, Secretariat, and Open Forum, established a precedent
for effective implementation and monitoring. The framework also facilitated highly
participatory consultations on preparation of the SDP. The SDP process benefited from brain-
storming discussions throughout the country, "Voices of Poor" and other surveys, and from
consultations with development partners. The new institutional arrangements allow for even
greater engagement of civil society organizations (CSO) through a CSO board and secretariat
with direct and regular access to the SDP Steering Committee. The framework encourages
direct participation by CSOs in the process of SDP implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation.

45.    Government is preparing a time-bound action plan that spells out specific
measures, responsible agencies, agreed indicators, and accountability arrangements for
SDP implementation. An action plan with updated measures for the medium-term will be
approved in the autumn of 2009. To effectively monitor implementation, the SDP translates
goals and strategic priorities into actionable measures and performance targets. However, this
should be further strengthened in the action plans, which should present: (a) a time-bound
matrix of key policy actions and institutional reforms, anchored in the MTEF, over a medium-
term horizon; and (b) a selected set of corresponding core indicators to measure performance
against targets. Moreover, there are several SDP priority areas for which existing reporting
arrangements are inadequate to provide sufficient information. In these cases the collection of
supplementary information will need to be improved. In other cases, a mismatch between
reporting and evaluation cycles will need to be rationalized. As the budget system has been
further strengthened, the monitoring of the SDP should be fully integrated into the budget
process, which would prove more sustainable. Specifically, performance budgeting reforms
are sufficiently advanced such that they provide an opportunity for the full integration of SDP
indicators with agency performance indicators.

46.    The major stakeholders of the SDP recently signed the Social Partnership (SPA)
Agreement on shared responsibilities and commitments to solidify participatory
implementation, monitoring, and reporting on the SDP. The signatories to the SPA are the
National Assembly, the Union of Local Self-governing Bodies, political parties, professional
and labor unions, foundations, the Armenian Apostolic Church, business federations, and the
Government. The Ministry of Economy has been tasked with SDP implementation. The
signed SPA stipulates development of new legislation that will request that SDP-related
projects be implemented in partnership with civil society.

           IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINKAGES TO CPS
47.    The Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is anchored on the two
strategic objectives of addressing vulnerability and strengthening competitiveness for
post-crisis growth. The strategy is strongly supported by the client, which has been actively
engaged and which values the World Bank Group as a valued development partner for
addressing its complex development needs. Recognizing that the country's development
strategy and the Bank's support to it are challenged by the uncertainties around the depth and


                                               16

duration of the global economic crisis, and the international policy response, it will be
essential to maintain flexibility in the design, timing, and sequencing of interventions.

48.     The proposed DPO series is a central instrument of the CPS to undergird the
policy dialogue. The DPO program is designed to be selective in supporting CPS outcomes in
order to keep the DPO focused on high priorities. Table 5 maps the DPO prior action and
trigger areas against the CPS results areas and outcomes. The CPS indicates that development
policy lending will remain the core policy-based instrument in support of the SDP. While the
overall share of DPOs will likely be nearly 20 percent of new lending, their cross-sectoral
content gives them higher leverage.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
49.    Armenia has an active on-going relationship with the IMF, from which it has had
strong support from Poverty Reduction and Growth Facilities (PRGFs) (see Box 1).
DPO preparation has been closely coordinated with the Fund, including both active
consultations between the Bank and Fund teams and parallel missions in February and April
2009. Coordination has focused in particular on issues concerning the macroeconomic stance,
in particular the scope of the required fiscal adjustment, financial sector policies, poverty
impacts of the crisis, and PFM reform, including tax administration. The Fund program also
draws on the DPO with respect to measures to improve targeting of social safety nets.

50.    The IFC will collaborate closely with IDA/IBRD in many of the areas which are
included in the DPO series. Based in part on the Doing Business report, the IFC and World
Bank teams are jointly developing targets related to the business climate. The regulatory
reforms in mining being supported by the DPO program as well as improvements in
governance in the health sector would be necessary for IFC support to be effective. Similarly,
the energy efficiency strategy being developed will provide the framework for possible IFC
investments.

51.    The ADB is scaling up with Armenia in its third year of membership. The Bank is
engaged in broadening collaboration with the ADB on the DPO to strengthen governance in
key public agencies (tax administration, business registry, PFM), and to advance public-
private partnerships aimed at improving the efficiency of investments in infrastructure. In
response to the crisis, the ADB is making available a first budget support operation of US
$70-$80 million, with Board presentation scheduled for June 2009, and a policy matrix that
draws on the Fund SBA and the Bank DPO.

52.    The EC is gradually expanding its presence in Armenia, as the country moves
ahead with the implementation ENP Action Plan. Consultations have been initiated for the
possible establishment of a Free Trade Agreement, implying an even closer alignment with
the body of regulations on the EU single market. Bank-EC collaboration is underway on
customs reform, with the possibility of TA funds (TAEX and twinning arrangements) being
programmed to support DPO-supported reforms in customs administration.

53.    Over the past seven years GTZ has been very active in providing support for the
PRSP processes in Armenia. Through the PRSP Secretariat, it supported the participatory
implementation and monitoring of the first PRSP and assisted in preparation of the SDP.
Support for the Social Partnership Network for the participatory implementation and
monitoring of the SDP will provide a valuable input to monitor DPO deliverables. In addition,
GTZ has committed to a modest amount of support for program budgeting reforms under the
leadership of the MOF, which is another area of on-going Bank-GTZ dialogue.

54.    The US will remain an important development partner of Armenia. USAID's
current project in tax administration is supporting reforms that are complementary to those
supported by the DPO. The Bank and USAID have been collaborating in this area to ensure a
coherent approach on the donor side.




                                             19

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
55.     DPO-supported activities will also facilitate implementation of the CPS by
supporting the Bank's other instruments. Reforms in the business climate, such as
reducing business registration and inspection costs, will support the FY09 Access to Finance
for Small and Medium Enterprises (AFSME) project. The DPO supported package for the
health sector will improve sector management and financing, including with regard to
copayment and unofficial out-of-pocket payments reform, which will promote higher benefits
for the FY07 Health APL II. There are also synergies in education on preschool and tertiary
sector reforms, including on the pilot needs-based student loan scheme, which will support the
proposed FY09 Education APL II. DPO-supported policies in energy efficiency are building
on recommendations stemming from the FY06 Renewable Energy project. The reforms in
telecommunications are laying the regulatory ground for realization of the Government's
vision of an "E-Armenia," which will be supported by the proposed FY10 E-Armenia Project.
Civil service and public financial management reforms, supported at the policy level by the
DPO series, are expected to be supported by institutional development funded by the
proposed FY10 Public Sector Modernization II Project and the FY11 PFM Project.

LESSONS LEARNED
56.     Between 2004 and 2007, the Armenian Government, with the assistance of the
World Bank, designed a series of four annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) to support reforms specifically directed at fighting poverty. Key lessons learned
from the previous experience include (based in part on the PRSC Series ICR):

        a)  Policy-based lending needs to be anchored in the Government's SDP to
            ensure ownership: The fact that the PRSCs were deeply rooted in the
            Government's poverty reduction strategy--that was itself prepared with wide
            societal consultation and participation--contributed to the success of reforms.
            While the PRSC series had broad policy coverage, the current crisis suggests a
            somewhat narrower coverage for the DPO series. At the same time, the PRSC
            experience suggests that where ownership of a particular reform measure is weak,
            it should not be included as a trigger. Even keeping issues with weak ownership
            on the agenda could prove contentious and unproductive, especially in a situation
            where the amount of the DPO series is small relative to the fiscal position.

        b) Given the crisis, policy-based lending should retain flexibility going forward:
            The PRSC series adopted a flexible approach to include new measures that
            emerged as priorities as new analytical work was completed. The DPO series
            should also use a flexible approach and, in fact, in the crisis context flexibility
            ought to be regarded as necessary condition for success.

        c)  The DPO program should reinforce intra-governmental coordination: The
            policy reforms supported by the PRSCs were the basis around which ministries
            and partners conducted policy discussions and developed a common
            understanding of how each could best help. While this was not always
            straightforward, the series helped further cooperation and thus increased the
            Government's capacity to implement reforms. The new DPO series should
            similarly reinforce the need for intra-governmental coordination through series
            design and processing.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
57.     The design of the DPO program is based on solid and wide-ranging economic and
sector work produced by the Bank and the Government. Specifically, the DPO program
has capitalized on the growth and public expenditure reviews prepared during 2006-2009. Of
particular importance have been three core sets of reports: (a) the poverty and social
assessments (the the Social Snapshot and Poverty in Armenia reports of 2006-2008, and
poverty maps); (b) the economic report, Armenia ­ the Caucasian Tiger (World Bank, 2007),
which focused on reforms achieved as well as the unfinished agenda in terms of the
constraints to growth and international integration, the business environment, financial sector
deepening, and the prospects for building the knowledge economy; and (c) the series of
Programmatic PERs conducted between 2005 and 2008, which focused on public expenditure
management, infrastructure investments, energy efficiency, the efficiency of health
expenditures, and social protection programs.

58.     Specific sectoral reports and client-driven policy reports were also produced
across a number of areas over 2007-2008. These include reports on taxes and subsidies in
energy; corporate governance reform; competition policy and conflict of interest; customs, tax
policy, and tax administration reforms; policy analysis capacity; public expenditure
management; and education sector reforms. These reports were packaged into a policy
advisory report, Armenia: Choices in Development Policy, 2008-2012 (May 2008), and
provided to the new Government as the suggested basis for the policy dialogue. The Choices
report also informed the Government's preparation of its SDP, and is also the analytical
backbone of the DPO series. Based on the findings of the social snapshots and the PPER
report on social protection, the DPO addresses the need for improving the targeting
mechanism of social protection measures and revising budget allocations for poor to mitigate
crisis implications for the most vulnerable. Analytical work on energy efficiency and the
economic costs of environmental degradation were completed in 2008 and contributed to
DPO prior actions and triggers on energy efficiency and environmental impact analysis. The
measures proposed on corporate governance and competition derive from the Choices report,
while measures on improving the business climate derive from technical assistance provided
by the Doing Business team, as well as from annual BEEPS surveys.

59.     The Government's self-assessment of its fiscal institutions and their performance,
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report of October 2008,
led to a Government decision to produce a comprehensive and integrated strategy on
future development of PFM reforms, which is fully supported by the DPO program. The
FY09 CPAR will also feed into the PFM Reform Strategy under preparation, as will the
inputs of various IDFs under implementation in financial management (accounting, NCOs,
and information systems). The recommended measures on conflict of interest were developed
in the Choices report, while the customs and tax administration reform recommendations
derive from the Choices report as well as the Bank's continuous engagement in these areas
over the past several years.

60.     The new CPS will support a rigorous new program of analytic and advisory
services to buttress the DPO series in the outer years. ESW is planned in the following
areas: post-crisis growth strategy, trade expansion strategy, financial sector monitoring, fiscal
space and expenditure policy, natural disaster risk, climate change, higher education reforms,
fiscal regime in mining, and allocation of radio frequency spectrum, among others.

                        V.     THE PROPOSED ARMENIA DPO-1

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
61.     The proposed DPO series has two policy objectives: (a) addressing vulnerability
by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital development; and (b)
improving competitiveness by alleviating private sector and governance constraints.
Under the two broad objectives of the DPO, which are based on the CPS pillars, there are six
sub-objectives at the sectoral level. The DPO series is designed to strike the appropriate
balance between crisis management and structural reform, with the first two years of the
series heavily weighted toward crisis management. At the same time, the Government is fully
committed to advancing the structural reform agenda in order to position Armenia for post-
crisis growth. There are thus several program priority areas that would mitigate the crisis
while laying a foundation for longer term growth. The program would thus remain valid
regardless of the evolution of the crisis. The coverage of the DPO series also reflects the
importance Government places on both a comprehensive reform agenda and on using
development policy lending to drive change. Moreover, line ministries themselves value the
instrument as a tool to advance their sectoral reforms, especially those that are cross-cutting in
nature and require cabinet-level support. The measures supported in the three-year series are
realistic given current central and line ministry capacities, as in some cases measures have
been delayed (compared to the SDP timetable) in order to allow for greater preparation time
and/or fiscal space as a result of the crisis impact. In short, the DPO series is designed to
strike the right balance between the Bank's comparative advantages in providing budget
support to mitigate the crisis and providing policy advice to undergird structural reform over
the medium to long term.

62.     The DPO series builds on the PRSC series (2004-2007). The four PRSC credits
focused on four themes: strengthening governance, including PFM; sharpening competition
and entrenching property rights; mitigating social and environmental risks; and modernizing
the rural economy. In most areas, the DPO series continues support to PRSC policy areas,
building on the accomplishments made in previous years. The DPO series does not propose to
continue supporting several areas (railways, agriculture and irrigation, forestry, insurance),
either because more appropriate instruments are being used to support those reforms or
because much has already been achieved.

                                   Box 3: Prior Actions for DPO-1

                                  Measures to Address Vulnerability

1. Increase funding for social safety net programs, including Family Benefits (FB) and pensions in
    the 2009 budget law (relative to 2008), increase funding for unemployment insurance (based on
    actual numbers of unemployed), and protect from any reductions
2. Restore funding for selected priority programs for the poor and vulnerable in health, education,
    and agriculture in accordance with the original 2009 budget
3. Undertake a review of FB program beneficiaries and exclude non-eligible households to improve
    targeting efficiency, and use FB budget savings to expand program coverage of the poor

                                  Measures to Strengthen Competitiveness

4. Strengthen banking sector surveillance and liquidity by undertaking frequent banking system
    stress tests and introducing enhanced reporting requirements, and making available liquidity to
    banks on a temporary basis through accepting a wider range of collateral
5. Reduce costs of business registration by removing: minimum capital requirement, seal
    requirement, and charter approval
6. Adopt an action plan with a timeline and key performance indicators for priority State Revenue
    Committee reforms, and commit to adequate funding from 2009-2011
7. Prepare and publish official PEFA assessment to serve as a baseline for future reforms
8. Submit to the National Assembly the Law on the Public Service, including conflict of interest
    provisions necessary to ensure the framework for further implementation


63.     DPO-1 proposes eight prior actions in addition to the prerequisite of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework (Box 3). The first three measures directly support
crisis mitigation in 2009, while the fourth measure supports crisis management in 2009. The
other four measures support structural reform. However, all four structural measures are
supportive of crisis management in that they set the stage for post-crisis growth by further
deepening Armenia's reforms in private sector development and public sector modernization.
The measures also take good practice lessons into account (Box 4).

64.     Over the CPS period, the proposed series of three development policy operations
will provide an anchor for policy and institutional reforms that cut across both pillars.
The first operation being presented to the Board in July 2009 would provide fiscal and
balance of payments support of about $60 million. The subsequent two operations are
expected to be presented on approximately an annual basis.

                         Box 4: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

This operation is based both on the Government's crisis response package and the Sustainable
Development Program (SDP) developed in 2008. The SDP was prepared with wide consultation,
including parliamentary involvement. The track record in the previous PRSC series (2004-2007) is one
of strong ownership and adherence to the PRSP ­ the medium term expenditure framework and the
annual budget have been derived from PRSP objectives and guidelines. The policy choices are
determined by the authorities, with inputs from public and civic institutions. Analytic work supported
by the Bank feeds into policy analysis and debate (notably economic reports, poverty assessments,
tailored studies on governance, infrastructure reforms and sector reforms, as well as comments on the
annual MTEF, annual budgets and the SDP itself).

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

The policy matrix is the central accountability tool in conjunction with the Letter of Development
Policy. The environment is results oriented and progress is tracked using agreed monitoring indicators.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

Bilateral aid is provided for investment projects. Through dialogue with the government and with
donors, such aid is designed to be complementary and best fit country needs. TA from bilaterals and
other IFIs is also well coordinated. Policies reflect government ownership in sensitive areas such as
governance as detailed in presidential speeches and government statements.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

All triggers in programmatic development policy lending take the form of agreed prior actions to
reflect SDP priorities and the Bank's CPS objectives. The DPO-1 is limited to eight prior actions and
the proposed DPO-2 and DPO-3 to ten triggers each.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support

Reviews focus on actions and on their contribution to results within the accountability matrix and the
draft CPS-supported results framework. Performance reviews will be quarterly, support will be
provided within the annual budget cycle and built into the budget financing estimate, and Bank
support volumes are made known well in advance.

OPERATION POLICY AREAS
  I.    ADDRESS VULNERABILITY BY PROTECTING THE POOR AND
        SUPPORTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
    A. Strengthen the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social Safety Nets and Protect
        Sectoral Programs for the Poor and Vulnerable

Prior Action 1: Increase funding for social safety net programs, including Family Benefits (FB)
and pensions in the 2009 budget law (relative to 2008), increase funding for unemployment
insurance based on the actual number of unemployed, and protect from any reductions.

65.     Notwithstanding significant reduction during the last decade, poverty reduction
will continue to be one of the most important goals for Armenia in the medium term.
The poor and vulnerable rely heavily on government transfer programs. Public transfers
account for 60 percent of the income of the extreme poor either in the form of pensions or
Family Benefit (FB) program.

66.     Despite the anticipated reductions in total budget expenditures, the Government
has fully protected budget allocations for the Family Benefit program, the funding for
which was increased by 10 percent in 2009. Social protection was the only broad category
of spending that did not suffer any reductions, the result of which was to increase its share of
the budget from 27.9 to 29.0 percent. The Government has also increased funding by 17
percent for pension programs in 2009, which are received by about 20 percent of the
population and are one of the most important income sources for the poor. The Government is
also providing greater funding for the unemployment insurance program, given the increased
number of applicants in 2009.

Prior Action 2: Restore funding for selected priority programs for the poor and vulnerable in
health, education, and agriculture in accordance with the original 2009 budget.

67.     Furthermore, the Government has also restored spending for high priority
programs targeting the poor and vulnerable in health, education, and agriculture by
means of a decree approved on May 14, 2009. The restored funding in the amount of AMD
1.6 billion finances: hospital services for vulnerable groups, tuberculosis, maternal child
health, treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, treatment for the mentally ill, universal 12th
grade access and corresponding high school equipment, and extension services for farmers.
The benefit incidence of these programs for poor and vulnerable groups is moderately high to
high, depending on the program.

68.     To create the fiscal space for immediate poverty mitigation expenditures and
prevent possible deterioration of access to healthcare and education services by the
vulnerable, non-priority spending across the rest of the public sector, including defense,
has undergone sizeable cuts. Further deterioration in revenue could mean another round of
budget reductions in non-priority programs. For DPO-2 and DPO-3 the Government will
continue protecting social safety nets and priority sectoral spending programs for the poor and
vulnerable by increasing their shares in the 2010 and 2011 budgets (as compared to 2009).




                                               25

Prior Action 3: Undertake a review of FB beneficiaries and exclude non-eligible households to
improve targeting efficiency, and use FB budget savings to expand coverage of the poor.

69.     While the Family Benefit is fairly well targeted at household level, additional
resources for the program would need to be combined with further improvements in
targeting. Based on the ILCS data, the FB's targeting accuracy worsened in 2007, compared
to 2006. In 2007, about 6 percent of the program's spending went to families in the top
quintile, compared to only about 3 percent in 2006. About 49 percent of the FB benefits went
to families in the poorest quintile in 2007, compared to over 57 percent in 2006. The leakage
of FB resources to non-poor families is estimated at 47 percent of the program resources in
2007, compared to about 40 percent in 2006. The Government has taken some measures to
reduce leakage in the FB program to the non-poor by revising the eligibility criteria and better
integrating existing household registry data with personal income data from various sources
(December 4, 2008 decree). In addition, Decree # 39-N (January 15, 2009) requires the audit
of FB program beneficiaries by authorizing home visits to recipient families. These
administrative improvements allowed the ministry to identify 9,428 non-eligible families,
which were then excluded from the program. This has already resulted in savings, which are
being reallocated to poor families. The Government also issued a decree (May 2009) to
strengthen the supervision of the paid public works program by enhancing resources for
program monitoring and providing a formula for allocating funds to marzes based on socio-
economic and fiscal need.

70.     The DPO series supports increased and protected funding for social safety net
(SSN) programs over 2009-2011, while also improving their efficiency. In particular, the
series supports Government's efforts to increase targeting efficiency in the FB program by
effecting significant reductions in leakage of resources to the non-poor. Triggers for 2010-
2011 will continue improving targeting and also strengthening monitoring and management of
SSN programs, including: (a) strengthening management and monitoring of social safety net
programs to improve targeting efficiency and increase public awareness in DPO-2; and (b)
completing development of the social protection management information system, and
physical and/or virtual transformation of social protection offices into integrated centers for
DPO-3.

    B. Strengthen the Management of the Education Sector
71.     The Government has boosted investment in education over the past ten years, in
particular, general secondary education, but tertiary and preschool education received
less attention.7 Access to education and quality assurance remain a challenge. In general
secondary education the Government has aimed to reduce poverty by increasing access,
improving quality, and boosting public spending. Tertiary education, on the other hand, has
seen a dramatic decline in public funding, and the lack of needs-based financing schemes
limits access among the poor. Governance and quality assurance are still weak, thus failing to
tackle what appears to be pervasive corruption. These constraints call for fundamental
financing reform and a strong quality assurance system geared, on one hand, toward


7The FY09 Education Quality and Relevance Project II includes a component on tertiary and preschool
education.

                                                   26

increasing equitable access and, on the other. In response the Government will adopt an
overall tertiary education financing strategy for DPO-3. Development of a strong quality
assurance (QA) system and a governance strategy for tertiary education are critical for
modernizing the sector. Strengthening the capacity of the Armenian National Quality
Assurance Agency (ANQA) to establish a national quality assurance system is a critical
measure. For DPO-3 the Government will develop an education quality assurance policy with
standards, criteria, procedures and guidelines through consultation with stakeholders,
institutions, and employers.

72.     At the same time development of a state-backed student loan scheme is critical
for ensuring expanded access for the poor. Tuition fees in public universities amount to 30-
40 percent of per capita income, as compared to, for instance, 11 percent in the US or Japan.
Poor households cannot afford tuition fees for fee-paying places in state or private
universities, and merit-based full-scholarships are extremely limited. Developing a state-
backed student loan scheme will provide a tool for the poor to access tertiary education. In
response the Government will pilot a needs-based student loan scheme in AY2010 for DPO-2
and expand it for DPO-3.

73.     Expansion of access to preschool education is critical for enhancing pro-poor
outcomes in the sector. There are about 450 communities where there are no preschool
services available at all. In addition, the enrolment rate in these institutions fell from 60
percent in 1993 to about 28 percent in recent years (and only 9 percent in rural areas). Despite
their legal responsibility, most local communities will have difficulty financing the increase of
enrollment rates up to 90 percent by 2015. Without further progress, access to preschool
education will continue to be constrained and unequal, and the school readiness of Armenian
children will continue to suffer. There is an urgent need to develop a viable model of
preschool education delivery and funding to expand and develop preschool services in all
marzes to meet the national goal to achieve 90 percent preschool enrollment by 2015. Thus,
for DPO-2 the Government will revise the legislative framework for preschool education and
create a viable financing mechanism that assures adequate funding.

74.     Establishment of a Competitive Innovation Fund (CIF) for tertiary education is
an important multi-sectoral ingredient on the Government's competitiveness and "e-
Armenia" agenda. International evidence shows that a competitive innovation fund (CIF) is
a most effective financing scheme to set the right incentives and regulations for higher
education institutions to improve their quality and relevance while at the same time becoming
more accountable for their performance. The CIF will provide block grants directly to higher
education institutions--both public and private--on a competitive basis. It will enable them to
design, develop and implement innovative plans for modernizing their study offerings and
pedagogical methods, build their fund-raising capacity, create linkages and partnerships with
industry, and engage in international cooperation activities. For DPO-2 the Government will
establish implementation arrangements and funding sources for a competitive innovation fund
scheme for universities. Toward this end, the Prime Minister's Decree # 425-A of May 25,
2009 approved the composition of an inter-ministerial working group consisting of
representatives of the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Education and Science to
conduct a CIF feasibility study submit findings within one month.




                                              27

    C. Strengthen the Management of the Health Sector
75.     Armenia has made significant progress in health reform over the past ten years.
The delivery of primary health care services has undergone major improvements. In addition,
the process of hospital sector rationalization was launched in 2004, starting in Yerevan and
now extending to the marzes. However, a substantial unfinished agenda remains, beginning
with the health financing system. Out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on health continues to
account for about 60 percent of total health expenditures, much higher than among its regional
comparators (Table 6). To a large extent this is a reflection of the low level of government
health spending as a share of GDP, as providers seek payment from patients in order to make
up for inadequate levels of funding from the budget. A significant proportion of OOP
spending is thus unofficial, and as such it represents a shortcoming of governance and
accountability in the sector. A lack of financial protection due to OOP payments increases the
incidence of impoverishing and catastrophic health expenditures faced by households.

       Table 6: Armenia and Region: Health Financing Indicators, Latest Available Year
                                           Armenia              CIS               EU-12             EU-15
                                                                               (E. Europe)       (W. Europe)

              (% of GDP)
       Source: WHO Health for All, except: * = Armenia National Health Accounts, 2005; and **=2007 estimate.

76.     There has been recent progress in addressing the challenge of high OOP. Budget
allocations to health since 2005 have risen faster than GDP even at a time of strong economic
growth, and thus public spending on health has edged up from 1.4% to 1.6% of GDP, though
in Armenia public spending on health is still low in comparative perspective. Also, in order to
confront the problem of informal payments for child delivery, the Government launched a
voucher program in July 2008 that enables women to receive free service, while also sharply
raising reimbursement levels to providers. Early evidence suggests this has been successful in
addressing informal OOP. Reimbursing providers at a level more closely aligned to actual
costs (currently the rate is about 50 percent, but with wide variation depending on service)
would reduce the tendency of hospitals and doctors to demand under-the-table payments from
patients. In addition, the Government is preparing a strategy to introduce official copayments,
which would help ensure that the component of OOP that cannot be offset through higher
reimbursement prices (because the gap is too large to be closed only through the state budget
over the medium-term) would be made official and transparent. Measures to ensure that the
copayment policy protects the poor and vulnerable are under active consideration. In response
in DPO-2 the Government will adopt a comprehensive strategy to introduce copayments and
increase hospital service reimbursement, to lower out-of-pocket spending. For DPO-3 the
Government will initiate implementation of a comprehensive policy for copayments,
including appropriate waivers for the poor, and hospital service reimbursement.

77.     While organizational reforms to the primary care and hospital sectors offer the
potential of improved health outcomes, these efforts can be bolstered by confronting the
key emerging priority of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These account for over 90%
of mortality in Armenia, and international evidence shows that cost-effective interventions for
primary and secondary prevention are readily available and can often be implemented at the
                                                       28

primary level. While the Government undertook initial steps to develop a strategy through the
PRSC operations, further progress is required in order to identify specific interventions to be
scaled up, associated budget requirements, and targeted outcomes. With regard to NCDs, the
Government is adopting measures to strengthen delivery of interventions, especially at the
primary care level. A draft strategy is under preparation, and a decree will be submitted in
November 2009 for DPO-2. At the same time, the Government is developing a plan to
introduce performance-based contracting (PBC) at the primary care level. This will
supplement the current capitation approach to paying for primary care with a PBC system,
including services related to NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol management).
This initiative will be piloted in 2010 for DPO-2 and rolled out further in 2011 for DPO-3.

 II.    STRENGTHEN COMPETITIVENESS FOR POST-CRISIS GROWTH
        A. Fortify the Financial Sector, Strengthen Economic Competition, and Improve
            Regulatory Environment
78.     Improving Armenia's international competitiveness, as well as deepening
domestic competition, are crucial objectives in a context where strong medium term
growth is at risk given the global crisis. Removing impediments to competition is a key
challenge. Competition is hobbled by weaknesses in laws, such as the competition law, as
well as the existence of some monopolies in sectors relating to trade and distribution.
Furthermore, Armenia's international competitiveness ratings are very low: 93rd out of 131 in
the Global Competitiveness Report (2007-2008) and 108th out of 127 in the Business
Competitiveness Index ("National Competitiveness Report 2008," Economy and Values
Research Center). In order to lay stronger foundations for post-crisis growth, the Government
has identified key actions and triggers in corporate governance, economic competition,
business registration and inspections, and public-private partnerships. These measures are
supported by technical assistance provided by IFC, FIAS, and the Bank.

Fortified Financial Sector

Prior Action 4: Strengthen banking sector surveillance and liquidity by undertaking frequent
banking system stress tests and introducing enhanced reporting requirements, and making
available liquidity to banks on a temporary basis through accepting a wider range of collateral.

79.     The Government has also committed to strengthening financial stability and has
already taken action to ensure this important objective. Liquidity will be bolstered by the
addition of reserves from the IMF SBA, which could be used to address shifts in currency
preferences in the banking system. The CBA has also strengthened banking sector
surveillance and liquidity by undertaking monthly banking system stress tests and introducing
enhanced reporting requirements on a daily basis (e.g. closed balance sheet, deposit structure,
structure of high liquid assets, etc.), and making available liquidity to banks on a temporary
basis through accepting a wider range of collateral. Further, to address possible liquidity
needs, the CBA has committed to providing, if necessary, long term funding or equity to
banks. Bank supervision will also be enhanced and prudential norms raised on foreign
exchange exposure.




                                              29

80.     In view of the global financial crisis and sharp slowdown of the Armenian
economy, there is a strong need for close monitoring of the financial sector. The impact of
the crisis on the banking system will continue evolving; the CBA is committed to closely
monitor developments and to take pro-active measures where needed. Updated information on
banks' solvency, liquidity, non-performing loans, and external borrowings will be analyzed
regularly. The CBA is expected to undertake a comprehensive, independent diagnostic of
banking sector vulnerabilities in 2010 for DPO-2, followed by a comprehensive FSAP update
in 2011 for DPO-3, both of which will provide specific recommendations for implementation.

More Competitive Business Environment with Stronger Corporate Governance
Prior Action 5: Reduce costs of business registration by removing minimum capital, seal, and
charter approval requirements.

81.     Armenia has already made progress on business registration and related
procedures. For DPO-1 the minimum information required for registration was specified
formally; the requirement for approval of a charter at registration was removed (a standard
charter document has been developed, but firms are not required to use it); the minimum
capital requirement was removed (capital must be greater than zero); and permission from the
police is no longer required to obtain a seal. This is an area where the Government has
undertaken to make further progress: for DPO-2 the Government will adopt a decree to
establish and implement a One Stop Shop for business registration. A related priority reform
area concerns the inspections regime, which imposes inordinately high financial and
transaction costs on firms. Inspections are not focused on the key risks (and are often not
transparent), while inspectors' discretion is excessive. In the context of the DPO and in
response to the crisis, the Government has recommitted to a clear and binding action plan for
the coming years and to enforce all provisions of the previous reform measures. For DPO-3
the Government will adopt a decree with an action plan to reformulate the inspections regime
by making it more risk-focused and transparent (including measures to address all relevant
issues around procedures and policies for obtaining construction permits).

82.     Ensuring equal conditions for economic competition requires stronger political
will as well as legal and regulatory measures. These include strengthening the Law on
Competition and reinforcing the capacity of the State Commission for the Protection of
Economic Competition (SCPEC). Competition law is a recent innovation in Armenia: the
SCPEC commenced prosecuting cases in 2001. However, the SCPEC has not been effective
in carrying out its mandate, due to weaknesses both in the legal framework and in the capacity
of the SCPEC itself. Many problems have been identified in the legal framework, including:
ambiguities and conflicts among existing laws; lack of mandatory firm information
submission requirements; lack of procedures for dealing with anti-competitive practices by
local self-governance bodies; weak authority to conduct audits; and inappropriate fine levels.
On the institutional side the SCPEC needs to gain greater autonomy (including financial
independence), develop the professional expertise of its staff, and increase its capacity to
engage and support the judiciary in expert assessments. The Government is committed for
DPO-2 to strengthen the autonomy and enforcement capacity of the SCPEC and submit
revisions to competition-related legislation to National Assembly to effect harmonization with
international best practice.


                                               30

83.      The main shortcomings in corporate governance relate to poor standards in
securities markets and corporate practices. Basic shareholder rights are provided for by
law, but weak in practice. There are no requirements for public disclosure of ultimate
beneficial owners. Company boards often lack independence from controlling owners and
from management. There are no rules on full director independence. A major weakness in the
legal and regulatory framework is the absence of a clear definition of the duties of the board
of directors, the executive, the controller, and the AGM. The relative lack of transparency of
corporate dealings in Armenia is a strong disincentive for foreign investment. Currently,
Armenia ranks 88th on the Doing Business Protecting Investors indicator. Disclosure of
related-party transactions and liability of company directors in case of prejudicial related-
party transactions are inadequate. A key reform, which the Government is committed to for
DPO-3, will thus be an amended Joint Stock Company Law to: increase disclosure
requirements for companies; clarify duties and liability of members of company supervisory
and management bodies; improve minority shareholder protection; guard against potential
misuse of corporate assets for personal gain; and provide for public access to documents from
the company registry.

84.      The Government program also underscores the importance of developing public-
private partnership (PPP) vehicles to ensure delivery of high quality public services, as
well as develop and implement strategic national and local priorities. The regional
development agenda promotes investments through facilitation of PPPs, in part by building
capacity of local self-government bodies. Given the Government's goal of a higher
investment to GDP ratio, an increasing amount of the volume of capital investment is
expected be financed from private sources through PPPs. The Government is committed for
DPO-3 to submit a regulatory framework for PPPs to the National Assembly, and elements of
the approach will be addressed in the public investment appraisal system strategy, under
development for DPO-2. The institutional framework for PPPs should ensure: consistency
with the overall framework for public investment planning and a strong gatekeeper role for
the Ministry of Finance; clear rules for accounting that require that direct and contingent
liabilities of PPPs are adequately weighted in the budget process; rules for reporting that
include comprehensive disclosure in budget documentation and publication of PPP contracts;
and well defined procedures for dealing with unsolicited PPP proposals.

         B. Address Critical Infrastructure Needs and Improve Regulatory Environment
            in ICT
85.      The Government considers development of an innovative and competitive
knowledge-based society in the country among its highest priorities for the coming
decade. Given Armenia's limitations in trade in goods due to its geographic position and its
strength in human capital and high tech industries, such a strategy makes great sense, so as to
seize a portion of the global market of over $200 billion in trade of IT services. In order to
take advantage of this opportunity, the Government is conscious of the need to make dramatic
improvements to its telecommunications infrastructure. This will require implementing
policies aimed at strengthening the local IT and high-tech industries, while at the same time
promoting the delivery of electronic services to businesses and the population at large. All
these would constitute the pillars of the country's future e-society strategy, currently under
design. Further improvements to the telecom sector should generate significant economic
benefits, since good quality and affordable telecom services are essential both for promoting


                                               31

the global competitiveness of Armenia's economy and development beyond its main urban
centers.

86.     The telecommunications sector has undergone significant liberalization over the
past two years. After OTE sold majority stake in ArmenTel to Russian VimpelCom
(BeeLine), the Government renegotiated the license and reached an agreement with the new
owner on surrender of exclusive rights. A second cellular operator, Vivacell, was licensed in
2005 and by November 2007 all of ArmenTel's remaining exclusive rights were eliminated.
Additionally, in November 2008, the Government selected a third mobile operator (Orange)
through open international competition, which has already started the roll-out of the
infrastructure. The liberalization of the telecommunications market has led to a substantial
increase in the number of new entrants: the number of companies offering Internet
connection, data transmission, and VOIP services has almost tripled. The increased
competition resulted in lowering of service tariffs, in some services by more than 50%. In
parallel, the Government has been strengthening the sector's legal, regulatory and institutional
framework.

87.     Despite significant progress with liberalization of the telecom sector and adoption
of pro-competitive regulatory approach by the regulatory authority, the Public Services
Regulatory Commission (PSRC), there remain several important constraints on the
telecom sector. The current legal and institutional frameworks are sub-optimal for efficient
planning, allocation, and monitoring of radio spectrum. In particular, the existing legislation
does not explicitly provide for efficient cooperation and exchange of information between the
Ministry of Transport and Communication and the PSRC. Moreover, the existing legal and
institutional arrangements, as well as the technical capacity, for avoiding radio interferences
are inadequate. There are no clearly stipulated arrangements or mechanisms in place to
facilitate transitioning of economically valuable spectrum from inefficient public sector use to
private sector use. Incentives are also weak for efficient reallocation of spectrum.

88.     Sector liberalization fostered entry of new telecom service providers. With the
new entrants there is an urgent need to address the issues of interconnection regime, provision
of open access, infrastructure sharing, and local loop unbundling while ensuring that firms
have the best possible incentives to invest in infrastructure so as to ensure a non-
discriminatory and pro-competitive regulatory environment. An interconnection regime is
essential for the physical linking of telecom operators' networks with equipment or facilities
of other operators or their customers. Another important step to further liberalize the telecom
market is the local loop unbundling, which will allow new entrants without local networks to
access end-users by purchasing access from incumbents. These are essential for ensuring a
level playing field, which is also in the long term interest of consumers and the overall
economy given the likely decrease of telecom service tariffs and increase in the range and
quality of services.

89.     Through the DPO the Government is supporting two sets of measures to promote
ICT sector development, overcome the digital divide, and ensure the telecom sector
maximally contributes to overall economic development:

(a) Strengthen the legal and regulatory framework and institutional arrangements for
efficient spectrum monitoring and management. In particular, the Government will: (i)
develop a strategy and action plan for increasing the efficiency of spectrum use in DPO-2 by
                                               32

improving the overall legal, regulatory, and institutional framework as well as strengthening
technical capacity for spectrum management and monitoring, including clear delineation of
rights and responsibilities of involved government agencies, and better coordination of
activities; and (ii) update the National Frequency Allocation Table for DPO-3 to align with
best practices.

(b) Adopt regulations for universal service and regulations for enhanced competition in
the telecommunications sector, including open access, infrastructure sharing, and local
loop unbundling for DPO-3. This will include an analysis of the law on electronic
communications with a view to phasing out in the medium term unnecessary economic
regulation once the competitive environment is such that the overarching competition law
would largely suffice to regulate the sector. In the short term, however, it is important to adopt
interconnection, infrastructure sharing, open access and local loop unbundling regulations.
Universal service regulations are also required in the short term to promote the provision of
service to rural and underserved urban areas, where service is not deemed to be commercially
viable.

        C. Improve Competitiveness Through Sustainable Use of Energy and Natural
            Resources
Improved Mining Sector Regulatory and Fiscal Regime

90.     Current mining sector law and regulations are conflicting and overlapping, the
fiscal regime is onerous, and the regulatory and institutional set-up lacks transparency
and public accountability. This likely decreases the attractiveness of the industry for
investors, and results in foregone revenues. Moreover, the current mining code regulations
governing licensing of exploration and mineral exploitation activities are sub-optimal. The
regulations governing environmental issues are also being revised to ensure that appropriate
environmental risk assessment, management, and impact mitigation measures are
implemented.

91.     In order to tackle these problems and help revitalize the mining sector, the
Government is developing a new mining code, which provides the legal foundation for
an appropriate fiscal, environmental, social, and licensing regime. Given the importance
of the sector in Armenia, the Government is committed to moving as quickly as possible to
put in place the new code for DPO-2. The Government will then enact the necessary
regulations by DPO-3 to ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability in mining, and is
considering participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to
strengthen management in line with international best practice.

Stronger Environmental Impact Assessment

92.     Damages to the environment in Armenia have been and continue to be the source
of significant costs, estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP per annum, with atmospheric air
pollution accounting for the biggest share (2.4 percent).8 It should be noted that these
estimates do not cover all possible damages (costs of losses to forests, biodiversity, and
agriculture are not included). Most concerns about environmental management center on lax


8Armenia: Country Environmental Analysis, forthcoming.
                                                  33

enforcement of environmental impact assessment (EIA) legislation, including variable
application of EIA law, weak public participation, and improper assessment of economic and
environmental impacts of projects. This is a result of ineffective coordination across agencies
and deficient EIA legislation.

93.     Going forward the Government is committed to strengthening EIA legislation.
Introducing strategic environmental assessment and environmental impact valuation would
help enhance transparency. Improved EIA legislation would help enhance transparency and
accountability in policy decisions, and promote stakeholder participation in EIA at the
planning stage. The Government also sees the need to address damages caused by mining
activities by enforcing regulations more effectively. For DPO-2 the Government will submit a
new environmental impact assessment law based on international good practice to the
National Assembly, while for DPO-3 the Government will issue a report on implementation
of and compliance with the new EIA law.

94.     Government also recognizes the importance of improving monitoring of
atmospheric air quality in response to the high costs of environmental damage. Further
determining where the hot spots lie, and then setting regulations to control pollution
concentrations in these areas, would produce significant benefits. For DPO-3 the Government
will adopt improved standards for atmospheric air quality.

Promotion of Energy Efficiency

95.     A Bank-financed energy efficiency study suggests that around 97% of identified
technically feasible energy efficiency potential is economically and financially viable,
and savings could amount to 5 percent of GDP. Moreover, realization of energy efficiency
potential can have significant positive environmental impacts by reducing green-house gas
emissions through lower consumption of electricity and gas. The study identified institutional,
financial, regulatory, and informational barriers impeding investments in energy efficiency
both in the public and private sectors. In particular, there is no designated energy efficiency
entity to champion and streamline policy. There is also a lack of long term and affordable
financing to invest in energy efficiency projects. The current energy sector utility regulatory
framework does not facilitate energy efficiency on the part of energy utilities. Lastly, there is
a lack of awareness about the benefits of energy efficiency investments in public, private, and
residential sectors.

96.     In order to remove the obstacles for realization of energy efficiency potential, the
Government is committed to developing for DPO-2 a time-bound energy efficiency
action plan with efficiency targets, and designating a responsible entity with adequate
resources. Specific measures will address the following key issues: adjustment in energy
sector utilities' regulatory framework to rely on mechanisms (e.g., identification of
appropriate DSM measures, such as load curtailment programs and dynamic pricing
programs) to ensure that utilities and their customers make energy production, distribution,
and consumption decisions that increase the efficiency of energy utilization; designation and
empowerment of an energy efficiency entity, allocation of financial resources to sustain its
operation, and strengthening of its capacity; identification of other key legislative and
regulatory barriers; development of incentives and standards to promote import,
manufacturing, and use of energy efficient equipment (e.g., energy efficiency standards,
energy efficiency labeling); establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation
                                              34

mechanism, including baseline and target indicators, on energy efficiency in the public sector;
and setting of short-term and mid-term energy efficiency targets. For DPO-3 the Government
will implement priority actions identified in the energy efficiency action plan.

        D. Adopt Best International Management Standards to Improve Public Sector
            Efficiency and Effectiveness

97.     The quality of governance in Armenia remains a significant constraint to
economic growth and poverty reduction. Public administration and civil service reforms,
initiated back in 2001, delivered a professional civil service, which, however struggles from
the limitations imposed by relatively low salary levels. Lack of motivation, in the absence of
proper remuneration and performance management system, does not allow the public
administration system to recruit higher quality expertise. Implementation of the Government's
previous Anti-Corruption Strategy and 2003-2007 Action Plan resulted in formal legislative
change, without significant impact on actual practices.

Fortified Public Expenditure Management

98.     Armenia's challenge in public financial management (PFM) is to move beyond
fragmented initiatives to craft an integrated program. Strengthening the PFM system's
basic processes suggests deepening the budget's performance orientation while both
strengthening fiduciary accountability and revenue management. Deepening the budget's
performance orientation will entail strengthening the MTEF and planning processes and
further rolling out and consolidating the program budgeting reform. Strengthening fiduciary
accountability would entail focusing on reporting and monitoring (including for non-
commercial organizations), internal audit, external audit, and parliamentary oversight.
Enhancing revenue management will focus on improving taxpayer compliance by
strengthening taxpayer services and audit and enforcement capacities in tax and customs.
Many reforms are already underway in most of these areas, and the challenge is to continue
implementing while closely monitoring impact.

Prior Action 7: Prepare and publish official PEFA assessment to serve as a baseline for future
reforms.

99.     The Government's self-assessed PEFA Report (October 2008) serves as an
important baseline assessment against which to measures future progress. The PEFA
report was prepared by the MOF, in consultation with development partners, and represents
the Government--donor consensus on PFM strengths and weaknesses, and is published on
the MOF and PEFA websites. In DPO-2 the Government will submit to the Cabinet a
satisfactory PFM Reform Strategy (including CPAR recommendations). The PFM reform
strategy should incorporate the following elements: a high level strategic reform vision, a
detailed implementation plan for the next stage, coordination arrangements within MOF and
across to line ministries, agreement on performance measures, and an assessment of key
capacity building needs.

100.    Though the previous reform efforts have yielded highly satisfactory results in
many areas, the system is now at the stage where it is critical that the core functions
(macro/budget, control, and accounting/reporting) move together in parallel toward
agreed strategic objectives. After the launch of the PEFA Report, it was agreed that the next
                                               35

key step would be for the Government to produce a comprehensive, sequenced, and
coordinated PFM strategy in 2009-2010. Program budgeting reform is the backbone of the
PFM system and MOF should use the program budgeting reforms as an umbrella to ensure the
overall consistency of the PFM reform strategy. In DPO-3 the Government will fully
implement program budgeting (as legal basis for budget approval) and the public investment
appraisal system via amendments to the Law on the Budget System.

Strengthened Tax and Customs Administration

101.    Revenue administration reform has been a key priority of the Government, well
before the crisis, given Armenia's very low revenue to GDP ratio. The economic crisis
further underscores the importance of reinvigorated implementation of the new reform
program. Overall, however, tax administration reform has been slow compared to neighboring
Georgia or Azerbaijan. Tax evasion is high and voluntary compliance low, both because of
high compliance costs, weaknesses in audit, processing third party information, and detecting
tax fraud. Improvement in revenue performance should be accomplished by modernizing
processes that would encourage voluntary compliance as well as detect tax evasion.

Prior Action 6: Adopt an action plan with a timeline and key performance indicators for
priority State Revenue Committee reforms, and commit to adequate funding from 2009-2011.

102.    The SRC Tax Service reform program focuses on strengthening compliance by
improving audit and enforcement functions, strengthening taxpayer services via the
Large Taxpayer Office and a one stop shop for taxpayers, electronic filing, and
improved back office functions. Limited technical assistance is provided for some of the
activities through donor support. The Government has requested World Bank support for: (a)
business process reengineering, (b) the data processing center, (c) a data management system
for individualized pension records and third party information, and (d) a database for service
centers. More specifically, the SRC and the Bank have agreed on a 2009-2011 action plan to
focus on core areas of the reform program to complement other donors' assistance. In DPO-2
the Government will implement reengineered business processes and subsequent design,
software development, and piloting of tax data processing center to improve taxpayer services
and compliance. In DPO-3 the Government will make fully functional the SRC data
processing center, including a data management system.

103.    In the SRC Customs Service new impetus for reform has resulted in significant
changes and the preparation of a sound reform program. Recent efforts have addressed
the image of customs (introduction of a code of ethics, updated methods of communication),
procedures (cautious introduction of bank guarantees, gradual improvement of clearance
procedures, enhanced use of IT solutions to manage new functionalities such as transit) and
necessary legislative clarification (definition of customs control areas and warehouses,
strengthening of suspense regimes). However commendable these efforts, they are still too
fragmented to meet the challenges of a modern Customs administration. In addition, they do
not factor sufficiently the recent merger between the customs and tax administrations. The
recent approach to reform was bottom up: introduction of direct trade input to minimize
interaction between officials and importers; gradual reduction in the number of repetitive and
non-productive physical examinations; development of a post-release control capacity; and
new instruments (such as bank guarantees) which set the stage for some major steps forward
(such as a "green channel" release by default).

                                              36

104.    The SRC action plan agreed by the Government and the Bank under the DPO
proposes a set of actions that would lead to significant improvement. First, the use of
performance statistics will provide a systematic way of assessing the cost effectiveness of
procedures and resources. Second, the combination of examination statistics, recorded rates of
detection of irregularities, and level of reassessed duties should give an indication of: (i) the
optimal level at which examination rates ought to be pegged, and (ii) the marginal cost of
enforcement. The DPO-supported program proposes the following actions for the coming two
years: in DPO-2 the introduction of a "green channel by default" approach to clearance,
including an overhaul of the clearance and examination policy (consisting in combining
document processing and possible goods examination in the Customs house, computerizing
warehouse operations and the links between warehouses and Customs houses, developing
documentary checks after release, computerizing the entire clearance process, and upgrading
the physical examination process); and in DPO-3 reinforcing the preventive and enforcement
wing to fight smuggling at the borders (including the border line between approved border
crossing points) and inside national territory, support investigations, gather and process
intelligence, and contribute to the agency's enforcement activities related to cross-border and
other international commercial activities. All these reform measures have been adopted by the
Government in an action plan with a timeline and key performance indicators for priority
State Revenue Committee reforms, with budget commitment for adequate funding from 2009-
2011, and a costing to be done by December, according to the Prime Minister's May 27, 2009
decree.

Civil Service Reform and Conflict of Interest Management

105.    The actions planned under the DPO will help to ensure sustainable policy for
Armenia's progress toward efficient and transparent public administration. The
measures draw on the recommendations of technical assistance on civil service performance
appraisal provided under the Public Sector Modernization Project, as well as the policy note
on the conflict of interest presented to the Choices report.

106.    The Government is commencing introduction of a performance management
system. To execute the performance appraisal of staff more objectively and with lower
transaction costs, the Government is adding a module to the Electronic Document
Management System. Once the performance appraisal system is introduced, the Government
intends to link staff performance with remuneration to provide greater motivation. Together
with a stronger focus on ethical aspects of public service, including provision of envisaged
administrative sanctions for violations, improved motivation of staff will enable improvement
of efficiency in public administration. Under DPO-1 the Government will adopt regulations
on performance-based remuneration in the civil service, while in DPO-3 the Government will
pilot the performance-based remuneration system in selected ministries.

Prior Action 8: Submit to the National Assembly the Law on the Public Service, including
conflict of interest provisions necessary to ensure the framework for further implementation.

107.    The draft new anti-corruption strategy strongly emphasizes conflict of interest
management and rules of conduct for public officials. The Government is committed to
establishing a system of ethical norms within the public sector, including conflict of interest
and disclosure mechanisms. The Government's vision is for the governing legislation to cover
all public servants and officials, including at the highest levels. Current regulation of conflict
                                                 37

of interest in the Armenian public service is highly fragmented. The Law on Civil Service has
provisions limiting the activities of civil servants outside the civil service including, inter alia,
their obligations in circumstances where their official position may influence private matters.
Similarly, the Constitution has explicit statements that govern the outside activities of
Members of Parliament. Other public service bodies including the SRC, Public Service in the
National Assembly, etc. have their own rules and procedures.

108.    Armenia's earlier implementation of asset disclosures, an important element of
conflict of interest regulation, had begun in earnest, but has become ineffective. Though
the decree is still in force and the Government is experimenting with introducing declarations
for regular citizens, none of the earlier phases was effectively and completely implemented.
The legislative framework was advanced on July 21, 2001, with the "Law Income and Asset
Declaration by Managerial Employees of RA Bodies of State Power", but implementation
was never satisfactory and the law expired at end-2008. After the first couple of attempts to
publish the declarations in the Official Gazette the practice was discontinued. The setback
behind the general progress is that, as of the moment, there is no longer a requirement for
mandatory publication of the information.

109.    The Government has identified the need to improve the legislation on conflict of
interest management, disclosure mechanisms, and increasing transparency. In May 2009
the Government introduced legislation to strengthen the conflict of interest provisions. The
Government views the establishment of a permanently functioning body dealing with issues
of ethics and conflict of interest as a key feature of the reform.

110.    The main objectives of the new conflict of interest regulations are to: (i) define in
concrete terms what constitutes the private interests of public officials; (ii) establish
mechanisms for the disclosure of those private interests (disclosure of income and assets); (iii)
set clear guidelines ex ante as to which forms of private interests are incompatible with
decision-making in the public interest and to establish procedures for excluding such private
interests from the decision-making process; (iv) define ex post procedures and sanctions for
resolving accusations of conflict of interest; and (v) establish an office responsible for
monitoring implementation of the legislation.

111.    In order to implement stronger conflict of interest provisions, the Government
has submitted to the National Assembly the Law on the Public Service as a prior action
for DPO-1. In DPO-2 the Government will approve the necessary regulations for
implementation of conflict of interest provisions, including those relating to declarations of
income and assets, in the new Public Service Law. In DPO-3 the Government will publish a
progress report on implementation of the Public Service Law.

                          VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
112.    The policies and the programs supported by the DPO series are expected to have
direct and indirect positive poverty impacts on the poor and vulnerable. In the short term,
the DPO series aims to provide support to the Government to withstand the social impacts of
the current global economic crisis, while over the medium term deepening implementation of
its economic and social reform agenda in order to remove key binding constraints to more
rapid and diversified growth in the post-crisis period.
                                                38

113.    Thus, one of the overarching policy objectives of the proposed DPO is to directly
address the impact of the global economic crisis on poverty. The DPO supports actions to
protect the most vulnerable from sudden external shocks, which have already become
manifest in higher unemployment and lower remittances, and will lead to imminently higher
poverty rates. Building on the sound social protection programs already in place, the DPO
envisages additional temporary measures to augment existing social safety nets in order to
protect the most vulnerable segments of society. The proposed operation also supports the
protection of the poor and key pro-poor programs in human development spheres. Budget
program expenditures for the poor and vulnerable, which had been reduced--such as for
hospital services for the poor, maternal child health, TB programs, and agricultural extension
programs--were restored as part of DPO-1.

114.    More specifically, DPO-1 supports prior actions on increasing the allocation of
funding for the Family Benefit (FB) and unemployment insurance programs, key
vehicles to mitigate the poverty impact of the financial crisis, and improving targeting of
the FB and public works programs. Existing evidence from the most recent poverty
assessments shows that large households with many members, children, female-headed
households, the unemployed, people with disabilities, and the less educated tend to account
for the large share of Armenia's poorest citizens, who also tend to be located in rural areas. As
a last resort program targeted at the bottom half of the poor and the vulnerable, the FB
intended to reach these groups of families, who are likely to be hit hardest by the global
economic crisis. The bulk of the beneficiaries of the FB lives in rural areas and would thus
directly benefit from the actions envisaged in the DPO series.

115.    While the FB program is fairly well targeted at the household level, additional
resources for the program would need to be combined with further improvements in
targeting. The Government has taken some measures in 2008 to reduce leakage in the FB
program to the non-poor by better integrating existing household registry data and
personalized income information. This has resulted in some saving and reallocation of
resources to poor families. However, there is still substantial scope for improving the
targeting accuracy. The DPO supports improvement in targeting efficiency of the program so
that the bulk of program resources go to those needing it the most. With the DPO's support,
the coverage of the poor by the FB program is envisaged to increase from 34% in 2007 to at
least 50% in 2011, while leakage to the non-poor decreases from 44% to 30% between 2007
and 2011.

116.    The DPO also supports measures to improve tertiary and preschool education
through better access, quality and management. These measures will help reduce the
intergenerational transfer of poverty by increasing access to education for all. The lack of
needs-based financing schemes limits access among the poor, necessitating a needs-based
student loan program to be supported by the DPO program. The DPO also supports expanding
access to preschool education (pursuing the national goal to achieve 90 percent of preschool
enrollment by 2015).

117.    The DPO also supports measures in health financing, with immediate impact on
the poorest groups. Out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on health continues to account for about
60 percent of total health expenditures. A lack of financial protection due to OOP payments
increases the incidence of impoverishing and catastrophic health expenditures. The DPO

                                               39

foresees the introduction of measures to address high OOP with important and beneficial
consequences for the poor and vulnerable.

118.    Armenia also faces many other binding constraints to growth and poverty
reduction that the DPO aims to help overcome, though their effects on poverty are more
indirect. These include: (a) the weak conditions for fair competition; (b) high administrative
and regulatory costs to firms; (c) insufficient and low quality infrastructure; and (d)
inefficiencies in public sector service delivery. Addressing these deficiencies will put
Armenia back on a stronger growth path during the post-crisis period. These actions, although
they do not directly impact poverty in the short term, will have positive consequences for poor
and vulnerable groups through efficiency gains and more rapid resumption of growth. For
example, the measures in private sector development--improving the business environment,
strengthening competition, expanding access to credit, reducing infrastructure costs, and
improving public service delivery through a strengthened PFM system and stronger
performance in the civil service--could generate more and better jobs and means of
livelihood for all Armenians, including the currently unemployed and poor.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
119.    The Bank has extensive knowledge of the country's PFM system. Public
Expenditure Reviews (2002, 2005, 2006) have provided recommendations to improve the
budget management system, particularly downstream process areas and operational
efficiency. A Country Financial Management Assessment (CFAA) was prepared in 2005. The
report noted the achievements in the period since independence, and supported the ambitious
plans to further improve budgeting and accounting, while developing modern treasury and
internal control systems. The CFAA also concluded that managers in all sectors and levels of
the administration needed to be better informed about the key components of the PFM
reforms, including budgeting, accounting and reporting, and internal and external audits. At
that time the CFAA assessed the overall fiduciary risk as significant, with further efforts and
capacity building required in order to institutionalize these reforms. The Government's PEFA
assessment published in 2008 highlighted the weakest links in the PFM system: monitoring
and reporting of NCOs, internal controls and internal audit, financial reporting, and external
audit and scrutiny. DPO-2 supports adoption of an integrated PFM reform strategy which will
link all the PFM reforms under a single umbrella in a sequenced manner.

120.    The IMF conducted a central bank safeguard assessment in 2002, which was
updated in 2005.      The update found that the CBA's safeguards framework had been
strengthened since 2002. In general, the procedures used by the CBA for sales of its foreign
exchange are viewed as transparent and the safeguards have been recognized as adequate. The
CBA adopted the IAS (now IFRS) in 1996 and has been audited by internationally recognized
auditing firms. Independent auditors have issued unqualified opinions on recent CBA
financial statements.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS
121.    Recipient and credit amount: The Recipient will be the Republic of Armenia. Upon
effectiveness of the Financing Agreement, expected in July 2009, the proposed single-tranche
credit of SDR 40.4 million (US$ 60 million equivalent) will be made to the Republic of
Armenia, represented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Provision of a legal opinion by
Armenia that it has followed its laws and procedures for the ratification of the credit
                                                40

agreement will be the effectiveness condition. The proposed credit will be on standard IDA
terms, with a 20 year maturity including a 10 year grace period.

122.    Disbursement: The Association will disburse the Credit in US dollars equivalent to
SDRs 40.4 million at the MOF's US$ deposit account in the Central Bank of Armenia. The
Recipient shall ensure that upon deposit of the proceeds of the Credit into the said account, an
equivalent amount will be credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Association, that is: the MOF's budget account will be credited with the
dram equivalent at the official exchange rate within 30 days of disbursement. The foreign
exchange proceeds of the proposed DPO-1 will be sold by the CBA or held in reserves, in
accordance with the objectives of monetary policy. The MOF be responsible for the
operation's administration and for preparing the withdrawal application, maintaining the
deposit account at the CBA, as required. The MOF, with the assistance of the CBA, will
maintain records of all DPO-related transactions in accordance with sound accounting
practices.

123.    Reporting, auditing and closing date: The audits of deposit accounts under the
previous four Poverty Reduction Support Credits were unqualified and revealed no issues of
concern. Considering the Association's knowledge of the public finance management systems
and the ongoing improvements of these systems, the positive assessment of the CBA made by
the IMF, previous unqualified audits of deposit account under PRSCs, and clean opinions
issued by the CBA's auditor on the recent years financial statements, no additional fiduciary
arrangements (including audit) will be required for the deposit account. The closing date of
the proposed credit will be December 31, 2009.

124.    Confirmation and eligible expenditure: The Recipient will provide to the
Association a confirmation that the amount of the DPO-1 has been credited to the account that
is available to finance budget expenditures (the format of the confirmation letter should be
acceptable to the Association). If, after the proceeds are deposited in the CBA account, the
proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement,
the Association will require the Recipient to promptly, upon notice from the Association,
refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to the Association. Amounts refunded
to the Association upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of the credit will
be the responsibility of the MOF.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
125.    It is expected that the DPO will result in significant positive effects on the
environment. These effects could be both direct, through the series' focus on environmental
sustainability and mining sector reforms, and indirect, through the range of sectoral reform
policies supported, including PFM and civil service reform. In support of the Government's
reform program, the DPO addresses policies aimed at strengthening the environmental
regulatory capacity of the country, including promotion of improved environmental impact
assessment (EIA), an improved mining sector regulatory and fiscal regime, and improved
monitoring and enforcement of atmospheric air quality.




                                               41

126.    The DPO builds on the extensive analytical framework of the Armenia Country
Environment Analysis (CEA, FY10) to support stronger environmental policy. The draft
CEA examines the costs of environmental degradation as well as environmental health costs,
assesses the financing and institutions of the environmental sector, and provides a case study
of the environmental impact of a controversial mining operation. The CEA's findings are used
to prioritize environmental policy actions for the DPO, as well as to assess the likelihood and
magnitude of the environmental impact of DPO actions.

127.    The DPO supports a range of positive direct effects on the environment,
including improved EIA legislation and improved monitoring of atmospheric air
quality. The focus on EIA is expected to contribute to promoting transparency and
accountability in decision making, and improve public participation, hence resulting in more
environmentally sound projects. The focus on monitoring of atmospheric air quality is
expected to reduce the level and risk of environmental degradation, including improvements
in environmental health. Another set of key positive direct environmental effects is expected
through an improved fiscal regime for mining, which would help promote better management
practices in mines and improve accountability of private sector involvement. The focus on the
promotion of energy efficiency would economize on energy costs in the short term, with
corresponding benefits for the environment, and also address cross-cutting issues, such as
climate change, by setting forth a long term agenda for low-carbon growth.

128.    The team does not assess that the operation will cause any likely or significant
negative effects on the environment. Furthermore, the requirements of OP 8.60--to
strengthen national environmental regulatory capacity--are addressed through the operation's
support of improved EIA legislation and enforcement of standards. Other policy actions
supported by the DPO are not likely to result in significant environmental effects. These
include, inter alia, education, health, and telecommunications measures. However, the
strengthening of public financial management and the civil service should enhance public
sector capacity in environmental management.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
129.    The government has tasked the Ministry of Finance as the main counterpart for
the DPO series. The Deputy Minister of Finance (Macroeconomics) is responsible for policy
coordination and overall program implementation, together with assigned contact officials in
each respective agency. The Deputy Minister is also responsible for donor coordination and
macroeconomic policies in the MOF, and is thus well placed to implement the DPO.

130.    A project preparation advance (PPA) for DPO-2 has been requested by the MOF
to support credit preparation for those sectors where further technical assistance (TA) is
necessary. This arrangement will allow sufficient time to mobilize TA. TA requirements have
already been identified for all DPO areas. In addition, there are two PHRD grants (pending
ratification), which could be used to support DPO implementation. However, given the
limited size of these PHRDs, the Government may need to mobilize funding from other
sources for some TA-intensive components.



                                               42

131.    As was the case with the previous PRSC series, the DPO is results-based, with a
detailed matrix of expected outcome and monitoring indicators aligned with the goals of
Armenia's SDP and deliverables of the Government's action plans. The Government is
committed to monitor DPO project implementation on the basis of the agreed results
framework. DPO implementation, monitoring, and evaluation will rely on existing
institutional arrangements (namely, the social partnership agreement for participatory
implementation of the SDP) developed during over the past seven years. The Bank is
represented in the highly participatory SDP Working Group, which also includes members of
the Civil Society Network Board (CSNB). This is an important forum and presents a unique
opportunity to both hold periodic discussions on DPO-supported policies and expected
outcomes of the operation. In addition, representatives of the CSNB directly participate in
Policy Development Councils, responsible for periodic reporting on SDP implementation,
which function in all ministries. Following previous practice, the Bank will also hold periodic
discussions with CSOs to receive direct feedback on progress in implementing DPO-
supported measures. The Bank will rely on the Ministries of Finance and Economy, the latter
of which coordinates SDP implementation, to provide regular, consolidated reviews of DPO
implementation, using performance indicators and data derived from the SDP monitoring
process.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
132.    The proposed operation is subject to several risks of domestic and external
origin. In the current crisis context, the main risk is a deeper and protracted global recession
that would seriously damage Armenia's economy and erode its growth prospects. There are a
number of risks that could emanate from a more severe crisis. First, a more severe crisis could
compromise Armenia's fiscal position in the short and medium terms, leading to a higher risk
of debt distress and limiting implementation of the SDP. Second, the economic crisis could
lead to deterioration in the political environment, which could weaken governmental
cohesion, if the social situation is exacerbated by higher employment in key sectors (mining
and construction) and in hard hit regions, and if return migration from Russia and elsewhere
aggravates tensions. Third, the crisis may pressure the Government to resort to suboptimal
measures in the form of protectionism and subsidies. These measures would erode
competitiveness and undermine the macro-fiscal framework, leading to a high and
burdensome debt level, and worsening medium term growth and poverty reduction prospects.
Current economic conditions could also embolden resistance to some reforms, including, for
example, implementation of stronger environmental regulations.

133.    To manage the risks, the Bank is pursuing a number of mitigation measures.
First, the Bank is holding a continuous policy dialogue with the Government on
macroeconomic issues as well as policy responses and tradeoffs. The robust relationship
between the Government and the Bank ensures frank and clear policy discussions at the
highest levels. The Bank has also intensified its macroeconomic monitoring such that
projections are updated at least on a monthly basis, and regularly discussed with the Ministry
of Finance (including through a joint Government-Fund-Bank economic working group
created by the Prime Minister). Second, the Bank is engaging in close collaboration, including
parallel missions, with the Fund. Third, the Bank is providing complementary technical
assistance in key areas, such as social protection, public financial management (including
revenue administration), and private sector development.

                PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
Unofficial Translation



Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President, the World Bank
Washington DC, USA

                              Republic of Armenia
                        Letter of Development Policy


       Dear Mr. Zoellick,

       In 2008 the Government of the Republic of Armenia launched the second
generation reforms with the primary objective of increasing Armenia's global
competitiveness. Long-term reform targets and policy priorities were stated in the
Sustainable Development Program (PRSP-2) aimed at achieving reduced disparities
in economic development, increased prosperity and human development through
proactive policies. Effective governance in both the public and private sectors, equal
regional development, an efficient tax and customs system, and development of an
information society underlie the reforms.

       Alas, the global financial and economic crisis proved to be a critical challenge
on the path to implementation of the planned reforms and development policies. The
ROA Government undertook a targeted anti-crisis policy focusing on social risk
mitigation and business activity stimulation with a view to mitigating the crisis-driven
constraints and threats. The reforms do not lose their relevance in the new
environment; rather, in some cases, they become more urgent and critical for
overcoming the crisis and effective positioning in a post-crisis situation.

       The development policies will be targeted at ensuring favorable fiscal and
improved external environment, protecting the poor, improving the business
environment and putting in place effective governance systems, improving public
services, strengthening economic competition and using natural resources efficiently.
Moreover, the latter will be implemented with improved accountability and monitoring
arrangements.

       Despite the likely constraints, the Government attaches importance to
continuation of pension reforms. These reforms will be aimed at developing an
equitable and financially viable pension system for working citizens that would serve
as an effective mechanism for institutionalization of domestic savings and growth
financing in the aftermath of the crisis.       Development of a modern pension
infrastructure in the current preparatory phase of reforms could be a driver for
developing electronic governance in the country.

                                          56

             Implementation of the Sustainable Development Program


1.     The Sustainable Development Program (SDP) is the country's main document
on socio-economic planning, which covers the key agreed-upon development
directions and policies. The approved document is of a long-term nature and is based
on pre-crisis global and domestic development projections. The latter have lost
relevance for clear reasons, leading to infeasibility of achieving individual policies and
indicators proposed in the Program.

2.     Under current circumstances, the SDP has nearly lost its practical importance
particularly for the short and medium term. The Government is forced to be guided
by the short-term action plan given uncertaintiesabout the global and domestic
economy. Namely, in coming months the Government plans to issue a short-term
plan of SDP policies for 2009-2011 as an Appendix to the SDP. It should be noted
that the longer-term SDP objectives and the framework for structural reforms
continue to be maintained.

3.     The short-term plan on SDP policies will cover a short-term planning horizon
and will include the key areas of development, priority reforms and anti-crisis
measures for the next one or two years. This approach will continue until the global
economy stabilizes and development trends become obvious, only after which the
SDP will be updated and the medium and long-term planning framework restored. To
this end, preliminary activities, including analysis and research, are currently being
carried out.

                              Crisis Management Policy


4.     The impact of the downturn in global markets and partner countries started to
be transmitted to Armenia's economy from end-2008. As opposed to the double-digit
growth of previous years, Armenia's economic growth in 2008 reached only for 6.8
percent. First, export volumes of mining products, then other types of products and
remittances from abroad, fell.      The downturn in the global real estate markets
resulted in less interest in Armenia's market with a parallel drop in investments
leading to a freeze in the construction sector ­ the main driver of growth in recent
years. The decline in the population's income and change in consumption behavior
on the one hand, and the fall in external demand on the other, resulted in reduced
activity in a number of sectors of the economy. Growth contraction reached 6.1
percent in the first quarter of 2009, further deepening in April. Projections show that
the economy will continue to be in recession throughout 2009.
                                           57

5.      In Armenia the direct impact and potential implications of the financial crisis
were avoided due to a small but strong banking system and a flexible policy. The first
wave of the crisis, targeting the financial system and macroeconomic stability, could
have led to an unmanageable situation, which was successfully overcome through a
temporary exchange rate regulation policy as well as excellent baseline indicators in
the banking system, a high level of financial supervision, and strong confidence in
banks. Although management of the exchange rate led to some losses in external
reserves, it allowed management of expectations in Armenia amidst financial panic in
partner countries and giving time to economic agents to make respective
adjustments. On March 3, 2009 the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) announced the
return to a freely floating exchange rate regime and made an exit from the foreign
currency market. The exchange rate depreciated immediately and then moved
toward equilibrium and stabilized around a market rate leaving the risks of the
financial crisis behind.

6.      The next set of anti-crisis measures is aimed at stopping the economic crisis
and preventing a decline in employment. In fact these measures have several
directions: support to growth-promoting investment projects, support to businesses
and streamlining tax administration, and implementation of regional energy and major
infrastructure projects.

7.      As part of the support for growth-promoting investment projects, the
Government has introduced unprecedented tools. Namely, enterprises with growth
potential and meeting the set criteria for contributing to employment were allowed an
option to use the following instruments: budget loans, guarantees, subsidies, equity
participation, technical assistance, etc. In addition, a number of initiatives were
undertaken for business and SME support aimed at alleviation of the tax burden and
streamlining administration and access to credit.

8.      A number of indicators are used for selection of enterprises to be included in
business support projects through direct state participation with such key indicators
as export orientation, use of innovative approaches, number of new jobs created, etc.
The majority of these projects are implemented through the national SME support
institution that makes its decisions in cooperation with independent consulting firms
and banks. In the future, similar projects will broadly continue to be implemented
through this institution (or the investment firm set up by it), which is currently
expanding its capacities and the scope of cooperation to be able to implement
deeper cost/benefit analyses.

9.      Key projects planned in regional energy and infrastructure are the new nuclear
power plant project, the North-South Transport Corridor Project, irrigation systems
development projects, the earthquake zone rehabilitation project, a project on
Gyumri's restructuring into a techno city, etc. These long-term development projects
were largely designed before the crisis, however, given their counter-cyclical nature,
                                           58

they become more urgent during the economic slowdown. Their implementation will
contribute to maintaining employment in the near term and to post-crisis growth and
development in the long run. These projects are planned to be implemented in
cooperation with international organizations and the private sector.

10.     The anti-crisis and long-term projects above will continue to be implemented in
line with Armenia's best public finance management traditions, and all investment
projects with public funds will be reflected in the budget to ensure a high level of
accountability and transparency. Possible non-traditional state support to the private
sector will be limited and temporary. Advanced public investment project appraisal
systems will be introduced. The Government will remain committed to its adopted
liberal economic policy principles as well as WTO and other international
commitments. The need for some policy adjustment because of the economic crisis
will in no way cause the liberal policy to go off track.

                        Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework


11.     2009 will be the first year during the recent 15 years that high economic
growth is replaced by high economic contraction. First quarter results show a
significant drop in remittances, export and import volumes, and private investment
and consumption, which cannot be reversed. Despite the anti-crisis measures, the
overall level of economic activity will suffer a one to two year setback in 2009.

12.     Economic recovery will first be stimulated by the Government anti-crisis
measures, the impact of which will start to be felt in the second half of 2009. As a
result, economic stabilization is expected to occur in 2010. Despite the risks
associated with the economic crisis, balanced macroeconomic policies would allow
maintaining inflation within the range of 3-4 percent over the 2009-2011period.

13.     The main burden of the economic crisis has fallen on the external balance and
the fiscal sector. The transition to a flexible exchange rate policy allowed a significant
mitigation of concerns over the external balance. The dramatic decline in tax revenue
against the background of increased poverty and the risk of social tensions limits the
Government's flexibility in cutting public spending in proportion to the decline in the
tax revenue. Also, the Government counter-cyclical policies imply additional budget
spending. All of this increases the fiscal tension.

14.     Under these circumstances, Government fiscal policy moves in three main
directions. Firstly, the pro-poor and human capital development budget programs are
protected. Secondly, given the decline in budget revenue experienced in the first
quarter and the risk of accumulating arrears, the Government suspended and
postponed AMD 92.2 billion in lower priority expenditure planned in the 2009 budget,
a part of which will potentially be fully cut by year-end (business travel, maintenance

                                             59

and representation expenses). Thirdly, infrastructure development projects already
approved by the Government as priorities have been revived and their earlier
implementation could ensure high countercyclical effectiveness.

15.     As a result, compared to previous years, the budget deficit will sharply
increase to 5-6 percent of GDP. The deficit will to some extent be financed from the
Government savings of previous years. However, external resources will serve as the
main source of deficit financing. To this end, significant external resources have
already been mobilized, which was made possible due to the low external debt, and
trust in implemented policies among foreign partners. The higher deficit in 2009 and
2010 will be financed by loans from the WB, IMF, ADB and the Russian Federation.
The funds will be used both for closing the budget gap resulting from the shrinking
revenue and the implementation of highly effective countercyclical projects. In
addition to the already agreed-upon external sources, the Government continues
bilateral and multilateral interstate negotiations for attracting additional resources.

                         2009-11 Fiscal Framework (In percent of GDP)
                                                           2007   2008  2009   2010  2011
 State Budget Revenue and Official Transfers               20.1    20    20.8  21.2   20.8
    Tax revenue and stamp duties                            16    16.4   16.3  16.7   17.1
     Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions               2.7    2.9     3    3.1    3.1
 State Budget Expenditure                                  22.4   21.8   27.1  27.0   24.0
   Current expenditure                                     17.2   17.9   22.1  21.8   20.6
   Capital expenditure                                      5.2    3.9     5    5.2    3.4
 State Budget Deficit                                       -2.3  -1.7   -6.3   -5.8  -3.2

16.     Such focus of the fiscal policy amidst the crisis will certainly lead to a
significant increase in external public debt, especially as a percentage of GDP (also
given the GDP contraction in dollar terms due to exchange rate depreciation).
However, the very low base of the debt allows Armenia, even under such crisis, to
maintain an easily manageable level of debt. According to Government estimates,
the external public debt as a percentage of GDP may double and exceed 30 percent
of GDP over the medium term, which, however, does not constitute a significant risk
from a debt sustainability perspective. It is particularly important to take into account
the fact that from 2011 fiscal policy will target rapid deficit reduction leading to a rapid
improvement in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term (see the table above).

17.     In terms of ensuring fiscal stability, acceleration of tax and customs reforms
becomes more urgent. The Government will continue to improve the tax and customs
administration, which would increase the possibilities for identifying new domestic tax
revenue.

                Social Risk Management and Human Development


18.    The priority of the Government's social risk mitigation policy in the coming
years is to safeguard the envisaged key social transfers and investments,
irrespective of the existing budget tension. In the meantime, given a possible
increase in social vulnerability amidst the crisis, the number of beneficiaries will be
increased to the extent possible through improved targeting of social transfers and
spending efficiency. The policies envisaged under the Sustainable Development
Policy remain relevant for the longer term.

19.     The Government will fully implement the social safety net programs as per the
2009 state budget law, including the family poverty benefits program and pensions.
Continued improvement in the targeting of the family benefits scheme is highly
important for the Government. As a result of clearing the lists of family benefit
recipients, the coverage error has already been reduced by approximately 9,000
families. The resulting savings, which could reach approximately AMD 3.6 billion by
year-end, will be used to provide benefits to families that have newly fallen below the
poverty threshold.

20.    Priority budget expenditure in health, education, agriculture and environment
(as per the 2009 budget) aimed at social risk mitigation will also be fully implemented.
Due to the decline in tax revenues in the first quarter of this year and the existing
uncertainties over the external financing at that time, in March, 2009 the Government
decided to temporarily suspend some spending programs. However, with clarity in
the fiscal framework, and as a result of budget reallocations, in May the Government
decided to restore the spending programs of high importance for human
development, including hospital services for the poor, tuberculosis and maternal child
care programs, the program for purchasing equipment for high schools and to ensure
access to 12th grade education, programs to ensure agricultural extension services,
and forest monitoring.

21.    In the medium term, it will be important to increase the efficiency of social
security administration and the system of monitoring and evaluation of social works.
The latter will be improved year by year in order to have a well-established social
safety management information system and integrated social services centers in
2011.

22.    The Government places high importance on improving the financing
mechanisms for tertiary and higher education for the long term development of
education. The exploration and assessment of flexible competitive funding schemes
for education will be completed in 2009 and in 2010-2011 respective competitive
funding mechanisms will be put in place by ensuring the legal framework and
implementing pilot projects.

23.     In view of the need to mitigate social risks anticipated over the long term due
to demographic developments, pension reforms also continue to remain among the
Government priorities. The latter is also important in terms of possibilities for
financing economic growth in the long run, as well as the development of modern
social infrastructure and institutions in the short run. In this respect, the Government
is taking steps to develop the relevant legal framework and infrastructure, increase
awareness, and carry out the necessary analyses and other preparatory activities for
launching the reform. We are anticipating and we ourselves would encourage the
active involvement of the World Bank and other international organizations and
advisors in the preparation of the launch of the new pension system.

                         Improved Public Sector Governance


24.     Improved public sector governance is one of the key Government priorities.
Reforms in this area will produce significant fiscal and economic benefits linked to
state revenue and spending efficiency as well as improved conditions for business
and competition. These are highly important resources for overcoming the crisis and
ensuring post-crisis growth.

25.     In this regard, one of the medium term priorities is reforms focused on drastic
improvement in state revenue. In addition, these are important from a business
environment improvement perspective, and will also play an important role in terms of
ensuring public debt and fiscal sustainability over the medium term given the
expected increase in external borrowings in 2009-10. Thus, the continued increase in
the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio is an important task.

26.     Drastic reforms of revenue performance require investment of the necessary
resources. A time-bound action plan of priority reforms with key outcome indicators
has been adopted for the State Revenue Committee to increase the revenue
performance in 2009-2011, also to be used to assess the reform progress.

27.      As a first step under the Action Plan, USD 500,000 will be used to carry out
an independent analysis for business process re-engineering in key tax areas, and
around USD 180,000 to deepen the customs reforms focusing on green-channel
customs clearance by default. Next steps and investment directions will be based on
the results of the first phase and will be completed in 2011. Among the main
directions, key importance will be placed on the full development of the electronic
filing system for tax and customs returns.

28.     The Government has embarked on public financial management reforms in
cooperation and with the support of the WB, EU and a number of other organizations.
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report was prepared and
published in 2008. Within the framework of the WB loan and in addition to other

                                            62

completed reviews, it will serve as a basis for developing the PFM reform strategy,
which has already been planned to be adopted in late 2009.

29.    As part of active anti-crisis policies, importance is placed on a significant
improvement in the quality of public investment. The urgency of the matter is also
due to the fact that the Government has initiated major infrastructure investments for
the coming years. The Government will publish the Public Investment Appraisal
System (PIAS) white paper in the near future in order to strengthen the PIAS. It
would allow improving the preparation of public investment projects to be
implemented in Armenia from 2010 and, as a result, selecting projects that would
have higher effectiveness.

30.    A radical improvement in public sector governance and increased quality of
public service in the country through proper regulation of conflict of interest and
elimination of distortions existing in the business environment is also one of the most
important objectives of the second generation reforms. This matter becomes more
urgent in the current circumstances, since tackling the economic crisis would require
a more efficient public service, which would also help to increase the competitiveness
of Armenia's economy. Accordingly, the Government of Armenia has submitted the
draft Law on Public Service to the National Assembly which also includes conflict of
interest regulations and the necessary provisions to ensure the framework for further
implementation.

31.    Earlier in the pre-crisis period the Government of Armenia declared that it is
necessary to consistently deepen public-private partnerships (PPP). In order to
ensure sustainable post-crisis growth, more favorable conditions for the private
sector become important, which is also underscored by planned major infrastructure
and increased competitiveness projects. The Government has already adopted the
PPP concept paper and will consistently implement the institutional development
process envisaged in the paper.

32.    Mining regulation, including the tax regime and procedural matters, are among
the areas requiring public sector governance reforms. The activities in this area will
focus on developing and introducing a legal and regulatory framework in line with
international standards.

              Improved Business Environment and Competitiveness


33.    Parallel to public sector governance reforms the Government has undertaken
steps directed at private sector development: improving business regulations,
ensuring new generation infrastructure, and creating new foreign trade opportunities.
These are also seen as important factors for post-crisis recovery.


                                            63

34.    In view of maintaining and further increasing business activity, the ROA
Government will take significant steps to reduce business registration costs. In June
2008 the Government approved the Action Plan on Improving Armenia's Business
Environment, with a view to fully introducing the one-stop shop principle for company
registration and issuance of construction permits, streamlining and reducing tax
reporting, documentary requirements for import and export, and relevant
amendments to the Labor Code.

35.    Ensuring SME and household access to credit (both in Yerevan and in
marzes) is highly important for private sector expansion and growth stabilization. In
this respect, the WB-supported USD 50 million project for a small and medium
enterprise (SME) credit line is highly important. The Government will continue to
make significant efforts to strengthen the financial sector and the policy to ensure that
credit resources are available for SMEs for increased access to credit. However, the
Government largely views it as a temporary policy, since after economic recovery
and overcoming of the crisis, Armenia's viable banking sector would be able to serve
the needs of the economy from independently generated resources (through
increased deposit base and integration into international financial markets).

36.    The Government will continue to institute the corporate governance culture in
the country considering it among the most important prerequisites for economic
competition in the country along with the establishment of a stronger institution for the
protection of competition and an improved business environment.

37.    The existence of low-productivity sectors is one of the factors that impedes the
realization of the private sector's full potential. In agriculture, the Government will
continue to make efforts aimed at providing irrigation and infrastructure, increasing
productivity through extension services, and expanding non-agricultural employment
in rural areas.

38.    The Government will also continue its ambitious projects to develop
infrastructure for the knowledge economy and reduce the knowledge and
technological gap compared to the developed world. In this sense, the specific focus
on tertiary education, research and development promotion, closer links between
universities and businesses, and developing new generation high-speed
communication and telecommunication infrastructure will be particularly important.

39.    The Government attaches strategic importance to initiating negotiations for
signing a deep and fully liberal trade agreement with EU and institutional alignment
and overhaul within that framework. Their successful implementation will provide
opportunities for developing an export-oriented private sector and thus for post-crisis
recovery and growth.



                                           64

40.    The project for building the North-South Corridor, which is planned to be
launched by the end of this year and gather momentum in 2010, will also have an
important impact on addressing the crisis, increasing economic activity, and ensuring
long term growth. The North-South is a new generation road infrastructure, which will
be critically important for our country with limited access to foreign markets in terms
of promoting both domestic and foreign trade, business, and integration.

                         Program Monitoring and Evaluation

41.    The Ministry of Finance will be the main counterpart for DPO implementation.
The Deputy Minister of Finance in charge of macroeconomic policies, together with
the representatives of other relevant agencies, will be responsible for policy
implementation and coordination. Regular monitoring and evaluation of results of
reforms planned under DPOs will be based on the expected outcomes and
performance indicators that have been already defined and agreed upon, and
implemented within the existing SDP monitoring and evaluation framework. The
Government has undertaken activities to improve the SDP monitoring and evaluation
framework, which entails an improved institutional and indicator framework. Together
with the short term plan for SDP policies, the Government will also approve the
revised monitoring and evaluation framework, including the DPO monitoring and
evaluation component, in the near future. The monitoring and evaluation activities will
be coordinated by the Ministry of Economy in cooperation with relevant Government
agencies and civil society institutions.

Annex 3: IMF Assessment Letter

                 Republic of Armenia--Assessment Letter to the World Bank


This note provides the IMF staff's assessment of recent macroeconomic developments and
prospects in Armenia. This assessment is based mainly on information gathered by an IMF
mission that visited Yerevan during May 7­20 to conduct the first review under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) and discuss the authorities' request for an augmentation of access.

The global economic downturn is having a deep impact on Armenia, with economic
activity falling rapidly. In particular, Armenia is feeling the impact of the global crisis on
Russia, with exports, remittances, and FDI down sharply. Construction activity, which
represented more than a quarter of value added, has collapsed. As a result, GDP growth in the
first four months of the year fell by close to 10 percent, and staff now projects a similar
contraction for 2009 as a whole. With the improvement of global conditions, real GDP is
projected to rise in 2010, but only by about 1 percent.

The return to a floating exchange rate on March 3--a key element of the SBA program
approved on March 6--has been successful. The 22 percent depreciation removed a
significant exchange rate overvaluation. Negative effects of the depreciation on the financial
system have been limited, with no deposit outflows, a broadly stable--albeit high--deposit
dollarization rate, and manageable balance sheet losses of the well-capitalized banking
system.

Despite the depreciation, inflationary pressures remain muted. Annual CPI inflation rose
to 3.2 percent in April from 1 percent in February and March, largely due to adjustments in
utility tariffs and, to a lesser extent, the pass-through from the March depreciation, which
mostly affected imported food prices. Owing to ample spare capacity in the economy,
inflation is expected to remain low throughout 2009.

The sharp economic downturn has caused a substantial deterioration of the external and
fiscal positions. Significant drops in export receipts, remittances, and FDI are expected to
maintain a large gap in the external balance of payments despite the decline in imports
associated with weaker economic activity. Tax revenues have fallen by 15 percent in the first
four months of 2009 and, due to financing constraints, the authorities had to postpone
expenditures, further aggravating the downturn.

While the banking system remains solid, credit conditions in the economy have
worsened. Liquidity in local currency remains tight. High deposit dollarization makes banks
reluctant to lend in drams, and borrowers without foreign exchange receipts are averse to
borrowing in dollars. Moreover, banks are tightening their lending criteria to address rising
borrower default risk. As a result, credit to the private sector is largely frozen, further
dampening economic activity.

The authorities are taking steps to ease monetary conditions. They have started to lower
interest rates (by 150 basis points since the hike in rates that accompanied the float of the
exchange rate), and with exchange rate pressures now limited, they are preparing to inject

                                                   71

more liquidity into the system. The authorities are also taking direct steps to boost access to
dram-denominated credit, notably through donor-financed loan programs for small and
medium enterprises. The authorities remain committed to the flexible exchange rate regime
and the inflation-targeting framework. However, the effectiveness of monetary policy is likely
to be limited after the recent increase in dollarization.

The authorities will ease fiscal policy to mitigate the severity of the downturn. The fiscal
deficit will rise to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2009 from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2008. This reflects
in part lower tax revenue, projected to fall by almost 1 percent of GDP, but the bulk of the
widening deficit is due to spending, which will be maintained to mitigate contractionary
pressures on domestic demand and to protect the poor. In 2010, the fiscal position is expected
to improve moderately, consistent with the need to adjust to a more subdued medium-term
outlook and to ensure fiscal sustainability, while not choking off an incipient recovery. The
authorities have also taken steps to support future fiscal adjustment by accelerating their
ambitious tax administration reform program.

Donor support will help cover the financing gaps. The additional financing gap (after
taking into account the remaining disbursements under the current SBA) is projected at
$350 million combined for 2009­10. This amount is on top of a $500 million project loan
recent signed with Russia. Later in June, the IMF Executive Board will discuss the
authorities' request for an augmentation of access, which would fill much of the additional
gap, with the remainder being covered by other donors. Given the difficulty issuing and
rolling over domestic debt, the authorities have requested that the additional IMF resources be
used to finance the balance of the deficit.

The SBA is broadly on track, but there are several risks to the program. Risks around
economic growth projections in 2009-10 appear evenly balanced, but uncertainty is high. A
strong policy response might alleviate the sharp economic downturn, but Armenia is very
vulnerable to a further deterioration of global conditions, particularly in Russia.

Debt sustainability is a concern in the medium term. Armenia's debt ratios will rise
sharply--albeit from a low base--with the ratio of public debt-to-GDP increasing from
18 percent of GDP in 2008 to 43 percent of GDP in 2010. The debt dynamics are sustainable
but remain vulnerable to several shocks. The projected debt-to-GDP levels do not appear
excessive, and standard stress tests show that Armenia is at low risk of debt distress.
However, rollover risk is high, mainly due to the relatively short maturity of Fund financing.
Relations with the Fund

On March 6, 2009, the Board approved Armenia's request for a stand-by arrangement with
exceptional access of 400 percent of quota (equivalent to SDR 368 million or about $544
million). Disbursements under the program are front-loaded: about $240 million was made
available at the time of the program's approval, and roughly $350 million in total is available
in 2009. Completion of the first review is expected by end-June.
