About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loarkredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions; government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Brazil Programmatic
Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform Loan (Ln7306) for
which the World Bank approved a Loan of US$502.5 million on June 14,2005. The Loan
was fully disbursed and closed on June 30,2006, as planned.

The report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report, the Program Document, legal documents and project files, and on
discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project. An IEG mission visited Brazil in
December 2009 to review project results and met with more than 30 interlocutors
including officials of housing and urban development agencies at the federal level in
Brasilia and representatives of commercial banks in Sgo Paul0 and Belo Horizonte. IEG
gratefully acknowledges the courtesies and attention given by all these interlocutors, as
well as the outstanding planning and logistical support for an intense and tight mission
agenda provided by SAIN, the International Affairs Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance.

IEG selected this operation for a PPAR field assessment, as recommended at the time that
the Implementation Completion Report was reviewed by IEG, to verify the ongoing
performance of this important housing and urban development project and to provide an
input into a comparative IEG analysis of Bank support for housing sector development.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review. Comments received are attached as Annex C.

Summary
The Brazil Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector
Reform Loan (Ln7306), called the "Operation" here, rightly focused upon achieving
better access to quality housing by the poor, those most negatively affected by Brazil's
declining, but still large, housing deficit. The 6.4 percent fall of the deficit over the 2004-
2007 period of the Operation was a good result, especially as the nation's population
continued to grow and become more urbanized.
Raising necessary funds for building and purchasing the extra houses needed to reduce
the deficit was a major part of the Operation's focus. Using unfettered local financial
markets with Brazil's present high interest rate regime, with large spreads between
savings and lending rates expected by lenders would not itself lead to affordable lending.
According to data reported to the International Monetary Fund and to the Bank, Brazil
has the highest interest rates and broadest interest rate spreads in the world.
Nearly all mortgage funding for house purchase in Brazil therefore occurs within the
government-driven Housing Finance System, through its two main windows, the
Brazilian Loans and Savings System (SBPE) and the Workers' Provident Fund (FGTS).
Together, they have taken outstanding mortgage debt in Brazil to the equivalent of just
2.9 percent of GDP, far behind Mexico's 12 percent, Chile's 15 percent, and the 60-85
percent range of most advanced industrialized economies. Brazil's current housing
program, as the Operation itself, sought to strengthen and improve the existing Housing
Finance System and its two windows, SBPE and FGTS, not overhaul and reform the
system altogether. Deep reform of the Housing Finance System may be inevitable in the
longer term, but it is a system that has served Brazil well for nearly fifty sometimes-
turbulent years, a period that included military dictatorship and hyperinflation.
Deep housing sector reform will have to await macro-conditions that can bring Brazil's
high interest regime to a close. The Government of Brazil has its sights set upon lower in-
terest rates, but there are constraints. One is that the interbank rate cannot fall below the
interest paid on Brazil's widely used savings accounts, historically set at 6 percent per
annum (plus a currently small adjustment for future expected inflation which is currently
negligible). Smaller spreads between savings and lending rates will most likely be driven
by greater market competition across an expanding financial sector.
The Operation's overall objective of improving the access of the poor to housing was
substantially relevant. It fits the Government's ongoing commitment to housing the poor
through the country's principal stimulus and development programs Minha Casu, Minha
Vida (My House, My Life) and the Programa de AcelerapTo de Crescimento (PAC -
Growth Acceleration Program). Two of the Operation's four specific objectives aimed at
developing housing policy and implementing housing subsidies for the poor were more
relevant. The other two, expanding housing finance (within constraints of the Housing
Finance System) and reducing urban land development costs through regularizing proper-
ty registration, were less so. These intended Operation outcomes amount to a significant
improvement to the functioning of the Housing Finance System, but may fall short of the
reform of it, an expectation raised by the Housing Sector Reform title of the Operation.

But the Operation design relevance was substantial, focusing mostly upon prior actions
instrumental for achieving the objectives. An exception was the operation's unrealistic
                                               X



expectation of achieving lower costs of new urban land provision through regularizing
property registers in existing informal settlements, such as favelas. Pre-preparing a fol-
low-on Operation-I1 and having a Housing Sector Technical Assistance Project (Ln7338)
alongside were good design principles. But the Government did not want a second fol-
low-on operation, so it was not prepared. Although approved shortly after the Operation
reviewed here, the Technical Assistance Project was barely implemented, but it remains
ongoing at this writing with two-thirds of the US$4.0 million loan already cancelled.

The Operation design itself earned mixed reviews in Brazil, even though the Operation
did bring together these various parties, with the Bank acting as honest broker among
them. As Borrower, the Ministry of Finance valued the flexibility and ownership it
conferred. As implementing agencies, the Ministry of Cities and the principal state bank,
the Caixa EconGmica Federal (CEF) lamented incurring costs during implementation that
could have been eligible for reimbursement under an investment loan, but not a policy
loan like the one reviewed here. The Ministry of Cities made little use of funding
available through the parallel Technical Assistance Project, however.

The backdrop of Brazil's buoyant macro-economy with GDP growth and falling-but
still very high-interest rates, boosted the demand for housing and housing finance. Bank
supervision focused primarily on preparing a follow-on Operation-II-one that a fiscally
stronger Government no longer wanted, indicating that Borrower demand for long-term
Bank assistance for sector development may be affected by unrelated short-run fiscal
considerations.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was not fully designed by the Operation, and failed
during implementation because it depended upon work that should have been done
through the parallel HTAP that was not implemented. This outcome.points to the need for
M&E to be an integral part of the design of the operation if it is to monitor, and not rely
upon a parallel activity that may or may not go ahead. Clear evidence of housing
finance's down-market move and of cost reduction new urban land provision is among
the resulting gaps.

Housing in Brazil has a much higher political profile than before, especially through the
Government's Minha Casu, Minha Vida mega-program. Housing policy's traditionally
volatile institutional framework in Brazil was stabilized through the consolidation of the
Ministry of Cities. The Housing Finance System's institutional arrangements, with CEF
at the heart, remain solid having been in place for nearly half a century. Even the new
Minha Casu, Minha Vida fits within that old framework.

Between 2006 and 2009 new housing finance grew six-fold in real terms; twice the rate
of the number of houses financed. Thus the average loan size doubled, a trend that does
not bode well for affordability, especially for low-income groups, and the Operation's
intended down-market shift. Construction finance nearly quintupled between 2004 and
2008, helping alleviate supply-side constraints. Evidence of the down-market move of
housing finance intended by the Operation is elusive. Rising average loan amounts have
prompted the Government to introduce new incentives for banks to lend down-market
within SBPE, and to pursue the Minha Casu, Minha Vida program more intensively.
While Brazil's housing finance is large in absolute terms, it is still small in relation to the
                                              xi

size of its economy. Under present macro-economic circumstances, housing finance in
Brazil can only grow within the Housing Finance System parameters and the funding
constraints of its two main instruments. Thus, lenders could provide more loans through
greater use of the alienaqdo Jiduciciria (trust deed) instrument, a more easily executed
lien in the event of loan repayment default, than a traditional mortgage, or hipoteca.

With a solid legal framework in place, securitization of housing loans took a firmer
institutional footing in Brazil, with new businesses in Sao Paul0 bundling loans and
trading mortgage-backed securities called Certzjkados de Recebiveis Imobilicirios in
Brazil. At this writing, the sale of these Certzjkados has lapsed in Brazil as has the
trading of such securities worldwide following the sub-prime lending crisis in the US.

The private sector share of housing finance has remained constant and is unlikely to take
off before interest rates are normalized in Brazil's financial markets. Private banks
complain that they have difficult access to FGTS funding because of excessive
bureaucracy that leaves CEF to dominate the use of FGTS funds. These banks also argue
that the small spreads allowed make FGTS lending unprofitable for them.

Comprehensive reform of housing finance in Brazil remains hostage to the country's high
interest rate regime, something likely to change only over the longer-term. Interest rates
did fall over the 2004-2009 period, but still remain extraordinarily high by international
standards. This makes free-market-driven housing finance a distant reality, leaving the
field to the SBPE-FGTS windows.

The Ministry of Cities began work on a national housing subsidy policy covering all
instruments, including direct up-front subsidies awarded by the federal government,
below-market interest rates of the Housing Finance System mortgage loans-still by far
the largest-and tax breaks on interest payments. Operation support came principally for
the Programa de Subsidios a Habitaqdo de Interesse Social (PSH) Brazil's up-front
Subsidy Program for Social Housing. But PSH did not take off. Excessive bureaucracy
discouraged large-scale operators. At this stage, PSH has effectively been incorporated
into Minha Casu, Minha Vida. Up-front subsidies were provided with FGTS lending for
the first time, although this meant borrowers receiving a double subsidy-the lump sum
and the below-market interest.

IEG found little evidence of the lower costs of urban land provision sought by the
Operation. But data on this are difficult to come by. Baselines and targets were not
systematically measured or reported. Furthermore, the Operation's focus upon
regularizing land titling of existing informal settlements was not the right one, as already
noted.

The Operation supported Government efforts to bring about necessary changes to
Brazil's housing sector. With so many other factors at play, attributing changes to the
Operation itself is not easy, but the 6.7 percent fall in the national housing deficit during
2004-2007 is consistent with the achievement of the Operation's overall objective.

The Overall Outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. It achieved its
relevant objectives, helping to increase access by the poor to housing, strengthening
                                            xii


policy and institutions and expanding housing finances, albeit with moderate
shortcomings. These included scant evidence of a down-market shift of housing finance,
little lasting impact on subsidies, and no evidence of reduced costs of urban land
provision. The Risk to Development Outcome is rated moderate. Government
commitment to the Operation-supported improvements is unlikely to waver. But possible
impacts-real estate bubbles, for instanc-f      rapid expansion of housing finance upon
the real supply and demand for housing were not addressed by the Operation. Bank
Performance is rated wk&mtely satisfactory. The project was prepared with care except
for M&E that was given cursory treatment and failed. Except for actions to lower the
costs of urban land delivery, the project was well designed to achieve the relevant object-
tives. Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory. The Government was committed to
improving the Housing Finance System, while placing housing center stage of its two
flagship programs, the PAC and the Minha Casu, Minha Vida. Those agencies respon-
sible for implementation, the Ministry of Cities and CEF, industriously pursued Opera-
tion-endorsed actions at their own expense.


LESSONS
   0   Strengthening housing finance is an important sectoral goal, but it should be
       pursued alongside efforts to overcome bottlenecks in real housing supply and
       demand that, if not addressed, may lead to a surge in property prices, creating a
       real estate bubble and collapse-as experience elsewhere has shown.

   0   Monitoring and Evaluation should be an integral part of the operation it is
       monitoring. Establishing a new M&E system or consolidating an existing one
       should be a key prior action for an Operation, and trigger for subsequent
       operations or tranches. Consigning Monitoring and Evaluation to another
       operation (such as a parallel Technical Assistance Project in this case) increases
       the risk of a total lack of evidence if the host operation fails.

   0   Bank value-added for its clients arises when it offers different advice from the
       local expert opinion and knowledge that exist in abundance in middle-income
       countries especially. This Operation provided an opportunity for a broad sector
       policy discussion of reform beyond the parameters of Brazil's Housing Finance
       System that could have been more fully exploited by the Bank.

   0   A policy lending operation can usefully bring together different sectoral
       stakeholders among whom the Bank can serve as honest broker, even when sector
       reform opportunities or achievements may be modest.

1. The Need for Housing Reform in Brazil
1.1      The Brazil: Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing
Sector Reform Loan (Ln7306), called the "Operation" in this report, rightly focused upon
improving the access of the poor to better quality housing as its top priority. As in most
countries, the poor in Brazil suffer disproportionately from low quality housing. Poorer
households-earning three minimum salaries' or less, up to R$1,140 (US$585) month-   per
make up the lower half of the income distribution but earn only 16.7 percent of all household
income. 19.5 percent of them occupy deficient housing, when only 2.3 percent of households
in the top half of the income distribution do. In the year after the completion of the Operation
in 2007, Brazil's housin deficit was reported to affect 7.3 million households; equivalent to
12.9 percent of the total.3 (Box 1). Fully 89.4 percent of this housing deficit affects lower
income households.


 Box 1. Estimating Brazil's Housing Deficit
 Households affected: 7.8 million in 2004 and 7.3 million in 2007
 Since 1995, the Fundaqclo Joclo Pinheiro of Minas Gerais has been researching and measuring
 Brazil's housing deficit for the Federal Government, an effort supported by the United Nations
 Development Programme and the Inter-American Development Bank. This is not a survey of the
 physical housing stock and its conditions and occupancy status as the name implies. Instead, it is a
 review of housing conditions reported annually by a national sample of households as well as the
 full population census every ten years by Brazil's census bureau and statistical institute, IBGE. The
 housing deficit estimate derives from household reports of (i) the poor physical condition of the
 house itself, its inadequate services or a location that is inaccessible or risky; and (ii) overcrowding
 where two or more households unwillingly share a single dwelling. The first results from the
 deteriorating condition of the dwellings themselves, while the second is the product of population
 growth and new household formation. Reducing this deficit thus requires improving existing
 housing and providing new units.

1.2     In the year before the approval of the Operation in 2004, the total housing deficit was
even higher, standing at 7.8 million units. Thus, over the 2004-2007 period covered by the
Operation, Brazil's housing deficitfezl by 6.4 percent, a good result considering that the
overall population grew by 4.7 percent over the same period, and the share of Brazilians
living in urban areas rose from 83 percent to 85 percent. Preliminary data for 2008

 Value of Brazil's minimum salary in Reais per month (with US$ equivalent using average exchange rate of the
year): 2004 - R$260 (US$88.7); 2005 - R$290 (US$l19); 2006 - R$360 (US$165); 2007 - R$380
(USs195); 2008 - R$415 (US$227); 2009 - R$465 (US$239); 2010 - R$510 (US$287)
 This 2007 figure was later revised down to 6.3 million households, when the 2007 survey revealed that one
million households were cohabiting voluntarily with other households in the same dwelling, a situation that was
not deemed to constitute overcrowding.
 The equivalent figure for Mexico for 2006 was of a housing deficit of 4.6 million units, representing 18.6
percent of the total housing stock.
                                                                                    2


         announced at the Fifth World Urban Forum, held in Rio de Janeiro in March 2010, show a
         further 7.9 percent fall in the housing deficit since 2007. Brazil's housing sector is moving in
         the right direction, but clearing the housing deficit still has some way to go to free Brazil of
         overcrowded and substandard housing, as dramatically seen in the proliferation offavelas,
         especially in the largest cities.

         1.3     Mobilizing funding for the construction and purchase of the quantity and quality of
         housing units needed is among the challenges facing the further reduction and eventual
         elimination of this deficit. In Brazil, raising the necessary funds directly in unfettered local
         financial markets would only lead to unaffordable lending. Interest rates in Brazil are the
         highest reported in the world, multiples of those in comparable states (Table 1.1). If one
         would exist carrying Brazil's 44.7 percent per annum interest rate, for instance, a
         hypothetical 15 year mortgage loan of US$150,000 would require a monthly repayment of
         US$5,5004-affordable only by households in the top few percentiles of the income
         distribution-clearly not a feasible solution. Large spreads between deposit and lending rates
         add to the high interest rates on loans. Brazil's spreads were the largest among the 121
         countries reporting this data for the 2008 World Development Indicators.'

         1.4     Although interest rates fell between 2004 and 2007, they began to rise again in 2008.
         At the time of writing, financial markets in Brazil were concerned about further possible
         interest rates hikes in 2010, as a tight monetary policy might be needed to curtail inflationary
         pressures as GDP accelerates. This high interest rate regime explains why no new mortgage
         lenders came to the market during 2004-2009, as the ICR correctly observed (ICR p. 20).


         4
          At this writing, the equivalent monthly repayment in the United States with interest of 4.5 percent per annum
         would be US$1,132.
         5
           Although currently very high, interest rates have been higher still in Brazil in recent times. It is worth noting
         that the 0 Globo newspaper of November 30,2009 carried a celebratory headline announcing that the 43
         percent interest for consumer credit that month was the lowest level charged since 1994.
                                                                  3


 1.5     Thus, most mortgage funding in Brazil takes place today within what is called in
 Brazil the Sistema Financeiro de Habitaqtlo (SFH - Housing Finance System) as it has since
 the 1960s. In the Housing Finance System, most housing finance passes through two lending
 windows driven, if not directly controlled, by the Federal Government of Brazil: (i) the
 Sistema Brasileiro de Poupanqa e Empre`stimo (SBPE - Brazilian Saving and Loan System)
 for higher-income borrowers; and (ii) the Fundo de Garantia de Tempo do Serviqo (FGTS -
 Workers' Provident Fund) for middle-income borrowers (details Box 2). Data for 2009 show
 that three quarters of SBPE loans went to finance new housing, and only one quarter for the
 purchase of existing units. Thus lending is poised to help meet the growing demand for new
 housing. In 2004 SBPE mortgage lending had been split evenly between new and existing
 housing. The loan to value ratio of SPBE mortgage lending has risen,from 47 percent in 2004
 to 60 percent in 2009. This is an important increase. Home buyers in Brazil, facing high
 interest rates-even when subsidized-typically borrow the least amount they need to
 supplement their savings, making for very varied loan to value ratios across individual loans.

 constrained in a country where 60 percent of house sales are cash and still only 40,percent

 17 countries providing this data report an increase in these shares over the 1994 - 2006 period. Among the most
 rapid increases were: Greece 3.6 percent in 1994 to 29 percent in 2006; Spain 16 percent in 1994 to 59 percent
 in 2006; Portugal 16 percent in 1994 to 59 percent in 2006; and Italy 6.0 percent in 1994 to 19 percent in 2006.

Operation itself, sought to strengthen and make improvements to the existing Housing
Finance System, not to make deep reforms to it that would complement or replace it with the
private market-driven financing behind the higher figures of other countries reported here.
With the inevitability of such reform in Brazil, the Operation could have elaborated scenarios
of reform steps and timing, identifying some of them as key prior actions.

1.7     Housing sector experts both within the Government and the Bank recognize the need
for and the inevitability of deep reform to the Housing Finance System, a system that has
been in place for nearly 50 years, and that has served Brazil well during periods of financial
and political volatility. They also recognize that such reform will only take place after
interest rates in Brazil, and spreads too, have fallen to levels similar to those practiced in
other countries.

1.8     Lowering Brazil?s benchmark interest rate, called SELIC (Sisterna Especial de
Liquidapio e Custddia), from its current 8.75 percent per annum towards Treasury Bill rates
in, say, Mexico (5.4 percent per annum) or the United States (0.2 percent per annum) is
Government policy as far as monetary conditions allow. Already, the Government succeeded
in bringing it down from 22.1 percent in 2003. This has helped lower pre-fixed interest rates
of Housing Finance System mortgage loans too, but not to the same degree.? In the short
run, further deep cuts in interest rates are unlikely. The historic 6 percent minimum rate plus
an adjustment for likely future interest rate adjustments (taxa referencial) paid for widely
used savings accounts constitutes a floor below which the SELIC cannot fall.

1.9 Narrower spreads too are desired, but not controlled by the Government. For
narrower spreads, banks and non-bank financial institutions would have to be able to increase
the volume of their business significantly keeping it profitable through larger volumes.
Normalization of financial markets with a competitive market-driven interest rate regime
offers the best hope.



2. Bank Support for Strengthening the Housing Sector
RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.1    Through its overall objective, the Operation?s focus upon the Government?s priority
of improving the access of the poor-who suffer disproportionately from the deficit-to
housing was substantially relevant (Box 3). The creation of the Ministry of Cities (MOC) in
2003 signaled a new Government determination to tackle the housing deficit systematically.
The ongoing relevance of the Operation objectives is clear from housing?s priority in the

lo Interest rates on government driven mortgages through SBPE and FGTS have not fallen over the 2003-2010
period as rapidly as the 60 percent fall in the SELIC rate in this period. The mortgage loan rates are driven by a
more complex formula involving base rates in the 12-14 percent per annum range plus a tma referencial
adjustment for likely future interest rates, a legacy fiom Brazil?s erstwhile hyperinflation. At this writing, the
value of the tma referencial is approximately 0.5 percent per annum, down from 4.7 per annum in 2003. This
would mean a fall of a mortgage loan rate from, say, 16.7 percent per annum to 12.5 percent per annum over the
2003-2010 period, a drop of 25 percent (against SELIC?s 60 percent).

Government?s 2007 launch of the R$13.5 billion Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) and
the April 2009 launch of the Minha Casu, Minha Vida (?My House My Life?)? stimulus
mega-program with a start up investment of R$34 billion. The commitment is there even if
initial performance has fallen short of initial expectations. Only 230,000 loan agreements for
house purchase, 5 8 ercent of Minha Casu, Minha Vida?s400,000 target for 2009, were
signed in that year. 1P Also, signed Minha Casu, Minha Vida construction loan agreements

amount to only one third of the applications r e ~ e i v e d .But, the specific objectives of the
operation (details Box 3) ?wererelevant too.

2.2     Specific obiective (a), developing a sound national housing policy, is substantially
relevant, and remains a priority for the Government, although it has lost some urgency as
attention has shifted to implementing the PAC and Minha Casu, Minha Vida mega-housing
programs. Specific obiective (b), expanding the housing finance system and moving it down-
market, is modestly relevant since the scope for expansion is constrained by the ceiling levels
of SBPE savings and FGTS contributions. Specific obiective (c), implementing a housing
subsidy system for the poor, is highly relevant because of the Government?s efforts to
promote the use of more efficient and transparent up-front subsidies. Specific obiective (d);
reducing the cost of formal land development through better land legislation and property
registration, is modestly relevant, since it overlooks the main causes of the high costs in
Brazil, namely the inadequate delivery of infrastructure, the urban land ownership patterns,
and inflexible urban planning, building regulations and land use zoning.

2.3      At the same time, however, the Program Document (PD) is more modest and realistic
about the scope and aim of the Operation itself, consigning reform within it to the
SBPE/FGTS system only: ?to support policy and micro-institutional reforms in the SBPE and
FGTS systems to promote the development of a more integrated housing finance system?
(PD p. 20). But does the SBPE/FGTS system itself not constitute a straightjacket that housing
finance in Brazil has to reform its way out of, to expand and provide housing opportunities
for more Brazilians? The Government certainly seems to think so. The PD reported the
Government?s commitment to such reform thus: ?The Government?s explicit policy agenda
is to create a liquid and efficient integrated formal housing market based on private capital-
markets is a clear departure from a history of directed credit and market segmentation?. This
Operation cannot be expected to bring about such reform by itself. It is likely to occur only
over the medium to long-term as Brazil?s financial markets acquire competitive interest rates
at levels of comparator countries. But in the short-run, the Operation could have started a
dialogue on what genuine reforms would mean for the operation of the real housing sector in

l 1 With financing through the federal budget R$14 billion), plus SBPE and FGTS funding, Minha Casu, Minha
 Vida originally planned to build one million houses by 20 10, especially for lower and middle-income families
earning less than ten minimum salaries--currently worth R$5,100 (US$2,800) per month-that includes all
households up to the 90? percentile of the income distribution. At this writing, some 380,000 units had been
financed, with an additional 800,000 applications for financing under review. To finance these house
purchasers, CEF would make available and administer thirty-year mortgage loans at 5.0 - 8.5 percent interest
per annum. In the run-up to Brazil?s general elections in the fall of 2010, the Minha Casu, Minha Vida program
target has been extended to provide two million more units by 2014, involving investments of R$71.7 billion.

RELEVANCE DESIGN
       OF

2.4     The original two-DPL series design was substantially relevant for offering an
opportunity for further policy dialogue and engagement through the preparation of a second
loan. In identifying 35 prior actions (details Box 3) the first loan plus 33 more for the
proposed follow-on Operation-I1 (details Annex B), the Operation reviewed here, may have
diluted policy attention from fewer most important key actions whose continued evolution
most needed monitoring. The Government chose not to continue with the Operation-11,
however, on finding itself much stronger fiscally, and no longer in need of a second Bank
loan. The Government's decision to continue pursuing housing sector reform without
Operation-I1 means that that operation's prior actions, that were an integral part of the design
of the first Operation, were no longer relevant to the Borrower's priorities.

2.5    Within three of the four areas focused by the objectives of the Operation, namely
housing policy, finance and subsidies, several of the prior actions identified, if continued,
could help lead to the changes sought. Of particular note were: preparation of a national
housing policy; actions to modernize SBPE/FGTS by using trust deeds; regulations to
accelerate mortgage loan origination; and up-front subsidies for low-income house buyers.

2.6     The Operation design for the fourth area, aimed at lowering the costs of formal urban
land development, invoked few actions relevant to meeting this objective. The principal
focus upon regularizing land tenure and registration in existing informal settlements,
principallyfavelas, had little relevance to the development of new urban land, the lack of
which is one of the principal causes of the expansion offavelas themselves. For this lack of
relevance, IEG mission interlocutors in Brasilia noted that this fourth area of urban land
supply was not a Government priority, having been included in the Operation at the Bank's
insistence. To lower the costs of urban land development, the Operation should have focused
more upon actions to remove bottlenecks to urban infrastructure provision, such as
inadequate supply capacity, outdated urban plans, and restrictive land use and building codes.

2.7      On the design of the DPL instrument itself, the IEG mission heard diverse opinions in
Brasilia. Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials found the absence of an investment loan's
conditionalities gave more local ownership of an operation. On the other hand, officials of
MOC and CEF-agencies that did not receive Operation funding as anticipated in a DPL of
this kind-were less enthusiastic. They had to carry forward the prior actions at considerable
cost to themselves without any financial reimbursement from the operation-as intended by
the Operation design, of course. MOC did not make much use of funding available through
                                                                )
the parallel Housing Sector Technical Assistance Loan (Ln7338, however. But most agreed
that a DPL, like the housing operation reviewed here, had the convening power to bring
different stakeholders to the table; MOF, MOC, CEF and even BACEN in this case. Thus,
this Operation did assign the Bank the role of honest broker among different and sometimes
competing interests.

2.8     The relevance of a common Operation design that has an accompanying technical
assistance project is substantial, as it would support Borrower actions to take the prior actions
forward toward meeting the relevant objectives. In this case, it included the Brazil: Housing
Sector Technical Assistance Project (HTAP) (Ln7338) under which a Bank loan of US$4.0
                                                        8


million would finance 15 technical assistance and study activities across the four Operation
areas. At this writing 67.5 percent of the HTAP loan has been cancelled and only 8.3 percent
disbursed. Planned for implementation over the 2005-2009 period, the closing date has been
extended to December 20 10 (from the original September 2009 date). While its ex-post
evaluation is premature at this time, it is already clear that HTAP will be barely implemented
and will contribute very little to the results of the Operation.l5 The negative impact upon the
Operation results of it not being implemented is testimony to its importance as part of the
overall design. A particular loss was the Operation's M&E (discussed in the next section).



 3. Implementation
3.1     Brazil's sound macro-economy during project implementation provided a positive
backdrop to the performance of the Operation (Table 3.1). GDP growth remained significant
and accelerated after Operation completion-until the 2008 global financial crisis-perhaps
contributing to the Government's reluctance to continue with Operation-11. Inflation fell over
the period, as did interest rates-that increased the demand for SBPEIFGTS mortgages
(Table 4.1). But interest rates did not approach normal international levels needed to augur
the Brazil's much-awaited free market in housing finance (see also Table 1.1). Government
expenditures during this period remained relatively stable, as a percentage of GDP.

 3.2     MOC and CEF, as the main executing agencies, implemented most of the Operation
 by taking the agreed prior actions forward. How far forward will be assessed in the following
 chapter of this report.

 3.3     But the Government did not wish to pursue the follow-on project further. From what
 the IEG mission learned in Brasilia, the ICR was correct in concluding that: "Government
 did not require a fast disbursing loan at this time due to its improved fiscal stance" and "did

not need to borrow for budget support" (ICR p. 13 and p. 16). While understandable from the
data available, this turn of events raises an important concern about the vulnerability of the
Bank's longer-term sector policy lending to the volatility of short-term shifts in fiscal
performance unrelated to the performance and needs of target sector.

MONITORING EVALUATION
        AND        (M&E)
3.4    M&E is rated negligible. M&E was not a key part of the Operation design itself. The
PD treatment of M&E was covered in one paragraph (para. 5.26) and a three-page Annex 8
of a 105 page report. The PD therefore provides few details of baseline or target values of
performance indicators. It does not indicate who should collect the M&E data and how.16
M&E for the Operation was left to HTAP that, barely implemented thus far, did not deliver
the M&E hoped for.

3.5     Thus M&E performance under this operation is widely recognized in both the Bank
(ICR p. 13) and the Government as having been inadequate-a finding endorsed by IEG.
This was a serious shortcoming for an operation with a total of 88 prior actions identified.
Thirty-three of these were for the planned follow-on Operation-11. Of these, 19 were
earmarked as triggers for disbursement. The main reason given for this failure was that
HTAP was not implemented.

3.6     How can such a failure be avoided in the future? One answer may be to ensure that all
lending operations incorporate M&E fully as a key element of their own designs. Trusting to
the vagaries of a parallel activity, even a TA operation firmly linked to the Operation as this
was, poses too high a risk. M&E will fail if its host parallel operation is not implemented.
Another important question is what to do after a failure like this has occurred? IEG learned
that MOC is actively engaged in developing a broader M&E system to measure progress in
improving housing conditions and in moves toward sector reform in Brazil. Clearly this is no
easy task, especially given the vast scale and diversity of the housing sector in the country.
Thus, MOC's efforts are still work-in-progress at this writing, leaving the Operation still
without effective M&E. The lack of M&E implementation and utilization leaves notable
gaps: a lack of evidence of housing finance's down-market moves, and little data on the cost
of developing urban land and evidence of the cost reduction intended.

16
  As the ICR noted: "Given that no specific organization was clearly designated as responsible for monitoring
and evaluation of the performance indicators for the DPL, no coordinated effort was made to consolidate the
necessary information from the different agencies or to use these indicators to inform decision-making and
resource allocation." (ICR p. 15).
                                               10


housing sector operated. Given the large scale, diversity and complexity of Brazil's housing
sector with many different forces acting upon it, it may be impossible to unequivocally
attribute observed outcomes directly to the single tranche Operation reviewed here, as the
ICR correctly recognizes (ICR p. 22). With the caveats of unclear attribution and mixed
results obtained, the results points to a positive impact of the Operation on the functioning of
Brazil's housing sector, likely bringing some additional benefits to the poor.

4.2     Improved housing access by the poor is consistent with the 6.4 percent decline of
Brazil's housing deficit between 2004 and 2007. As noted earlier in this report, the poor
suffer disproportionately from this deficit. On the other hand, evidence that the poor directly
benefited from the expansion of mortgage lending during this period is weak, as is a
convincing demonstration that housing finance moved own-market. While these sector
changes were occurring, the Government maintained fiscal discipline as the Operation
promised it would. The Government's primary surplus was sustained at around 4.0 percent
throughout this period and Government debt service (as a percentage of exports) fell from
23.8 percent in 2003 to 10.7 percent in 2007-the latest World Development Indicators
figure. The performance and outcomes in each of the four Operation areas are mixed too, as
the following sections show.

                    POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
STRENGTHENING HOUSING

4.3     Substantial efficacy: At this writing work is under way on the dissemination of
PZanHab, the National Housing Plan, a key prior action for strengthening housing policy that
was identified by the Operation. Today, thanks to its central stage in Brazil's main stimulus
and development programs, the Minha Casu, Minha Vida and PAC, housing in Brazil
probably enjoys its highest policy profile since the creation of the SBPEFGTS system nearly
a half-century ago. But the adoption of these mega-programs cannot be directly attributed to
the housing Operation reviewed here. In terms of policy, it is as if housing has outgrown its
own sectoral bounds.

4.4      As far as developing a sound institutional framework for housing and urban
development is concerned, an important achievement is the consolidation of MOC itself and
its Housing Secretariat. Prior to MOC, housing and urban development policy and its
institutions were volatile and fractured in Brazil. Several institution set-ups came and went.
For instance, a Ministry of Urban Development and Environment was created in 1985,
transformed into a Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and Environment in 1987, and
changed once again to become a Ministry of Housing and Social Welfare, which was made
extinct in 1989. Prior to 1985 and after 1989, the Government's housing and urban
development policy responsibility was carried by the Ministry of the Interior. In 1995, the
responsibility shifted to the Ministry of Planning, until the creation of the present Ministry of
Cities itself in 2003. This stimulated the Operation, which was correctly anchored to the
creation of MOC, a positive move for the sector. Since then, MOC has established itself as
the Government's principal housing sector interlocutor. At this writing, however, as Brazil
prepares for general elections in November 2010, MOC's policymaking role is being
challenged by the President's Minha Casu, Minha Vida initiative, a challenge that might
lessen after the election.

4.5     Even the bold Minha Casu, Minha Vida program relies upon the legacy Housing
Finance System institutional framework, entrusting its implementation to the Caixa
EconBmica Federal (CEF), the Government's principal saving and loan bank, particularly
through FGTS. In the short-term, there is no alternative arrangement, and the Government
was pragmatic and realistic about this (as was the Operation tool7). Recent reports in Brazil's
financial press point to deep reform of Housing Finance System likely to begin after 20 13
when the Housing Finance System is projected to mobilize insufficient resources for the very
high levels of demand for housing and housing finance expected.'* So the Operation too
relied on a Housing Finance System framework whose principal elements had been in place
for nearly 50 years. Its bedrock agency today, the CEF, has been in the savings and lending
business since 1931. Some IEG mission interlocutors, both in government and in private
banking, consider CEF to be the de facto lead agency of low-income housing policy
formulation too. It was so during the sector's state of institutional flux during the 1980s and
1 9 9 0 and it remains so today as implementing agency of Minha Casu, Minha Vida, the
        ~~
Government's largest investment program.

4.6      One specific Operation-supported institution building effort prospers little in today's
Minha Casu, Minha Vida environment. The creation of the National Fund of Social Housing
(FNHIS) in 2005 was cited as a key prior action by the Operation. Managed by CEF as its
agente operador, or operating agency, and expanding to R$0.9 billion commitments for
housing and infrastructure projects for 2009, FNHIS was a new element in housing's
institutional framework, but demand at the municipal level, its mainstay, did not take off as
much as expected. Being funded by the federal budget meant that unused funds had to be
returned at the end of the fiscal year, according to Brazil's budget law. For these reasons,
FNHIS was integrated into the PAC and Minha Casu, Minha Vida sought off-budget funding
through FGTS in particular.

                    CREDIT AND SAVINGS, MOVING DOWN-MARKET
STRENGTHENING HOUSING                        IT

4.7     Substantial efficacy: By 2009, housing finance through Housing Finance System in
Brazil expanded in real terms more than six-fold since before the Operation in 2004, while
number of housing units financed grew at half the rate (Table 4.1). This difference is
reflected in the average Housing Finance System mortgage loan size that nearly doubled in
real terms from R$37,334 in 2004 (in R$ of 2009) to R$71,786 in 2009. SBPE loans
expanded most, thanks to increased savings in an economy growing at 5 percent per annum,
and banks' statutory requirement to apply 65 percent of new saving to housing finance.
FGTS loans grew at only half the rate despite Government efforts, supported by the
Operation, to allow banks other than CEF access to FGTS funds. For SBPE lending,

  The Housing DPL PD did, however, refer to the gradual phasing out of the SBPE directed credit system, but
only "When interest rates normalize and converge and the secondary market for mortgage {SIC] is fully
consolidated." (PD p. 20). But, as noted earlier, the DPL did not bring specific proposals to the table about this.

BACEN data shows how the total outstanding mortgage debt increased during 2004-2008,
although by less than the reported increased lending would lead one to expect. SBPE's
outstanding mortgage debt as a share of the stock of savings increased from 18.5 percent to
25.7 percent over the period, indicating a more intensive use of savings for mortgage lending
purposes. A positive sign of housing sector development, given the supply-side constraints, is
the rapid increase of outstanding construction loans. These nearly quadrupled between 2004
and 2009. Finally, it is worth noting that the relative constancy of private banks' share of
outstanding mortgage debt points to business as usual in the Housing Finance System.
Private funding of housing finance will only take off toward its potential after interest rates in
Brazil's financial markets are normalized, prompting the inevitable deep sector reform.

4.8     The remainder of this section looks at some outcomes related to the strength of
Brazil's housing finance system today, the market shift up or down, and whether they can be
attributed to the Operation.

4.9    Housing finance has far to expand in Brazil: Measured by both the award of new
loans and the total debt outstanding, mortgage lending expanded significantly in Brazil. It
                                                   13


represents an improvement, albeit within the confines of the existing Housing Finance
System. The biggest gains were in 2008 and 2009, mostly through additional CEF lending.
Outstanding mortgage debt increased by 46 percent in real terms over the 2004-2009 period,
while GDP growth itself accumulated 26 percent. Although large in absolute terms because
of the size of the country, mortgage debt in Brazil is still relatively small for the scale of its
economy as noted earlier in this report (para. 1.6). IEG learned from bankers in S?io Paulo
that to expand beyond the present 2-4 percent of GDP niche in which it finds itself, housing
finance in Brazil will most likely expand, as in most advanced countries, through increases of
unshackled private funding. More private funding would be driven by a growing economy
and the normalization of Brazil's interest rate regime, developments that could lead housing
finance beyond the Housing Finance System straightjacket in the medium to long-term. The
expanded housing finance market sought by the Operation would require, as a counterpoint,
strengthening the supply lines of housing itself through better infrastructure and greater
participation of more agile private developers and builders. All these, it should be stressed,
would be the consequences of deep housing sector reform outside the SBPE/FGTS duo,
something beyond the scope the Operation reviewed here.

4.10 There has been some growth, nevertheless: Improvements on the demand side, on
the other hand, have helped expansion of housing finance. First, nearly 50 percent more
savings in real terms during 2004-2009 has likely helped make more households into
potential home buyers eligible for mortgage loans. But this effect is also the result of a
buoyant macro-economy over this period. A second improvement that bolstered the quantity
and quality of demand for mortgage lending, the widespread use of the alienaq6oJiduciciria
(trust deed) instrument as mortgage lien, is directly related to the Operation. First introduced
through Law 9,54 1 of 1997, the trust deed was put to more widespread use after being
identified as a key prior action by the Operation. It was a lot more attractive to lenders than
the conventional mortgage instrument-called a hipoteca in Brazil-which is slow and
difficult to execute through the courts in cases of loan repayment default. An important legal
difference is that the trust deed withholds full ownership until the loan is fully repaid, making
its execution in a court of law more agile. Delinquencies (when repayments are more than
three months late) on loans backed by trust deeds were only 1.2 percent in 2009, compared
with 33.1 percent for loans backed by mortgages. Greater use of trust deeds he1 ed reduce
SBPE delinquency in general from 9.7 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent in 2009. I?

4.1 1 Securitization: Strengthening housing finance through mortgage-backed securities
by consolidating secondary mortgage markets has had mixed results thus far in Brazil. The
legal framework is in place. Laws 11,033/04 and 11,053/04 recognizing institutions entitled
to carry 'out this business and affording them income tax breaks on the transaction were key
prior actions for the Operation. From this, businesses have been established, especially in Silo
Paulo, to launch securities on the market backed by real estate loans for residential and
commercial property. From visits to two operators in this market, the IEG mission could see
that they were well prepared and equipped to conduct this business. Their deals were
typically in the R$4.5 million to R$470 million range and they demonstrated the
professionalism and technical know-how for the job. Pension funds and other institutional

                                                             14


    investors were the typical buyers. This secondary market's performance has lapsed at this
    time, however. After being laggard since 1997 when it was created, the market picked up in
    2005 through the sales of these securities called CertiJicados de Recebiveis Imobilidrios in
    Brazil. Sales peaked in 2008 to R$4.9 billion (US$2.7 billion) but fell thereafter to a trickle at
    this writing in the wake of the international financial crisis.20Just R$0.4 billion-worth was
    auctioned in the first two months of 2010. Brazil's level of financing through secondary
    mortgage markets is about half Mexico's, the region's leader. Thus, securitization in Brazil
    mobilizes only a small share of what is still only a small market lodged within the
    SBPE/FGTS constraints. FGTS regulations themselves prohibit the securitization of
    mortgage loans that it funds. Banks are required to hold FGTS-funded mortgage loans on
    their balance sheets. With the fall-out of the sub-prime crisis, more countries are following
    suit, as the risks involved in a mortgage originator bundling and selling poor quality loans to
    others have become more evident.

    4.12 The IEG mission learned from two firms that had auctioned mortgage-backed
    securities in Silo Paul0 in recent years that the scale of the deals was relatively small, but well
    received in the market for their A+ or higher credit ratings. Most of the mortgages bundled
    into the securities were for higher income borrowers, considered lower risk in Brazil's
I
    financial markets. Both reported that securitization had become easier with the
    standardization of mortgage loan documentation that the Operation supported. This made it
    simpler to identify the components of the bundle and remove the most risky ones from it.

    4.13 Little evidence of down-market shift: Evidence of the down-market move of
    housing finance, intended by the Operation, is elusive2'. For both SBPE, and more sharply
    for FGTS, average loan size increased in real terms during 2004-2009 (Table 4.1). But, by
    themselves, the mean values do not describe the distribution of loan sizes. IEG sought data
    on the number of loans and amount lent per cohort of loan size, but was unable to obtain it.
    Without such data, evaluation findings must remain tentative. But, significantly rising
    average loan sizes make housing finance less affordable to households at least across some if
    not all ranges of the income distribution. If it less affordable in the lower income part, then
    housing finance would have moved up-market. Even without knowing the distribution, we
    can conclude that larger loan sizes are not compatible with an increasing share of total
    lending going to lower income households. Out of concern for a possible drift of lending
    away from lower-income borrowers, Resolution 3347/06 of the National Monetary Council
    introduced a system of weights that made it easier for lending banks to meet the minimum
    requirement of 65 percent of savings going to housing, by doing more SBPE lending to lower
    income borrowers. On the FGTS side, the ICR reports that a falling share of lending-from

    2o Beyond Brazil, securitization of mortgages is undergoing a thorough review worldwide, and it is unclear at
    this time, how the fiture of mortgage-backed securities will unfold. As recent research has shown (Renaud
    2007), securitization propagated high-risk sub-prime lending in the US, now widely regarded as the trigger, if
    not cause, of the global financial crisis. At this writing, investors are looking warily at such securities, now seen
    as bundles of mortgage loans harboring much more risk that previously imagined. Also US sub-prime lending
    is, in practice, suspended.
    21 Incomments on this PPAR, CEF regards the growth of housing finance through FGTS itself as being
    evidence of lending to low-income families. IEG sees the need for additional evidence, such as an increasing
    share of all FGTS lending going to low-income families over time.
                                                       15


85.6 percent in 2006 to 71 -4percent in 2008-went to households earning five minimum
salaries or less (ICR p. 19). More recent data cited by the Government in its comments on
this report point to a modest increase in the share of all FGTS mortgage contracts going to
families earning three minimum salaries or less from 25 percent to 28 percent between 2008
and 2009. Without knowing the distribution of all lending by average loan size across all
market segments (FGTS, Minha Casu, Minha Vida and others) and knowing how this has
changed over time, the limited evidence available does not directly support the ICR's finding
of "improved targeting to low-income borrowers" (ICR p. 12).2223

4.14 Private sector finance has still to take off: Behind several Operation prior actions,
such as Monetary Council Resolutions and SBPE Regulations (details Box 3), is the
expectation of greater private sector participation in housing finance in Brazil. Actual results
achieved have been modest. One (private) banker in Silo Paul0 even complained about state
banks recently buying up small private banks in Brazil. As noted earlier in this report, private
lenders' share of outstanding SBPE mortgage loans increased very little over the 2004-2008
period from 41.8 percent of the total to 43.6 percent. At this writing, CEF alone is still
responsible for 79 percent of all new mortgage loans awarded. CEF's position on FGTS
funding is still more dominant, accounting for 98.3 percent of all FGTS loans in 2004, and
96.9 percent in 2008. As well as operator, CEF is also guarantor of the FGTS, giving the
appearance of a conflict of interest in CEF's role of screening other lenders' access to FGTS.
Why should CEF take the extra risk of allowing others to use FGTS funding, when CEF
would be ultimately responsible in case of another lender's default? The IEG mission found
officials of CEF and the FGTS Conselho Curador (Governing Council) open and willing for
private and other state banks to participate, even if some officials were concerned about
private banks making excessive profits out of FGTS. Representatives of these banks told IEG
that they found CEF's protracted processing and tight spreads offering little profit constituted
a bureaucratic firewall that prevented banks other than CEF from participating on a
significant scale. Some even proposed that what they called the "hellish" bureaucracy
surrounding mortgage loan origination through FGTS was designed to keep non-CEF lenders
out of the FGTS game. MOC, CEF and FGTS officials reminded the IEG mission that
official policy was to make FGTS funding accessible to all interested banks.24

4.15 The interest rate trap: The demand for mortgage lending in Brazil during 2004-
2008 was spurred by rising incomes through economic growth and declining interest rates

22Using data of the allocation of FGTS subsidies by salary level of beneficiaries, as the ICR does (ICR p. vi) as
evidence of moving housing finance down-market is not convincing. Subsidies are more accurately interpreted
as measures to correct for market distortions or to redistribute market allocations for policy reasons. Convincing
evidence of a down-market shift of housing finance would include time series data showing an increasing share
of the volume of all housing finance going to lower income borrowers over the period of the project. IEG
requested such data or its proxy (e.g. housing lending going to small loans affordable by low-income
borrowers), but was unable to obtain any.
23 Government comments on this PPAR (reproduced in Annex C), reported, specifically for the Minha Casu,
Minha Vida program at the national level, an increase in the share of all mortgage contracts going to families
with less than six minimum salaries from 67 percent to 92 percent between 2008 and 2009, and a reduction
from 24 percent to 5 percent for those families with more than six minimum salaries.
24 Furthermore, in comments on this PPAR, CEF listed the measures that CEF has taken to facilitate private
abnks' access to FGTS (Annex C)
                                                       16


(Tables 1.1, 3.1 and 4.1). Despite the fall, interest rates in Brazil still remain extraordinarily
high, and the interest rate regime unreformed. This has meant that, at this writing, "normal"
market-driven solutions for housing finance cannot prosper, and only the "exceptional"
Housing Finance System can still fund mortgage lending on a large-scale. Even this falls far
short of Brazil's potential and the levels already achieved by comparator countries, as noted
earlier in this report. The Operation design did recognize the constraints posed by Brazil's
high interest rate regime: "Continued high interest rates will hamper the expected
development of the housing finance market and housing subsidies will remain necessary in
the medium-term." (PD p. ii). Indeed, unsubsidized mortgage loans in Brazil's current system
are not feasible and would be affordable only by households in the top percentiles of the
income distribution-and, even then, only if such households felt them to be worthwhile. In
practice, very few high interest loans are offered because there are so few takers in the
market. Realistically, the Operation recognized that "the full deregulation of the current
government-directed housing finance system" will not happen in the short-run (PD p.2), and
that "Sustainable lower interest rates depend on a further remaining structural reform
agenda" (PD p. 5).25

4.16 The outlook for housing finance in Brazil: Brazil's housing finance system has the
potential to become much larger and stronger, as well as move down-market, but maybe not
much in the short run. Comprehensive housing sector reform is likely to follow the
normalization of the financial system as a whole, which would take interest rates in Brazil
down to levels of comparator markets. Mortgage financing could easily quadruple in a
scenario of private sector lenders moving in with resources mobilized on efficient financial
markets-an enormous increase, but one only bringing Brazil into line with comparator
countries. But there are supply-side constraints in the real housing market for such a scenario.
The Operation PD itself noted that formal developers and builders provided only 250,000
units in 2003, just one quarter of the supply needed to house Brazil's one million additional
households that year (PD p. 7). Still such rapid growth would have to be calibrated with
expansion of the real housing economy. Supply-side constraints in particular would have to
be overcome through expansion of the developer/construction industry, and the improvement
of municipal urban planning, land use and building regulations.

4.17 If extra housing finance boosting demand is not met by additional housin supply, it
can stimulate a bubble of rising house prices, as current developments in Brazil2 Fand
experiences elsewhere have shown. The recent experience of Spain, a country with a more
open financial system than Brazil's and with a strong construction sector, provides a striking
counterpoint. Even with an agile supply-side response between 1996 and 2006 when annual

25While in Brazil, the IEG mission inquired of participants of nearly all meetings why interest rates remained so
high. An common reaction was to note that, by historical standards, they are not so high. Thus, only fifteen
years ago, at a time of high inflation and recent government default on debt, people remember interest rates that
were three times higher than what they are today.
26 A recent press report informed that MCMV has heated up local real estate markets, doubling the price of units
for "low-income" households that were in the R$40K to R$50K range to more than twice that level over a
period of twelve months in the region of the capital Brasilia (Correio Braxiliense April 4,2010). Early 20 10
residential real estate prices in Sao Paul0 were reported to be 50 percent higher than twelve months earlier in
2009, and actual sales have increased 25 percent, pointing to a market overheated by the greater supply of
financing (Diario Comercio, Industria e Serviqos April 13,20 10).
                                              17


construction output in Spain increased from 200,000 units to 600,000 units, real house prices
still rose 170 percent in that country. Housing finance accelerated far ahead of house
building. Rising prices helped take residential construction from 4 percent of GDP in 1995 to
more than 8 percent by 2006. Affordability-measured by the ratio of house prices to
household income-was badly hit as it rose from 2.8 to 5.5 over the same period. Rising
house prices hit low-income households particularly hard, excluding many of them from the
home-owners' market altogether (Kim 2009). There may be lessons for Brazil about
calibrating the expansion of housing's financial and real sectors in the context of housing
sector reform.

                                       SUBSIDY SYSTEM FOR THE POOR
DESIGNING IMPLEMENTING A UNIFIED HOUSING
        AND

4.18 Modest efficacy: As part of its preparation of the National Housing Plan, MOC is
working on preparing a national housing subsidy policy. The work is broad-based,
encompassing direct up-front subsidies to be awarded by the Federal Government through
Minha Casu, Minha Vida, for instance, existing below-market interest rate subsidies through
SBPE and FGTS, and indirect subsidies of income tax deductions on mortgage interest
payments. By a large margin, most housing subsidies in Brazil are provided through the
below-market interest of the Housing Finance System mortgage financing, since interest
charged on SBPE and FGTS loans is much lower than it would be if determined by the
parameters of Brazil high interest regime.

4.19 Among these subsidies, the Operation focused upon consolidating and rationalizing
them. This included strengthening the Programa de Subsidios a Habita@o de Interesse
Social (PSH - Subsidy Program for Social Housing) by ensuring that its budgetary resources
continued to be made available. It also meant adding up-front subsidies to (the already
subsidized) FGTS. Originally established in 2001 as a pilot program, PSH was retained as a
permanent instrument for providing up-front housing subsidies for the construction of social
housing through Laws 10,008/04 and 10.998/04. Both laws left it for the implementing
agency, the CEF in this case, to decide which target income groups would benefit at the time
of implementation. At this time, an autonomous PSH has lost momentum, having disbursed
nothing since November 2009,27having been incorporated into Minha Casu, Minha Vida.
Another reason for its slow-down may have been the feeble take-up by states and
municipalities and by private operators. The IEG mission heard complaints about PSH's
excessive bureaucracy, in much the same vein as criticisms of FGTS processing. Smaller and
under-capitalized developers and builders were more willing to bid for PSH funds in auction
in order to get a foot into the market, but were often unable to mobilize their own counterpart
funding needed to complete the deal which would then fall through. Despite not having
taken off, the PSH experience served to stimulate a long-overdue discussion in Brazil about
up-front housing subsidies. Results having fallen short of achieving a unified subsidy system
for the poor.

4.20 FGTS , with its below-market interest rates, already embodies a significant housing
subsidy driven by the state. Even so, direct up-front subsidies were added to the FGTS
package for the first time after the Operation. According to the ICR, 70,000 FGTS borrowers
received R$380 million in 2008, equivalent to R$5,430 per household. Using up-front
subsidies in FGTS for the first time was an important program innovation, albeit introducing
a double subsidy for one borrower; the lump sum and below-market interest.

4.21 Reading the ICR (p. 12) that: "Housing subsidies in Brazil had traditionally been
embedded in below-market interest rates inherent in the FGTS system and to a lesser extent
in the SBPE system" might leave a false impression that such below-market interest rate
subsidies are a thing of the past. But that is not the case. Nor is there evidence to support the
PD finding that there had been "a clear shift away from implicit interest subsidies" (PD p.
iii). On the contrary, at this writing, up-front subsidies are very far from replacing the below-
market-interest-rate-subsidy, the mainstay of FGTS and SBPE.

                          LAND
REDUCING THE COST OF FORMAL   DEVELOPMENT"

4.22 Negligible efficacy: IEG found little evidence of lower costs of urban land delivery
sought by the Operation. Meaningful and comparable data about the real costs of formally
developing urban land across and within different cities in Brazil is not generally available.
Even if current data is obtained, it will be impossible to establish whether costs have risen or
fallen over time without baselines for generally accepted indicators. IEG cannot therefore
report a satisfactory Operation outcome in this area.

4.23 As noted earlier in this report, the Operation fell short in identifying prior actions that
might have best led to the desired outcome. The Operation focus upon the regularization of
land tenure in existing informal settlements, such asfavelas, relied upon a prior action
unlikely to lead to the desired outcome of lower costs for the provision of additional urban
land. Even so, it is important to recognize important MOC work in this area that has obtained
good results thus far, even if it did not directly contribute to the desired Operation outcome.

4.24 With the help of the Cities Alliance MOC has, since 2006, produced a number of very
useful documents on land title regularization. They include summaries of and guides to
model practices, to be emulated, that involve municipal administrations and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) across the country. In particular, they highlight how to
make the role of notaries public, called cartdrios in Brazil, more effective. IEG learned of
successful examples in the northern State of Para and in Siio Paulo too. A field visit by the
IEG mission to Siio Paulo revealed how far title registration can now be done directly by the
interested party on the Internet. To inform legal opinion, MOC has prepared texts of the laws
and regulations governing title regularization, as well as references to case law. To make the
topic more accessible by the most interested party, the resident head of household, MOC
designed and produced well-illustrated manuals using readily understood and simple
language. Finally, with an eye upon the international dissemination of these experiences,

28 This PPAR understands formal land development, to be the process of subdivision and the introduction of
urban services and infrastructure to provide additional urbanized land that is ripe for urban development, in this
case for housing.
                                               19


some of the documents have been prepared in English. All this work makes clear that title
regularization is not an easy task. It should be made easier once the draft Law of Territorial
Responsibility is approved by Congress where it is still currently under discussion, as it has
been for these past several years. This work also makes clear the need to modernize Law
6766 of 1979 that still provides the legal framework for land and property registration in
Brazil.

5. Ratings
OUTCOME

5.1     Rated: Moderately Satisfactory. The project achieved its relevant objectives of
improving the access of the poor to better quality housing with some moderate shortcomings;
the weakness of evidence of a downward shift in the housing finance market, little lasting
impact upon subsidies, and no evidence of lower costs of urban land delivery. "Housing
Sector Reform" was in the title of the Operation (but not in the formulation of its objectives)
but deep sector reform will likely be for the medium to long-term, and has barely begun. In
the meantime, the Operation supported useful improvements within the existing Housing
Finance System-incentives for financing ore lower income housing, use of the trust deed as
a property lien, and tighter regulation of housing credit institutions, for instance-aming
this operation a positive outcome rating, but did not take even preliminary steps for
reorganizing the half-century old Housing Finance System, an inevitable step for Brazil to
achieve the comprehensive housing reform that it seeks and needs.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT
                 OUTCOME

5.2     Rated: Moderate. The Government's commitment to ongoing changes in the existing
Housing Finance System and its reform in the medium to long-term is not likely to waver.
The enormous potential for expanding Brazil's housing finance beyond the present straight-
jacketed housing market and improving the quality of the housing stock for poor households
is there. The deep reform of housing finance will be unavoidable once Brazil's financial
markets and interest rate regime normalize. But without proper preparation on the real supply
and demand sides of the housing market, which the Operation addressed little, an explosion
of housing finance would lead to soaring property prices and a real estate bubble. An over-
heated property market risks undermining the gains made thus far with the support of the
Operation.

BANKPERFORMANCE

5.3     Preparation and quality-at-entry: rated Moderately Satisfactory. Project
preparation was thorough, except for M&E that was assigned to the parallel Technical
Assistance operation that was not fully implemented and given cursory treatment by the
Operation design. Project design had realistic expectations of what might be achieved
through the operation. But entitling the operation as "Housing Sector Reform" was, perhaps,
an overstatement of what it set out to achieve. To help bring about improvements to the
existing Housing Finance System, the Operation design focused upon supporting actions that
would help bring about needed changes. A weak part of the design was the Operation's
                                               20


inclusion of land tenure regularization, a worthy topic but not one that, by itself, could lower
the costs of new urban land delivery as the operation boldly intended.

5.4    Supervision: not rated. For a single tranche DPL such as this, there was no formal
supervision. Although the ICR reported 14 staff weeks (US$18 1,930) spent on supervision,
this was, in fact, for the preparation effort of the Operation-I1 that did not come to fruition.
As has become normal DPL practice, Bank supervision missions were not fielded primarily
to monitor and report on implementation progress. Instead, ostensible Bank supervision
missions worked on the preparation of the expected follow-on Operation-11, whose 33 prior
actions were already identified in the PD of the (first) Operation, the operation reviewed
here.

5.5       Overall Bank Performance: rated Moderately Satisfactory

       PERFORMANCE
BORROWER
5.6     Government: rated Satisfactory. The Government, through MOF and h OC initia
demonstrated strong ownership of the Operation. Their commitment to improving the
Housing Finance System was strengthened as housing took a prominent role in Government
development and stimulus programs, particularly the PAC and Minha Casu, Minha Vida.
But, with stronger fiscal revenues than expected, the Government had less need of the loan
funds offered by the Bank and decided not to request the follow-on Operation-I1 that had
been factored into the design of the first operation. With this decision, the Government
continued to pursue its path toward housing sector reform, but without the support of a
second Operation. As a result the GovernmentBank housing sector dialogue diminished.

5.7    Implementing Agency: rated Satisfactory. In several respects MOF and MOC were
implementing agencies for the operation, and, as such, they performed proactively, carrying
forward selected prior actions that were deemed to be taking the operation toward a
successful outcome. As noted earlier in this report, the achievements in the case of MOC
especially should not be underestimated. Under the Operation, MOC had to undertake many
actions at its own cost for which there was not direct reimbursement through the Operation,
ofcourse. `

5.8       Overall Borrower Performance: rated Satisfactory


6 . Lessons
      0   When deep sector reform is sought by Government and warranted by the challenges
          posed by existing constraints, Bank operational support should realistically address
          such reform, initially through scenarios that cover the necessary reform steps and
          timelines. At the same time Bank assistance can and should continue to support
          improvement and strengthening of the existing Housing Finance System
          arrangements as this Operation did. But calling such interim support "sector reform"
          can mistakenly convey the idea that deep reform is already under way, when much
          still needs to be done just to get the process started.
                                               21


    0   Strengthening housing finance is an important sectoral goal, but it should be pursued
        alongside efforts to overcome bottlenecks in real housing supply and demand that, if
        not overcome, may lead to a surge in property prices, creating a real estate bubble and
        collapse-as experience elsewhere has shown.

    0   M&E should be an integral part of the operation it is monitoring. Establishing a new
        M&E system or consolidating an existing one should be a key prior action for a DPL,
        and trigger for subsequent operations or tranches. Consigning M&E to another
        operation (such as a parallel TA Project in this case) diminishes M&E?s importance,
        and increases the risk of a total loss of it if the host operation fails.

    0    Particularly for a sector like housing, that tends to assume a sui generis form in each
        country, Bank assistance to try to bring an innovative outsider?s perspective upon the
?
        country housing sector problems. Bank value-added for its clients comes through
        offering different advice from local expert opinion and knowledge that exists in
        abundance, especially in a middle-income country.

ANNEX TO OFFICIAL LETTER NO. 9612010 - SAIN/MF

Comments on the document entitled : "Project Performance Assessment Report - Brazil             -
Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform (Loan
7306)"

                                      Ministry of Cities

1. According to the above referenced document, the overall result of the project was
considered to be moderately satisfactory. The project achieved its relevant objectives with
respect to increasing the access of poorer people to housing; strengthening policies and
institutions in the sector; and the growth of resources available for housing finance.

The report considers that, while the Minha Casu, Minha Vida program itself represents an
advance, there was not a significant advance in the market for housing finance for the lowest
income households, since the growth of lending in these cohorts is limited to the FGTS and
SBPE (please see comments by CEF).

It is important to emphasize that the Federal Government increased the number of lending
operations for the low income population a lot, especially through Minha Casu, Minha Vida.
Mortgage lending in this segment, especially through FGTS resources, increased
substantially over the years.

It is appropriate to highlight that, of the R$35 billion committed to Minha Casu, Minha Vida,
R$14 billion (41 percent) was transferred from the General Federal Budget (OGU) to the
residential rental fund (FAR) aimed exclusively at families with incomes up to 3 minimum
salaries.

Minha Casu, Minha Vida implemented a significant reform in Brazil's subsidy model by
introducing fixed direct subsidies and by establishing a cut off income for access to long-
term financing, thereby promoting a significant increase in the individual amounts and also in
the total volume of resources aimed at subsidies. The total volume of resources for subsidies
was R$26 billion for house building.

The Program also innovated by promoting the blending of resources between the General
Federal Budget (OGU) and the workers' severance fund - FGTS. The greater objective of
policies to tackle the housing deficit resulted in a program design that saw resources focus
upon families with incomes up to R$1,395.00. The program also foresaw incentives for
families with incomes up to R$2,790.00.

One of the great achievements of Minha Casu, Minha Vida was the growth of loan contracts
in the income range up to 6 minimum salaries, in both the quantity of operations (absolute
and relative values) and in the unit value of loans awarded. Even discounting operations from
0-3 minimum salaries with OCU/FAR resources, 207,684 units, and taking into account only
the operations financed through FGTS, 150,500 units-loan contracts by income group in the
first year of the program up to April 2009-there was important progress compared to 2008.
                                                59


There was a significant increase at the national level, of loan contracts in the range of up to 6
minimum salaries as a share of the total, from 76 percent to 95 percent. Most of the change
occurred in the South-East region, where the country's housing deficit is greatest, from 67
percent to 92 percent.

Broken down by income group at the country level, this increase in loan contracts was from
25 percent to 37 percent for the 0 - 3 minimum salary range; an increase from 5 1 percent to
58 percent for the 3 - 6 minimum salary range; and a fall from 24 percent to 5 percent for
the range above 6 minimum salaries. The same improvement was observed in all regions of
the country, with drastic reductions for the above 6 minimum salaries range, and significant
growth for the 0 -3 range. The South region stands out in this regard. It had a 17 percentage
point increase in this range, from 20 percent to 37 percent. With caveats for the results in the
states of the North-East region where, in spite of economic growth, there is still a small
number of loan contracts financed by FGTS, especially for the 0- 3 range, partly because of
the performance of PAR in this income range. The North-East and Central-West regions
deserve closer study because of the concentration in these regions of operations for the 0 - 1
minimum salary range, through operations guaranteed by FGTS resources that cannot be
compared with conventional financing.

In the states of the North-East region that concentrate the largest deficits in the country, if we
overlook loan contracts made in 2008, the number of operations guaranteed, being grant
funded, are similar to (conventional) programs for 0 - 3 minimum salaries. From this
perspective, growth in 0 - 3 minimum salary operations was similar to that of the South
region, namely 17 percentage points, making it today the largest share serving the 0- 3 range
of 47 percent. The Center-West region was the least affected with respect to the changing
profile of loan contracts, still seeing growth from 84 percent to 96 percent in contracts up to 6
minimum salaries, albeit with a decline for the 0 - 3 range from 46 percent to 43 percent.
Nevertheless, it is important to recognize progress in this region, since it is significant for the
3 - 6 minimum salary range in which all states saw growth. DF (the Federal District) grew
from 20 percent to 62 percent, MT (Mato Grosso) from 18 percent to 54 percent; and MS
(Mato Grosso do Sul) from 48 percent to 62 percent. Growth was not negligible for the 0- 3
range if we take into account the guaranteed operations contracted in 2008 in the states of
MT and MS, where they accounted for 67 percent in that year, distorting the overall number
for that period. Leaving aside these contracts, the growth in this range was still important in
the DF from 4 percent to 14 percent, in MT from 10 percent to 40 percent and in MS from 23
percent to 32 percent.

If we consider all Minha Casu, Minha Vida Operations, including those in the 0-3 minimum
salary range, the expansion of operations in the lowest income ranges is even more evident.
Operations with individuals in the 0 - 3 range represent, in December 3 1,2009,77.6 percent
of contracts; operations in the 3 - 6 range 20.2 percent and in the range above 6 minimum
salaries, 2.2 percent. There is also a significant convergence in relation to the deficit which
demonstrated the extreme social reach of the program and its effects on the rest of FGTS
operations. Table V provides a synthesis of the relative distribution of the contracts and of
the deficit by income range.

 As far as more detailed aspects of the interventions are concerned, two considerations are
 important. The first is regarding the value of the individual loan awarded that, under new
                                                     -
 measures introduced by Minha Casa, Minha Vidu 2 , was significantly increased to an
 average of 45 percent in the subsidized range. Strongest growth occurred in the 0 - 3 range,
 in practice previously excluded from housing finance. This resulted in the 2 -3 minimum
 salary income range increasing from 13 percent of FGTS funding at the national level to 30
 percent. It some important states it was higher than 40 percent. Such increases, added to
 subsidies awarded to increase affordability, contributed significantly to the improvement of
 the product on offer and to the response to the needs of the beneficiaries. The second
 concerns precisely this product. In this aspect too, there was major progress in financing
 aimed at purchasing a new property or under construction, with agreed minimum
 specifications, while in previous years financing typically aimed instead at the acquisition of
 older homes and for construction materials too. Finally, with regard to the distribution of loan
 contracts, the program gives priority to metropolitan regions where, today, 35 percent of the
 country's housing deficit is found. 42 percent of the interventions are in these regions, of
 which 20 percent are in the state capitals.


 2. The report criticizes the lack of dissemination and clarity of the PlanHab housing plan,
 But establishes that the date indicated by the Ministry of Cities for publication in by June
 2010.

 Although the report criticizes the limited dissemination of PlanHab, the conception of
 PlanHab was part of a planning process that began in 2007, went through all of 2008, being
 presented to the Council of Cities in December of that year.

 The elaboration of national participative plan in a country the size and complexity of Brazil
 was a great methodological challenge. PlanHab confronted this challenge, seeking to become
                                               61


a strategic instrument of national planning-traditionally formulated in a techno-
bureaucratic, if not authoritarian manner-that could incorporate all views in Brazilian
society about housing questions. These included regional diversity, the differentiated vision
of all segments of society and various technical viewpoints.

At the same time it kept a special role for institutions of social control and participation:
Concidades, the council of cities; the FGTS governing council; and managing council of
FNHIS, the social housing fund.

PlanHab was concluded and presented in December 2008. From then on it was widely
disseminated through diverse public events, such as a the 3rdconference of cities, in the
offices of PLHIS (details in item 14 of this document), on the site of the Ministry of Cities
(MOC), in various presentations made by staff of the national housing secretariat in fairs,
seminars, debates, meetings, with special mention of the Fifth World Urban Forum held in
March in Rio de Janeiro, and at the 4thconference of cities.

Minha Casa, Minha Vida constituted an important stimulus to implementing PlanHab by
aligning the concepts and the actions of the plan. This was through: (i) a significant increase
in government resources allocated for housing; (ii) prioritizing serving low-income families;
(iii) proposing a differentiated treatment of family groups in accordance with their incomes;
(iv) establishing a framework for consolidating a policy of subsidies integrated with finance;
(v) instituting a regulatory framework for regularizing titling of occupied areas; (vi) reducing
interest rates for housing finance; (vii) relating investments by sources of financings and
government responsibilities; (viii) stimulating the expansion of the private market for low-
income housing.

3. With respect to SNHIS-FNHIS, the report affirms that it was "upstaged" by the growth
acceleration PAC program and by Minha Casa, Minha Vida.

The national system of social housing (SNHIS) underwent a process of strengthening through
broader participation of federal agencies that created the council, fund and plan of social
housing. This was in order to access the resources of the fund, FNHIS.

It is important to stress that FNHIS became part of PAC from 2007. It was a fundamental
axis of finance for housing policy, with guaranteed resources of the order of one billion reals
per annum.

4. The report also states that FNHIS is managed by CEF. However, the Law 11,124/2005
that established FNHIS affirms that CEF is only the agente operador of the system. [note on
translation: the word "manage" in the English language would cover such a role.]

There is a substantial difference between the two roles.

The Ministry of Cities as the manager of FNHIS is responsible for the implementation of
housing policies aimed at the lower income population, as well as the coordination of actions
of the National Social Housing System (SFHIS). It is also responsible for the definition of
                                               62


instructions, priorities, strategies and instruments for the implementation of the National
Housing Policy (PlanHab) and social housing programs.

As agente operador CEF is responsible for the system's operations, by implementing the
operational procedures necessary for using FNHIS resources. This is based upon the norms
and instructions established the governing council and the Ministry of Cities. CEF is also the
depository of FNHIS resources and carries out the required accounting of them.

5 . Finally, the report mentions on page 17 that the DPL foresaw the strengthening of PSH. In
fact, what was at the heart of the project objective was the general harmonization of subsidies
and a more consistent budget allocation for PSH.

This happened because PSH was one of the active programs at the time. Currently, it can be
said that Minha Casa, Minha Vida promoted this harmonization up to a point, and significant
budget resources were allocated to housing subsidies, but through Minha Casu, Minha Vida,
not PSH.

6. The HTAL was criticized for being underutilized, not only by MOC but also by CEF
through the lack of use of the opportunity of accessing this technical assistance.

The technical assistance project for the housing sector, called TAL HABITACA"0 was
conceived and started at a time when discussions involving the main directions of PlanHab
were being incorporated. PlanHab has a 15 year time horizon and led to a new agenda of
discussions and demands for studies on housing.

Implementing PlanHab was complex, being part of a planning process that began in 2007,
went right through 2008, and was presented to the Council of Cities in December 2008. In
this new context, some of the (technical assistance) contracts foreseen at the time of signing
the Loan Agreement became inadequate and extemporaneous as far as SFH objectives were
concerned.

For this reason, it became necessary to realign the planning of the Project to the current
situation of the housing sector.

It is important to highlight that the management and implementation of the HTAL project
was the responsibility of MOC. CEF was not involved in its execution.

7. On the item where the DPL focused upon a broad program of municipal capacity building,
with tool kits, training programs and completed PLHIS, it is critical to note that the roles of
states and municipalities within the institutional framework of housing and urban
development remains unchanged.

Meanwhile, during 2008-20 10, various distance learning courses were held with the aim of
preparing public officials working in the area of housing in states and municipalities, to
increase local capacity in this area.
                                              63


In 2008, a distance learning event on slum upgrading (making integrated interventions in
informal settlements) was carried out by the Cities Alliance in partnership with MOC. More
than 300 participants completed the course.

In 2009, two versions of a distance learning course to train professionals in planning for
social housing. Taken both occasions into account, the course reached out to 4,000
professionals, 2,000 of which completed the course and received certificates.

The course had a positive evaluation by the participants and didactic material produced for it
is available on the MOC site, with the idea of guiding the elaboration of the plans referred to
above.

Finally, in 2010, the second course on slum upgrading was closed on June 22,2010, with
more than 800 participants and the lowest dropout rate of any MOC organized training. It
was considered a success by the participants.

Also in 20 10, the SNH will organize a distance learning course for 2,000 professionals aimed
at preparing them to undertake social work in informal settlements. This course will begin in
the month of July and is open for registration until July 11, 2010.

Apart from distance learning courses carried out with resources of HTAL, the department of
institutional development and technical cooperation (DICT) of SNH launched during 2009
various notable events, with particular attention given to the PLHIS workshops in the states.

Undertaking in partnership with CEF and with state governments, these workshops reached
out to more than 700 municipalities and trained a total of 2,188 people.

The workshops were targeted upon social workers directly involved in the elaboration,
follow up, or evaluation of PLHIS, giving priority to the participation of:

       o Municipal officials responsible for the execution of the contract with CEF and/or
         its immediate substitute.
       o Representatives and professionals of state governments who are active in the
         housing sector and/or urban development, and who are responsible for the
         development of the respective State Housing Plan.
       o Professionals of CEF (representatives of GIDURs or REDURs) responsible for
         analyzing PLHIS terms of reference and products.
       o Social workers responsible for the social control of PLHIS, preferably members
         of governing councils of social housing funds.

Report: "Excessive bureaucracy discouraged large-scale operators. PSH is on hold at this
writing, having, among other things, been upstaged by Minha Casu, Minha Vida. Upfront

receiving a double subsidy-the lump sum and the below-market interest" (Summary, page
xi, 5thparagraph, 6thline)
Comment: "We disagree with the affirmation that the PSH "did not take off' because of
excessive bureaucracy. The resources committed to the Program were fully used. New
operations were not undertaken, since PSH was incorporated into Minha Casu, Minha Vida.

Report: "The Operation design itselfearned mixed reviews in Brazil, even though the
Operation did bring together these various parties, with the Bank acting as honest broker
among them. As Borrower, the Ministry of Finance valued the flexibility and ownership it
conferred. As implementing agencies, the Ministry of Cities and the principal state bank, the
Caixa Econsmica Federal (CEF) lamented incurring costs to execute the project while
receiving no reimbursement from it-as the Operation design intended, of course. Neither the
Ministry of Cities nor CEF made much use of funding available through the parallel
Technical Assistance Project, however. " (Summary, page x, 2nd paragraph--complete)
  .., and CEE industriously pursued Operation endorsed actions at their own expense-for
which they received no reimbursement". (Summary, page xii, 2"dparagraph, 16thline)
Comment: "We are not aware of the execution of the DPL, referred to in this text as the
Operation. Meanwhile, our attention is called to the report of CEF incurring costs that are
still not reimbursed. This comment can bring about an institutional risk for the Federal
Government, through a hypothetical non-fulfillment of contracts.


Secretariat of the Economic Policv (SPE)

The Secretary of Economic Policy of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requests the following
alterations to the text of the draft report (editing conventions: (i)       indicates
deletion, and (ii) underlined indicates insertion into the text).

a) In Summary

a. 1 - page xi. Suggested text:

 With a solid legal framework in place, securitization of housing loans took a firmer
institutional footing in Brazil, with new businesses in Si30 Paulo bundling loans and trading
mortgage-backed securities called Certijkados de Recebiveis Imobilidrios in Brazil. At this
                                                65

writing, the sale of these Certificados has lapsed in Brazil as has the trading of such
securities worldwide following the sub-prime lending crisis in the US,

The private sector share of housing finance has remained constant and is unlikely to take off
before interest rates are normalized in Brazil's financial markets. Private banks complain that
they WRR& have difficulty to access existing FGTS funding, as they are entitled to, because
of excessive bureaucracy that leaves CEF to dominate the use FGTS funds. These banks also
argue that the small spreads allowed make FGTS lending unprofitable for them.

Comprehensive reform of housing finance in Brazil remains hostage to the country's high
interest rate regime, something likely to change only over the longer-term. Interest rates did
fall over the 2004-2009 period, but still remain extraordinarily high by international stan-
dards. This makes free-market-driven housing finance a far reality +m$&&&b,        leaving the
field to the SBPE-FGTS windows.

a.2 page xii Suggested text:

 The Overall Outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. It achieved its
relevant objectives, helping to increase access by the poor to housing, strengthening policy
and institutions and expanding housing finances, albeit with moderate shortcomings. These
included scant evidence of a down-market shift of housing finance, little lasting impact on
subsidies, and no evidence of reduced costs of urban land provision. The Risk to
Development Outcome is rated moderate. Government commitment to the Operation-
supported improvements is unlikely to waver. But possible impacts-real estate bubbles, for
instance-of rapid expansion of housing finance upon the real supply and demand for
housing were ) the scope of the                      minimized into
Operation. Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The project was prepared
with care except for M&E that was given cursory treatment and failed. Except for actions to
lower the costs of urban land delivery, the project was well designed to achieve the relevant
objectives. Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory. The Government was committed to
improving the Housing Finance System, while placing housing center stage of its two
flagship programs, the PAC and the Minha Casu, Minha Vida. Those agencies responsible
for implementation, the Ministry of Cities and CEF, industriously pursued Operation-
endorsed actions at their own expense-for which they received no reimbursement.

6.1     Mobilizing funding for the construction and purchase of the quantity and quality of
housing units needed is among the challenges facing the further reduction and eventual
elimination of this deficit. In Brazil, raising the necessary funds directly in unfettered local
financial markets would only lead to unaffordable lending. Interest rates in Brazil are the
highest reported in the world, multiples of those in comparable states (Table 1.1). If one
would exist carrying Brazil's 44.7 percent per annum interest rate, for instance, a
hypothetical 15 year mortgage loan of US$l50,000 would require a monthly repayment of
US$5,500-affordable only by households in the top few percentiles of the income

    1. The market for housing finance and the SFH

    Statement of the report: The Brazilian housing finance market is excessively dependent upon
    the SFH, a solution that has been around for more than 50 years. As in other editions of this
    report, it is said that housing financing should be left to the free market. However, this will
    only be possible when interest rates in Brazil are reduced to acceptable levels, since they are
    still very high when compared with other countries.
    Counterpoint: The SFH precisely has the objective of making loans with different interest
    rates feasible for borrowers, as a way of bringing down market interest rates. The SFH was
    created as a mechanism to make decent housing possible for the worker, and as the report
    itself notes, the tendency is to encourage a sustainable reduction in interest rates for housing
    loans, something that has occurred in recent years.

    2. The market for loans for low-income families

    Statement of the report: There is no evidence that housing finance aimed at low-income
    families has increased significantly in recent years, even through that part financed through
    the SPBE and FGTS. The report states that [IEG] sought data on this, but was unable to
    achieve this.
    Counterpoint: Housing loans awarded to low-income families, especially through the FGTS,
    have increased substantially over the years. The value of financing awarded through the
    FGTS increased by more than 553 percent between 2004 and 2009, for example. The
    increase of the volume of annual discount offered was more than 700 percent, and the
    average loan value grew by more than 409 percent, as shown below:

3. The double subsidy to low-income families

Statement of the report: The SFH awarded double subsidies to borrowers, given that the
interest rates are below-market and direct subsidies are also provided.
Counterpoint: The direct subsidies are awarded only to borrowers who have specific
characteristics related to family income and affordability. They are workers who, even with
below-market interest rates, would not succeed in obtaining financing unless they had access
to the (direct) subsidy.



4. The increase of direct subsidies and the low-income (housing) finance market

Statement of the report: The confirmed increase in the award of direct subsidies cannot be
taken as evidence that the housing finance market is giving a broader coverage to the low-
income population.
Counterpoint: The increase in the award of direct subsidies is unequivocal proof that the
quantity of housing finance for the low-income population increased substantially. This
happened because, with the subsidy, more low-income families gained access to housing
finance.



5. The SFH and housing sector reform in Brazil
Statement of the report: The World Bank loan had more modest objectives than reforming
Brazil?s housing sector would call for, as the title of the loan would lead one to conclude. A
deep and broad reform of the housing sector in Brazil is extremely necessary in the medium
to long term, and the SFH will have an important role in this task. This is especially so in the
next few years, although the housing market should be left to private capital more intensively
in the future
Counterpoint: We agree that FGTS and SBPE resources have an important role in the
housing sector, although government policies to stimulate credit for the low-income
population are also fundamental for the sector.



6. CEF as the operations agent of the FGTS and the lack of access to private banks to FGTS
resources

Statement of the report: CEF, as operations agent of the FGTS has no interest in facilitating
the access of other financial agencies to the resources of FGTS, given that the CEF itself is a
financial agency. Also, the risks of a possible default by other financial agencies toward
FGTS would fall upon CEF. Besides this, the processing of applications (made by other
financial agencies) for FGTS funding is slow and bureaucratic.
Counterpoint: CEF, as operations agent, has no interest in making (others?) access to FGTS
resources for housing loans difficult. On the contrary, and as has been reiterated to the World
Bank,CEF has taken several steps to fully and efficiently execute the FGTS budget,
                                              70


notwithstanding the constant increase in resources over the years. Some of the measures
were:

       - Yearly formal consultation by CEF of financial agencies through a published
       Circular about their intention to use FGTS resources for housing finance and the
       amount that will be needed for the following year. Only after these demonstrations of
       interest is the budget request made and presented to the FGTS governing council.

       - The operations agent has often held technical meetings with financial agencies to
       remove doubts and seek adjustments that contributed to the optimization of the use of
       FGTS resources by all.

       - Transfers of extraordinary amortizations, that used to be executed within 10 days
       after the amortization, are now made on a monthly basis, as the financial agencies
       requested. This has improved the operational process.

       - Questions raised about the rate of credit risk by financial agencies were clarified in
       the sense that this rate, approved by the FGTS governing council, is applied on the
       basis of a rate for each agency, and constitutes a mechanism of calibration, collection
       and provision for credit risk. It is important to emphasize that this rate is collected
       from CEF, when it acts in the role of financial agency, and that the rating of most of
       the banks is the minimum foreseen by the regulations of the governing council, at 0.2
       percent per annum. For this reason, this rate does not constitute an obstacle to the
       undertaken the operations.

       - The limit to the spread of operations financed by FGTS resources, of R$10,034.00,
       exists to help achieve the FGTS objective of focusing attention upon social housing
       for low-income families. Even so, it is important to emphasize that such a limit is
       only applied to low-income borrowers, those who have a right to FGTS discount.
       When a borrower does not have that right, there is no limit to the spread.

As the World Bank had been informed, financial agencies tend to call the policy of allocating
FGTS resources to low levels of income as being "bureaucratic". Thus, the governing council
of FGTS and the MOC define the target levels of income and the objectives that FGTS
should try to achieve, in relation to the regions where the resources should be applied, the
amounts committed to discounts, and the quantity of corresponding resources. These
definitions are part of the sectoral directives that are aligned with the housing policy of the
State that aims to guarantee the priority application of FGTS resources to the strata of
population most in need of these resources.



7. Increase of housing finance and the market supply of housing units

Statement of the report: Increasing the potential of housing finance to borrowers is an aim
that should be permanently pursued, although it must accompany efforts to overcome
bottlenecks in the supply of houses, in other words, in the construction industry.
                                               71


Counterpoint: The Minha Casa, Minha Vida program introduced incentives for low-income
housing production, from the point of view of the entrepreneur as well as the final borrower.

Operations Agent CEF does not expect that FGTS is likely to face restrictions of resources
for housing finance in the coming years."

C) On the same page, after the passage "These banks also argue that the small spreads
allowed make FGTS lending unprofitable for them ", to include: "However, the Financial
Agency CEF, responsible for nearly all housing loans financed through FGTS, is also bound
by the same rules and spread limits as other financial agencies. Thus CEF's domination of
the market does not result from a privileged position in relation to other agencies, but to its
strategic action as executor of the Federal Government's housing policy."

                                                                        f

                               f

convincing demonstration that housingfinance moved down-market ", taking into account he
point made in item 2 of this document.

I.     PD ANNEX 2: MATRIX OF OBJECTIVES, KEY ACTIONS AND
       OUTCOMES - Page 29

1.1    1. Improve regulatory and legal environment for housing finance

        Basically, comments on the regulatory advances especially through Laws 9 3 14/97
and 10,931/2004 were added. Among other things, they introduced alienaqa"ofiduci6ria
[translator's note: similar to "trust deed'y and regulated the rules of incontroverso
[translator 's note: similar to "surety" or iiescrow'7.

      In discussions about the project, it became clear that, in terms of the regulatory
framework, the greatest legal risk that required mitigation came from the polemical question
                                               72


of capitalization of interest that follows Decree 22,626/33. This question is noted on page 29,
namely the preparation of a draft project law to solve the legal ambiguity about capitalization
of interest, as applied to existing portfolios (interpretation of 1933 law).

       As the report does not present any comment on the evolution of this matter either in
the annex or in the body of the body of the document, it leaves the impression that there was
no progress. Meanwhile, Law 11,977 of July 7,20 10 was a major step forward that certainly
contributed to the mitigation of what is the greatest legal risk posed to Brazilian housing
finance.

         Considering the importance of this theme, we judge it opportune to insert in some
part of the body of report, or in the annex itself, the following items:

         "In terms o improving the regulatory framework and mitigating risks, Law 11,977
                    f
was drafted in July 7, 2009. The Law incorporated important advances with respect to the
principal legal risk associated with housing finance, namely controversies arising from the
capitalization o interest. In this context, the Law expressly authorized the monthly
                f
capitalization o interest, as well as regulating the mathematical rules to follow in
                f
amortization systems used in housing loan operations. In the same way, the Law also
                                f
explicitly authorized the use o the accounting system known in Brazil as the "Tabela Price ",
                                       f
that in the context o capitalization o interest was the target o recurrent legal actions
                     f                                          f
against it in Brazil, putting the system at risk. "

        With the same approach recommended in the previous paragraph about the Law
19,777/2009, it is important to insert in the document some mention of the advances made in
greater transparency for borrowers. Thus we suggest for inclusion in the body of the
document or in the annex the following:

       "In terms ofprotecting the interest of borrowers and also to bring greater
transparency to the relations between lenders and borrowers, as well as stimulating
competition between financial institutions, two important mechanisms were introduced:

I - Obliging loan agreements to inform the Total Effective Cost (CET) of the operation, as
per Resolution CMN/BACEN 3,517 of December 6, 2007, in order to make it easier for
borrowers to identih the best proposals in the market, as well as to clarib the real costs of
the loan.

II - Freedom for borrowers to choose their insurer for housing loans. Law 1I , 977/2009
obligedfinancial institutions to offer a minimum o two (insurance)policy options, at least
                                                  f
      f
one o which should not belong to the lender's economic group. Apart from this, the Law
allowed the borrower to opt for any other legally recognized insurer in the market. This
measure resolved an old discussion with state attorneys and legal authorities, as well as
stimulating competition between insurers that already resulted in cost reductions in this type
 f
o insurance.

I1       Comments arising from questions noted in the body of the Report

2.1    Paragraph 4.19 - page 17 - Originally established in 200 1 as a pilot program, PSH
was retained as a permanent instrument for providing up-front housing subsidies, managed
bv CEF, for the construction of social housing through Laws 10,008/04 and 10,998/04 (our
emphasis)

       The part underlined in the above text constitutes a technical error and, although it
may appear to be irrelevant, it can lead to interpretations that can be harmful to the image of
CEF. For this reason, we ask that the underlined text be excluded from the report. Apart from
being unnecessary, the exclusion does not undermine the point being made there.

            The reason for requesting this exclusion derives from the fact that CEF, either as
     financial agency or as operations agent, at no time exercised the role of administrator or
                 operator of PSH. This responsibility was always MOF's and MO
