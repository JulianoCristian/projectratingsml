outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: government\n            participation in the analytical preparation and formulation\n            of the policy reform agenda is to ensuring long-term\n            commitment. While some specific activities within the\n            results framework did not evolve as planned, the Government\n            has shown a clear commitment, through several large scale\n            programs, to developing the housing sector based on the\n            conceptual policy guidelines espoused in the Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL). Linking housing construction to economic\n            stimulus plans is an effective and politically palatable\n            means of spurring housing construction for specific income\n            groups as well as generating employment. The launch of the\n            Minha Casa, Minha Vida stimulus package has gained broad\n            support within Brazil and will catalyze housing programs\n            identified in the National Housing Plan. The use of the\n            trust deed in housing finance instead of the traditional\n            mortgage has proven to function extremely well in a context\n            like Brazil because it provides a stronger incentive to pay\n            since title is only transferred when the loan is paid in\n            full. Indeed, loans based on trust deed in Brazil have had a\n            lower foreclosure rate than loans based on other forms of\n            security like a mortgage lien. DPLs with reform agendas that\n            require specific actions from the private sector, require\n            the identification of tools to ensure an open dialogue\n            between the public and private sectors during implementation."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
