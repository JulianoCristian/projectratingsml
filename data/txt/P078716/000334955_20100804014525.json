{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Programmatic Loan for\n            Sustainable and Equitable Growth : Housing Sector Reform\n            Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            strengthening housing finance is an important sectoral goal,\n            but it should be pursued alongside efforts to overcome\n            bottlenecks in real housing supply and demand that, if not\n            addressed, may lead to a surge in property prices, creating\n            a real estate bubble and collapse-as experience elsewhere\n            has shown. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be an\n            integral part of the operation it is monitoring.\n            Establishing a new M&E system or consolidating an\n            existing one should be a key prior action for an operation,\n            and trigger for subsequent operations or tranches.\n            Consigning M&E to another operation (such as a parallel\n            Technical Assistance Project in this case) increases the\n            risk of a total lack of evidence if the host operation\n            fails. Bank value-added for its clients arises when it\n            offers different advice from the local expert opinion and\n            knowledge that exist in abundance in middle-income countries\n            especially. This operation provided an opportunity for a\n            broad sector policy discussion of reform beyond the\n            parameters of Brazil's housing finance system that\n            could have been more fully exploited by the Bank. A policy\n            lending operation can usefully bring together different\n            sectoral stakeholders among whom the Bank can serve as\n            honest broker, even when sector reform opportunities or\n            achievements may be modest."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
