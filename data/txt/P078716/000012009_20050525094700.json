Housing Sector Reform\n            Loan Project is to support the Government's efforts in\n            improving access by the poor to better housing and\n            serviced/serviceable land, while maintaining fiscal\n            discipline, as part of the set of loans supporting\n            sustainable and equitable growth. Brazil has witnessed\n            enormous progress in all economic and social fronts, the\n            exception being the critical situation of the shelter for\n            the poor. The Government is committed to address this\n            challenge by supporting the needs of the very poor, and the\n            development of a market that could, and should cater to the\n            less poor. This loan focuses on one key component: housing\n            sector reform. It thus deepens the reform agenda to promote\n            efficiency of the financial sector and improve economic\n            opportunity. Specifically, the project will a) develop a\n            sound national policy, and institutional framework for\n            housing and urban development; b) strengthen the housing\n            credit, and savings systems, and provide incentives for the\n            housing finance market to expand, as well as move\n            \"down-market\"; c) design and implement a unified\n            federal housing subsidy system, to address the affordability\n            of housing solutions for the poor; and, d) reduce the costs\n            of formal, urban land development, by strengthening land\n            legislation, regulations, and real property registries. In\n            spite of several risks to this operation, namely, timing and\n            expectations, coordination and institutional risks, and,\n            macroeconomic developments and interest rate volatility, the\n            Government's commitment to pursue its fiscal adjustment\n            policy, should lead to a decline in overall debt and lower\n            market interest rates. Furthermore, the program provides a\n            conceptual framework to help the Government monitor the\n            segments of the housing market, including those relevant for\n            poor and middle-income families."}, "docdt": "2005-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
