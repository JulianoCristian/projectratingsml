                     GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS AND INSTITUTIONS


CEF Caixa Econômica Federal is the largest Federal Public Bank in Brazil and a major player
in the housing finance system. It accounts for a significant part of the direct housing credit system
(SBPE) lending; uses most of the FGTS funds that are on-lent for housing; manages the accounts
of the FGTS members; and distributes the bulk of the public housing subsidy resources.

Estatuto da Cidade (the City Statute) is a law related to urban development which
decentralized to municipalities a number of housing and land responsibilities and required cities
to develop their institutional capacity, as well as participatory urban plans.

FGTS Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço is the cornerstone of both the directed credit
system as well as the housing subsidy system. It is funded by the monthly compulsory
contributions of salaried employees into accounts linked to the workers managed by CEF.

FNHIS (Fundo Nacional de Habitação de Interesse Social). National Social Interest Housing
Fund that was established as one of the Prior Actions to the DPL. It was established to coordinate
transfers, subsidies, financial resources and funding to support the national housing policy.

Law 6.766/79. National legislation that regulates the subdivision of land for urban purposes,
which has been under revision since the DPL.

Minha Casa, Minha Vida is an economic stimulus package launched in April 2009 that aims to
construct 1 million new homes by 2012.

MOC (Ministry of Cities). Created in 2003, the ministry filled an important vacuum in terms of
urban and housing policy. It has made important advances to coordinate and define low-income
housing policies, sharing with STN the management of the new social housing program.

MP (Medida Provisória), a legal instrument issued by the President with the force of law but
that has not been approved by the Parliament.

NHP (National Housing Policy) was prepared by the Ministry of Cities in wide consultation
with partners and civil society. The Bank was very active in the review of early drafts and in
sharing methodology and conceptual framework.

PAC (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento). The government introduced the PAC in
January 2007 with a goal of encouraging R$ 504 billion in public and private investment over the
subsequent four years. The measures are divided into five groups: infrastructure (transport,
sanitation and housing), credit stimulation, institutional development, tax exemption, and long-
term fiscal measures.

PlanHab (National Housing Plan), completed in 2008, is the road map for the National Housing
Policy determining specific targets up to 2023 and the responsibilities of each public agency, as
well as the financial needs and sources of finance.

Papel Passado Program aims to assist states, municipalities, public administration entities and
nonprofit civic associations in promoting land regularization in informal settlements in urban
areas.

SFH (Housing Finance System). Created in 1964, the SFH is a classic closed-circuit housing
finance system offering below-market rates on a limited pool of funds. It includes the SBPE, the
savings and loans arm of the system, FGTS, FCVS, and CEF.

PSH (Social Housing Subsidy Program) Parcelamento is the component of the PSH that
provides upfront subsidies to the beneficiaries and pays financial institutions to supervise the
actual construction or purchase o f the house. Municipalities contribute with the land and enforce
the contracts. Financiamento is the component of the PSH that subsidizes both the final
beneficiary as well as the bank to finance low-income households. In most cases, municipalities
are the guarantors of the loan advanced to the households.

SBPE (Sistema Brasileiro de Poupança e Empréstimo) is a system that offers liquid and tax
free saving accounts (cadernetas de poupança), at a relatively low interest rate. Part of the
deposits is compulsorily dedicated to finance housing loans.

SFI (Sistema Financeiro Imobiliário) is the new market-based housing finance system that the
government aimed to strengthen under the DPL.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The loan was appraised in early 2005 during the first Lula Administration. During that
period, the Government was working on several fronts to demonstrate its commitment to
fiscal and macroeconomic stability. For the first time since the 1970s, the Brazilian
economy was experiencing a healthy combination of brisk growth, single-digit inflation,
and a current account surplus.

Since 2003, the Government had established an agenda of microeconomic and
institutional reforms to foster capital accumulation and productivity gains and thereby
favor sustainable and equitable growth. Decline in investment levels in infrastructure had
been large. Productivity performance had been relatively better, but a poor "investment
climate" was still a major obstacle to further productivity gains. The reforms were
structured around four pillars: (a) reducing logistics costs to raise productivity and ease
trade; (b) improving the business environment to enable better market functioning; (c)
enhancing financial efficiency and depth; and (d) transforming knowledge into
productivity through innovation.

The improvements in the housing sector fit within the Government's microeconomic
agenda of reforms, and would require increased mortgage credit, effective property rights,
and the removal of obstacles to commercial lending for housing. These matched the
broader initiatives of supporting private sector development, improving the business
environment, and increasing financial depth. Better regulation for land use was also an
ingredient of the larger task of improving infrastructure regulation and simplifying
business entry and operation, other elements of the agenda. And the emphasis on targeted
subsidies and auctioning was part of a broader effort to increase the efficiency of social
expenditure. A new housing policy was thus envisioned to galvanize the government's
microeconomic agenda, reduce social distress and improve fiscal management.

In February 2000, Brazil's Congress passed a constitutional amendment that guarantees
the right to adequate housing for all Brazilians. Accomplishing this goal, while
maintaining fiscal discipline, presented a major challenge. While the issue of housing and
the attendant social, economic, environmental, and health issues was a priority in the
electoral campaign of President Lula in 2002, progress in housing outcomes had proven
limited by 2005. This was in large part due to the fact that the new Government had to
develop an institutional and policy framework for the sector from the ground up. Fiscal
restrictions, self-imposed by the Government, further limited their ability to launch new
housing investment programs.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

On June 14, 2005, the Bank Board approved the Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and
Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform (Loan 7306-BR), which became effective on


                                           10

May 9, 2006. The operation was part of a set of four loans to support the Government of
Brazil in its agenda for sustainable and equitable growth. An accompanying Technical
Assistance Loan was approved by the Board on November 10, 2005 to assist the
Government in pursuing its new housing policy and design the necessary policy reforms
which would be supported by further Bank lending.

Program Development Objectives. The objective of the program was to support the
Government's efforts to improve access of the poor to improved housing and serviced
serviceable land, while maintaining fiscal discipline. Specifically, the operation aimed to
support the Government in its efforts to: (a) develop a sound national policy and
institutional framework for housing and urban development; (b) strengthen the housing
credit and savings systems, and provide incentives for the housing finance market to
expand as well as move "down-market"; (c) design and implement a unified federal
housing subsidy system to address the affordability of housing solutions for the poor; and
(d) reduce the costs of formal urban land development by strengthening land legislation
and regulations and real property registries.

Key Indicators. The operation was designed to provide timely, appropriate support to a
policy reform program that was, by its very nature, medium-term in scope. The DPL
supported initiatives already completed. A list of the policy developments required by the
Loan Agreement in this first phase of the program is provided in Annex 7. The results
framework identifies eight key actions as "triggers" for the preparation of a subsequent
DPL ­ completion of these actions would serve as a clear signal of the Government's
intention to maintain the policy trajectory of the program ­ and thirty-five
Performance/Outcome Indicators. These performance indicators were selected as a means
of measuring the Government's progress in addressing specific policy needs.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The DLP supported the Government's efforts in four areas of housing sector and urban
development policy reform, including: (i) Strengthening the Housing Policy and
Government Institutional Framework; (ii) Reforms to Increase the Stability and Scale of
the Housing Finance Market; (iii) Improving the Effectiveness of Federal Housing
Subsidies; and (iv) Land and Urban Development.

Strengthening the Housing Policy and Government Institutional Framework. Until the
creation of the Ministry of Cities in 2002, the housing system in Brazil was driven by a
set of federative entities without a clear articulation of policies or a plan to address the
housing and urban development problems of the country. At the time of the DPL
approval, the Government had made significant progress in strengthening housing policy
institutions, consolidating financial resources for Federal housing programs so as to
increase their impact and homogenize their allocation criteria, and taken steps to
strengthen subnational entities to implement housing policy.


                                           11

Reforms to Increase the Stability and Scale of the Housing Finance Market. Since the
mid-90s, Brazilian authorities have attempted to restructure the country's housing finance
sector and have embarked on the gradual transition from a system of directed credit in a
highly segmented market towards an integrated and capital market-driven housing
finance system, with an increased role of private universal banks in the immediate-term
and a functioning secondary mortgage market in the medium-term. While major progress
had been made in the improvement of the regulatory and legal frameworks for the
primary and secondary housing finance market, there were still serious constraints
preventing private banks from entering the market. The result was that, in general, private
lenders limited their mortgage lending to relatively large loans to upper-income
customers.

Improving the Effectiveness of Federal Housing Subsidies. Housing subsidies in Brazil
had traditionally been embedded in below-market interest rates inherent in the FGTS
system and to a lesser degree by the SBPE system. At the time of the DPL approval, the
FGTS had initiated improvements in its systems, approved by the FGTS Conselho
Curador in 2004. In particular, it moved to greater effectiveness of its subsidy system,
and had improved its targeting to lower-income borrowers.

Land and Urban Development. In addition to actions geared to stimulate demand for
housing and to enable the subsidies to help the lowest income brackets, efforts were
required to complement demand-side adjustments with supply-side reforms. There was a
consensus that land supply in Brazil is constrained by excessive regulation, conservative
zoning, and over restrictive devices, albeit their purpose of protecting the poor against
speculation and to guaranteeing a minimal level of human dignity. Specifically, the
revision of law 6.766/79 (which sets general norms of urban law concerning land
subdivision for urban purposes) had been a priority since the mid 1990s, and the Ministry
of Cities had since its creation in 2003 played a critical role in facilitating public debate
on the law and its reform. It was the goal of the Ministry of Cities that any revision of the
law be consistent with the main principles underlying the Government's policies on land
and housing. By the time of approval of the DPL, the Government had begun a process to
improve the legal and institutional framework as regards urban development and formal
settlement creation to address both the backlog of needed investment and to create an
enabling environment for the orderly incorporation of new land subdivisions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance


                                          12

Program performance for the DPL is rated satisfactory because the Government has
made significant progress regarding most of the identified policy needs, in addition to
demonstrating through the Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento (PAC) and the new
Minha Casa, Minha Vida stimulus package the prominence of the housing sector and its
importance to the growth and equity agenda.           In effect, under the DPL, important
advances were made in (a) strengthening the housing policy and Government's
institutional framework, (b) expanding the scale of the housing finance market, (c)
increasing the transparency of housing subsidies, and (d) enhancing land tenure
regularization.

Improvement in some other areas has lagged slightly behind target, including: (a) limited
expansion of private lenders' down-market penetration using FGTS funds; (b) a
comprehensive M&E system for the housing sector is still under development and (c)
slow progress in the harmonization and consolidation of housing subsidies under the
Fundo Nacional de Habitação de Interesse Social (FNHIS) and in the expansion of
upfront housing subsidies through the Programa de Subsidio à Habitação de Interesse
Social (PSH). In spite of the latter issues, the significance of the achievements in several
other areas and the fact that the two most important Government investment programs in
the past four years have focused on the housing sector, including the improved clarity and
targeting of subsidies under the Minha Casa, Minha Vida program, warrants that the
overall program performance be rated as satisfactory.

One of the factors affecting the assessment of program performance and outcomes is the
timing of this implementation completion report (ICR). The initial plan was to prepare
only one ICR for the entire DPL program (consisting of four loans ­ two related to
housing and two related to employment and poverty), to be completed six months after
the closing date of the last DPL in the series, which would have been the second housing
related DPL. However, the second housing DPL did not move forward as Government
did not require a fast-disbursing loan at this time due to its improved fiscal stance.
Therefore, the second employment and poverty DPL, which closed June 30, 2008,
became the last DPL in the series and their respective ICRs were prepared separately.
The fact that this ICR is prepared more than two years after the date of completion of the
housing DPL, made it possible to assess over a longer timeframe the impact of the
implemented reforms and thus offer a more comprehensive overview of the housing
sector. In particular, the timing of the ICR has allowed it to take into account the
Government's interventions through the PAC and the MCMV program, which are
testament to the Government's strong commitment to the housing sector and its
importance to the growth and equity agenda.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

The Government was, and has remained, committed to the housing reform program.
This commitment was evidenced by the broad set of policy reforms that took place prior
to the DPL and the continued financial and institutional focus that housing issues have
had during the last four years. In particular, two of the largest public investment programs
launched in the past four years tackled housing problems in Brazil, which demonstrates


                                           13

the importance attached by the Federal Government to the housing sector. These are the
PAC, launched in 2007 and in which R$13.5 billion in urban upgrading and housing
investments have been contracted, and the R$34 billion MCMV stimulus package,
recently launched in April 2009.

The background analysis supporting the reform program was sound, and based on
extensive analytical work done by the Bank and the Borrower. During the two-year
preparation of the DPL, the Bank Team, with support from international and Brazilian
housing experts, worked closely with the Borrower to fully understand the challenges
facing the housing and land sectors and identify the specific reforms necessary to reach
the development objective of improving access to housing for the poor. After access to
shelter services was identified as a priority area for Bank intervention during the pre-CAS
consultation process towards the end of 2000, the Bank launched fieldwork that led to a
comprehensive piece of ESW (Brazil Progressive Low-Income Housing: Alternatives for
the Poor, Report 22032-BR). In 2001, the Brazilian authorities explicitly requested Bank
assistance in preparing a National Housing Policy for Brazil taking into account the new
macroeconomic stability of Brazil, the much wanted deregulation of the credit system,
and the increased potential for capital market development.

Difficulties faced in the implementation of the companion Technical Assistance Loan
prevented the timely achievement of some outcomes envisaged under the DPL. The
DPL was designed to provide continued support to the Ministry of Cities in the
implementation of the reform agenda through the approval of an accompanying housing
sector Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). Among the items that were identified to be
funded by the TAL were capacity building for the National Housing Secretariat,
operationalization of the FNHIS, a strategic study of the FGTS, support for subsidy
harmonization and rationalization, establishment of a comprehensive Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) system, strengthening of sub-national planning and housing entities,
and development of a national urban upgrading program. Difficulties in the procurement
process of the different studies to be financed under the TAL, unavailability of
consultants in Brazil with the necessary housing sector expertise, and the availability of
alternative funding sources within the Ministry to conduct some of the work led to
significant implementation and disbursement delays of the TAL. As a result, the
implementation of the M&E system was significantly delayed.

An overall favorable macro-economic environment led to lower interest rates and as
such increased lending for housing. The annual flow of housing mortgage loans grew
from R$5.4 billion in 2004 to R$39.1 billion in 2008. This rapid expansion of housing
finance owes in large part to positive macroeconomic conditions, as well as to improved
legal and regulatory framework. In effect, the economy grew at an average of 4.8 percent
between 2004 and 2008, while inflation dropped from 12.5 percent in 2002 to 5.9 percent
in 2008. This led the Central Bank to reduce the headline interest rate (SELIC) from 26.5
percent in 2003 to 9.25 percent in June 2009.

The expansion of the housing finance market in general and further down-market
penetration by private lenders was affected by the recent global economic crisis. The



                                            14

DPL design correctly identified that there are inherent macroeconomic risks associated
with any policy-based program of support and that this is particularly true in the case of
housing finance. The recent global economic crisis, which began to show effects in Brazil
in October 2008, has slowed growth in the housing finance market, especially for private
financial institutions. Indeed, while the flow of SBPE mortgages issued by private
lenders had peaked in August 2008, October 2008 marked the first month-on-month
decline in mortgage flow relative to the previous year, and by February 2009, mortgage
loans issued by private lenders had fallen 46 percent lower than the same period in 2008.
Only CEF's sustained increase of SBPE lending prevented the decline of mortgage loans.
The crisis and its effect on the contraction of credit by private lenders are thus expected
to delay the expansion of the private housing finance market and its extension to lower
income households.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The DPL defined a results framework in which triggers for a subsequent DPL,
performance indicators and medium-term anticipated results were defined for each policy
reform area. However, an institutional arrangement for the collection of data and its
monitoring was not designed. Moreover, many of the numerous performance indicators
lacked baseline data and did not indicate specific targets. The PAD does not provide a
clear division of responsibilities for M&E among institutions/agencies, especially since
the different policy areas fall under the purview of different entities. As the designated
implementing agency, the Ministry of Finance could be assumed to be responsible for
overall M&E of the DPL outcomes. Yet, in the main reference to M&E in the PAD, it is
indicated that the TAL would ensure that performance monitoring and evaluation is
mainstreamed in the Government's housing policy. As such, it could be inferred that the
Ministry of Cities would be the responsible agency for M&E of the DPL.

Given that no specific organization was clearly designated as responsible for monitoring
and evaluation of the performance indicators for the DPL, no coordinated effort was
made to consolidate the necessary information from the different agencies or to use these
indicators to inform decision-making and resource allocation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

It was envisioned that Bank support to the Government's reform and investment program
would be structured over the four years following the DPL and would comprise (a) loans
aligned with the Government's budget cycle and linked to federal policy reform efforts,
including the establishment of a sector-wide housing subsidy program; (b) a Technical
Assistance Loan (TAL) which was approved in 2005 and has been extended to close in
December 2010; and (c) a possible investment-linked operation, to be prepared under the
Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) modality. The DPL was designed to support the
establishment of the institutional and policy environment for sustainable housing sector
development consistent with the emerging national priorities and to set the stage for a
follow-on DPL, the focus of which would be to enhance the effectiveness of the housing
finance system and the targeting and transparency of subsidy programs. While several of
the identified triggers have been met, the Government has not moved forward with the


                                          15

second housing related DPL. The improvement in economic conditions and the rapid
build-up of foreign reserves meant that in 2007 the Federal Government did not need to
borrow for budget support, and as such has not pursued the second housing DPL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives of the DPL remain highly relevant to current country priorities. While
Brazil's macroeconomic conditions have improved considerably since the DPL and
poverty rate dropped from 32.9 percent in 2003 to 24.2 percent in 2007, the country still
faces a large housing shortage, especially among the lowest income groups. Indeed the
National Housing Plan estimated the Brazilian housing deficit as 7.9 million units across
the country, corresponding to 14.9 percent of total households in Brazil. Most of the
demand for housing is in the lower income ranges. In fact, 90.3 percent of the urban
housing deficit of the country is concentrated in families with monthly incomes of less
than three minimum wages and 96.3 percent in families with monthly incomes of less
than five minimum wages. This strong concentration of the deficit among the low-income
occurs in all regions of the country, including metropolitan areas where the cost of
housing is substantially higher than other areas.

The focus of the DPL on the housing sector and the reforms that it underpinned remain
very relevant for Brazil's growth agenda, as well as the equitable sharing of such growth.
Reforms to remove constraints to housing demand and to housing supply should result in
both increased investment in housing construction, thus contributing to higher demand
for labor, and increased capital accumulation. Improved access to affordable housing and
shelter conditions in informal settlements would also be expected to contribute to crime
reduction and enhanced labor productivity. This explains why, in the aftermath of the
global economic crisis, the Government has identified the housing sector as the focus of
its new stimulus package to generate employment, attract investment and contribute to
growth, while addressing the housing challenge. As such, the DPL's objective and
design remain very relevant to both the growth and equity agendas, which are the main
Government priorities and key pillars in the Country Partnership Strategy.

In terms of design, the DPL's four areas of focus are particularly valid and provide a
comprehensive response that addresses both demand- and supply-side challenges
preventing low-income households' access to affordable, adequate housing. The PAD
acknowledged that the DPL's scope was ambitious, and noted that in particular the land
component was expected to produce results over a longer timeframe, and likely by the
time of the follow up housing sector DPL that was then envisaged. As such, one could
argue that the first DPL ought to have focused only on the first three policy areas--
housing policy, finance and subsidy, leaving aside land issues to the second DPL.
However, the inclusion of a land policy component under the DPL was warranted to
initiate the policy dialogue and because separating demand and supply-side issues would




                                              16

have risked compromising the intended development outcomes, as housing sector reform
requires a comprehensive solution.

The DPL's implementation arrangement was well designed, particularly through the set
up of the inter-ministerial working group bringing together key stakeholders (Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Cities, and BACEN). Even though the group's regular meetings
somewhat waned following the completion of the DPL, the institutional cooperation that
was initiated under the DPL served as the foundation for the design and implementation
support of the PAC's urban upgrading component and the design of the MCMV stimulus
program. The DPL could thus be credited for initiating institutional cooperation in
housing policy and program formulation, mainly between the Ministries of Finance and
Cities, as well as with Casa Civil, BACEN, and CEF.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

Policy Area #1
The outcome of Policy Area #1: Strengthening the Housing Policy and Government
Institutional Framework is rated satisfactory because of (i) the completion of the National
Housing Plan; (ii) the activation of the managing council for the FNHIS and
consolidation of housing related funding to lower federative levels, albeit not in the
largest national investment programs; and (iii) the centrality of housing policy within the
two most important national development programs during the last four years. Of minor
concern is the slow progress on the completion of municipal level housing plans.

The strengthening of the government's housing policy making institutions was evidenced
by the completion of the National Housing Plan (PlanHab) in 2008. The National
Housing Secretariat elaborated the PlanHab in close collaboration with related ministries,
local governments, the private sector, and social movement groups. The PlanHab has a
planning horizon until 2023, and will guide the planning of public and private actions
aimed at better targeting existing and future resources to confront the housing needs of
the country.

During the last four years, housing has become an important issue in the national
development agenda ­ both the PAC and the recent economic stimulus package, the two
most important national development programs during the last four years, place an
emphasis on the housing sector. Within the PAC, housing was allocated R$ 10.7 billion
for 268 urban upgrading initiatives, not including R$ 2.2 from the FNHIS. The PlanHab,
the primary product of Policy Area #1, was used as the foundation for the development of
the international economic crisis stimulus package ­ Minha Casa, Minha Vida. The
R$ 34 billion stimulus package focuses on the housing sector, and specifically on the
provision of housing for low-income families. The package includes upfront subsidies
combined with housing loans, infrastructure financing, and housing production chain
financing. It is important to note that the inter-ministerial working group (Prior Action
#2) has evolved over time to become more action oriented. The design and



                                              17

implementation of the stimulus package highlights the strengthened working relationship
between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Cities.
The establishment of the FNHIS in 2005, the activation of its managing council in 2006,
and the channeling of funds for upgrading and social housing through it, demonstrate a
significant first step towards the consolidation of financial resources for federal housing
subsidies. Indeed, R$1 billion per year was allocated to the FNHIS in the PPA 2008-11 to
pass through to states and municipalities. However, there is a large discrepancy between
the amount of funds passing through the FNHIS and the overall federal resources for low-
income housing. Specifically, resources for housing from the PAC (R$10.7 billion for
2007-10) and the MCMV stimulus package (R$20.5 billion for 2009-12) were not
channeled though the FNHIS.1 This is primarily due to flaws in the design of the Fund,
which are in the process of being addressed by the Government, as well as the limited
duration nature of these two programs. If FNHIS is meant to be the cornerstone of a new
system of relationship between the federal and local governments, developing direct
federal funding channels outside the FNHIS may make the whole new system weaker.
That said, it is important to note that while the funds for the PAC and MCMV are not
channeled through the FNHIS, the Ministry of Cities is responsible for providing the
main guidelines and criteria for monitoring the expenditures.

As part of the establishment of the FNHIS, states, the Federal District, and municipalities
were required to create local housing plans (PLHIS) by 2009 in order to access federal
resources. However, as of March 2009, only 26 municipalities had completed and
received approval of their PLHIS by CEF, and the National Secretariat of Housing
officially postponed the deadline to December 2010. The 26 municipalities that received
approval, however, only represent those that had requested financial support from the
Ministry of Cities to develop their plans. Several other cities, such as Sao Paulo, do have
housing plans but are not included in this list. According to the Ministry of Cities, a
survey would need to be conducted to determine the number of municipalities with
housing plans at this time.

Policy Area #2
The outcome of Policy Area #2: Reforms to Increase the Stability and Scale of Housing
Finance Market is rated satisfactory because of (i) the extremely large relative increase in
housing finance lending; (ii) well focused targeting of FGTS subsidies; and (iii) the
improved foreclosure process due to the introduction of the trust deed instrument. A
persisting challenge, however, is the limited expansion of the private housing finance
market to lower income groups.


1 Many of the upgrading projects in the PAC involved significant sanitation works. As such, it was determined that it
would be easier to route the housing funds through the sanitation budget. The direct end users of the MCMV funds are
not other federative bodies, as it was feared that state and municipal capacity would be overburdened given that they
are already responsible for implementing the PAC. This made it not possible to use the FNHIS under its current design.
To have used the FNHIS, states and municipalities would need to execute lengthy procurement processes (at least 8
months for a bidding process). For the 0 to 3 minimum wage portion of the MCMV program, the intention was to
remove part of this lengthy process and make it easier for the municipalities in terms of management. However, they
remain key players due to the fact that they are responsible for identifying the land, the developer, and the beneficiaries.
In addition, FNHIS was designed as an "accounting" fund, which is a limiting factor as it cannot, for instance, carry
over funds from one year to the other.



                                                         18

Between 2004 and 2008, the value of mortgages issued for existing and new housing
septupled (increasing from R$ 5.4 billion in 2004 to R$ 39.1 billion in 2008) and the
number and value of mortgage-backed securities issued and traded doubled (R$ 2.1
billion through 34 transactions in 2005 and R$ 4.9 billion through 72 transactions in
2008). It is important to note that while lending growth has been impressive, it is both
due to reforms prior to and as part of the project, as well as the improvement of macro-
economic conditions.

Another reason for the large increase in residential lending was reforms of the SBPE,
which mandates that a fixed percentage of savings held by a financial institution be used
for housing finance (Prior Action #5). Indeed, SBPE mortgages increased from R$ 3.0
billion in 2004 to R$ 29.9 billion in 2008. Instruments put in place to bring SBPE lending
down-market, specifically the multiplier system, have also shown success. Lending for
"low-value" properties increased from 3.2 percent of the outstanding portfolio in 2006 to
8.6 percent by 2008.

The issue of Law No. 10.931/2004 (Prior Action #4), which strengthened the Borrower's
housing credit regulatory framework, has also played a significant role in broadening the
housing finance system. Specifically, financial institutions interviewed stated that the
new collateral instrument introduced by Law No. 9.514/1997 and enhanced by Law No.
10.931/2004, the trust deed (alienação fiduciária), has proven much more effective than
mortgages in the case of foreclosure, which significantly reduces the time and transaction
cost.2 ABECIP (Brazilian Association of Real Estate Lending and Savings Institutions)
reports that the process of foreclosure in case of non-repayment can be completed in as
little as three months. As for the patrimônio de afetação or developer escrow account, it
has not been used as widely as expected due to high transaction costs.                              Instead,
developers have used special purpose vehicles to achieve the same objective with respect
to purchaser advance payments, and have also resorted to other means of financing their
projects than through purchaser advance payments.

In regard to improving the targeting and transparency of the FGTS subsidy program and
extending access to FGTS funds to additional financial institutions (other than CEF), the
results have been mixed. FGTS lending to households earning less than 5 minimum
wages per month decreased from 85.6 percent of contracts in 2006 to 71.4 percent in
2008. However, the targeting of FGTS subsidies remains well focused on the lowest
income groups, with 78 percent of the subsidies going to households earning less than 4
minimum wages in 2008. The on-lending of FGTS funds by private financial institutions
remains very limited despite that fact that R$ 3 billion of FGTS funds were earmarked for
private lenders' use under the Pró-Cotista program. Currently, five public and private
financial institutions effectively use FGTS funds for housing loans, out of ten that are
authorized to do so. Private lenders' interest remains limited due the low return relative to
high perceived risk and the large upfront costs required to develop new underwriting
systems for a different client group. In addition, lenders find the requirements for asset-

                                                    19

liability matching imposed by CEF's FGTS operating arm as onerous and requiring them
to develop new separate accounting systems, which also represents another important
upfront cost. It is important to note that, with the rapid increase in recent years of SBPE
deposits, private banks have not been in a rush to use FGTS funds, as they are mandated
to lend a minimum percentage of SBPE deposits for housing finance.

The objective of expanding access to housing finance showed progress during the last 4
years, despite the fact that no alternative lenders (the type of lender that usually caters to
underserved income categories) came to the market. Indeed, as described above, down-
market lending for both the SBPE and FGTS increased during the period. While the
average size of the housing loans increased (approximately R$ 26,000 in 2004 to
R$ 72,000 in 2008 or 175%), so did average per capita income in metropolitan areas
(approximately R$ 467 in 2004 to R$ 605 in 2008 or 30%), albeit at a lower rate.

Policy Area #3
The outcome of Policy Area # 3: Improving the Effectiveness of Federal Housing
Subsidies is rated moderately satisfactory because although a comprehensive housing
subsidy policy was developed and transparent subsidies included in the MCMV package,
very limited advances have been made in establishing a monitoring and evaluation
system. Of minor concern is the fact that the pilot PSH program did not become the
credit-linked upfront subsidy program envision in the DPL, since it served as a
transitional first step in realizing this type of program under the MCMV on a much larger
scale.

The main anticipated outcome for this policy area was that the Government would
develop a strategy for the allocation of all subsidies and programs across priority groups,
in line with overall housing policy goals. A second anticipated outcome was that a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the housing sector would be in
place. This first portion of this goal was accomplished in 2008 with the preparation and
publication of a comprehensive housing subsidy policy as a core component of the
National Housing Plan.

The development of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system,
however, is significantly behind schedule. A conceptual design of an M&E database
system was proposed as part of the PlanHab. While there is enthusiasm for establishing
the database system, as well and an internal capacity to perform program impact analyses,
the initiative has not moved forward since the DPL.

Although a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for housing has not been
established, periodic and long-term monitoring and evaluation do occur. First, the
development of the PlanHab involved an in depth evaluation of the housing sector.
Second, a committee closely monitors the PAC investments in urban upgrading with
representatives from the Ministry of Cities, CEF, and the Casa Civil who meet on a bi-
weekly basis. An Excel-based monitoring system was established and is updated every
week. This information is then presented for evaluation during the bi-weekly meetings. In
addition, as highlighted in the results framework, two evaluations of the housing rental



                                             20

support program PAR were carried out by CEF and the Ministry of Cities completed an
evaluation of the Programa de Subsidio à Habitação de Interesse Social (PSH) in 2007,
during which field visits and interviews were conducted.

The design of the MCMV stimulus package also demonstrates a consolidation of the
upfront subsidy policy initiated by the federal government under the PSH program and
used in the FGTS system.3 The stimulus package builds on the subsidy policy framework
of the PlanHab, and includes programs in which low-income housing will be financed by
a combination of savings, subsidies, and credit with predictable resources allocated over
the next 3 years (this includes R$20.5 billion from the OGU and R$7.5 billion from the
FGTS). This represents a great step forward in Brazilian low-income housing policy and
reflects the prominence that housing issues have under the current government. In
2001/2002, the Government launched an innovative upfront subsidy program - the PSH -
with funds coming from the Federal Government's budget and allocation done by
competitive auctions to financial institutions. This pilot, transitional program served as an
important first step in creating a "budget-financed upfront housing subsidy system for
very low income groups," which is now being realized under the MCMV stimulus
package on a large scale.4

Policy Area #4
The outcome of Policy Area # 4: Land and Urban Development is rated satisfactory due
to (i) the significant increase in the regularization of informal settlements through the
Programa Papel Passado; (ii) the significant increase in upgrading activities, primarily
through the PAC; and (iii) recent advances in reforming urban land development
legislation. Of minor concern is the slow progress in elaborating updated municipal
master plans.

The creation of the Programa Papel Passado, coordinated by the National Secretariat of
Urban Programs (Prior Action #9), aims to assist states, municipalities, public
administration entities and nonprofit civic associations in promoting land regularization
in informal settlements in urban areas. In the years 2004 and 2005 R $ 15.5 billion from
the federal budget were allocated to municipalities, states and civil society organizations
for land regularization activities in 382 settlements (65 cities in 20 states). By 2009,
2,578 settlements in 387 municipalities had initiated land regularization with direct and
indirect support from the Program. In addition to settlement-specific regularization
processes, it was anticipated by the DPL that municipalities would develop citywide



3In the model used by FGTS - and present in MCMV ­ there are two subsidies: an upfront grant to reduce to purchase
price of the home and a reduced interest rate loan to augment the size of the credit available to the household.
4 The PSH has faced multiple challenges. First, the program was designed to help bring private banks into the low-
income housing finance market. Since inception, five private commercial banks have been successful in the auctions
for the right to the upfront subsidies, the largest being Bradesco. Bradesco, as well as some other private banks,
determined that the program was too complicated for them, especially the income progressive nature of the upfront
subsidy. Nowadays, there is strong competition from small financial agents who made aggressive bids. These small
financial agents lack capital to provide the program's loan component, and instead serve as middlemen for the upfront
grants. In some cases, especially for the 1MW target group, the state or municipality complemented the subsidy with a
further subsidy, thereby providing a fully subsidized unit to the beneficiary. As such the program has been operating
mostly a non-credit-linked subsidy program.



                                                        21

regularization plans. According to the National Secretariat of Urban Programs, no
information has been collected regarding this indicator.

In the past 4 years, there has been a significant shift in urban development focus towards
urban upgrading. Indeed, funds allocated for urban upgrading increased from an
estimated R$1.1 billion (170,000 families) during 2003-2005 to R$8.5 billion (730,000
families) during 2006-2008. The large increase in families benefiting from urban
upgrading is due to OGU investments in the national program for precarious settlements
(starting in 2006) as well as the PAC (starting in 2007).

Finally, the draft Urban Land Subdivision Law, which was prepared as early as 1999 to
replace Law 6.766/79, is still under discussion in the House. The Council of Cities has
undertaken a large number of activities and seminars across the country to promote the
revised law, and a special commission is still supporting the finalization of a draft Law.
In the immediate term, to address urban land regulation bottlenecks, the Government's
MP No. 459 of March 25, 2009, for the MCMV program included important advances in
the area of land tenure regularization related to takings, technical requirements for land
regularization projects, streamlining the environmental licensing process, and devolving
to municipalities the authority to approve land regularization for low-income housing.

Progress in elaborating and updating municipal master plans (Planos Diretores) has been
only moderate. While the Statute of the City established that 1,682 municipalities needed
to develop and approve Participatory Master Plans by October 2006, currently only about
36 percent of them have realized this goal, and an additional 49.8 percent have started the
process.5

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory

The overall impact of the broad set of housing sector reforms implemented by the
Government of Brazil since 2005 have made a significant impact in improving access of
the poor to improved housing and serviced land. Moreover, while it is perhaps impossible
to directly attribute causality, the urban upgrading component of the PAC and the
housing sector focus within the new economic stimulus package are clearly related to the
strengthening of the national housing policy and institutional framework that resulted
from the DPL measures, in particular the improvements in housing subsidy policy and
land sector reforms initiated under the DPL.




5To promote the development of updated master plans, between 2003 and 2006, the National Secretariat of Urban
Programs implemented 388 awareness workshops that gathered 21,298 participants and reached professionals and
social representative from 1,349 municipalities in every Brazilian state.




                                                        22

In regard to the second part of the PDO - improving access of the poor to improved
housing and serviced land, "while maintaining fiscal discipline" ­ the Government of
Brazil has also performed in a satisfactory manner. Since the DPL, fiscal vulnerability
was decisively reduced due to tight fiscal policy. From 2003 to 2007, the public sector
primary surplus averaged 4 percent of GDP. For 2008, the public sector primary balance
should reach 4.5 percent. As a result, the public debt fell to 36 percent of GDP in 2008,
from 50.5 percent of GDP in 2002. Strong primary balances and declining interest rates
and debt led to the reduction of the public sector overall deficit from 4 percent in 2002 to
1.3 percent in 2008.

In the areas where progress was slower, such as the development of a housing sector
monitoring and evaluation system and the expansion of private lenders' down-market
penetration, continued work is ongoing.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

It was anticipated that most of the specific policy measures supported by the DPL on
housing finance, housing subsidy and land tenure regularization issues would have
significant positive poverty impacts. Performance outcomes of the program, such as the
down-market movements of the FGTS and SBPE, significant increase in housing subsidy
funds for low-income households, and the sharp increase in families benefiting from
urban upgrading investments, appear to confirm this supposition.

Similarly, the subsequent launch by the Government of the PAC, which focuses, among
other activities, on infrastructure delivery and upgrading of low-income settlements, is
credited with significant improvement in living conditions of low-income groups. Most
recently, the MCMV program also promises to have significant pro-poor impacts. The
direct impact of such programs of enabling low-income households to access new
housing units and/or improve their existing shelter conditions in squatter/informal
settlements and the expected impacts of homeownership and tenure regularization on
vulnerability reduction and serving as a foundation to improve living conditions are likely
to have significant poverty alleviation effects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The DPL and its accompanying TAL, have had positive impacts on the institutional
strengthening of the Ministry of Cities, and especially the National Secretariat of Housing.
Specific institutional strengthening actions within the DPL include the establishment of
the inter-ministerial working group between the Ministry of Cities and the Ministry of
Finance and the establishment and operationalization of the FNHIS Management Council.
The inter-ministerial working group has proven sustainable, and the model continues to
be used for the implementation of the PAC and the preparation of the MCMV program,
in cooperation with Casa Civil. In addition, the process of developing the PlanHab, and
especially the regional and inter-ministerial workshops, strengthened the Secretariat's


                                             23

capacity to lead the housing policy dialogue at multiple federative levels. Finally, this
evolution within the Secretariat, and the Ministry of Cities more broadly, is evidenced by
the leading role that they are playing in the implementation of the PAC and the design
and launch of the MCMV stimulus package.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One of the outcomes of the DPL was to establish a strong foundation for sector dialogue
and consultation between the Government and the private sector, including private
housing lenders and the development and construction industry. While consultations
between Government and private sector occur frequently, the strengthening of public-
private consultations in the housing sector was also due to the Bank's convening power
and to the joint attendance by many Brazilian public officials from the Ministries of
Finance and Cities as well as from private lenders and developers of the low-income
housing finance executive course held annually at the Wharton School, University of
Pennsylvania (to which the Bank facilitated attendance). Such links have allowed several
affordable housing developers to prepare a joint presentation to Casa Civil and the
Ministries of Finance and Cities on the challenges facing the industry's down-market
penetration, as part of the consultations around the MCMV program.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The risk that the reform actions taken under the DPL will not be maintained is low. The
reforms to the housing sector have strong legitimacy and political support, and are not
likely to be reversed. Moreover, in many cases, the Government has already
mainstreamed policy changes, such as land regularization, upfront subsidy programs,
integration of housing policy formulation, and sub-national strengthening, and launched
new programs upon this foundation (e.g. the PAC and MCMV).

However, there are some internal and external risks that could delay some of the
development outcomes that are expected in the medium to long-term. One internal risk is
that the subsidies for low-income housing will contract in the future. This has the
potential of being an opportunity to push for further sector reforms to enhance subsidy
efficiency, targeting and leveraging private lenders to expand down-market to cater to
low-income groups.

Another risk is that CEF's expanded mandate under the MCMV program could delay the
reform efforts aiming to stimulate private lenders to further expand down-market,
especially in the 5-10 minimum wage segment. CEF, as a public bank, has been called
upon to serve as a key implementer of counter-cyclical policies, and in this case the
MCMV is one of the key measures. Increasing CEF's role as a large government
institution at the center of the housing finance system, tasked with implementing
government's housing policy, could be perceived as hampering the opening of the


                                              24

housing finance market which was one of the development objectives. While it is
acknowledged that many government initiatives to fight the economic crisis are based on
quick government intervention, there is still some concern that such a move may appear
to go against the commitment taken by the Government to expand private lenders'
participation. However, as explained in Section 3.2, the low-income segment of the
market targeted by the MCMV program, especially in the 0-5 minimum wage range, is
still not particularly attractive to private banks at this moment, which makes it necessary
for CEF to play this implementation role.

Finally, an external risk is that private banks and housing developers contract business,
especially among middle and lower-income markets, due to the international economic
crisis. The launch of the MCMV program was specifically intended as a mitigation
measure against such risk.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Ratings: Satisfactory

The program of reforms agreed with the Government was based on extensive analytical
work done by the Bank during preparation of the DPL and strong dialogue with the
Borrower. Indeed, the Bank identified, facilitated preparation of, and appraised the
operation such that it was most likely to achieve planned development outcomes. The
Bank team was effective at drawing upon international and domestic expertise regarding
the multiple sector issues. Importantly, there was close cooperation between the
Government and the Bank team and the full integration of the Bank support in a policy
making process that commenced well before the project was launched. Comprehensive
and detailed Aide Memoires of Bank missions during preparation and supervision attest
to an in-depth understanding of sector issues, which in turn owes to the extent and quality
of earlier sector work and composition of the Bank's team. The Bank took further steps to
ensure quality and tried to minimize the risk of a reform reversal by preparing an
accompanying technical assistance loan, which was envisioned as a tool to provide
continued support to the Government and the reform agenda.

The one area where improvement could have occurred was the results framework and
M&E indicators. A large number of indicators were selected, including some which do
not appear very relevant for measuring the intended outcomes of the policy reforms.
Often, the indicators selected lacked targets and some lacked baseline values, making it
difficult to measure improved performance. Moreover, a responsible agency for the
monitoring of the indicators was not identified.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
Ratings: Satisfactory

DPLs inherently put more emphasis on preparation than supervision, especially in a case
of a single tranche loan based on meeting prior actions such as this one. The Bank's
involvement with the Borrower regarding the DPL continued after the DPL was approved.
Two supervision missions were conducted in January 2006 and December 2006, and the
resulting Aide Memoires remained of high quality. The technical assistance loan was
also put in place as a tool for continuing support for the housing reform agenda, which
has allowed for another supervisory platform for the DPL's outcomes. That said, once the
DPL closed and when it became clear that the second DPL may not take place, the
engagement between the Bank and the Government on the housing sector waned.
Despite the fact that the TAL remained under implementation, this instrument did not
prove to be appropriate to maintain a solid follow-up on issues such as performance
indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance rating reflects primarily the solid analytical foundation
and the quality of sector dialogue established with the Government during the preparation
of the DPL. The quality of supervision was also satisfactory. The results framework and
the M&E indicators represented the one area where some improvement was warranted.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

Government performance is rated satisfactory because it displayed strong ownership of
the program by instituting major policy changes as prior actions to the program.
Moreover, the Government has continued implementing policy actions within the
framework of the agreed reform agenda and integrating housing sector growth into key
national development programs. That the two largest Government investment programs
over the past four years focused on the housing sector is proof of the importance that the
Government places on the housing sector. Finally, the government has had a successful
record in maintaining fiscal balance in recent years, including during and following the
DPL.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

Multiple ministries and public agencies were involved in the preparation and
implementation of the DPL through the commitment of staff and involvement in the
policy formulation dialogue. The most relevant include the Ministry of Finance, Ministry
of Cities, and the Caixa Econômica Federal. The participation of the ministries and
agencies ensured the quality of the program design and achievement of development
outcomes. Their close collaboration, jointly, with Casa Civil and with the private sector,
was also an important foundation to the implementation of the sector reforms, during the
preparation of the DPL and subsequently under the PAC and MCMV programs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

Strong ownership by the Government and the active participation of highly qualified staff
from ministries and public agencies ensured the quality of preparation and
implementation of the DPL.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)
The lessons learned from the DPL include:

    (i)     Government participation in the analytical preparation and formulation of the
            policy reform agenda is key to ensuring long-term commitment. While some
            specific activities within the results framework did not evolve as planned, the
            Government has shown a clear commitment, through several large scale
            programs, to developing the housing sector based on the conceptual policy
            guidelines espoused in the DPL.
    (ii)    Linking housing construction to economic stimulus plans is an effective and
            politically palatable means of spurring housing construction for specific
            income groups as well as generating employment. The launch of the Minha
            Casa, Minha Vida stimulus package has gained broad support within Brazil
            and will catalyze housing programs identified in the National Housing Plan.
    (iii)   The use of the trust deed in housing finance instead of the traditional
            mortgage has proven to function extremely well in a context like Brazil
            because it provides a stronger incentive to pay since title is only transferred
            when the loan is paid in full. Indeed, loans based on trust deed in Brazil have
            had a lower foreclosure rate than loans based on other forms of security like a
            mortgage lien.
    (iv)    The inherent focus in DPLs on preparation relative to supervision and the use
            of single tranche DPLs based on prior actions makes it difficult for the Bank
            to support the achievement of medium and long-term sector goals and reforms
            and curtails the ability to measure outcomes. As such, the design of a series of
            DPL with an accompanying technical assistance loan is conceptually strong
            because it facilitates a continuity of support for the sectoral reform agenda.
            However, such design requires careful sequencing to ensure that the TAL is
            concurrent with the DPL series.
    (v)     DPLs with reform agendas that require specific actions from the private sector,
            require the identification of tools to ensure an open dialogue between the
            public and private sectors during implementation.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Secretariat of International Affairs within the Ministry of Finance received the draft
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for the Housing Sector DPL on
May 22, 2009. This draft was disseminated to involved Government agencies for review
and comment. On June 10, 2009, a meeting was held at the Ministry of Finance to discuss
feedback from the various agencies. Subsequently, on June 23, 2009 a meeting was held
between the Government and the World Bank team responsible for the ICR to discuss the
comments and agree upon revisions to the text. This Annex summarizes and consolidates
the main content observations made by the Secretariat of Housing (Ministry of Cities);
the Secretariat of the Treasury, the Secretariat of Economic Policy, and the Secretariat of
International Affairs (Ministry of Finance); the Securities and Exchange Commission; the
Central Bank; and the Caixa Econômica Federal.

In addition to the correction of some specific data points, the following issues and
clarifications were raised with the World Bank team:


Housing Sector Monitoring and Evaluation
Many advances have been made in establishing monitoring and evaluation systems
within the housing sector in Brazil during the last four years, especially related to specific
programs.

For example, all housing and urban upgrading related investments in the PAC are closely
monitored by representatives from the Ministry of Cities, CEF, and the Casa Civil who
meet on a bi-weekly basis. A monitoring system, including status of the projects within
municipalities, was established and is updated every week. This information is then
presented for evaluation during the bi-weekly meetings. CEF's monitoring of its housing
related loan programs has also improved. This led to changing terms of its construction
material loans and reducing non-performing loans.

In regard to periodic evaluations of programs, two evaluations the PAR program were
carried out by CEF. The Ministry of Cities also completed an evaluation of the PSH in
2007, during which field visits and interviews were conducted. Finally, the development
of the PlanHab involved an in depth evaluation of the housing sector, including housing
and land markets, demand, supply and subsidy issues.

The establishment of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the hosuing
sector is currently under development within the Ministry of Cities. As part of the
PlanHab, a conceptual design of an M&E database system was proposed It would build
on the infrastructure that is already in place as part of the Cadunico (Cadastro Único, a
household cadastre focused on poor neighborhoods and used as the basis for social
development programs; it is operated by CEF with inputs from municipalities and is
under the oversight of the Ministry for Social Development) and Cadmut (Cadastro
Nacional dos Mutuários, the consolidated cadastre of housing subsidy recipients,
operated by CEF under the oversight of the Ministry of Cities). It would leverage the



                                           32

lessons learned from the implementation of the Bolsa Familia program. It is envisioned
that the database would be managed by the National Secretariat of Housing, with the
logistical support of CEF.


Design of the National Fund for Social Housing (FNHIS)
At the time when the FNHIS was designed, its main purpose was to consolidate federal
housing funding as a means of better coordinating housing policy in the country.
However, the design of the Fund has limited its use in the implementation of recent
programs, specifically the PAC and the MCMV.

The first limitation is that FNHIS was designed as an "accounting" fund, which means
that funds cannot be carried over from one fiscal year to the next. As such, if a project is
delayed, the funds that have not been disbursed are at risk of being allocated to other uses.
For this reason, upgrading resources under the PAC (which has a multi-year
implementation period) were channeled through the sanitation budget.

The second limitation is that resources are passed through the FNHIS from the federal
government to states and municipalities. These federative bodies are then required to
adhere to all public procurement regulations. The execution of lengthy procurement
processes, which could last for at least 8 months each, would greatly hamper the quick
implementation of an initiative such as the MCMV program.

With these limitations in mind, the fact that housing resources for special programs like
the PAC and MCMV have used channels outside FNHIS does not indicate a weakness in
the coordination of housing policy, but rather the need to redesign the Fund to make it
more flexible in use. The process of redesigning the FNHIS is currently underway and
was analyzed as part of the National Housing Plan. Moreover, it is important to note that
while the funds for the PAC and MCMV are not channeled through the FNHIS, the
Ministry of Cities is responsible for providing the main guidelines and criteria for
monitoring their expenditures.




Expansion of FGTS lending to private banks
The issue of limited participation of private banks in the application of financial
resources from the FGTS for housing is attributed, in the ICR, to some outstanding
operational issues. Since 2005, the World Bank has argued on behalf of the private banks,
including to the FGTS Council itself, that excessive regulations of the funds (distribution
requirements by geographic location and income bracket, for example) and the lack of
flexibility with the funding (the FGTS rules provide the funds after the loan is made,
rather than in advance) limit expansion of the FGTS funding to private banks. However,
this argument ignores the primary factors that limit private banks' interest in using FGTS
funds, specifically that FGTS has a small spread and is expensive for those banks who
already have to worry about meeting their lending mandate under the rules of the SBPE.
Moreover, with the introduction of the "low property value" multiplier into the SBPE



                                          33

system, the SBPE lending started to reach into the same income range as the FGTS,
making accessing the FGTS funds even less attractive.

In addition, the recent boom in savings account deposits in 2007 and 2008, served as a
further deterrent from seeking out FGTS funds because the private banks were occupied
with fulfilling their mandatory lending obligations.

Attempts have been made to induce participation by the private banks in FGTS lending.
Since the first discussions regarding the DPL, there had been a group of about a dozen
financial institutions approved to access FGTS resources. Some of these agents specialize
in sanitation sector lending operations where the spread is greater than in housing finance.
In 2008, with the launch of Pró-Cotista Program, which allows the use of FGTS resources
to income groups above 10 minimum wages, private financial actors requested resources
and created the need to supplement the budget by R$ 3 billion. This amount was
specifically allocated to private banks. Frustratingly, the private banks that had requested
these resources have not used them.


Role of CEF in the Minha Casa, Minha Vida stimulus package
With the launch of MCMV, CEF consolidated its role as the operational arm of the
Government in the implementation of public policies in the area of housing. As a public
financial institution, CEF focuses its effort on assisting the segment of the population that
constitutes the overwhelming majority of the housing deficit, that is, families that earn up
to 5 minimum wages. This role could be shared with the private banks - at least with
regard to funding - but the strict rules for using these resources, including the requirement
to target low income groups who are not the traditional clientele of private banks,
hampers the ability of the private banks to assume this role in the short term. Therefore,
the expansion of the role of the CEF as a major government institution at the center of the
housing finance system is a reality that is necessary to drive the counter-cyclical
measures of the Government at this moment, specifically in regard to the MCMV
program's goals of providing housing to low-income segments of the population.


Evolution of the PSH program
The PSH, as a pioneering program of the Government to link upfront grants with housing
loans, was instrumental in the evolution of this type of housing program in the country.
Specifically, the lessons learned with the PSH have been essential in designing the
housing subsidy component of the MCMV program.

During the duration of the PSH, multiple public and private banks have participated in
the actions for the upfront grants. Some of these banks determined that the program was
too complicated for them, in addition to having concerns with the very low-income target
market, low level of profitability, or the dispersion of projects across the country. As the
program evolved, the Government decided to put more emphasis on meeting the needs of
the lowest income groups through greater participation of states and municipalities, and




                                             34

therefore the upfront grant portion (parcelamento) of the program took prominence over
the housing loan component (financiamento).

Clarification regarding Certificados de Recebíveis Imobiliários (CRIs)
The indicators table in the Project Appraisal Document includes two errors related to
CRIs. First, the issuance and trading of CRIs are "registered," and not authorized.
Secondly, the government agency with which the CRIs are registered is the Securities and
Exchange Commission (CVM), not the Central Bank (BACEN). The sentence should
read as "Number and value of mortgage-backed securities issued and traded (CRIs)
accredited by CVM". The Results Framework should be revised to reflect these
inaccuracies.

Clarification of Law No. 10.931/2004 (Prior Action #4)
Law No. 10.931 did not introduce the trust deed instrument. This instrument was created
by Law No. 9.514 in 1997. Law No. 10.931 did, however, make small adjustments to
Law No. 9.514, primarily to allow the use of the trust deed instrument for specific types
of leasehold transactions. The enactment of Law No. 10.931 was much more important in
regard to the establishment of the patrimônio de afetação or developer escrow account

Annex 8: List of Prior Actions from the Legal Agreement

1     A national housing policy (Política Nacional de Habitação) was issued by MOC and
      approved by the Borrower's Council of Cities (Conselho das Cidades) in November
      2004, defining principles, guidelines and general objectives for the housing sector, and
      presenting proposals for the formulation of a national housing plan, to be discussed
      within the Borrower's government, which includes goals, investment plans and
      performance indicators for the housing sector.
2     The Borrower's Ministers of Finance and of Cities have agreed to create an inter-
      ministerial working group to monitor the impact of Resolution 3259 and other housing
      market-based instruments, and to elaborate proposals to rationalize the Borrower's
      housing subsidy programs.
3     Bill of Law PLC No. 36/2004, which provides for the creation of the national social
      interest housing fund (Fundo Nacional de Habitação de Interesse Social) to coordinate
      transfers, subsidies and funding structures for low income housing beneficiaries, was
      approved by the Borrower's House of Representatives (Câmara dos Deputados) on
      June 3, 2004.
4     The Borrower's Law No. 10.931/2004 was enacted to strengthen the Borrower's
      housing credit regulatory framework by: (a) regulating real estate credit instruments;
      (b) establishing that the land and the structures or improvements thereon under any real
      estate development are assets separate from those of the real estate developer
      (patrimônio de afetação), introducing more efficient means of inspection of the real
      estate development, and making feasible the continuity of construction works in case
      of bankruptcy of the developer; (c) simplifying the tax regime of the assets referred to
      in (b) above; and (d) establishing a more efficient procedure for judicial resolution of
      disputes between real estate developers and purchasers of real estate units.
5     Resolution 3259 revised prior regulations dealing with the mandatory use of savings
      account funds for housing financing to bring them in line with the capacity of the
      institutions in the housing and finance sectors, and created incentives for housing
      financing for the low-income population.
6     Resolution No. 460, of FGTS Conselho Curador (Managing Council), dated December
      14, 2004, was approved to improve the targeting and transparency of the FGTS interest
      rate subsidy program by: (a) including the creation of an explicit upfront subsidy
      differentiated by income group; (b) establishing that, by 2008, all FGTS resources will
      benefit households with a monthly income equivalent to less than 10 minimum wages;
      and (c) increasing the amount of credit available for households with a monthly income
      equivalent to less than six minimum wages in 2005.
7     The Borrower's Law No. 10998, of December 15, 2004, revised the Programa de
      Subsidio à Habitação de Interesse Social (PSH), a transparent upfront housing subsidy
      program financed from the Borrower's budget, which now may be implemented
      through schemes that may or may not include additional credit lines.
8     A framework was established by MOC for the monitoring and evaluation system of the
      Borrower's housing program, with particular attention to the subsidies component.
9     The Borrower issued, in 2003, a national policy for sustainable urban land tenure
      regularization (política nacional de regularização fundiária sustentável ­ Programa
      Papel Passado) to secure land titles to the poor, and has been implementing such
      policy in a satisfactory manner.
