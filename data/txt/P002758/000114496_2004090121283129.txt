Dear Sir:
Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2867-TA):
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
I refer to the letter of August 28, 2000 (ref. no. TYC/B/40/83) from 
the Permanent Secretary of your Ministry requesting amendments of the 
Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement) for the Urban Sector 
Rehabilitation Project dated August 9, 1996 between the United Republic of 
Tanzania and the International Development Association (the Association) in 
order to reallocate funds among disbursement categories as proposed in your 
letter to allow a well-rounded completion of the project.  This is a request 
for a second amendment, the first amendment having been made on July 6, 1999. 
I
am pleased to advise you that the Association agrees to your request 
and consequently proposes to hereby amend the Agreement as follows:
1.
The table in Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended to 
read in its entirety as set forth in Attachment 1 to this letter.
2.
Paragraph 2(d) of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended by the 
addition of “salaries and project office rent” to the definition of 
“Incremental Operating Costs” to read:
“the term ‘incremental operating costs’ means expenditures 
incurred for fuel, 
maintenance and insurance of vehicles, project 
office rent, office supplies and minor office 
equipment, utilities, and 
salaries and field and travel allowances for project staff.” 
If you agree to the proposed amendments, please countersign and date 
both duplicate originals of this letter in the space provided below and 
return one countersigned duplicate original to us for our records.  The 
amendments shall come into effect on the date of countersignature by you.
Sincerely,
