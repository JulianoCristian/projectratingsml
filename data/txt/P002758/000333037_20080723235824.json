Tanzania were as follows: outcome\n            was satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            modest; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: projects dispersed over a wide\n            geographical area. In this case, success came from: (i)\n            logistics must be well worked out for the successful\n            implementation of large packaging works into larger\n            contracts to be undertaken by experienced large firms able\n            to operate across these large areas; (ii) assembling design\n            work already done under earlier operations; and (iii) fully\n            deploying the Bank country office to ensure regular contact\n            with client towns. Project experience demonstrates that\n            direct technical assistance and training with on-the-job\n            experience o f executing priority physical investments\n            continues to be a winning combination for improving local\n            government municipal management and urban service delivery.\n            Project design should focus only upon intended outcomes that\n            can feasibly be achieved and whose success can convincingly\n            be demonstrated. Claims to attain higher level intended\n            outcomes-economic development and poverty reduction in this\n            case should only be made when there is a convincing\n            rationale that project interventions can achieve them, and\n            also a sound Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system to\n            record the baseline, target and endline values of indicators\n            to measure the achievement."}, "docdt": "2008-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
