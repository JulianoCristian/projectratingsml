Establishing base-line data for\n            the key output/impact indicators for a project and tracking\n            it over the implementation period will make quantitative\n            information available.

The supervision strategy for large\n            infrastructure projects must be well structured and should\n            be followed in a disciplined fashion, and include exhaustive\n            site visits. Creation of autonomous Urban Water and Sewerage\n            Authority (UWSAs) with ring-fenced revenue has proven to be\n            an effective institutional arrangement for sustainable\n            service delivery.
