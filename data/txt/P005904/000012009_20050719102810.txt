    OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independencein evaluation.


 Aboutthis Report
       The Operations EvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two
  purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verify that the Bank's work is
  producingthe expected results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough
 the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percentof
 the Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperations for assessment,preferenceis given to those that are
 innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
  ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave requested assessments;and those that are likely to generate
 important lessons.The projects,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessment support larger evaluation
 studies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review;the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 Aboutthe OED RatingSystem
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.orgloedleta-mainpage.html).
      Relevanceof Objectives: The extentto which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance.Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Susfainabilify: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements andlor (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     BankPerformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        Attached is aProject Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the Basic
EducationProject inYemen (Credit 2412-RY). The project was approved for a credit o f
US$19.7 million equivalent inJuly 1992. The project closed on April 30, 2001, and
US$0.95 million was canceled. The Netherlands provided cofinancing o fUS$8.5 million.

       This project was selected for assessmentinorder to study the effectiveness o f
Bank strategy ina poor country that has been declared ready for the Fast-Track Initiative
inorder to achieve Educationfor All by2015. The assessmentcontributes to background
work for an ongoing Operations EvaluationDepartment (OED) study o f the Bank's
assistanceto basic education.

       The PPAR is basedon the following sources: Project or Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), loan agreements for the
projects, and project files, particularly the supervision reports. An OED missionvisited
Yemen inDecember 2004 to interview officials andbeneficiaries, observe instructionin
schools, and collect other pertinent information. Fieldvisits took place at a sample o f 10
basic education schools that hadbenefited from the projects. The author thanks the
government officials who received the mission for their extensive cooperation.

       Following standard OED procedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to the
relevant government officials and agencies for their review and comments but none were
received.

  Summary

         Since 1972, Yemen has implemented 19 IDA-financedprojects (including four in
 the former People's DemocraticRepublic o fYemen) designedto increase its ability to
 provide education at all levels. The goal o f the Basic EducationProjectwas to increase
 female enrollments dramatically by buildinga large number o f schools and hiringfemale
 teachers who would receive training and incentives to serve inrural areas. Project
 objectives were to: (a) increase the school participation rate o f girls inrural areas; and (b)
 lay the foundation for improving the quality o f education.

         Most o f the plannedachievements were realized, and constructionwas double the
 targeted amount (thanks to added financing from the Dutch government); 1,124
 classrooms were built inremote rural areas rather than the initial target o f 600. The new
 classrooms had space for about 31,617 additional students. Curricula for grades 1-6 were
 revisedand textbooks were produced and issued every year to students free o f charge.
 However, budget constraints reduced the hiring of female teachers bymore than halfo f
 appraisal targets. Important in-servicetraining activities were delayed andwere not
 carried out effectively.

        Enrollment has been climbing since the 1980s, but the project-related
 interventions amplified achievements. Inthe governorates where the project intervened,
the female gross enrollment rate increased from 34 percent in 1991/92 to 43 percent in
 1999/2000. Insome areas, gross female enrollment rates moved from almost 0 in 1990/91
to 35 percent in 1999/2000.

        Trend data on student achievement are not available; the project financedbaseline
testing ingrades 4 and 6, however. The vast majority (86-93 percent) o f studentswho
were tested usinga sample-based assessment scored lower thanthe mastery criterion o f
70 percent inmath and science. Thus, the government goal o f improving human
resources through female enrollment i s possibly not beingrealized. The government has
recognized this and has made quality improvements inthe curriculum, widely distributed
new textbooks, developed an assessment system, and initiated inservicetraining and
improvements in supervision. The quantitative and qualitative improvements o f multiple
projects constitute buildingblocks o f the government's efforts towards Education for All
by2015.

        Overall, the outcome o f the Basic EducationProject i s ratedsatisfactory because
girls' participationincreasedbeyondexpectations. Institutionaldevelopment impact is
ratedmodest becausethe ability o f schools and district offices to provide quality
education tailored to the needs o f the poor (particularly girls) remains limited.
Sustainability i s rated likely becausethe schools built are likely to be sustained; despite
the highrecurrent expenditures created, donor financing to help achieve Educationfor
All maymaintainenrollmenttrends.Bankperformance andborrower performanceare
rated satisfactory.

        This assessment confirms a number o f OED lessons from the education sector:

                                        X



0 Countries that have limited literacyrates and few schools may benefit from a
  strategy that simultaneously pursuesboth supply-side(school construction,
  teacher training) and demand-side (public campaigns to enrol girls) interventions.
  These activities may be carried out through multiple well-coordinated operations.

0 Evenifenrollment increases, potentialgains may be lost when studentsdrop out.
  School authorities must be sensitized to the needs andproblems o frural students
  and actively try to prevent drop out, particularly among those not yet functionally

0 Byitself, studentenrollment does not guaranteeacquisitionofbasic skills. It is
  also necessary to use classroom time wisely, ensure that textbooks are available
  for students to take home, provide in-service teacher training, and allow for
  systematic supervision. Without attention to quality, basic skills may be acquired
  late, and students may drop out before learningto read fluently andto calculate.

  budgetary constrains and the low numbers o f qualifiedwomen willing to work in
  rural areas. Recruiting women who already live inrural areas, even ifthey have a
  relatively limited education, may be a sound way to increase the number o f
  female teachers available.

  1.       Background

  1.1      This document presents evidence regardingthe achievement o f objectives o fthe Basic
 EducationProject. It also presents evidence regarding the extent to which Yemen i s progressing
 towards the achievement o f the Education for All initiative.

  1.2      With a per capita income of US$510, Yemen i s a low-income country that was divided
 before 1990 into the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the socialist People's Democratic
 Republic (PDRY). The economy o fYemenremains largely agriculture-based with a population
 of 19.2 million (increasing at arate o f 2.9 percent annually) and with halfits citizens under 16
 years o f age. Almost 72 percent o f the population lives inrural areas. The literacy rate i s about
 50 percent, and there are largediscrepancies ingross primary-school enrollments betweenboys
 and girls (97 and 64 percent).' Providing social services to a large population o f young people
 represents a heavy burdenon taxpayers.


 Bank Sector Strategy

 1.3       Since 1972, IDA has supported 19 education projects inNorth Yemen (YAR) and South
Yemen(PDRY),2 totalingUS$286.3 millioninIDA funds. O fthese projectsthree were active in
2004 (Figure 1; Annex A, Table A-1). The first 10 (1974-1993) financed vocational and
nonformal education as well as teacher training, and their objectives typically were to (a)
alleviate acute shortages o f skilledmanpower; (b) train local instructors; (c) increase the
numbersof student places available for the supported types of education; and (d) improve
curricula andprovide technical assistance. The supported institutions trained teachers with
lower-secondary education as well as primary-school graduates (Grades 1-6) intrades such as
automotive mechanics, electricity, and carpentry. Completedoperations include teacher training
projects as well as the Basic Educationproject, which i s the subject o fthis review (Figure 1).
The active projects include a sector credit, a higher education project, and a child development
project. With the exception o f two vocational-technical education projects, OEDhas rated
outcomes o fthe Yemeni education projects satisfactory (Annex A, Table A-2). Despite frequent
implementation difficulties, the government has been intent on improving its humanresource
base and education o f girls. Government sector strategy has beenaligned with the Millennium
Development Goal o f universalcompletion o fprimary education by 2015. Because o f its
strategic vision and demonstrated capacity to implement projects, Yemen i s one o f the first
countries to receive support under the Bank-led Fast-Track Initiative that i s expected to
accelerate progress toward universalprimary school completionby 2015 and attainment o f
Education for All (EFA).The 2002 poverty reduction strategy paper specifically includes human
development as an objective toward achievingthese goals3

 1.4          The Basic EducationProject (known as BEP) was a cornerstone o f the 1990s' efforts
toward EFA.It was appraised in 1991, shortly after the country's unification. At that time, there
were 1.16 millionboys enrolled inprimary education, a number approximate to the cohort aged
6-11; but there were only 0.44 million girls enrolled, althoughthe cohort aged 6-11had 1.08
million girls. Therewere big differences among governorates inthe levels o f enrollment as well
as between rural and urbanareas. The former north had lower enrollment rates than the former
south, and difficulties in financing the deliveryo f education. The system depended heavily on
foreign teachers, mainly Egyptians and Sudanese; foreign teacher payments accounted for 44
percent o fprimary-level teacher payments and 62 percent o f secondary-level teacher payment^.^
Thus, the Bank supported adual government policy: increasing enrollment rates, particularly
among girls, while replacing foreign teachers with Yemenis.

1.5          The Basic EducationProject was focused on increasing enrollments and training existing
teachers while the "Yemenization" effort was undertaken by the primary and secondary teacher
training projects (Cr. 1773 and 2222). These were subsequentlysupported by the sector

  Objectives of the Assessed Project

  1.8       Project objectives were: (a) to increase the school participationrate o f girls inrural areas;
  and(b) to lay the foundation for improvingthe quality of education. To increase enrollments,
  particularly for girls, the project sought, first, to buildschools and, second, to hire female
  teachers who would be trained and givenincentives to serve inrural areas.

  1.9       Components were (see activities and targets inAnnex A Table A-2):

  (a) Expandingaccess for girls inrural areas: by (i)             building, extending, rehabilitating, equipping,
  and hrnishing classrooms inimpoverisheddistricts and (ii)                   recruiting and training female
  teachers for project schools.

  (b) Enhancingteacher effectiveness through (i) education, development andprinting
                                                              distance
  instructional modules for an in-service training program, expansion o f a buildingthat was to be
  usedfor this purpose, provisionof educational audiovisual media, technical assistance, and
  studies.

 (c) Improvement o f educational quality: (i)            curriculum and textbook development capabilities at
 the educational research and development center, typesetting capacity at the MOE textbook
 press, and (ii)   development o f standardized achievement tests and enhancement o f the
 supervisory capacity inthe guidance and evaluation department.


 2.        ImplementationoftheAssessed Project

 2.1       The project constructed classrooms incommunities chosen from an initial list o f 1,140
 rural communities o f 1,000-2,500 inhabitants that had female enrollment lower than 20 percent
 according to the 1986 census. Initially 385 communities were selected, and 600 project
 classrooms (3-rOOm schools) with latrines6were spread out over 6-8 governorates. Agreement
was reachedbetweenthe MOE and the communities that girls would have priority inattending
the schools if space were inadequate.

2.2        Constraints. Activities were delayed due to a civil war that started soon after the project
became effective in 1994. Disbursementswere slow until aproject implementation unit (PIU)
was established in 1997. The PIUwas staffed with engineers, and there was little input from
educators. At times, governance was weak. Financial audit reports repeatedly suggested that the
government counterpart financing was inflated, and project documents contain reports that
smaller classrooms had been constructed thanbids had specified.' Contractors abandoned some


6. Although major environmentalimpactswere not anticipated, the project was classifiedas Category B.The environmental
managementplanwas to ensure adequatesite selectionfor school construction,avoiding loss of vegetationandtrees. In
earthquake-pronezones, appropriatedesignswere to be used, and flood zones were to be avoided. Asbestos productswould be
barredinnew construction.Any exposed lead-basedpaint inbuildings would beneutralizedthrough an appropriatemethod, and
new constructionwould not use lead-basedpaints. Clauses includedincontract documents were to ensure the appropriate
disposalof constructionwastes, particularly hazardous substances. The extent to which these guidelineswere followed could not
be verified by the OEDmission.
7. Onthe report datedJune 11, 1997,RajehA1Awade, public accountant, for year 1995 statedthat government counterpart
financing was only US$25,314rather than US$l64,509, as it was reported(an overstatement of US$139,195). Similarly, in 1996
the same accountingfirmconcludedthat governmentcounterpartfinancing was US$653,930rather thanthe required

                                                                  5


  primary-teacher training centers after materials prices increased and also left some schools
  unfinished.However, there is no evidence inthe files regarding the resolution ofthese situations.
  Duringappraisal itwas foreseen that communities wouldbeinvolvedinconstructionand
  planning,' andbuildingcosts hadbeenestimated at US$l50per square meter, but communities
  had fewer resources than expected and limitedinvolvement. Constructioncosts were higher,
  US$180per meter.

  2.3        The following activities were carried out during implementation (Annex A, Table A-3):

  Objective 1: Increasing schoolparticipation for girls in rural areas

             Component (a): Expanding accessfor girls in rural areas: With additional aid provided
 bythe Netherlands after project initiation, 1,124 classrooms were built-nearly double the target
 o f 600 - andhalfo fthem were exclusively for girls. Promotional campaigns were carried out.
 Enrollmentsrose by 31,6 17, nearly a thirdhigher than the target o f 24,000. Teachers' houses and
 hostels were built but were eventually usedas classrooms, becauseteachers preferred to live near
 families. Due to a legal change inteacher pay scale, allowances for rural service were given
 rather than housingincentives. Ultimately, budgetary limitations meant that only 452 (57
 percent) o f the expected 800 female teachers were hiredby the end o f the project. Overall,
 however, the implementation o fthis component was satisfactory.
 Objective 2: Laying thefoundation for improved quality of education

             Component (b): Enhancing teacher effectiveness. A distance training center was built that
 was to promote teacher training through videoconferencing and audiovisual means. Some
 district-level training centers received audiovisual equipment,but the videoconferencing
 technology available at the time was unsuitable for large-scale implementationinYemen.
 Overall, few in-service training activities were carried                O U ~ . ~

 was unsatisfactory.

            Component (c): Improvement of educational quality. Curricula were updated for grades
 1-6, and textbooks were developed that were printed after the end o fthe project. The project
provided appropriate stafftraining for textbook development. It also provided technical
assistance, inconjunction with UNICEF, for the development o fthe competency-based
Monitoring LearningAchievement (MLA) tests and administrationto a nationwide sample o f
about 200 schools.'o Overall implementation o f this component was satisfactory.

9. The lack o f an educator inthe project implementation unit throughout much o f the project may have been one reason for the
limited implementationo f educational components. UNICEF throughout the 1990s financed teacher training for rural girls who
had some education by driving them into towns every day or setting up classes near several o f them when possible. However, the
Bank project didnot collaborate with this activity.

   2.4      Mission observations. The OEDmissionvisited 10 schools unannounced inrural areas
   that hadbenefited from the project constructions and/or curricula.'' The schools were close to
   main roads andwithin a distance o f about 100kilometers from Sana'a. Therefore, these schools
   would be expected to provide abetter-than-average quality o f education. (These were one-time
   observations that provide no insight as to whether instruction inschools improved or deteriorated
   over time.) Observations are presentedbelow:

   2.5      For objective 1 Increasing schoolparticipation for girls in rural areas

            0    All schools were operational, withmany students attending. (Average absenteeismin
                 a sample o f 10 classes was 18.6 percent). Some classes were overcrowdedwith 68,
                 85, or 97 students. Fumiture was limited infour schools, and many students sat on the
                 floor. Inthree o f the schools space was not sufficient, and some classeswere heldin
                 corridors and under entrances. The space allocated for science labs was usedby other
                 classes. Overcrowdingwas the problemmost often discussed by school staff.
                 However, none o f the schools visitedhad an afternoon shift that would alleviate
                 crowding. (Only about 25 percent o f schools have aftemoon shifts inYemen, mostly
                 inurbanareas.)

            0    Girls' classeswere crowded, and girls were present inthe lower-grade coeducational
                classes as well. However, their number visibly diminishedinhigher grades, and
                 sometimes there were as few as three girls per class ingrades 5-9 out o f 20-30
                 students.

            0   Overall, staff expressedsatisfaction with the quality o f schools. However, three o f
                the 10 schools visited had unfinisheditems, such as large rocks inthe schoolyard. A
                lack o frailings inanother posed safety risks for second-floor classes.

            0   The new schools hadbathrooms, but three older buildings that were refurbisheddid
                not despite efforts to attract girls. These included one large girls' school whose
                bathroom was locked because no water was available.

   2.6     For objective 2: Laying thefoundation for improved quality of education

                About 12 teachers were asked ifthey had receivedtraining but reportedthat they had
                received no training since 2002. They also reportedthat inspectors and supervisors
                rarely came.

           0    Most students had all the requiredtextbooks intheir possession. Inone school, the
                govemment textbooks had not arrived, and inthree other schools, they had arrived 2-
                3 months after school started. The missionwas informed that school principals do not
                always go to pick them up on time from the depot. Some studentshad the older

                editions, which have different texts. Predictably, students o f the classes that had
                received them late were studyingthe beginningpages and were behindother classes.

           0    At the moment ofthemissionentry ina class, teachers were lecturinginmost classes.
                The students sat quietly and listened. Four classeswere found to engage inquestions
                and choral answers, whereas infive others, one student solved a problem on the board
                or read aloudwhile the rest o f the class was silent (for example, reading a geography
                lesson aloud ingrade 6). No classes were observed that had discussions, group work,
                or students initiating questions. (See Annex D for a discussion o f these issues.)

          0     A sample of2-4 students in 10classesof grades 1-4was askedto read. Grade 1
                students generally had learned all the letters inthe first three months o f school.
                However, they didnot progress to fluent reading; most studentsingrades 2-3 read
                haltingly and showed limitedcomprehension o f the texts. (See Annex D).  l2



          0     The teachers interviewedabout student performance attributed the low performance
                to rural homes, illiterate parents, and malnutrition. Three teachers stated infront o f
                students unable to read that they were from poor environments and suggestedthat the
                OED missionlistento other children's performance.

          0     Seven o f the schools visitedhadno female teachers. Inthe three schools that did, the
               teachers come from Sana'a by bus (travelling for an hour). The missionwas advised
               that female teachers may be unwiIIingto live or be unaccepted inrural areas.

          0    Staffmentioned a shortage o f teachers, particularly for math. Subjects are taught by
               specialized teachers starting ingrade 4, so available teachers may be considered
               unqualifiedto teach 4thgrade arithmetic. (See Annex D.)

         0     Instructional time was constricted. Inthree o f the schools visited near closing time
               (12:30), the classes were dismissedearly, at about 12pm. Infour o f the
               approximately65 classes visited, the teacher was absent and studentswere idle.

         0     The missionheard some governance concerns. One teacher stated that hehadpaid
               three months o f salary to be transferred from another district to his home district.
               Staff reported to the missionthat some o f the textbooks are sold off on the side,
               leaving an insufficient number insome schools.

2.7      The mission also visited the in-serviceteacher training center that had been built in
Sana'a with project funds and interviewedits director and staff. This large buildinghas been
equippedwith ahostel andaudiovisual media and houses an educational television channel; none
o f the facilities were operating. The staffreportedthat training activities take place a few times
per year; a five-dayworkshop hadtaken place two months earlier, inOctober 2004.

2.8      The OED missionplannedto visit pre-service primary teacher training centers invarious
towns that hadbeenbuilt by earlier projects (Annex A, Table A-1) as well as by the Basic
EducationProject. However, these centers that were created to train primary-schoolteachers at

 training only. The government has decided to offer pre-service training only at the university
 level and inthe larger cities where universities operate. (See Annex D.)

 2.9        The missionalso interviewed government officials and donor staff involved with the
 projects assessedinthis report and obtained opinions about actions and outcomes. These are
 referred to invarious parts o f the report. (See Annex B and sections on Bank andborrower

 3.         Project Outcomes -Achievement of Objectives

 3.1       Data reliability issues. Several o f the donor and government staff interviewedmentioned
 that data are not always reliable (Annex B). Data show inconsistencies among different reports.13
 Also, some data pertain to primary education (grades 1-6) and others to basic education (grades
 1-S), making some comparisons difficult. One reason i s that the management informationand
school mappingsystems function partiallybecause o f limited school inspection and supervision,
and there i s no system to verify enrollments reported by schools and district offices. This
tendency makes it difficult to evaluate program effects.

Objective 1: Increasingschoolparticipation for girls in rural areas

3.2        Access toprimary education improved inproject areas. The Basic EducationProject was
the first project inYemen to build large numbers o f schools, particularly targeting enrollment
increases among rural girls. Female participation had increased steadily inthe years before the
project. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage o f the age cohort enrolled inprimary schools
nationwide (grades 1-6) improved from 22 to 76 percent, with female enrollments increasing
from 7 to about 37 percent. (Boys' enrollments remained steady.) Enrollmentsroughly tripled in
project schools, and enrollment o f girl became nearly equal to that o f boys (Figures 2 and 3;
comparable figures innon-projectrural schools for that period are not available.) An evaluation
showed that the female enrollment rate increased from 34 percent in 1991/92 to 43 percent in
1999/2000 inthe governorates where the project intervened.l4Insome areas o f Hadramaut,
Sa'ada, Althale, and Almahra governorates, the female enrollment rose from almost 0 in 1990/91
to 35 percent in 1999/2000.15

grades 1-6), but calculations from Basic EducationProjectdocuments point to 1.592 million in90/91 in YAR and PDRY [Staff

 3.3       Gender gap narrowed inproject areas. The project has contributed to increasing female
participation inclasses to the extent that entering first graders have nearly achieved gender parity
inproject schools; girls constituted37 percent of students ingrade 1in1990/91buthadinfact
surpassed boys and constituted 52 percent in 1999/2000 (Figure 4). Despite impressive progress
for girls, the gender gap inproject areas i s still large (about 20 percent over all grades).

Objective2: Layingthe foundation for improvedqualityof education

3.4       Important prerequisites for improved education quality were fulfilled, notably curricular
design, and textbook development (Annex A, Table A-3). Very important was the development
andadministration o fthe competency-based Monitoring LearningAchievement (MLA) tests
developed by UNESCO to a nationwide sample of about 200 schools.'6 (See results insection

16. ERDC. "Reasons for the students' level in the primary school inreading and writing from the perceptions ofteachers and
supervisors". Sana'a 2000.

                                                       10


 5). Test results ought to serve as feedback to the schools sampled and to the MOE inits efforts to
 improve quality o f education. A report inArabic was printedand distributed with a summary in
 English, but interviews with officials revealedthat no action has beentaken on the basis o f this
 feedback. The Educational Research and Development Center (ERDC) that produced them has
 only a research role without a responsibility for dissemination or policy dialogue on the basis o f
 research. It was unclear whether the Ministryof Educationplanned training interventions based
 on these data.



 4.      Ratings

 ProjectOutcome

 4.1     The project was highly relevant to the needs o f the country, and the strategy o f increasing
 female enrollments by opening more schools proved effective, so efJicacy was substantial.
 EfJiciency was modest; the unit cost o f classrooms proved higher than expected, some textbooks
 were diverted to the market, and teacher training was not implemented as intended to facilitate
 the efficient instruction o f basic skills. It is unclear how much more enrollments would have
 increased or how girls' dropout would have changed ifthe expected number o f female teachers
 had been hired or ifteachers hadbeen trained as expected. Despite these difficulties, the project
 fulfilled most objectives and targets (Table A-2), and outcome is ratedsatisfactory.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.2      Institutional development impact is rated modest. Though the government carried out
most physical activities and was able to operate schools inremote rural areas, it didnot develop
an effective teacher training system and didnot hire the needed numbers o f female teachers who
mighthave fostered girls' education further. Plans for decentralizationhave only beenpartly
carried out; district education offices are still not able to send supervisors to schools regularly
and thus support their work effectively. In-service education continues to be weak. The
implementation o f teacher laws providing incentives for service inrural areas have been partly
implemented. However, the government was able to develop a standardized achievement test and
obtain baseline data.

Sustainability

4.3      The presence o f schools inremote rural areas and the efforts to sensitize the population to
the benefits o f girls' education are likely to be sustained inthe long run.However, the additional
schools and teacher salaries have created long-term recurrent cost implications, and it is
uncertain who will fund them and for how long. Currently, the government spends an unusually
highpercentage o fits budget on education (tables C-1 to C-3), andprimaryeducation accounts
for about 60 percent o f the education budget (down from 77 percent in 1998; Figure C- 4).
However, the percentage seems to be dropping, suggesting a flagging ability to sustain an
expanding primaryeducation budget. Continued donor involvement will be necessary to help
maintain the momentum o f further enrollment increases. Inlight o f the Fast-Track Initiative

                                                                  11


  commitments, donors are likely to continue trying to close the primary education financing gap.
  Thus, despite countervailing forces, project sustainability i s rated likely.


  Bank Performance

  4.4      Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory. Interviewswithgovernment anddonor staff
  brought to the fore the positive influence o f the Bank not only inthe implementation o f the Basic
  EducationProject but also inits leadership inEFA. The Bank is seen as a well-organized
  institutionthat monitors progress systematically, follows up on commitments, and revises its
  strategies as needed.IfBank financing hadnot beenprovided, Yemen's capability o fproviding
 primary education would be more limited.

 4.5       However, the Bankhas beencriticized for making loans to the sector that were too large
 and that stretched implementation capacity. The needto disburse large amounts i s complicated
 bythe difficulty inkeepingtrack of disbursements." The largenumbero fprojects that the Bank
 finances i s seen by some donor and government staff as increasing the potential for
 mismanagement. The donor community has not yet found a means to deal with this issue.

 Borrower Performance

 4.6       Overall, borrower performance inthe Basic EducationProject i s ratedsatisfactory.
 Despite delays and problems, the government carried out an extensive constructionprogram in
 difficult areas, developed curricula, and formulated a textbook policy that enables inprinciple all
 students to take books home and study. Nevertheless, it didnot give the same level o f attention
 to instructional aspects o f the project, so that students could acquire basic skills efficiently.

 4.7      Nevertheless the misrepresentedcounterpart payments raise concerns about the
 government's ability to manage some public institutions. (See para. 2.2). Some staff interviewed
 by the missionwere ofthe opinionthat government audits lack credibility, and it is hard for
 international agencies to determine how their financing has been spent andwhat effects it has
 had. Donor-financedprojects have been known to fail inYemen as a result o f large-scale
mismanagement.

4.8       A worrying example is the large number ofnon-teaching staff employedbyMOE(about
50,000 in 1998/99 compared to a teacher corps o f about 150,000).'9 It is unclear how many are
trulyneededor are actually working, but their salaries impedethe hiringo f suitable staff
(including needed women teachers) and frustrate efforts to provide quality education to students.
The government has been unable to enforce standards and limit hiringto clearly identified
locations (about 5,000 in 1999). Related problems include unclear responsibilities, complicated

88th position in 2003 to 112th in2004. (2.4, down from 2.6; 5.0 is a borderline distinguishing countries that do and do not have
serious corruption issues. www.ti.org)
19. According to the General Report o f the 2000/2001 Education Survey, there were 4,157 male and female teachers who did not
teach any period. The numbers o f other non-teaching staff are uncertain. Given the large numbers o f primary schools inYemen,
non-teaching school staff might constitute only 10-15 percent o f educational employees rather than about 30 percent.)

     organizational structures, limited staff skills, and data o f questionable reliability that contribute
     to the inefficiency o f the system.2o Furthermore, teachers who manage to be transferred to

     teachers.


     5.       Moving towards Education for All (EFA)

     5.1      Despite the difficult social conditions and geographic terrain, the country has made
     considerable progress towards schooling all children inprimary school (grades 1-6) and where
    possible through basic education (grades 1-9). The outcomes can be summarized as follows:

    Increasingaccess to primary educationfor girls

    5.2       Government efforts supported by donor assistance inYemen seem to have made an
    impact on enrollment rates. In2002/03 the total number o f studentswas 3,765,169, o fwhich
    girls were 1,427,208, andboys 2,337,961 ingrades 1-9. Gross enrollments rose from about 50
    percent in 1970 to about 67 percent in2000/01,while female enrollments rose from about 15
    percent to about 51 percent inthe same period (Figure 5). To accommodate students about
    97,462 classrooms are now available, 11,917 urbanand 85,545 rural.21Accordingly, basic
    education buildings have increased from 9,824 in 1990/91,to 11,263 in2002/03 (Figure6).

 but still only constitute about 21 percent o fthe basic education staff." (As discussed inChapters
 2 and 5, budgetary and educational issues have impededthe recruitment o fmany women.)

 5.4       Reducing the gender gap. Nationally, the gender gap has improved slightly but i s still
 among the largest inthe world: about 33 percent o f students inbasic education were girls in2000
 compared to 28 percent in 1994/95.24National gross enrollment rates ingrades 1-6 are about 51
 percent for girls (Figure6). Net enrollment rates are about 41 percent nationally but only about
 30 percent for rural girls.


 Documentingand ReducingDropoutandRepetition

 5.5       Detailed dropout data are not available, and the direction o f the trends i s uncertain.
 UNESCO reports (which refer to figures but do not report them) mention that repetitionrates
 start low ingrades 1-2 andprogressively increase to about 13.3 percent ingrade 5. 25 According
 to UNESCO references, girls' repetition rates are somewhat higher than boys' (7 versus 6.3
 percent). However, government projections indicate higher dropout rates for girls (Figure 7); in
 2001, the overall first- grade accessrate was estimated at 73 percent but the access rate would
 decline to 51percent by the end o f the primarycycle. A cohort reconstructionanalysis suggests
 that o f 100pupils who gain accessto grade 1, only 70 will continue untilgrade 6. Ofthe girls
 enrolledingrade 1in200/01 (gross enrollment rate of 63 percent) there would be only 37
 percent left ingrade 6 (Figure 7).26Only about 36.4 percent o f girls continue untilgrade 9 and o f
 these only about 36.6 percent take the ninthgrade e~amination.~'                         Ifgovernment projectionsare
 realistic, some rural girls may be ingreater danger o f dropping out illiterate, 28 since many
 children finally become literate ingrade 3 or 4. Clearly, dropout and repetition require better
 documentation.

27. Abbas 2000. About 80,000-85,000 girls drop out every year before finishing basic education, especiallyinrural areas. The
mission was told that school authorities typically fail to inquire why students are absent or drop out. It was reportedthat some
teachers may find such an outcome desirablebecause class sizes are thus reduced.
28. According to governmentstaff, an unpublishedstudy found that fathers' lack of time to help studentswith homework
contributesto dropout. This is particularly aproblembecauseinYemen rural mothers are typically illiterate and cannot help.

5.6        Trends in student achievement unknown. Before 2000, there were no data on student
achievement, so it i s not possible to know how student performance has changed over time. The
standardized test scores for grades 4 and 6 will serve as baseline to monitor performance in2005
and subsequent years2' (Table 2). The results are summarized below.

  However, the parents o f the students who took the test seem to bebetter educated than the

 percent secondary school completion). Furthermore, girls constituted 40-46 percent o f the
  sample, a percentage higher than the country's a~erage.~'Thus, the sample o f studentswho took
 the test seems biased insome systematic ways. This i s likely to make the interpretationo f
 subsequenttest results difficult (see Annex E).


 OngoingBankSupportfor GovernmentStrategy

 5.8        Enrollment increases could be attributed inpart to the sector strategy agreed inthe 1990s
 between the Bank and the government, which gave highestpriority to basic education, girls'
 education, and an increase o fYemeni teachers. The Bankhas supported these with pieces o f
 sector work.32In2005, the progress towards EFA and government strategy was underpinned by
 the Basic Education ExpansionProject (Cr. 3422, FYO1) that i s beingimplementedinfive
 governorates since 2000 and aims to: (a) further expand access to education by increasing the
 number o fnew andrehabilitated schools through an efficient and demand-based selection of
 school sites, (b) improve the quality o f education inmral basic schools through in-service
 training o f teachers, inspectors and headmasters, and (c) strengthen the capacity o f the Ministry
 o f Education (MOE) to implement basic education reforms and to prepare educational statistics
 andmonitoring.        33


 5.9       The ongoingproject i s puttinginpractice lessons learned through the Basic Education
Project and carrying out activities pertinent to the strategic concerns o f Educationfor All.
 Teacher deployment i s to be reformed to enhance interventions, and a new curriculum will be
introduced. Educationalmaterials and school fbmiturewill be suppliedupon completiono f civil
works. Quality improvement programs will be implemented, and project management will be
strengthened interms o f regulatory framework, business guidelines, and information.
management. Technical assistancewill be provided to develop action plans for community
participation activities. It i s also helpingenforce regular school inspections as well as extensive
teacher and administrator training. It i s too soonto tell whether these quality interventionshave
had an effect. However, the project has already resultedinfurther enrollment increases; inthe
areas where it operates, girls' gross enrollment rate increased from 51 percent in 1999/2000 to 56
percent in2002/03.34The third Public Works Project (Cr. 3859) and third Social FundProject
are constructing classrooms for about 5 15,000 additional students altogether (Annex Table 1)
and organizingcommunitiesto support the new schools.

 EFA Plans and Prospects

 5.10      The government has developed a Basic Education,Strategy for the years 2003-2015, and
 proposes to implement it through the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative and attain universal
 primary education by 2015 (see details inAnnex C, Tables C-10-C12),35The strategy includes
 strengtheningat all levels the capacity to plan, manage, andmonitor improvementsinthe
 performance o fthe education system, training o f educational personnel, increased enrollment
 and completion rates through increased construction, and strong community participation. To
 carry out the strategy, the government has announced a further increase inpublic expenditures on
 basic education. (A target i s to increase the share o f education inthe GDP to 9.6 percent in2005,
 up from 7.7 percent in2000). Yemenrequested atotal o fUS$96millionfrom the FTIfinds for
 the three-year periodbetween 2003 and 2005. At the time o f the OED mission, discussions were
 still going on regarding implementation and financing details.


 5.11 The government and donors have done much already to overcome the infrastructure
 limitations o f the country and reach the sparsely populated mountainous terrain. But with an
 estimated primaryschool completionrate o f 58 percent in2000 (38 percent for girls and 77
 percent for boys), Yemen i s considered off-track for achieving EFA by 2015.36Thus despite
progress, the country faces the following obstacles:

          Implementation capacity limitations. The limitedability to train teachers i s an indication
          that ability to build and staff large numberso f schools may be close to its limits. For
          example, the five-year plan (1996-2000) aimed at buildingand equipping20,618
          additional classrooms, but the government fell short o f these expectations by more than
          half.37The endemic governance problems inthe country complicate issues by raising
          questions regardinghigher buildingcharges and large numbers o f non-teaching
          personnel.

          Rate ofpopulation increase. Duringthe 1990s, enrollment growth inbasic education
          barely kept up with the 3.5 percent population growth rate, and the number o f children i s
          projectedto increase inthe short term (Figure 8). Recent declines inthe birthrate will
          reduce pressure to expand primary education, but unless school usage becomes more
          efficient, 3.7 millionchildren ages 6-14 will lack a place inschool until the population
          levels offby 2020.38At a rate o f 40 students per class, about 128,000 new classrooms and
         teachers may be neededby that date, and those may be inthe areas hardest to reach.

     0   High required levels of investment. It is conceivable that Yemen could satisfy its basic
         education needs by 2020 ifit consistently invested YR5.5 billionper year (inconstant
          1998 prices) over the next 15 years.39(See Annex CyTables C-1 to C-5 for expenditure

37. For example, 191schools were constructedbetween 1996 and 1997(about 1,337 classes) and 662 schools between 1997 and
1998or about 4000 classrooms(Yemen: ReportPart I1Analytic section. EFA 2000 Assessment Country Reports.

          information). This amount is lower than the 1998 expenditures and may be feasible. But
          to provide every child with a school place o f reasonable quality would also require
          recurrent expenditure of YR52 billion in2020 for teacher salaries and school
          maintenance, an amount equivalent to a 2.2 percent growthper year inreal terms. Inthe
          1990s donors have financed about 45 percent o f the investment budget, and this share
          would have to continue for at least the next decade and may also have to extend to
          recurrent costs. Yemenwould have to convince donors to make substantial long-term
          commitments.

          Uncertain sourcesfor future teachers. Inprinciple, the Ministryo f Education employs
          enough teachers to provide one for every 40 childreninthe basic education age group.
          However, only 6 percent o f adults complete secondary education (grades 10-l                            q 4 0 and
          most girls who enter the school system do not continue to secondary school. It i s unclear
          from which populationteachers will be obtained (particularly women), giventhe new
          emphasis inhiringteachers who have completed secondary school and attended
          university.

         Largefinancing gap. The government estimated that ifa proposed 'reform scenario' to
         befully implemented(Table C-10), the financial requirement for EFAwill beabout
         US$7.1 billionover the 13 years from 2003 to 2015, or US$549 millionper year. The
          Government's financial envelope for primary education i s estimated at US$5.8 billion
         over the next 13 years or an average o fUS$442 million per year. Thus, the financing gap
         would be estimated at US$1.4 billionover the next 13 years or US$107 millionper
         year-an       annual US$76 million for recurrent and US$31million for capital expenditures.

         The first tranche (US$3 million) was transferred to Yemen inNovember 2004, and it is
         not possible to monitor progress as yet.

         Competing education expenditures. Despite efforts to increase educational spending,
         expenditures for vocational and higher education may inhibit primary and secondary
         education. Currently, the government spends an unusually highpercentage o f its total
         budget on education (tables C-1to C-3), and primary education accounts for about 60
         percent o fthe education budget (down from 77 percent in 1998; Figure C- 4). However,
         the percentage i s dropping inreal terms, partly due to the large-scale expansion o f
         vocational andhigher educati~n.~'The government plans to expand vocational training
         further (accounting for about 6 percent ofthe education budget in 1999) andto channel
         15 percent o f secondary education students to vocational programs that may cost about
         six times more per student thanthose o f general education. The future hiring o f
         university-trainedteachers also implieshigher training costs.

with growth inthe age cohort. (Lockheed, Bendokat, andYuki, 1999).

 5.12     Though enrollment figures are shown to matchthe indicative fi-amework parameters by
 2015 (Table C-13), it i s unclear how feasible they are, given implementation capacity andpast
 experience. Ifprogress i s linear, girls' enrollment cannot increase ninefold by 2015 (Table C-9);
the completionrate cannot rise from about 38 percent in2005 to 100percent in2015, giventhat
in2001 it was about 24percent (Table C-7). There is no reasonto expect an exponential
increase, given that increasinglyremotepopulations must bereached. Similarly, it seems
unlikelyto replace about 60,445 teachers who only have primary education with secondary
education graduates (Table C-6) giventhe scarcity o fwomen able to serve as teachers inrural
areas. The parameters o f a "realistic reform scenario" (Annex C) include drastic reductions in
repetition rates to 3 percent, an average class size o f 35 despitethe smaller classes ofmany rural
schools, constant construction costs despite recent increases, and almost no increases inteacher
salaries. But ifthese parameters are implemented, theneducational quality might be too low to
benefitthe average poor students. Inother countries (Niger, for example42)that proceeded along
similar parameters, mainly the smartest andbetter-off have been known to benefit. But such an
outcome would defeat the purpose o f the Fast-Track Initiative inYemen.

5.13     The EFAinitiative also includes issues related to (a) improvedmonitoringo fdropout,
repetition, and achievement, (b) efficient provision o f informationto students, and (c)
implementinga sustainable teacher training policy. These issues are discussed more extensively
inAnnex D.

5.14     For all the reasons stated above, it may finally prove impossible to bringabout universal
primary education completion by 2015-2020. However, it maybe possible to teach basic skills to
the vast majority o fthose who attend eventwo years ofprimary school byusinginstructional
time well, teaching material inways appropriate to children's informationprocessing strengths
and weaknesses, and focusing on early acquisition o f fluent reading andmath. Thus, the dropouts
will notjoin the ranks o fthe illiterates.

 German Democratic Republic for South Yemen) has beenextensively involved invocational-
 technical training inYemen. Other donors, including the OPEC fund and the European Union,
 also indicatedinterest inthis sector. UNICEF, UK,Japan, Germany, Islamic Development Bank,
 and the Netherlandshave beeninvolved inprimary education and the social funds. For the Basic
 Educationproject, the Netherlands contributed cofinancingo fUS$8.5 million (NLG 17.5
 million). Coordination has beenclose and systematic. Donors have considered the govemment's
 EFAproposal overly ambitious andinternally inc~nsistent,~~but have workedwiththe
 government to arrive at affordable financing levels andrealistic targets.

 6.        Lessons

 6.1       This assessment confirms a number o fOED lessons from the education sector:

      0    Countries that have limited literacy rates and few schools may benefit from a strategy that
           simultaneously pursuesboth supply-side(school construction, teacher training) and
           demand-side(public campaigns to enrol girls) interventions. These activitiesmay be
           carried out through multiplewell-coordinated operations.

     0     Evenifgirls' enrollment increases, potential gains may be lost when students drop out.
           School authorities must be sensitized to the needs andproblems o f rural students and
           actively try to prevent drop out, particularlyamong those not yet literate.

     0     Byitself, student enrollment does not guaranteeacquisition o fbasic skills. Itis also
           necessaryto use classroom time wisely, ensure that textbooks are available for students to
           take home, provide in-serviceteacher training, and allow for systematic supervision.
           Without attention to quality, basic skills may be acquired late, and students may drop out
           before learningto read fluently and to calculate.

     0     The strategy o f employing female teachers may fall short o f expectations due to
          budgetary constrains and the low numbers o f qualified women willing to work inrural
           areas. Recruitingwomen who already live inrural areas, even ifthey have a relatively
          limitededucation, maybe a sound way to increase the number o f female teachers
          available.

Annex B: Statements and Issues Raised inMission Interviews


       Interviews took place individually or in small groups as the circumstances
dictated. The 32 persons interviewed included:

       educators (4 district-level managers and staff, 8 teachers, 10principals inthe
       schools o f areas visited )
       government officials inthe Ministryo f Education or its dependencies (6 people);
       staff o f donor agencies residing in Sana'a (4 people).

       The questions posed to respondents were:

       What were the benefits of the project inyour school, geographic or sectoral area?
       What problems did you face inimplementing the project? What were its
       disadvantages?
       Which components worked best inbringingabout results, which didnot? (some
       persons interviewed were asked about specific components, as appropriate).
       H o w effective were the Bank staffor consultants who worked on the project?
       What training did you receive through the project? Didit teach you what it was
       supposed to?
       What financial irregularities (ifany) were there inyour area o fjurisdiction?
       What would be different inthe education sector ifthe project had not existed?
       Other issues and observations.

       The table below reflects the number o f respondents who indicated a view on each
   question. Persons couldraise one or more issues, but an opinion brought up
   repeatedlyby the same person counted as one comment. Not all staff had opinions
   about all questions and sometimes only one person ina group expressed an opinion,
   so reply statistics are approximate. Teachers were only asked questions regarding the
   availability and effectiveness o f inputs, since most didnot know who hadpaid for the
   inputs and didnot have an opinion about the project.

 Girls' schooling may be used as another pretext for corruption. The situation is dire, with much money wasted in

 Reliable people matter a lot and there are not many among local staff. The project really needs expatriate
 administrators.
Textbooks stolen often, distribution is a problem. Regional staff may send fewer to schools, forcing some students to go
to the market and buv those stolen
Issues and observations
Literacy classes taking place in some schools are ineffective due to low teacher pay and lack of follow-up. There are
many administrators but few teachers.                                                                                           1

Vocational education is not crowding out primary education because donors finance both                                          1
The donors finance religious education as part of the curricula at all levels, but it is unclear what is taught and what
attitudes students learn about other religions through donor funding; concern that unchecked religious education in
primary schools may fuel fundamentalism. Donors are afraid to bring up this issue to the government.                           2
Teacher salaries are inadequate for supporting those willing to move to rural areas; many also have to pay bribes to get
posted where they want                                                                                                         2

 Annex C:SectoralInformationand Educationfor All


           The government and the donor community have carried out extensive sector work
 regardingthe financing issues involved inachieving Educationfor All. Some issues are
 presentedbelow ingreater

           Sub-sectoral allocations ofpublic investment expenditures do not yet reflect the
 government's priority of basic education. Yemen's public education expenditure has
 been high.GDP andtotal public expenditure on education have increased simultaneously;
 government expenditures on education grew from 5.1% o f GDP in 1996 to 7.7% in2002,
 which i s highcompared with most Arab countries and lower-income countries. This trend
 reflects the rise inteachers' salaries and increased investment expenditure. The
 education sector also increased its share o f total government expenditures from 16.0% to
21.6% during the period. Between 1994 and 1998, allocation for allocation for basic and
 secondary education showed a real 52 percent increase.45

           However, the proportion o fprimary education has been declining. It declined
from 46 percent in 1996 to 44 percent in2000. A similar trend i s observed inthe upper
grades o fbasic education and insecondary education (grades 7-12) whose share has also
decreasedfrom 42 percent to 40 percent duringthe same period. Conversely, the share o f
tertiary education has increased 4 percentage points, demonstrating an increased demand
for tertiary education. The large-scale expansion o f vocational education also seems to
be a reason.46

          Inefficient recruitment andpersonnel management does not deploy adequate
teachers to schools despite MOE's high wage bills. Wage bills have increased
significantly-       from 3.3% o f GDP in 1996 to 4.7% o f GDP in2000. However, the falling
student-teacher ratio inbasic education (21:1in 1998/99 as compared with 31.1in
1994/95) hints at inefficiencies inteacher deployment and hides extreme urban-rural
 difference^.^' The Government has introducedmeasures such as hiringnew teachers
according to clear criteria, but local authorities resist them. The wage increases allowed
bythe Teacher Law (1998) do not yet linkrigorously to deployment inremote rural areas
and to performance measures such as attendance.

          Nutritional status may afect performance. Considerable international evidence
suggests that students' nutritional status i s related to academic performance. Malnourished

 Demographic andHealth Surveyreported a malnutrition prevalence rate o f 27.5 per cent

 (Table C-13).5' Some o f the poor performance may be attributable to this issue.

 Fast Track Initiative Scenarios

           Inits applicationfor theFast-Track initiative, the government created scenariosto
 show how it i s possible to achieve Educationfor All by 2015 (Tables C-6 to C-9). The
 Fast-Track Initiativeproposal applies to grades 1-6 only. Tables C-10 to C-13 show
 estimates on how the EFA targets couldbe achieved, comparing a status quo scenario
 (whereproportion o frepeaters remains at 7 percent) and a `reform' scenario o f automatic
 promotion and reduction o frepeaters to 3 percent by 2015. The baseline indicatorsuse
 2001 data and have the following assumptions: (a) 100percent primary completion rate
by2015; (b) the percentage o fage-group entering grade 1would reach 100percent by
2010 which i s the latest targeted year for students to complete the 6 years o fprimary
 education; and (c) 3.7 percent annual growth o f primary school population. Inthe first
scenario, primary school enrollment will increase to 7.1 millionby2015 and the gross
enrollment rate i s projected at 107percent in2015 due to repeating students. Inthe
second scenario, if automatic promotion were implementedby 2005, primary school
enrollment would be approximately 292,000 fewer than inthe status quo scenario and
gross and net enrollment will reach 103 percent by 2015 (see Table C-13). However, this
option may result ingraduation but inlimited acquisition o fbasic skills.

           Ifthe Government wereto fully implementitsproposedefficiency measures, such
as increasing student-teacher ratios from 25 in2000 to 35 in2015 and decrease the
proportiono f repeaters from 7 to 3 percent by 2015, 32 percent fewer teachers and
classrooms would be required compared to the status quo of grades 1to 6 o f the basic
education system. The `realistic reform' scenario (Table C-10) projectsrequirementso f
an additional 79,000 primary teachers and 88,000 primary classrooms while it assumes
20 percent o f classes operating double shifts inthe next 13 years. The policy changes
presentedinthis reform are due to large efficiency gains brought onby improvementsin
studentkeacher ratios and by introducing automatic promotion to reduce the number and
the cost o frepeaters.At the sametime, non-teacher items-quality improvement-are
factored in, combinedwith improved resource mobilizationbased on the following

assumptions: i)an increasedshare o f education spending on primary education; ii)an
increased amount for promoting female education and operatiodmaintenance; and iii)an
increased share o f public recurrent spending on education as a percent o f public spending.
Ifthereformwere tobefully implemented, the financialrequirement for EFAare
estimated at US$7.1 billion over the 13 years from 2003 to 2015, or US$549 millionper
year. The Government's financial envelope for primary education is estimated at US$5.8
billion over the next 13 years or an average o f US$442 millionper year. Thus, the
financing gap would be estimated at US$1.4 billion over the next 13 years or US$107
millionper year-an      annual US$76 million for recurrent and US$31million for capital
expenditures.

        The `realistic reform' scenario (Table C-12) also projects very small salary
increases (from 3.2 to 3.5 times the per capita GDP), stable construction costs, and an
increase to an average class size o f 35. However, current teacher salaries seem inadequate
to attract teachers to rural areas, construction costs keep rising, and an average o f 35
students per class ina predominantly rural country and necessarily small schools seems
unfeasible. Classes inurban areas would be very large under this scenario. Such large
sizes are also likely to affect people's willingness to come or to stay inthe teaching
profession.

Notes: -Non available.
Needs for EFA are simple projections based on the following assumptions:
a! Student-classroom ratio would be 40 for 75% o f children (urban children) and 80 for 25% (rural children).
b/ Basic furniture per school include desks and chairs for 40 students anda blackboard.
c i In-service teacher training, about two week-training insummer or winter break andperiodic training during school days.
d/ Basic education is assumed to account for 86% ofthe total MOEbudget. The remaining budget is for secondary education andnon-fomnaleducation.
efFor unit costs:
t. Cost per classroom for a two classroom village school is based onactual costs o fUNICEF Area BasedProgram.
2. Cost per additional classroom including school facilities such as sanitary facilities and administrative room is based on actual costs o f
I D A projects which are higher man those for community based small schools supported by UNICEFbut
lower than some govemment financed projects.
3. Costs o fbasic furniture are based on a IDAproject, assuming a set of 40 desks and chairs would be S 160 and a blackboard S60.
4. Average salaryper teacher would be the same as that in 1998 in real tem.
5. Costs o f incentive programs would be 500 YR. which is about three times as mucb as school fees.
6. Construction costs of sanitary facilities would be the same as those for one classroom
7. Rehabilitation costs o f water supply would be balfo f those for one classroom
8. Average salary per general secondary educated teacher with tertiary teacher training would be 1DUOhigher than that
for existing teachers without tertiary teacher training.
9. Every classrooms would receive routine maintenance (e.g., physical maintenance, water and electricity bill) about 2% o f construction costs.
10. The average number of textbooks per student inbasic education is 10. Cost per textbook is assumed to be IOYR.
11. Costs o f instructional materials are assumed to be 40% o fa full set o ftextbooks.
12. Recurrent costs o f in-service teacher training are based on actual costs o f teacher training supported by UNICEF.

 Annex D. IssuesinImprovingQuality of Education


 Need for ImprovedMonitoringMechanisms


           To track the achievement o fEducation for All, more detailed informationmust be
 obtained regardingdropout and repletionby gender and location o f schools. There i s also
 aneed to monitor students' ability to read and write, particularly inthe early grades.
 More attention may be on understanding what key inputswill improve learning outcomes
 for the children already enrolled.

           Care may be neededto ameliorate the sampling issues related to achievement
 testing. Because the 200 schools usedfor baseline measurement hadapopulationthat
 was not representative o f Yemeni students, future results may not show changes reliably.
 Furthermore, inclusion o f increasingly poorer children i s likely to lower scores.
 Sophisticated statistical treatments, such as propensity score matching, could be usedto
 ferret out achievement changes.

 EfficientlyProvidingUsefulInformationto Students

           It is quite feasible for most students inYemen to read their textbooks fluently by
 the endof grade 1, becausevoweled Arabic is phonetic, and the Yemeni dialect is close
 to the standard Arabic usedinclass. However, the classrooms observed by OED were
 found to use instructional time inefficiently. Student and teacher absenteeism, premature
 endo fschool days, andteacher tardiness, may contribute to the low level o freading
 skills shown by students ingrades 2-4. Because little in-service training takes place and
supervisors rarely visit schools, teachers teach as they see fit and as their own teachers
taught them.

          One part o f the problem i s that students spend much o f the time passivelyhearing
lectures. Young students' attention span i s limited.Iflectures andrepetitive activities go
past 1-2minutes, studentsinlower grades probably stop paying attention.52Time i s also
poorly used when a single student solves problems on the board (usually a time-
consuming task) while other students are uninvolved. The boring classes coupledwith
teachers' reportedly strict disciplinary measuresmay be an important reason why over 88
percent o f students assessed through the MLA test stated that they did not like
Dropout may be related to this attitude. Optimal time use i s particularly important to girls
and groups o f students prone to dropping out early. Research suggests that ifstudents
drop out after they become literate, they are likely to maintain their skills and improve
them. But ifthey drop out before they have developed fluent reading, they are likely to
lose their skills andjoin the ranks o f illiterate^.'^ Under such circumstances, the

expressed their dissatisfaction with the grades they receive. (EDRC 2000).

  govemment's efforts at enrollment increaseswould be compromised. Studentsmay
  benefit only from a fraction o f the educational organization andbudget spent for them.

           Improving instruction in large classes through cooperative learning. Poor use of
  students' time and attention spancreates egregious problems inlarge classes, because
  students thus get little time to practice readingor other skills by themselves. Some social
  research suggests that information i s elaborated better ingroups.55This i s particularly
  important inthe case o f large classes, where teachers are sometimes observed to work
 with a few competent students and ignore the rest. Groups canbe formed inlarge and
 crowded classes by asking students seatedina front row to turntoward those behind
 them. Training and experimentation are neededfor this purpose.

           Rural school buildings can also beput to more efficient use iffull morning and
 afternoon shifts are established (with different teachers or with the same teachers paid
 extra). Some government officials may consider that the afternoon shift offer less
 instruction; however, if students go to school three days inthe morning andtwo inthe
 afternoon, equity among groups will be established.

 Implementinga Sustainable Textbook Strategy

           Yemenhas apolicy o fgivingstudentstextbooks to take home andprinting each
 year 70 percent o f the number needed, since many canbe reused. The policy i s laudable
 because it enables students to study after-hours. Eventhough it i s financially
 burdensome, students are probably benefitingacademically from it. However, used
 textbooks are often wasted as large numbers get reprinted. (Aninitiative has been
 developed to sendold textbooks to India for recycling into pulp.)

          To alleviate theft and sale inthe market, the MOE could sell textbooks to private
 vendors (suitably labeled), so that students can buy them iffor some reason they need to.
 Iftextbooks areavailable inthemarket atreasonablerates, therewill belittleincentiveto
 cause delays and shortages inschool by stealing them and selling them.
Implementingan EffectiveTeacher Support System

          The government has decided to close the primary teacher training centers that
have produced rural teachers since the 1970s.The policy was developed because their
quality was low, and it was considered that secondary-level teachers didnot know
sufficient materialto teach students. At the same time, economic studies suggested that
Yemen has a relatively low average student-teacher ratio (about 21)56and maynot really
needmore teachers. Instead, it needsbetter allocation ofteachers to rural areas and more

  female teacher^.^' The Yemeni government is taking special measures to reduce
  minimumteaching qualifications for women to completion o f secondary education.

           However, the Yemeni system must expand inrural areas where about 72 percent
  o f the population lives, and female rural teachers constitute only about 7 percent o f the
  teacher corps.58Experiences worldwide suggest that it is extremely difficult to post urban
  dwellers (particularly women) inremote rural areas.59They try to return to the cities, and

  have been limited.) More o f concern should be the fact that if students complete
  secondary school inYemen, they are likely to be middle class or above and have other
  options besides the low-paidteaching profession and work inrural areas. Students may
  enter university faculties o f education with the expectation o f getting a general education
  rather than actually teaching. Thus, this population may be quite unsuitable for staffing
  rural schools.

          Secondary-level teachers have effectively hnctioned inmany countries and
  continue to do so insome countries, such as Romania. It may be more efficient to
  continue operating primary teacher training centers for secondary-level study inareas o f
 highneed.

          Another unusual characteristic o f Yemeni teacher use is that subject specialists
 are required for grades 4-6. This differentiation creates inefficiencies inthe system
 (particularly insmall rural schools) and may deprive students o f subject matter
 knowledge when the specialized teachers are unavailable. The government might
 consider eliminating specialization and making sure that teachers are trained well enough
 to teach math and science o f grades 4-6, as practically all other countries are able to do.
 The move toward university-trained teachers should bring to the sector better-educated
 personnel.
