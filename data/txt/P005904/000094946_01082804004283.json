assessment of outcome was\n            satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, though\n            institutional development impacts are modest. Among the main\n            lessons, the importance of clearly defining the expected\n            outcomes of administrative entities is reinforced, to be\n            accomplished through specific terms of reference with\n            detailed roles, and responsibilities, and, developed for\n            implementation prior to loan effectiveness. In addition, it\n            is recommended that periodic reviews, and implementation\n            progress be pursued, with the subsequent report issuance for\n            consideration by the funding agencies, and borrower. And, in\n            the absence of strong procurement capacity, particularly in\n            light of large civil works, and procurement of goods, and\n            consultant services, it would have been wise to carry out a\n            procurement capacity assessment, implemented during\n            appraisal, or prior to effectiveness. This could have solved\n            specific issues, and avoided implementation delays. Once\n            again, the importance for community involvement at an early\n            stage of the project is emphasized, by adequately\n            structuring their assistance in planning, supporting, and\n            implementing their roles, and responsibilities, potentially\n            avoiding delays in site selections, and reducing unit costs,\n            while ensuring project sustainability. Other lessons\n            emphasize the need to define technical assistance based on a\n            preliminary institutional assessment; assess project impacts\n            using clear monitoring indicators; and, provide adequate\n            funding for teachers supervision."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
