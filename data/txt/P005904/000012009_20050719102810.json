This assessment confirms a number of OED lessons\n            from the education sector. Countries that have limited\n            literacy rates, and few schools may benefit from a strategy\n            that simultaneously pursues, both supply-side (school\n            construction, teacher training), and demand-side (public\n            campaigns to enroll girls) interventions. However, even if\n            enrollment increases, potential gains may be lost upon\n            students drop out. School authorities must be sensitized to\n            the needs and problems of rural students, and actively try\n            to prevent drop out, particularly among those not yet\n            functionally literate. Furthermore, by itself, student\n            enrollment does not guarantee acquisition of basic skills.\n            It is also necessary to use classroom time wisely, ensure\n            that textbooks are available, provide in-service teacher\n            training, and allow for systematic supervision, i.e.,\n            attention to education quality. The strategy of employing\n            female teachers may fall short of expectations due to\n            budgetary constrains, and the low numbers of qualified women\n            willing to work in rural areas. Recruiting women who already\n            live in rural areas, even if they have a relatively limited\n            education, may be a sound way to increase the number of\n            female teachers."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
