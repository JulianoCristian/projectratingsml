                         During the mission which benefited from the sector manager's visit to the country, the Government clearly expressed its commitment to continue the programs committed under the
                         project and related to (i) enhancement of decentralization and empowerment of Local Governments through particularly regular and substantial fiscal transfer (FRD) and a continue
                         capacity building at the local level; (ii) slums rehabilitation in Nouakchott and main cities; (iii) micro credit for housing and economic activities and employment for slums and peri-
                         urban inhabitants. The Government official also confirmed their interest for the second phase of this APL. A formal request was already sent to the Bank.
                         The project is very likely to achieve its PDO with a very strong ownership and very good prospects for sustainability and continuation of undertaken programs.
