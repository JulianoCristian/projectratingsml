The Program should be carried out in\n            two phases; the first phase in progress must be completed on\n            June 30th, 2011. Before starting the second stage of PDU, a\n            supplementary program was initiated with the support of an\n            additional financing from IDA. This supplementary phase will\n            relate to the achievement of the following infrastructures:\n            Road and draining systems, water supply system and\n            electrification.  The achievement of the urban\n            roadway/drainage system works and infrastructures, of\n            electrification and water conveyance can have environmental\n            or social impacts, either individually, or in a cumulative\n            way, in the project\u0092s target districts. However, these\n            negative effects were perceived as moderate or minor during\n            the former programs. In the production phase (management),\n            the crucial issue of the achieved facility management will\n            be raised: maintenance of the roadway system (cleaning,\n            sweeping); maintenance of the gutters (clearing out); etc.\n            To take these aspects into account, this Environmental and\n            Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP), adapted to the\n            sub-components was carried out to permit determine the\n            identification and management mechanisms and procedures of\n            these potential negative incidences. The projects will have\n            major positive effects on the social level, with relatively\n            minor negative consequences. On the other hand, the\n            infrastructures (roadway system), and the environmental\n            projects (works of drainage, water conveyance, etc) will\n            have positive effects as well as minor or moderate negative\n            impacts. Even though they permit to improve the setting and\n            living conditions, these projects will, all the same,\n            somewhat contribute to the degradation of the living\n            environment in the urban area if accompaniment measures are\n            not taken."}, "docdt": "2010-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
