                         During June 2011 supervision mission, the Government clearly expressed its commitment to mobilize some significant resources to continue implementation and scaling up of the
                         programs committed under the project and related to (i) enhancement of decentralization and empowerment of Local Governments through particularly regular and substantial fiscal
                         transfer (FRD) and a continued capacity building at the local level; (ii) slums rehabilitation in Nouakchott and main cities; (iii) micro credit for housing and economic activities and
                         employment for slums and peri-urban inhabitants. The project is very likely to achieve its PDO with a very strong ownership and very good prospects for sustainability and
                         continuation of undertaken programs.
