outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned include: project approach\n            is not the more efficient way for sustainable capacity\n            building. So, developing local governmental capacities\n            requires a national program, based on sustainable resources\n            and strong political commitment that eventually will be\n            supported by donors. The project demonstrated the\n            feasibility and sustainability of microcredit operations for\n            generating income activities in Mauritania. Slum upgrading\n            has limitations when there is a lack of established\n            appropriate regulatory frameworks for land development in an\n            urban environment. Therefore, an appropriate and rigorous\n            compensation policy coupled with an efficient land ownership\n            control system for illegal land occupation will be necessary\n            for successful slum rehabilitation. The amount paid by\n            low-income people to have access to land property rights is\n            very low as compared to the existing land market value.\n            Depending on local conditions, additional arrangements needs\n            to be put in place to ensure that only targeted people are\n            benefitting from such programs, and will keep this benefit."}, "docdt": "2013-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
