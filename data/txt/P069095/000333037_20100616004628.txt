            URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ­ ADDITIONAL FINANCING

I.     Introduction

1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide Additional
Financing of US$25.5 million to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the Urban Development
Project (UDP), as well as an extension of the closing date of the original Credit (Cr.3574 MAU)
from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The UDP is the first phase of a two phase Adaptable Program
Loan (APL). The request for Additional Financing builds on two specific requests from the
Government (letters dated January 14, 2010 and March 4, 2010) to use available IDA resources
(US$10 million from the country's IDA 15 allocation) and funds available under the Crisis
Response Window (CRW) (US$5.5 million from CRW 1 and US$10 million from CRW 2).

2.      In accordance with OP/BP 13.20, Additional Financing, the proposed Additional Financing
would finance costs associated with scaling up the development effectiveness and impact of
component 1 (d) (Provision of basic urban infrastructure in the main cities) of the Urban
Development Project, described in the Project Appraisal Document presented to the Board on
October 25, 2001. The scaling up is comprised of construction of: (i) paved road (25.7 km), (ii)
unpaved roads (26 km), (iii) water supply (8.3 km of network), and (iv) transmission and
distribution lines (18.5 km of network and 210 street lamps).

3.     The Bank-financed activities will be coordinated closely with activities under
implementation financed by the Government of Mauritania and other donors --(French Development
Agency (AFD), Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), the Kuwait Fund for
Arabic Economic Development and the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)-- in the urban sector.

II.    Background and rationale for additional financing

4.      Country context. Mauritania has a population of 3.2 million and a gross national income
(GNI) per capita of US$840 (2008). The country has undergone a period of political instability with
the overthrow of elected governments in 2005 and 2008. Constitutional rule was re-established in
August 2009. Overall growth in gross domestic product (GDP) decelerated from 11.4 percent in
2006 to 0.6 percent in 2008. After declining to 7.4 percent at the end of 2007, inflation reached 8.6
percent in 2008 due to the food price crisis. The Government's reform process was disrupted by the
coup and the fiscal situation has deteriorated. Gross international reserves (excluding oil) had
declined to US$208 million at end 2007, equivalent to 1.9 months of imports of goods and services.
Government revenues, based largely on natural resources, have declined as (i) oil production fell
under 10,000 barrels a day, (ii) the price of iron ore, which is the main source of foreign currency,
fell by more than 30 percent in 2009, and (iii) the fishing industry is not doing well. The current
account deficit widened to 13 percent of GDP in 2009. The situation is critical, particularly in the
urban areas, where unemployment has reached record levels.



                                                 1
5.     Urban context. The urbanization rate stands at 62 percent, up from 4 percent in 1962. About
35 percent of the urban population lives in slums. The absence of economic infrastructure limits the
competitiveness of Mauritanian cities and their ability to reap the benefits of the economies of scale
normally linked to increased urbanization. In addition, living conditions in many neighborhoods are
affected by the lack of adequate urban services and the urban poor are particularly vulnerable to the
financial crisis, which has contributed to further degrading their quality of life.

6.      The original Credit. The original Development Credit Agreement for an amount of SDR 55.8
million (US$70.0 million equivalent) was signed on October 31, 2001. The Urban Development
Project (UDP) is the first phase of a two phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL), described in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) approved by the Board on October 25, 2001. Project
implementation was coordinated with parallel financing by other donors in the amount of US$9
million. The Credit became effective on April 30, 2002. The project was originally scheduled to
close on December 31, 2006, but it has been extended twice due to changes at the country level
which have led to holds put on contacts between the Government and the Bank. The current closing
date is June 30, 2011. An extension of the closing date of the original project will be required to
align it with the proposed closing date of the Additional Financing which is expected for June 30,
2012. As of June 3, 2010, 94 percent of the Credit has been disbursed. Disbursement projections
indicate that the total credit amount will be disbursed before the current closing date of June 30,
2011.

7.     Original project objectives. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) and APL objectives,
as stipulated in the Project Appraisal Document is to support Mauritania's central and local
governments to: (i) improve living conditions and promote employment opportunities in the main
towns of Mauritania, especially in slums; and (ii) strengthen the institutional framework and
capacity for urban and land management.

8.     Components of the original project: The project has four components:

       a)     Provision of basic urban infrastructure (US$75.85 million; IDA: US$54.30 million).
       Support to the first phase of a ten-year program of comprehensive slum upgrading in
       Nouakchott and to the extension of basic infrastructure and community facilities in 12
       regional capitals. Direct employment generation is expected through labor-intensive
       construction methods and, in the longer term, through infrastructure in support of labor-
       intensive economic activities.

       b)     Micro-credit (US$6.90 million, entirely funded by the Government). Credit for land
       tenure regularization or land acquisition, home construction or improvement, enterprise
       development, and employment promotion.

       c)     Institutional and capacity building (US$8.05 million; IDA: US$8.05 million).
       Technical assistance, training, and capacity building for: (a) local organizations, micro-
       enterprises, and the Human Rights, Poverty Alleviation, and Insertion Agency (CDHLCPI);
       (b) municipalities; and (c) government administration.

       d)     Auditing, monitoring, and operating costs of implementing agencies (US$6.56
       million; IDA: US$5.92 million).

                                                  2
9.       Project performance. During its eight years of implementation, the project has consistently
been rated Satisfactory in terms of its PDO and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings, despite the
challenges posed by the suspension of disbursements. The project has already achieved the targets
for its ten PDO indicators and eight out of the ten intermediate outcome indicators (the ninth related
to municipal revenue is currently being evaluated). Some of the main achievements are: (i)
generation of almost twice as much employment as expected (107,000 employment-months versus
an initial target of 40,000), (ii) increase in water consumption from 15 to 41 liters per person per day
(target: 25 liters) and reduction in water prices by 50 percent (as expected), (iii) regularization of
27,970 land titles (target: 3,000) and 15,238 land titles registered (target: 3,000), and (iv) transfer of
funds to municipalities increased tenfold, providing substance to the decentralization process. The
project has been affected by the holds on IDA funds, and especially complex reforms related to land
taxation and municipal taxes have taken time to materialize. However, the Government, in office
since August 2009, is fully committed to make progress in these important areas, which are being
supported by activities already planned under the original project. As a result, the Government sent
to the Bank two requests for Additional Financing, dated January 14, 2010 and March 4, 2010.

10.    Legal covenants. All dated legal covenants beyond the conditions for effectiveness are met.

11.    Procurement compliance is satisfactory. During the Bank's supervision mission in
September 2009, a post-procurement review was conducted and was assessed as satisfactory. The
review concluded that the project is complying with the Bank's procedures.

12.     Financial management performance is satisfactory. During the Bank's supervision mission
in September 2009, a financial management review was carried out by the Bank and was assessed
satisfactory. Financial audits were delivered on time and are unqualified. The Financial
Management Reports (FMRs) have also been submitted on time to IDA. A technical audit of works
implemented under the different components has been carried out regularly (every two years) by
independent consultants. The audits have found the technical quality of works to be satisfactory.
This assessment was confirmed by regular Bank supervision missions.

13.     Compliance with safeguards. The project is rated satisfactory in terms of overall safeguard
compliance: environmental safeguards are rated satisfactory and social safeguards (OP/BP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement) are rated highly satisfactory, due to the highly satisfactory handling of the
complex resettlement which was necessary for the El Mina slum upgrading, as evidenced in a study
conducted in 2004. The performance of the implementing agencies is satisfactory. In preparation of
Phase II, the Government and the Bank agreed to carry out a social audit of the resettlements to be
carried out by the Government in the slums proposed under Phase II. Those resettlements had been
carried out in Nouakchott (which is not covered under the Additional Financing) mostly during a
period when the Bank's activities in Mauritania had been put on hold due to the emergence of a de
facto Government.

14.    Rationale and reasons for requesting the Additional Financing. Based on the satisfactory
performance of the project and the scope of the needs, the Government requested Additional
Financing for the project to expand the scope of works under Component 1(d), provision of basic
urban infrastructure in the 12 regional capitals, in view of the high impact of these works on the
improvement of the quality of life of affected populations and the potential to mitigate the impact of

                                                    3
the financial crisis. As presented in paragraph 9, the activities related to Component 1 are
performing well, exceeding, in some cases, the end-of-project targets. Access to services and
infrastructure was significantly improved. However, the global economic downturn and the
domestic political crisis following the coup in August 2008 led to a deterioration of macroeconomic
conditions in Mauritania, with a significant increase of unemployment in urban surrounding areas.
The population is increasingly unable to pay for services delivered by the project (water, health,
transport, housing loans, etc.). This would seriously affect the achievement of the PDO, in particular
the improvement of living conditions and could compromise the second phase of the APL. If the
additional activities are implemented now, the created jobs and generated revenues will allow the
population to effectively benefit from the services and infrastructure built by the project.

15.     Providing the Additional Financing for the first phase of the APL will allow the Bank to
assist the Government of Mauritania in the short-term mitigation of the financial crisis by financing
activities that are fully aligned with longer-term development objectives. Appraisal of the Additional
Financing provided an opportunity to review triggers for the second phase of the APL and to sustain
momentum generated by the project until funds for urban development can be made available by the
Government or potentially under IDA 16. The proposed closing date until June 30, 2012 will allow
all activities to be fully implemented and ensure that the second phase of the APL can be fully
prepared under Phase 1.

16.     Justification of Crisis Response Window (CRW) resources. Overall GDP growth decelerated
from 11.4 percent in 2006 to 0.6 percent in 2008. After declining to 7.4 percent at the end of 2007,
inflation reached 8.6 percent in 2008 due to the food price crisis. The Government's reform process
was disrupted by the coup and the fiscal situation has deteriorated. Gross international reserves
(excluding oil) had declined to US$208 million at end 2007, equivalent to 1.9 months of imports of
goods and services. Government revenues, based largely on natural resources, have declined as (i)
oil production fell under 10,000 barrels a day, (ii) the price of iron ore, which is the main source of
foreign currency, fell by more than 30 percent in 2009, and (iii) the fishing industry is not doing
well. The current account deficit widened to 13 percent of GDP in 2009. The situation is critical,
particularly in the urban areas, where unemployment has reached a record level.

17.      The funds available under the Additional Financing will be used to scale up Component 1(d)
of the project1. This includes implementing works to reinforce the impact of the project in the slums
of the major cities of Mauritania and generating employment for unskilled labor, directly benefiting
the poorest part of the population. For the Additional Financing, the generation of temporary
employment through the use of labor-intensive construction techniques will be monitored as it has
regularly been done under the original project. While the indicator is not included as a formal
project indicator, it will be used to better monitor the project's immediate social impact. Based on
initial estimates by the Borrower, implementation of the proposed additional activities, using labor-
intensive construction techniques is expected to generate about 36,000 person-months of
employment, essentially distributing revenue to unskilled workers and the poorest part of the
population. This will contribute to reducing the social tension and allow the Government to avoid a
significant social crisis, in line with the objectives of the Crisis Response Window (CRW) resources
to manage the poverty, social, and economic impact of the crisis. The proposed Additional

    This corresponds to Part B of the original project in the Development Credit Agreement.

                                                             4
Financing will have a direct impact on poverty alleviation. The operation will also protect the poor
by ensuring that essential services, such as water, transport and electricity, are preserved.

18.     Consistency with the Country Assistance Strategy. The 2006 Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) is Mauritania's second generation of poverty reduction strategy. The FY08-FY11
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is aligned to the five themes of the strategy: (1) acceleration of
growth and stabilization of the macroeconomic framework; (2) centering growth in economic areas
benefiting the poor; (3) development of human resources and expansion of basic services; (4)
improved governance and capacity building; and (5) enhanced steering, monitoring, evaluation, and
coordination of efforts. The Bank is committed to supporting the second and third themes by
contributing to urban development and urban poverty reduction as well as to improving the quality
of, and universal access to, basic services, such as water supply.

19.      Coordination with other donors. The design of the Additional Financing fully takes into
account the activities funded by the Government and other development partners in the urban sector.
Given the importance of this sector for the economy and in the fight against poverty, more than
US$470 million is currently being spent in Mauritania's cities. Major donors include the French
Development Agency (AFD), the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), the
Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development and the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). As
about 90 percent of those funds have focused on Nouakchott, the capital city, it was agreed with the
Government to use the resources of the proposed Additional Financing on the other regional capital
cities already included in the scope of the original project.

20.     Risks. The overall risk associated with the original project was rated Moderate. Risks
identified during the preparation of the original project have not materialized. It is particularly
important to note that the Government has consistently provided timely counterpart funds under the
first phase of the project. However, some additional risks were identified during the project
implementation. In particular, these include risks related to the macro-economic framework, which
further justifies the use of CRW funds, as well as interruption of the dialogue between the
Government and the Bank for a period of about 15 months, which has impacted project progress in
the past. A full review of risks at the country, sectoral, and project levels was carried out during the
Bank's supervision mission in May 2010. The risks, as well their corresponding mitigating
measures, are fully developed in Annex 2. As a result, the overall residual risk of the Additional
Financing is Moderate.

III.   Proposed changes

21.     The original PDO has been revised to be more focused and better aligned with the proposed
activities. The revised objective reads as follows: To support Mauritania's central and local
governments to: (i) improve access to basic services and infrastructure in targeted urban areas; and
(ii) increase access to micro-finance and income-generating activities for populations living in
slums. The activities financed under the Additional Financing will scale up Component 1(d),
Provision of basic urban infrastructure in the 12 regional capitals, and will include the construction
of (i) paved road (25.7 km), (ii) unpaved roads (26 km), (iii) water supply (8.3 km of network), and
(iv) transmission and distribution lines (18.5 km of network and 210 street lamps), thereby
improving access to water, road, and electricity. The Additional Financing will enable these services
for an additional 120,000 persons, and will also create 36,000 employment-months, in line with the

                                                   5
objective of the CRW funds. While IDA funds will be dedicated to the works activities, the
Government will finance the costs related to the management fees of the national Public Works
Agency (AMEXTIPE) and operating costs of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), estimated at
US$2.4 million. The technical and financial audits of the works proposed under the Additional
Financing will be funded by the remaining funds under the original project.

IV.    Appraisal summary

22.    Appraisal of scaled-up activities. A thorough review of implementation progress has been
carried out during appraisal, including an updated cost analysis to ensure that the original project
and the proposed Additional Financing would complement other donors' operations within the
context of the urban development program.

23.    The detailed scope of works is presented in Annex 3 and was finalized and agreed at
appraisal. The determination of the activities considered for the Additional Financing takes into
account the following criteria: (i) priorities of the municipalities; (ii) degree of readiness of the
various infrastructure projects submitted for consideration; and (iii) other financing sources
(Government, development partners) already available in each of the municipalities. Engineering
studies as well as four bidding documents for works located in four (out of 9) cities are already
available. The bidding documents of all works identified for the entire program of the proposed
Additional Financing (US$25.5 million) will be finalized in June 2010, thus allowing a
disbursement of about US$18 million in 2011 and US$7.5 million in 2012.

24.     A socio-economic analysis was carried out as part of project preparation confirming the
economic justification of key activities. The proposed works were subject to an economic analysis
verifying that the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is above the minimum required 12 percent. The
recurrent maintenance cost incurred by the proposed program for water and electricity infrastructure
will be covered by the relevant public utilities (the national water company, SNDE, and the national
electricity company, SOMELEC). The recurrent maintenance cost incurred by the proposed road
program will be paid for by municipalities which are committed, through the municipal contract, to
mobilize the required resources.

25.    Safeguard aspects. The project was rated Category A due to the resettlement of a community
that was located in an urban slum area. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared in 2001 and
successfully implemented and completed in March 2004. An Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) was also elaborated in 2001 and has concluded that there was no major environmental impact.

26.     The Additional Funding activities will mainly focus on roadway, adduction systems, and
electrification. An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) have been elaborated, indicating that the activities proposed under the
Additional Financing will involve minor or moderate negative environmental and social impacts
(arable lands (destruction of crop fields) and on the domestic infrastructure (fences, septic tanks,
etc)). The elaboration of those framework documents involved main stakeholders (including mayors,
consultants, and representatives from government and civil society) and a consultation workshop
was held on May 4, 2010 to present and discuss all the ESMF and RPF findings. It was concluded
that the Additional Financing be given a safeguards rating of Category B. These safeguard


                                                 6
instruments have been disclosed in the country on May 4, 2010 and at the Bank's Infoshop on May
19, 2010.

27.     Implementation arrangements. The Additional Financing scales up Component 1(d) of the
original project. The same implementation arrangements as those used for this component under the
original project will be used for the Additional Financing. Two entities will be involved: (i) the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) which will continue handling the overall project monitoring,
reporting to the Bank, and auditing. The PCU reports to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Development and the Coordinating Committee; and (ii) the executing agency, the national agency
for public works, AMEXTIPE, in charge of implementing all the activities proposed under the
Additional Financing on behalf of the communes, on a contract management basis.

28.     Concerned municipalities have already selected their subprojects, programming, and
operation and maintenance. The Government and the concerned municipalities will sign new
agreements with AMEXTIPE on project implementation arrangements. New Delegated Contract
Management Agreements (Conventions de maîtrise d'ouvrage déléguée, MDOD) in form and
substance satisfactory to IDA will be signed between AMEXTIPE and each of the concerned cities.
The agreements (Municipal contracts) will be signed between the Government and each of the nine
participating municipalities specifying the roles and responsibilities of the cities, line ministries, and
central government, and the policy reforms to be undertaken by each party (i.e. under these
Agreements, the beneficiary cities will commit to set aside some of their budget funds for
maintenance of the investments financed under the project). Those draft documents were prepared
during project preparation and are expected to be signed in the week following Board approval.

29.     Closing date. The current closing date of the original project is June 30, 2011. An extension
of the closing date will be required to align it with the proposed closing date of the Additional
Financing which is expected for June 30, 2012. As of May 17, 2010, 94 percent of the Credit has
been disbursed. Disbursement projections indicate that the total credit amount will be disbursed
before the current closing date.

30.     Procurement arrangements. The procurement management function of the project has
continued to be satisfactory. The implementation of contracts already awarded is proceeding in
accordance with the procurement plan. In order to mitigate the procurement risk and facilitate the
implementation of the activities of the additional financing, the procurement of goods, works, and
services will be carried out by AMEXTIPE. As the executing agency, AMEXTIPE will be
responsible for preparing bidding documents, coordinating and monitoring bidding processes, and
liaising with IDA. The PCU will have to handle a limited number of activities, including monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) activities as well as technical and financial audits. The PCU includes
qualified and experienced procurement specialists who have access to appropriate tools and
knowledge, to enable them to carry out their functions effectively.

31.    The procurement activities funded under the Additional Financing will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
(dated May 2004, revised October 2006 and May 1, 2010)" and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (dated May 2006, revised October 2006 and
May 1, 2010). For each contract to be financed under the Additional Financing, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated

                                                    7
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame have all been agreed between the Borrower and
IDA in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated as required ­ at least annually
­ to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

32.    Procurement capacity assessment, action plan, risk rating, and thresholds. A participatory
procurement capacity assessment of the existing implementing agency, AMEXTIPE, was conducted
during program preparation of the Urban Development Project (Credit 3574-MAU) in March 2001
and reassessed annually as part of the procurement supervision missions and procurement post
reviews of the original project. The following points emerged from the assessment and
reassessments: (i) AMEXTIPE is staffed with several procurement specialists and task programs
managers with extensive experience in IDA and with other donors' procurement procedures; (ii) the
agency is well organized and has clearly defined procurement responsibilities; and (iii) the agency
has the capacity to manage procurement cycles well and has a good procurement record-keeping
system.

33.     Financial management: disbursement arrangements, reporting, and auditing. A financial
management assessment was carried in May 2010 in the context of the supervision mission of the
original project. The objective of the mission was to determine whether the PCU in charge of project
implementation continues to maintain an acceptable financial management system in place. The
conclusion of the assessment is that the financial management system in place, subject to the
reinforcement measures, satisfies the Bank's minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.02, Financial
Management, and is therefore adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely
financial management information on the status of the project required by Bank.

34.     All the fiduciary aspects of the current operation will be handled by the qualified fiduciary
team of the PCU who has strong knowledge and experience in the Bank's fiduciary procedures;
while the technical aspect will be handling by AMEXTIPE under a Delegated Management Contract
Agreement.
