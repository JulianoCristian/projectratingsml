INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY FOR A
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendations on the proposed
loan to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$33.0 million to
assist in financing the Fifth Highways Project. The loan would have a term
of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7.45% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An updating economic report covering short-term development entitled
"Economic Memorandum on Paraguay" (1582-PA) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1977. An economic mission visited the country in September
1977 to evaluate the regional development prospects of the area adjacent to
the Parana River. The mission is preparing a special report on this topic.
A summary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
Economic Performance
3.         Paraguay is endowed with vast areas of unutilized lands well-suited
for agriculture or livestock, and substantial hydroelectric potential, largely
on the Parana River which forms its eastern and southern borders. Despite
these natural resources, Paraguay has experienced severe obstacles in the
process of development. Its remoteness from foreign markets, its scattered
population, its weak transport network, and its dependence on rural production
present formidable constraints to growth. The private sector still consists
mainly of small traditional firms, and the role of the public sector in the
economy is limited. For many decades, per capita income and employment grew
slowly and emigration served as an outlet for unemployed and underemployed
manpower. More recently, however, many Paraguayans who had emigrated to
neighboring countries have returned, responding to the expanded employment
opportunities associated with the construction of the Itaipu dam. Furthermore
the expansion of the agricultural frontier has generated immigration of farmers
from abroad. Nevertheless, the country's population density remains very low
in relation to agricultural land.
4.        The economic potential of the country has begun to be realized
during the 1970's. The most significant factors leading to the changed
circumstances have been a rapid expansion of land under cultivation and
the beginning of the exploitation of the enormous hydroelectric potential
1/   This part is identical to the one contained in the President's Report for
the Rural Water Supply Project (Report No. P-2172-PA of November 21, 1977).



- 2 -
of the part of the Parana River along the country's border. A rise in
external demand and favorable prices were instrumental in accelerating agri-
cultural growth. The effective supply response of Paraguayan agriculture
was made possible by an effort to improve the transport infrastructure and to
implement a comprehensive set of programs designed to increase and diversify
exports of agricultural products. The good performance of agriculture in
recent years has brought about an improvement in the real incomes of the rural
population, which comprises about three-fifths of the total. A significant
share of production of tobacco, cotton, and soybeans, which account for most
of the recent expansion, is grown by small farmers who have received land
under the Government's colonization programs. Roughly one out of every four
agricultural workers have benefitted from these land settlement efforts.
Moreover, rural wages have increased sharply in some areas where demand for
agricultural labor has recently exceeded supply. Thus, the benefits of agri-
cultural progress have been fairly widely shared. This has acted to reduce
the levels of rural-urban migration. Per capita income grew at 5.8% per
annum during 1972-76 compared to the 1.2% averaged during the previous 30
years. Economic growth has also been accompanied by improvements in the
social aspects as evidenced by increases in the level of life expectancy
and literacy, and a reduction in infant mortality. Nutritional levels are
comparable to those found in other countries with higher per capita incomes.
Furthermore, the Government has started to emphasize over the last three
years a series of programs aimed at extending social and other back-up services,
financial support, and technical assistance to existing and new land settle-
ments. These programs should help in spreading the benefits of growth more
effectively among the poorer segments of the population. The proposed Rural
Water Supply Project reflects the thrust of recent Government programs.
5.        Exploitation of the country's hydropower potential has been facil-
itated by treaties signed with Brazil and Argentina to form two binational
authorities for the construction and operation of two or more hydroelectric
plants aggregating at least 17,000 MW. Actual construction of the Itaipu dam
with Brazil, one of the largest projects of its kind ever built, has begun and
is on schedule. These developments have been accompanied by increased foreign
capital inflows, a notable expansion of investment levels, and an acceleration
of economic growth. Paraguay's economy is now in the midst of a rapid trans-
formation spurred mainly by agricultural expansion and construction activity
on the Itaipu dam. The rapid growth of agriculture has continued unabated
in 1977, and, together with the reactivation of agroindustrial activity in
the wood and beef sectors, should make possible the attainment of a 7.5-8%
GDP growth rate.
6.        The growth of private savings and capital formation has permitted
the economy to reach a high overall level of savings in recent years (21.8%
of gross domestic income in 1976). Although consumption has declined rather
steadily relative to GDP during 1972-76, there has still been a fairly substan-
tial gain in per capita consumption (2.7% per year) during this period. More-
over, fiscal and monetary policies have been generally successful in preventing
inflation originating in the foreign sector from reaching an excessive rate.
The increase in domestic prices which had reached 22% in 1974 decelerated to
8% in 1975 and 6% in 1976, paralleling the tapering off of price increases
for imports and exports. Inflation may reach 10% in 1977 owing primarily to
the rapid increase in the money supply generated by large capital inflows
associated with the construction of the Itaipu dam.



- 3 -
7.        Total Central Administration revenues have declined relative to
GDP, from 9.7% in 1974 to 8.9% in 1976. This has largely been due to a rela-
tive decline in revenues from taxes on international trade, reflecting the
Government's attempt to stimulate private investment by removing or reducing
import duties. The Government has been able to compensate for lagging revenues
by keeping a fairly tight rein on current expenditures. While these have
remained at about the same proportion of GDP over the last three years, there
has been a gradual decline in Central Government savings from 2.6 to 2.1% of
GDP (still considerably above the 1972/73 level). Public capital expenditures
have increased steadily relative to GDP over the past two years so that over-
all budgetary balance has swung from a small surplus to a small deficit. Net
external financing has exceeded the deficit, allowing the Government to reduce
its debt outstanding to the monetary authorities.
8.        Paraguay has enjoyed a good overall balance-of-payments performance
in recent years largely as a result of heavy capital inflows including direct
investment, foreign exchange flows associated with construction of the Itaipu
dam and foreign borrowing by the Government. Thus, despite modest growth of
exports and a rapidly widening current account deficit reflecting higher fuel
costs and large-scale imports of capital goods, Paraguay has experienced a
gain in net foreign exchange reserves during the past three years. Net foreign
exchange reserves reached a level of US$152 million at the end of 1976, equiva-
lent to four months of imports. The good balance-of-payments performance is
continuing in 1977 with a further increase of net reserves.
Economic Prospects
9.        Paraguay's development prospects are quite favorable.  The exploita-
tion of the country's vast hydropower resources will provide a source of
foreign exchange earnings and abundant energy. The construction of the
hydroelectric projects will continue to provide a significant stimulus to
the growth of the economy, while capital inflows associated with them strengthen
the balance of payments. In addition, since only a small portion of the
country's arable land is presently under cultivation, there is considerable
potential for further expansion of agriculture and agroindustry taking
advantage of extensive land suitable for agriculture, livestock and forestry.
10.       The country's development strategy aims at sustaining the growth
momentum of agriculture and agroindustry, giving high priority to land settle-
ment and to the provision of transport infrastructure to facilitate the flow
of goods to markets and export outlets. The Government is carrying out a
program to assist farm settlers to increase their productivity, and is
expanding credit for agriculture and agroindustries. In the case of small
farmers, the emphasis is on the consolidation of existing colonization
schemes and the establishment of some additional ones. Through foreign
private investment and credit programs, the Government hopes to encourage
the concurrent development of industries, particularly of those that would
help raise the value-added content of primary production.



- 4 -
11.       The authorities are aware that the on-going boom in private invest-
ment and the prospect of continued high levels of GDP growth will call for
greater public investment in supporting infrastructure as well as increased
expenditure for education, health, rural development and other development-
related services. An acceleration of public capital formation will require
tax measures, pending substantial transfers from power export earnings to
the Central Government, to ensure the generation of additional internal
resources to provide the domestic contribution for a balanced investment
program. At the same time, higher current expenditures in the public sector
will be required to improve effectiveness and broaden the scope of public
action in the social sectors. The favorable prospects of the economy should
also allow for improvement in the rate of growth of private consumption.
12.       The level and pattern of public investment that could be achieved
during the next five years will also depend on the technical and adminis-
trative capacity of the public sector to prepare and implement projects.
Although improvements have been made in the planning mechanism in recent
years, a bigger public sector investment program would require a large
number of well-prepared projects. There is a need, therefore, for upgrading
the technical aspects of project identification and preparation, and for
devoting increased attention to enhancing the administrative capacity of
public sector institutions. A broader investment effort will require stream-
lining and decentralizing the decision-making process. Moreover, salaries of
scarce professional staff need to be adjusted upwards to compete effectively
with the increased demands of the private sector for their services. Given
the medium-term nature of these types of obstacles and the urgent need for
greater public investment to support higher levels of private economic
activity, substantial external technical assistance will be needed more than
ever before to bolster the institution-building process.
13.       The direct capital inflows stemming from the Itaipu project will
be more than sufficient to finance its contribution to the current account
deficit and should, in fact, cover 65% of net capital inflows during the
next five years. Under the terms of the treaty, the debt associated with
these capital inflows is guaranteed entirely by Brazil and does not form part
of Paraguay's external public debt. The debt of the Binational Entity will,
in turn, be serviced through the sale of the electricity produced by the dam
after the first turbines are installed in 1983. This situation will still
leave a requirement of approximately US$200 million per year during 1977-81
to be financed from other sources. Direct private investment, which can be
expected to continue growing rapidly, should provide about US$60 million.
Suppliers' credits and official external assistance will probably provide US$100
million per year. The remaining gap of about US$40 million would need to be
financed by borrowing from commercial banks. Since Paraguay has in the past
obtained the bulk of its capital needs on concessionary terms, its present debt
service ratio (7.2% in 1976) is relatively low. The additional borrowing of
this estimated magnitude should raise the debt service ratio to around 10-12%
until 1981, which is well within the bounds of continued creditworthiness.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
14.       Paraguay has received US$146.1 million (net of cancellations) of
Bank loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$96.3 million has been in the
form of thirteen IBRD loans, and eight credits totalling US$49.8 million have
been made from IDA resources. As of December 31, 1977, the Bank and IDA
held US$136.9 million, including US$76.3 million undisbursed. The amount
held by the Bank and IDA as of December 31, 1976, was equivalent to 25.2% of
Paraguay's external debt, with a blend of about 45% IDA and 55% IBRD. The
service on this debt amounted to 13.1% of total debt service in 1976 repre-
senting about 1% of exports of goods and nonfactor services. On a sectoral
basis, Bank and IDA assistance to Paraguay has been 50% for agriculture, 22%
for transportation, 14% for education, 7% for industry, 4% for water supply,
and 3% for preinvestment studies in various sectors. Execution of these
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory.
15.       IFC has had only one operation in Paraguay.  In 1974, it financed a
wood processing project. Its participation, a US$5.4 million operation with
FINAP, S.A., consisted of a US$4.0 million loan, an equity participation of
US$1.0 million, and a contingent loan for the financing of cost overruns of
US$0.4 million. Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of December 31, 1977 and notes on the execution of on-
going projects.
16.       Bank Group lending to Paraguay was very active in FY77, and three
loans totalling US$40 million and a credit of US$4.0 million were approved
for education, rural development and industrial credit. In FY78, the program
consists of the recently approved rural water supply project and the proposed
fifth highway project. In addition, work is underway on a livestock project
and preparation of a third rural development project is about to begin.
17.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the Govern-
ment in achieving four major objectives which are interdependent and comple-
mentary. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely than
before and, more particularly, to attack directly the problem of rural
poverty. A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output, including
exports, by supporting projects that directly or indirectly make large con-
tributions to production and employment. A third objective is to support
programs that will bring about improvements in the management of the economy
and, particularly, that will help to strengthen public institutions and
financial intermediaries. A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient ex-
ternal resources to complement Paraguay's domestic savings and provide the
necessary funds for maintaining an adequate level of economic and social
investments in a framework of sound domestic finances.
18.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its com-
position. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed
and may, moreover, support more specific government objectives. Thus, Bank
Group assistance for education, rural development and rural water supply is



designed to help ease the rural poverty problem and to improve the living
standards of the lowest 40% of the income distribution scale. Bank Group
lending for industry and livestock is aimed at increasing the value added of
agricultural products destined for export and at expanding marketing outlets,
particularly for small farmers. Lastly, loans in the transport sector are
designed to help improve institutional structures and policies of the sector,
which play a vital role in supporting the production activities of the agri-
cultural and industrial sectors. The proposed project will help strengthen
further the highway maintenance organization and capacity as well as meet the
increasing demand for all weather roads.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
19.       Landlocked, with its economy based on primary and processed agri-
cultural products, Paraguay depends heavily for its continued economic devel-
opment on the maintenance and expansion of its transport system. Some 80% of
the population, most of the rich agricultural soils, and all of the country's
major hydroelectric resources are concentrated southeast of the Paraguay River
in what is known as the "triangulo" area of Asuncion-Encarnacion-Puerto Presidente
Stroessner. Historically, economic growth has centered in the area of the
"triangulo" while the main artery for external trade has been the Paraguay
River south of Asuncion entering the River Plate Basin and the sea. Since the
late 1960's, the Government has made determined efforts to expand outwards
from this base with the objective of: (a) closing the "Triangulo" by linking
Puerto Presidente Stroessner and Encarnacion to Asuncion by all-weather roads;
(b) improving links with the road and rail systems of neighboring Brazil and
Argentina, affording alternative routes to the Atlantic Ocean; (c) progres-
sively penetrating the Chaco, the underpopulated ranchlands northwest of the
Paraguay River; and (d) maintaining and improving domestic airport facilities.
The Transport System
(a) River Transport and Ports
20.       About 80% of Paraguay's international traffic is handled by river.
The Paraguay and the Parana are the principal navigable rivers of Paraguay
and, with River Plate, constitute a 1,600 km system. Bulk exports, such as
wood products, cattle and meat, tobacco, cotton and soya are mostly shipped
from the river ports of Asuncion (Paraguay River), and Encarnacion (Parana
River) to Buenos Aires for onloading to seagoing vessels. North of Asuncion,
the Paraguay River continues to provide the only reliable means of communication
to agricultural settlements around Concepcion and the northeast border with
Brazil. However, river transport is restricted by the limited depth and width
of navigable channels in the Paraguay River and the high speed of current in
the Parana River. The Government is planning to convert its merchant fleet
from self-propelled ships to convoys of barges and pushtugs in the 1980s, and



- 7 -
is currently reviewing the need for complementary investment in navigation
equipment and civil works. The port of Asuncion, improved with Bank financing
(Loan 437-PA, US$2.8 million, December 1965), is by far the largest of the
country's ports and has sufficient capacity, although handling facilities and
equipment are in need of renewal.
(b) Air Transport
21.       International passenger traffic is growing rapidly and has more
than tripled since 1964. Domestic air traffic, while low in terms of absolute
numbers, is important because it often constitutes the only means of trans-
port among various sections of the country, especially during the wet season
when many roads are closed. Two scheduled airlines provide domestic air
transportation. The growth of domestic aviation is hampered by antiquated
aircraft, inadequate air fields and poor navigational aids, and there is a
need for institutional development. Studies have therefore been carried out
with financing from IDA Credit 587-PA (Preinvestment Studies Project) with a
view to developing proposals for improvements in the sector. The Government
is at present reviewing its policies with regard to the development of air
transportation.
(c) Railways
22.       The continued operation of the President Carlos Antonio Lopez (PCAL)
railway is a permanent tenet of Government policy. It crosses the "Triangulo"
area from Asuncion to Encarnacion (376 km) and is linked by ferry with the
Argentine railway. Railway traffic is small in absolute as well as relative
terms when compared to other modes. In fact the railway does not attract
sufficient traffic to be financially self-sustaining. In 1971 the Bank
obtained a Government undertaking to limit railway subsidies. The deficit of
the railway has been maintained at moderate levels increasing from US$680,000
in 1971 to US$900,000 in 1976. Several studies, including a recently prepared
Transport Plan, have suggested limited track rehabilitation, which would main-
tain the railway in operation at lesser costs and would allow it to increase
slightly its freight traffic while continuing to provide an alternative to
river and road transport connecting with Argentina. In line with this, the
Government is exploring the possibility of obtaining a loan from Argentina to
finance a limited rehabilitation of PCAL. While this rehabilitation appears
to be desirable, it would be important to maintain a limit on the scope of the
proposed investments. The Bank has agreed with Government that over the
project period (1978-82) it would: (i) not undertake investments in PCAL's
permanent way and rolling stock without prior review by MOPC's Office of
Coordination and Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT); and (ii) inform the
Bank of investment of more than US$5 million in any given year (Section 4.06
of the draft Loan Agreement).
(d) Highways
23.       Road development in Paraguay really commenced in 1950 when the
total road network was only 850 km; ten years later, the network had reached
2,165 km (9% was paved). Today the network totals 8,500 km (13% is paved), of



- 8 -
which 6,700 km are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works (MOPC).
Past efforts were concentrated on connecting economic and population centers
and paving the most heavily travelled roads. However, because of rain, some
of the roads are closed up to 100 days per year affecting adversely the
economic development of vast areas of the country.
24.       The area best served by roads is the southeastern part of Paraguay
(the "Triangulo" area). The two principal inter-urban routes, Asuncion-Puerto
Presidente Stroessner (376 km) and Asuncion-Encarnacion (370 km) are paved all-
weather roads. Historical traffic survey data are not reliable, but a survey
taken in 1976 estimates system average daily traffic at 184 vehicles, with paved
roads carrying an average of 1,029 vehicles per day. Traffic appears to have
been growing at an average rate of about 7.7% per year since the mid-1960's.
25.       Road transport is regulated by the General Transport Directorate,
a department of MOPC. Domestic truck transport is practically unregulated,
and there is little information concerning fleet size or capacity. Many
small local operators and 18 Paraguayan international companies as well as
23 foreign companies are operating in the country. Past and current efforts
to enforce axle load regulations have not been effective. Overloading is a
major problem, particularly on the dirt roads where serious damage can be
caused by only a few trucks. To overcome this problem, the proposed project
provides for the installation of automatic weighing stations and adoption
of an enforcement program including operating procedures.
26.       Highway expenditures are financed through the Government's general
budget. Over the period 1970-1975, about 40% of total highway construction
(US$1.1 million equivalent p.a. average) was financed by external borrowing.
Maintenance outlays are funded by taxes on fuels and a surcharge on vehicle
imports. The proceeds of road user charges have substantially exceeded
highway expenditures since 1970 and in the future are expected to continue
providing sufficient resources to support the development of the road network,
including increased maintenance outlays.
27.       The Direccion General de Vialidad (DGV, part of MOPC) is responsible
for planning, constructing and maintenance of all national and departmental
roads, except in the Chaco area where the Army has constructed and maintains
about 1,800 km of roads. The strong demand for qualified technical personnel
for the Itaipu and the Yacyreta-Apipe Hydroelectric projects has reduced
MOPC's ability to retain experienced staff especially at Vialidad's headquarters.
The present project would include the establishment of a Project Unit which
would be in a position to offer competitive salaries to attract experienced
engineers and managers necessary to carry out the project.
28.       Highway maintenance is performed through four district offices.  The
Government with assistance from the Bank has achieved substantial progress in
highway maintenance over the last fifteen years. The Government's awareness
of the situation is reflected in the yearly maintenance allocations, which
increased from US$1.5 million in 1970 to over US$3.3 million in 1976.



- 9 -
29.       In order to facilitate highway planning and engineering DGV will
(i) adopt by December 31, 1979 a set of design standards, and construction
specifications; and (ii) complete a road inventory not later than December 31,
1980 and update it every five years thereafter (Sections 3.06 (a), 3.06(b) and
4.08 respectively, of draft Loan Agreement).
Transport Planning and Coordination
30.       One of the major problems in the transport sector has been the lack
of overall sector policies and coordination of investment decisions. Pursuant
to the recommended terms of a UNDP transport survey, the Government created
OCIPT. OCIPT, as a first step toward establishment of a planning mechanism,
advises the Government on transport planning and coordination. The Fourth
Highways Project (Loan 1059-PA) enabled OCIPT over its first year of operation
to begin a systematic collection of data relevant to planning and to draft a
transport plan including a ten-year transport investment program. OCIPT also
completed a series of feasibility studies for a total of about 400 km of roads,
including the study on which the road element in the proposed project is based.
The task of developing OCIPT is far from being completed; its continued
strengthening would be one of the goals of the proposed project.
Past Bank Assistance for Highways
31.       Over the past 16 years, the Bank Group has been assisting the devel-
opment of road transport in Paraguay. Four highway projects (total lending
US$30.8 million) were made since 1964, which resulted in (a) upgrading of more
than 600 km of primary roads, that is, more than 65% of the network presently
paved; and (b) building up the maintenance capacity. In addition, three agri-
cultural projects have provided US$13.6 million for improvement and maintenance
of more than 1,200 km of feeder roads. Although much remains to be done in
terms of adequate road maintenance, the series of highway projects have, over
the years, transformed a modest and uncoordinated maintenance department into
a dynamic countrywide organization which, over the coming years, should be
able to cope with growing traffic demands within the limitation of a road
network which has less than 10% of its roads paved. The previous projects
have established an adequate organizational structure and logistic support
including communications, and other related equipment and services.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report Fifth Highway Project"
(No. 1721b-PA dated January 27, 1978) is being distributed separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is being placed at the front of this report. A Supplemen-
tary Project Data Sheet is appended as Annex III. The project was identified
by MOPC in March 1975, and subsequently prepared by consultants during 1976-77.
The project was appraised in May 1977. This was followed by a post appraisal
mission, which visited Paraguay in October 1977. Negotiations were held in
Washington from January 16, 1978 to January 20, 1978; the Paraguayan Delegation
was led by Dr. Cesar Romeo Acosta, President of the Central Bank.

Project Objectives and General Description
33.       The main objectives of the proposed project are to:  (a) improve
the integration of the major northern area of the country to the main popu-
lation centers through upgrading a high priority road; (b) strengthen and
expand the capacity of MOPC to ensure an adequate level of maintenance of
the national highway network; and (c) continue the strengthening of transport
planning and coordination. The maintenance component of the project largely
reflects experience gained under previous projects; points of emphasis would
be systematic equipment renewal, regular supply of spare parts, training,
strengthening of headquarters' staff and more stringent enforcement of
vehicle weight regulations.
34.       Specifically, the project consists of the following:
(i)  Upgrading, including paving, of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San
Estanislao Road (about 98 km)
- civil works, and supervision of construction;
(ii) Four-Year Maintenance Program (1979-1982)
- resealing and partial strengthening of the Paraguari-
Encarnacion road (302 km);
- acquisition of new maintenance and workshop equipment to
meet the maintenance requirements of an expanding network
for 1979-1982 and replacement of units being retired
from service;
- a road betterment program and overhaul and intensive
maintenance of about 260 equipment units;
- strengthening of MOPC headquarters' staff through the
establishment of a "Project Unit" for planning,
programming and supervising implementation of annual
maintenance programs and acquisition of mini-computers
to mechanize the accounting operations of DGV;
- training for engineers, technicians and operators; and
(iii) Transport Sector Management
- preparation of a highway inventory and development of
design standards and construction specifications;
- preparation and implementation of measures to improve
and reinforce control of axle weights, including improve-
ment of existing weighing stations and construction of new
ones; and



- 11 -
- strengthening of the OCIPT and provision of related
equipment (traffic counters and miscellaneous vehicles).
Implementation of the project is expected to take about four years (1979-1982).
Reconstruction of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao Road (98 km)
35.       This road is the backbone of the transportation system of the north-
eastern part of Paraguay, acting as collector of the traffic with origin and
destination in Asuncion and Puerto Presidente Stroessner. Its improvement
to paved standards would provide less costly and more reliable access to the
rich agricultural lands north of Asuncion and east of the Paraguay River.
Population growth in this region has exceeded the national average. Most of
the expanding agricultural production of the area including timber and live-
stock is destined for southern Paraguay for consumption or processing and
depends therefore on the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara road. The present road, with
its poor riding surface and the periodic flooding of some sections, is no
longer adequate for the growing traffic (currently some 400 vehicles per
day).
The Four-Year Maintenance Program
36.       The proposed project would include the resealing of the Paraguari-
Encarnacion road (302 km). In view of the critical nature of resealing and
overlays and the fact that they represent large lump sum expenditures, DGV
should expand its capacity to plan for future requirements. The Government
has confirmed that by December 31, 1981 DGV will prepare the requirements
for sealings and overlays for the next ten years (Section 4.03 (c) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The proposed project would provide maintenance and workshop equipment
to replace worn-out equipment. The project would keep up and expand DGV's
maintenance capacity to enable it to carry out a four-year (1979-1982) mainte-
nance program. The program, as devised by consultants Roy Jorgensen Inc.
(USA) - Tecnipar (Paraguay), includes a road betterment element aimed at
reducing closure periods during heavy rains. About 5,200 km of roads have to
receive betterments, of which 880 km are gravel surfaced and 4,320 km are
earth surfaced. Yearly targets and scope of betterment works have been
agreed. DGV will consult with the Bank on its annual programs starting 1979
(Section 3.04 (b) of draft Loan Agreement). The maintenance program would
continue institutional improvements initiated under previous Bank projects,
mainly in maintenace planning and training of DGV staff. The project would
also provide improvement of DGV's accounting, budgeting and inventory system.
38.       A substantial part of MOPC's equipment fleet is in need of overhaul.
The remainder of the fleet is approaching the end of its economic life and
would require intensive maintenance over the next few years. The project would
provide spare parts to overhaul about 110 salvageable units and to reconstitute
stocks necessary for the continued maintenance of about 154 aging but still
operating equipment units. The overhaul of the equipment will be carried But



- 12 -
and completed before December 31, 1980, according to a program acceptable to
the Bank. The Government will submit a detailed program before September 30,
1978 (Section 3.04 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement). To provide MOPC with a
regular flow of parts, the Government has also confirmed that in the fiiti.r'
DGV would receive sufficient resources in its current budget, under a separate
heading, to cover current spare parts requirements. The Government has also
confirmed that it would continue to facilitate direct importation of spare
parts by DGV, particularly by expediting the handling of related administrative
procedures (Section 4.03(b)(i) of the draft Loan Agreement).
39.       The Government does not have a systematic approach to the renewal of
worn-out equipment. Over the past ten years, MOPC has relied mostly on Bank
projects to effect large purchases every four to five years. This pattern of
lump renewal is not conducive to continuity in maintenance operations or to
the adoption of improved fleet maintenance methods. To provide a basis for
the systematic renewal of the fleet, the Government has agreed to establish
an equipment renewal fund under the authority of MOPC with annual allocations
sufficient to ensure timely renewal of the fleet, such allocation to be no
less than US$1.3 million equivalent (February 1978 values) per year starting
in 1981 (Section 4.03(b-ii) of draft Loan Agreement).
40.       The continuous expansion of DGV activities has shown that more
advanced systems of cost accounting, budgetary control, inventories and
administration are required. Consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar have carried
out a thorough study of the problem and recommended mechanization of account-
ing operations, for which the purchase of mini-computers is proposed. DGV
and the Bank agreed that this mechanization is urgently needed, and the
present project includes US$150,000 equivalent for purchase of the equipment.
The equipment would be supplied and installed by a specialized firm which
would also carry out a training program for the accounting staff of DGV.
41.       Over the period 1979 to 1982, maintenance expenditures would have
to be gradually increased from their present level to about US$6.33 million
equivalent in 1982 (end 1976 values). The proposed increases are in line
with MOPC's absorptive capacity. The Government has confirmed that it will
continue to provide adequate funding for highway maintenance in these orders
of magnitudes. Minimum estimates of requirements during the project period
including provisions for betterment, equipment renewal and supply of spare
parts have been agreed (Sections 3.01 and 4.03 (a) and (b) of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Sector Management
42.       The proposed project provides for continued technical assistance
(about 42 man-months) to OCIPT for transport planning and for the preparation
of an enforcement program for vehicle weight control. The project would
strengthen the role of OCIPT in evaluating projects and advising the Government
on intersectoral priorities. The Government has given assurances that it will
provide OCIPT with the necessary resources to carry out the above mentioned



- 13 -
tasks (Section 3.01 (c) and 4.07 of the draft Loan Agreement). The project
would also provide technical support and equipment for the establishment of a
permanent program of traffic counts which is a requisite for improved highway
planning. The Government has confirmed its commitment to the establishment of
such a program (Sections 3.07 and 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
43.       The project would include purchase of automatic scales and their
installation. The project would also include a study of the regulatory
framework and institutional arrangements for effective enforcement of vehicle
weight regulations. This study which would start not later than September 30,
1978, would be carried out by DGV with technical assistance provided under the
project following terms of reference agreed with the Bank. The Government has
confirmed that it will adopt an enforcement program based on such study
acceptable to the Bank not later than December 31, 1979. Adoption of such a
program is a condition for disbursement for the scales and weighing stations
(Section 3.05 of, and Part 4(-iii) of Schedule 1 to, draft Loan Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financing
44.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$48.1 million equiva-
lent, the estimated foreign expenditure component of which is US$38 million.
Of this, US$33.0 million equivalent would be financed by the proposed loan.
The Government is prepared to finance the remainder but has approached private
foreign banks regarding the possibility of a loan of about US$5 million at
medium-term. We have informed the prospective lenders and the Government that
we would be prepared to recommend to the Executive Directors to associate the
proposed Bank loan with the commercial bank's loan if this were to result in
better terms for the Government than it would otherwise obtain in international
markets. If such a cofinancing operation materializes we would return to the
Executive Directors with full details regarding the proposed private loan and
appropriate recommendations for amendments to the Bank's loan agreement.
45.       A contingency allowance of 10% has been included to cover increases in
construction quantities. About 17% of the project base cost has been allowed for
foreign price variations and 23% for local prices over the implementation period
for equipment, civil works and consultants. The average cost per man-month of
consultant services is assumed to range from US$2,000 to US$5,000 equivalent for
supervision of construction, setting up the project unit and for providing
technical assistance. The various consulting services would require a total
of about 590 man-months.
Execution, Procurement and Disbursements
46.       MOPC would be responsible for the execution of the project.  Because
of the shortage of qualified personnel and the additional workload resulting
from the implementation of the proposed project, a Project Unit would be
established within DGV to assist in carrying out the maintenance component of
the project. During its initial stage, the unit would include three inter-
nationally recruited engineers, for periods of about twelve months, to train
local personnel and establish working procedures. The unit would also comprise
six locally recruited engineers and technicians for the overall project period.
To attract qualified individuals and to compete with the high salaries paid by
the binational hydroelectric authorities, who are after similar type of skills,



- 14 -
the salaries of the local and foreign personnel would be eligible for disburse-
ment under the proposed Bank loan. The composition, functions and operation
of the Project Unit, as well as its terms of reference including its staffing
plan, have been agreed (Section 3.03 (a) of, and Schedule 5, to draft Loan
Agreement). The creation of the Project Unit and the recruitment of at least
three engineers should be completed no later than August 31, 1978 and it
should be fully staffed no later than March 31, 1979 (Section 3.03 (a) and (b)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
47.       It is anticipated that by the end of the project period, DGV would
be able to retain the Paraguayan members of the Project Unit and integrate
them into its expanded organizational structure. The Government has confirmed
that it will, before the end of the third year of the program (1981), consult
the Bank to ensure adequate staffing of DGV including the reassignment within
DGV of the Project Unit staff functions and responsibilities (Section 3.03 (c)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
48.       Civil works contracts for road upgrading and resealing would be
awarded through international competitive bidding following prequalification.
Minor civil works contracts for construction of weighing stations would be
awarded following local bidding procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
49.       The procurement program for equipment and parts indicating lot
sizes, estimated costs and proposed exceptions to international competitive
bidding, would be subject to prior approval of the Bank. A limited number
of lots with estimated costs of less than US$75,000 would normally be
advertised locally in accordance with MOPC's regulations which are satis-
factory. Parts for specific makes of equipment would be procured directly
from established dealers in accordance with MOPC's regulations for individual
orders of less than US$75,000 equivalent and within a ceiling of US$500,000
equivalent.
50.       Project expenditures eligible for disbursements under the Bank loan
would be defined as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for direct imports or 90% of local
expenditures for locally procured goods, for the purchase of
equipment, spare parts, accounting machines, weight control
scales and traffic counters;
(b) 54% of total expenditures for works on: (i) the Coronel
Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao Road; (ii) the Paraguari-
Encarnacion Road; and (iii) weight control stations;
(c) 73% of total expenditures for project administration
and construction supervision; and of total expenditures
for technical assistance to DGV and OCIPT.
Any funds remaining in the loan account on completion of the project may, with
the Bank's prior approval, be used for project-related items such as the purchase
of additional equipment or the extension of consulting services.

Economic Evaluation
51.       The paving of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road would
benefit road users through reduced vehicle operating costs, elimination of
road closures, and maintenance cost savings. Given that the freight and
passenger industries are highly competitive, the vehicle operating cost
savings arising out of the project are expected to be passed on as benefits to
the producers in the northeastern region, which has lagged behind the richer
south and southeast regions. Better and more reliable connections with the
country's capital and main economic centers would also yield important benefits
and open up new opportunities for the residents of the project area. The
economic rate of return for this part of the project is estimated at 16%,
which is satisfactory, particularly in view of the conservative basis used to
project future traffic growth, and the restrictive assumptions adopted to
evaluate benefits from elimination of road closures and generation of traffic.
52.       Quantifiable benefits from the proposed maintenance programs
include lower vehicle operating cost as well as savings and time savings of
road users through reduction of road closures. Additional benefits would be
time savings of road users through the prevention of further road closures and
protection of investment. The proposed road maintenance program is well
justified with a benefit cost ratio of about 2.9:1 in 1980 considering only
vehicle operating cost savings, passenger time savings and reduction of
closure benefits; including prevention of closure and protection of investment
benefits, the benefit cost ratio is about 6.6:1.
53.       The resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road would benefit road
users through vehicle operating-cost and maintenance savings. The economic
rate of return for resealing of this road is estimated at well in excess of
50%. The return is high because it represents conservation of an existing
fairly heavily travelled road.
54.       In addition to these benefits, the project is designed to enable
DGV to plan, fund and organize its future maintenance efforts systematically
in the face of dramatically expanded network requirements, to build up OCIPT
and MOPC's capacity to regulate and monitor sector development, and strengthen
the Government's capacity to prepare and evaluate projects and assess inter-
modal investment priorities.
Risks
55.       Neither the reconstruction nor maintenance elements present special
risks. The traffic forecasts on the Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao road are
sufficiently conservative that the future economic development required to
generate these growth rates is not serious question. Appropriate funding
of current expenditures has been thoroughly reviewed and would be the object
of specific commitments which are well within the financial capacity of the
Government. In view of the relatively good performance of Paraguay under
similar projects and the attention devoted during preparation to the question
of increased current expenditure requirements and funding mechanisms for spare
parts and equipment renewal, the risks have been reduced sufficiently to allow



- 16 -
reasonable expectation of success concerning the physical and operational objec-
tives of the project. A higher element of risk is attached to the institution
building objectives. Although specific convenants would ensure continuing
Government support for DGV (including the Project Unit) and OCIPT through the
project period, it should be recognized that the building up of DGV's manage-
ment and the strengthening of OCIPT's transport planning function are long-term
processes depending largely on availability of qualified professional staff
and the Government's capacity to pay adequate salaries, particularly after the
project has been completed. Although the project objectives concerning DGV
and OCIPT are realistic, a further measure of assistance may be necessary
beyond the time span of the present project.  Special attention would be
attached to these aspects of the project during supervision.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Paraguay and the
Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Bank's Articles of Agreement are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
57.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex III.
The adoption of a vehicle weight regulation enforcement program no later than
December 31, 1979 would be a condition of withdrawal for the scales and
weighing stations (Paragraph 43). In addition, creation of the Project Unit
and the recruitment of at least three engineers should be completed before
August 31, 1978 and would be a condition for disbursing for equipment and
parts.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 347-PA First Education Project, US$5.1 million, December 22, 1972;
(Date of Effectiveness: October 30, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979).
Project implementation is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
The three first phase schools are completed and in operation. The four
second phase schools have been delayed to facilitate the provision of local
funds and are expected to be completed about eight months later than originally
scheduled; however, the whole project will be completed by the original
closing date of December 31, 1979. Total project cost is estimated to exceed
the appraisal evaluation by about 12%, but no difficulties are foreseen by the
Government in providing the required counterpart funds.
Loan 1037-PA   Fourth Livestock Project, US$10.0 million, September 6, 1974;
(Date of Effectiveness: February 21, 1975; Closing Date:
February 28, 1979).
Although disbursements of the loan proceeds exceed appraisal fore-
casts, project-induced production and profits are likely to remain far below
appraisal estimates unless prevailing unfavorable price/cost conditions for
beef production, the quality of technical services to project beneficiaries
and the attitudes of farmers and ranchers towards more rational range and
herd management improve drastically. Subloan recovery rates under the three
former Bank/IDA-financed livestock projects and interest collections are un-
satisfactory, amounting to less than 80%. Fondo Ganadero, the project's exe-
cuting agency, is keen to correct the situation through more efficient debt
collection measures and the hiring of consultants to provide highly desirable
in-service training for its staff, and, if possible, the hiring of more
experienced personnel.
Credit 509-PA Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, US$11.0
million, September 6, 1974; (Date of Effectiveness: April 14,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979).
The project credit component is proceeding satisfactorily with
regard to medium- and long-term lending, but short-term lending is about 72%
and distribution of land titles about 42% behind appraisal estimates. Insti-
tution building efforts with the National Development Bank (BNF) are begin-
ning to yield positive results as the recently adopted debt recovery plan
has improved the portfolio arrears situation. Infrastructural works are
proceeding well. Construction of the second set of schools (nine) has begun,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
about 120 km of roads have been built, initial contracts for construction of
culverts and bridges and community centers (three) have been assigned and
plans are being prepared for construction of the remaining roads.
Loan 1059-PA   Fourth Highway Project, US$14.5 million, December 12, 1974;
(Date of Effectiveness: March 11, 1975; Closing Date; June 30,
1979).
Construction works on the two project roads are being carried
out by two joint ventures of Japan-Paraguay and Argentina-Paraguay firms.
Works on the two contracts are behind schedule, mainly because of insufficient
equipment and poor management, but corrective measures are being taken. Pro-
gress on one of the roads is about 52.5%, instead of the scheduled 100%, and on
the other road it is 33%, compared to 85% originally scheduled -- a combined
delay of about one year. The roads are expected to be completed in
February 1978 and March 1979, respectively. The consulting firm engaged
for assistance in highway maintenance has completed its work; the firm engaged
for assistance is at work; the report on maintenance needs has been completed
and reviewed by the Bank.
Credit 587-PA  Preinvestment Studies Project, US$4.0 million, October 17, 1975;
(Date of Effectiveness: April 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980).
The credit encountered start-up difficulties of processing
subproject and contractors' payment applications on a timely basis. Technical
assistance support is also behind schedule--the technical assistance team
envisaged during appraisal was engaged in March 1977. Government has agreed
to take appropriate measures to expedite the Preinvestment Fund operations.
Loan 1252-T-PA Vocational Training Project, US$4.0 million, May 13, 1976;
(Date of Effectiveness: August 26, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980).
The loan became effective on August 26, 1976. At this stage,
no difficulty is foreseen in completing the project by the closing date of
June 30, 1980. Total project cost is estimated to exceed the appraisal eval-
uation by about 3% and counterpart funds are available for 1977 calendar year.
Loan 1346/      Third Education Project, US$4.0 million Credit and US$8.0
Credit 667-PA million Loan, December 22, 1976; (Date of Effectiveness:
March 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981).
The Loan and Credit Agreements became effective on March 4,
1977. The project is expected to proceed without major problems.

(Date of Effectiveness: January 17, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981).
This loan became effective on January 17, 1978.
Loan 1419-PA   Industrial Credit Project, US$10.0 million, May 18, 1977;
(Date of Effectiveness: January 17, 1978; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982).
This loan became effective on January 17, 1978.
Loan 1502-PA   Rural Water Supply Project, US$6.0 million, December 16, 1977;
(Date of Effectiveness: February 16, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982).
This loan has not yet become effective.
