This report is based on information provided by the Government,
in particular, the Ministry of Public Works and Communications; by the
consultants Jorgensen (US)-Tecnipar (Paraguay) and SAE (Argentina) EIT-CONTEC
(Paraguay) and on the findings of two appraisal missions in February and May
1977 and a post appraisal mission in October 1977 consisting of Messrs. Raul
Paraud (Engineer), Robert Rafloski (Economist) and John Sargent (Economist).






I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geaeral
1.01      The Republic of Paraguay is landlocked in the middle of South
America; its most important transport link to the sea is provided by the
river system formed by the Paraguay River which flows north-south across the
country to join the Parana River at the border with Argentina (Map IBRD 12831).
About 80% of the country's population of 2.4 million and most of its economic
activity are located east of the Paraguay River in the "Triangulo" area,
roughly defined by its corners at Asuncion (the capital), Encarnacion, and
Puerto Presidente Stroessner. Since the country's economy is based mainly
on primary and processed agricultural products, transport improvements and
maintenance of the present system will be major factors in facilitating
further development. In order to develop Paraguay's agricultural potential,
the Government is pursuing a policy of intensive internal colonization; roads
have been provided to support these efforts and also to integrate scattered
centers of agricultural and industrial production into the national economy.
The transport sector has recently been receiving the largest share of public
investments (Table 1.1), and the basic transport system--essentially roads--now
exists. However, continued emphasis on extending and improving the road system
is needed. Road transport is the main mode used for domestic freight and
passengers. River transport, except for small amounts of bulk cargo, is not
significant, but it provides the most important link to the sea, carrying some
80% of external trade.
B.   The Transport System
(i) Highways
1.02      Paraguay's highway network, including the primitive track system
serving the Chaco, totals about 8,500 km, of which some 6,700 km are under the
jurisdiction of the Ministerio de Obras Publicas y Comunicaciones (MOPC)
(Chart 17310). Of the latter, some 87% are unpaved and susceptible to closure
because of rain for up to 100 days per year. Road development has been
concentrated on paving the more heavily trafficked roads and extending the
system (Table 1.2). The network as a whole provides acceptable transport to
most populated areas of the country.  However, due to the extent of the
unpaved system, adequate maintenance is critical, and improvements are re-
quired to meet growing traffic volumes and facilitate the development of new
agricultural areas.
1.03      Given the nature of transport demand with relatively short distances,
many scattered, low volume production centers and a few concentrated consump-
tion areas, road transport is, in general, the most economic mode. Domestic
trucking, which is growing rapidly, is highly competitive, loosely regulated
and handled by small local firms or individuals. Bus transport is also highly
competitive but more closely regulated; companies are generally run by individ-
ual owners or cooperatives. Available truck capacity appears underutilized,
whereas buses maintain a high occupancy rate. More than half the traffic on
the system consists of buses and trucks. Paved roads carry an annual average
daily traffic (ADT) of about 1,000, while gravel and earth roads carry only
about 100 vehicles per day (VPD). The highway subsector and its administration
are discussed in full in Chapter LI.



-2-
(ii) River Transport
1.04      The Paraguay and the Parana are the principal navigable rivers of
Paraguay and, with Argentina's Rio de la Plata, constitute a 1,600-km system
along which the bulk of Paraguay's foreign trade is carried; most of this
trade is transshipped in Buenos Aires or Montevideo. A dredging program main-
tains a navigable depth of 3 m. This has eliminated the costly lightering of
goods during low water periods. Also, aids to navigation have been installed,
and navigation at night is now possible.
(iii)  Ports
1.05      Ports handle about 80% of Paraguay's international traffic.  The
Port of Asuncion, improved with Bank financing (Loan 437-PA, US$2.8 million,
December 1965), is by far the largest of the country's ports. It serves the
most important productive areas and is the only port equipped with modern
berthing facilities and cargo-handling equipment. It clears about 25% of the
country's import volume 1/ and 50% of the export volume and river-borne
domestic trade. Port capacity at Asuncion is sufficient. Limited investments
are needed to renew obsolete equipment and facilities. In addition to Asuncion,
there are several minor ports which handle small volumes of local and inter-
national traffic. Paraguay's ports are satisfactorily managed by the semi-
autonomous National Administration of Navigation and Ports (ANNP).
(iv) State Merchant Fleet
1.06      The Flota Mercante del Estado (FLOMERES), a semi-autonomous Govern-
ment agency, has a small and aging merchant fleet of 22 operating ships with
a total carrying capacity of about 20,000 tons (capacity per vessel ranges
from 250 to 1,100 tons), and two passenger ships. FLOMERES' traffic averages
more than 150,000 tons annually, mostly on the Paraguay-Parana-Rio de la Plata
river system; this represents about 20% of the country's total import and
export volume.
(v) Railways
1.07      The state-owned Presidente Carlos Antonio Lopez (PCAL) railway is
run by a semi-autonomous Government agency under the responsibility of MOPC.
The railway crosses the "Triangulo" area from Asuncion to Encarnacion (376 km)
and is linked by ferry with the Argentine railway. The neglected condition of
the track and rolling stock has made railway service inefficient, unattrac-
tive and uneconomic. Traffic has been generally declining since 1950, with
passenger traffic dropping from over 2.0 million p.a. at that time to about
0.2 million in 1966, at which level it has remained fairly constant.  Total
freight in 1975 was only about 100,000 tons, a decline of 30% from 1974.
This decline was due to the closure of the Argentine market for Paraguayan
processed wood. In 1977, this market slowly began to open up again.
1/   Principal imports are crude oil, fuels and lubricants, which amounted to
250,000 tons in 1975, or about 60% of total port imports. All are
handled at the private pier for the Paraguayan refinery (REPSA), at
Villa Elisa, just south of Asuncion.



1.08      The continued operation of PCAL is a permanent tenet of Government
policy. The railway does not attract sufficient traffic to be financially
self-sustaining. In 1971, the Bank obtained a Government undertaking to limit
railway subsidies to revenues obtained from earmarked taxes on gambling and
social insu-ance. Under this agreement, the deficit of the railway has been
maintained at moderate levels, increasing from US$680,000 in 1971 to US$900,000
in 1976. Several studies, including OCIPT's Transport Plan, have suggested
limited track rehabilitation which would maintain the railway in operation at
lesser costs and would allow it to increase its freight traffic slightly. The
Government is currently exploring the possibility of obtaining a loan of abou
US$20 million from Argentina for the modernization of PCAL. If applied to the
limited rehabilitation recommended by previous transport studies, such a loan
should allow PCAL to improve its service and to continue to provide an alter-
native to river transport and trucking along the Paraguay-Argentina route. It
would be important, however, to maintain a strict limit on the scope of the
proposed improvements. The Bank, during negotiations, obtained an agreement
with the Government that, over the project period (1979-1982), it would (a)
not undertake investments in PCAL's permanent way and rolling stock without
prior review by OCIPT and (b) transmit the findings of the above review
to the Bank in case of investments of more than US$5 million in any given
year. Such review would include an assessment of the impact of the proposed
investments on public finances.
(vi) Air Transport
1.09      Paraguay has two scheduled airlines, both of which operate aged
aircraft. The largest, Transportes Aereos Militares (TAM), is state-owned
and provides scheduled domestic service. The other, Lineas Aereas Paraguayas
(LAP), which is also operated by the Paraguayan Air Force, provides inter-
national services to nearby Latin American countries. International passenger
traffic is growing rapidly and has more than tripled since 1964. Domestic air
traffic, while low in terms of absolute numbers, is important because it often
constitutes the only means of transport among various sections of the country,
especially during the wet season when many roads are closed.
1.10      Growth of domestic air transport is hampered by antiquated aircraft,
inadequate air fields and poor navigational aids. The need for aviation
infrastructure and for fleet and institutional development is readily apparent.
The Government, using funds from Credit 587-PA, is currently preparing a
project for the Bank's consideration which would include improvements to air
fields, provisions for navigational aids and institutional reforms. A new
air terminal at Asuncion (with capacity for 800,000 passengers p.a.) is under
construction (financed by the Central Banks of Paraguay and Argentina and the
Bank of America).
C.   Planning, Coordination and Financing
(i) Planning and Coordination
1.11      Modal agencies identify deficiencies within the submodes and prepare
a five-year financial program. Highway, shipping and rail plans are formu-
lated through MOPC while the Defense Ministry controls air transport investment.



-4-
The five-year investment plans are coordinated through the Secretariat Tecnica
de Planificacion (STP), which is responsible for overall economic planning.
This agency examines the economic viability of the investment plans on the
basis of expected economic and financial resources and of social, economic and
political goals. The draft plan is then submitted to the Consejo Nacional de
Coordinacion Economica (CNCE). After approval by this council, which is
composed of the President and the Ministers, the plan is submitted to Congress
for approval and becomes the planning guideline for the subsequent five years.
1.12      One of the major problems in the transport sector has been the lack
of overall sector policies and coordination of investment decisions. Decisions
have been made on a project-by-project basis without an understanding of an
individual project's impact on the transport sector or its implications for
the cost of transport. Since the share of transport sector investment will
remain large in relation to total public sector investment (Table 1.1), the
planning and coordination of these investments should be strengthened. The
Government took the initial step in addressing this problem by creating the
Office of Coordination and Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT) within MOPC
under the Bank's Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA) (Chart 17310 and
paragraph 3.08). The creation of OCIPT was the major recommendation of the
Transpor.t Survey which consultants BCEOM (France)/ENECOM (Brazil) completed in
1973, with UNDP financing and the Bank as executing agency.
1.13      The creation and development of OCIPT under Loan 1059-PA has been a
first step toward establishment of adequate capacity to advise the Government
on transport planning and coordination. The task of developing OCIPT is far
from complete, and further strengthening would be included under the proposed
project. Although the Government has not indicated any intention to curtail
OCIPT's development, the operating budget of OCIPT for 1977 was below require-
ments, and OCIPT's ability to continue data collection and to carry out its
planning function has been impaired. The Government confirmed, at the time of
negotiations, that it would continue to support the development of OCIPT
(para 7.03).
(ii) Financing
1.14      Government investment in transport infrastructure is budgeted by the
Ministries, mainly the Ministries of Public Works and Communications and of
Defense, for allocation to the modal agencies. MOPC is responsible for civil
works pertaining to civil aviation, although this mode is under the juris-
diction of the Ministry of Defense. Each Ministry submits its annual budget
to the Ministry of Finance every September, following the five-year planning
guidelines approved by the Congress and CNCE.
D.   Recommended Sector Improvements and Developments
1.15      OCIPT has been functioning since early 1976 and, with assistance
from consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC (Argentina/Paraguay), has prepared the feasi-
bility studies for road projects and a ten-year investment program for high-
ways, ports, river shipping and the railroad, as well as several road feasi-
bility studies. OCIPT has also prepared a series of recommendations concerning
revisions to road user charges, maximum axle loads and truck sizes and improve-
ments to truck and bus industry operations and organization. These studies



- 5 -
are competent, and the recommendations appear well thought out. The OCIPT
ten-year program recommends that the Government address the following priority
areas.
(i) Highway Infrastructure
1.16      Network improvements should include the area north of the Asuncion-
Puerto Presidente Stroessner road; the feeder road system should be expanded
to link agricultural production areas to the Paraguay River; an earth surface
link should be provided from Capitan Meza to Puerto Presidente Stroessner and
aging paved roads should be resealed and strengthened as necessary. These
proposed investments would require about 1.5% of projected gross domestic
product (GDP) over the ten-year period 1977-1986. This is less than the 1.7%
of GDP used for road investments over the ten years to 1976.
(ii) State Merchant Fleet
1.17      One of the more important studies carried out by OCIPT dealt with
the improvement of the river fleet operation. Most of the traffic handled by
the present fleet is carried by self-propelled ships, an expensive method in
shallow river waters. OCIPT has recommended that a push-tow fleet, either
private or state-owned, be put into operation. This would gradually replace
the existing fleet over a ten-year period.
(iii) Railways
1.18      Within the framework of the Government policy to maintain railway
operations, OCIPT has devised a plan (total investment cost about US$21.5
million) for rehabilitation of PCAL track and purchase of locomotives and
rolling stock. The plan would include improvements in the quality of service
and would allow the railroad to be cost competitive with truck transport and
attract a reasonable level of cargo.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   The Highway Network
2.01      The inventory carried out in 1976 by consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar
shows that the network under maintenance was about 6,689 km, of which only
883 km, or 13%, were paved (Table 1.2).  An additional 1,830 km, serving the
Chaco Region, are maintained by the Army. The network as a whole grew between
1970 and 1976 at an average annual rate of 3.4%, and, between 1976 and 1982,
the projected annual average rate of growth is about 4%.
2.02      Road development really commenced in the 1950s, when the total
network was only about 850 km; by 1960, the network was about 2,165 km, of
which about 9% was paved. Efforts were concentrated on connecting the eco-
nomic and population centers and on paving the most heavily trafficked roads.
Most connections are still only to earthwork standards with no drainage
structures or pavement and have to be closed after rain to avoid major dete-
rioration and subsequent repair. The average closure time per year is up to
100 days, hampering communications and economic development of vast areas of
the country.



- 6 -
2.03      The area best served by roads is the southeastern part of the
country, east of the Paraguay River (Map IBRD 12832R), where the economic
activity is now concentrated. The two principal inter-urban routes, Asuncion
to Puerto Stroessner (about 376 km) and Asuncion to Encarnacion (about 370 km),
are paved all-weather roads. The rest of the paved roads are mainly within
and around Asuncion.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic and Regulations
2.04      Existing historical traffic survey data show large disparities, owing
mainly to the variety of their sources. The more consistent data are from the
UNDP-financed transport study (1973), MOPC's annual traffic counts (1973-1975)
and recent preinvestment studies. The proposed project would support the
development of a systematic traffic counting system (para 7.06). The recent
traffic survey taken in 1976 indicates that the ADT on the system is about
184 vehicles (Table 2.1). Paved roads carry an average of 1,020 VPD while
secondary earth, the least trafficked roads, carry about 11 VPD.
2.05      The composition of traffic and vehicle kilometrage by vehicle type
are fairly evenly distributed on the several types of roads, with light
vehicles accounting for about 45% of the traffic and buses and trucks about
55%. There are no reliable data on traffic growth over the network as a
whole but, when individual roads have been analyzed and traffic statistics
are available over a period of time, traffic appears to have been growing at
an average of about 7.7% p.a., ranging from 5% p.a. to 10% p.a. These rates
are consistent with fuel consumption statistics, which show annual growth
rates of about 6.5%, with diesel fuel, used mainly by trucks and buses,
averaging about 9% p.a. growth (Table 2.2).
2.06      Vehicle fleet statistics are not collected on a regular basis, and
no census of the operating fleet has ever been taken; all census counts to
date have been made by tallying vehicle registrations. This system is not
satisfactory since vehicles can enter the country on a temporary license and
remain indefinitely without being registered officially. Also, the system
does not account for vehicles removed from service. While the actual number
of vehicles may be questionable, the statistics indicate the broad picture,
with registrations growing at about 12% p.a. (Table 2.3). Bus transport has
shown the highest rate of growth, with registrations growing from some 2,000
buses in 1969 to about 6,500 in 1975.
2.07      Road transport is regulated by the General Transport Directorate (DGT),
which is under the responsibility of MOPC. DGT approves route licenses annually,
regulates fares for medium and long-distance service for passenger transport
and maintains operational standards for inter-urban buses. Only companies
ranging in size from 2 to 45 buses are permitted to carry passengers for hire.
The law only requires licensing of international truck transport. Domestic
freight transport is practically unregulated.
2.08      Overloading of vehicles remains a serious problem in Paraguay,
especially around the area where the Itaipu dam is being built.  Trucks from
neighboring countries carry heavy loads for the construction works, damaging
the local network. Consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC carried out a study of the
overloading problem, which showed that the legal axle load limit of 10 tons



- 7 -
is exceeded, on average, by 40% by three axle single trucks and by a much
higher percentage by the tractor and semi-tractor combinations. An economic
analysis prepared by the same consultants shows that an increase of the legal
axle load from 10 to 11 tons would be advisable and that, more important,
stricter enforcement of the weight regulations is imperative. MOPC officials
feel that an increase in the legal limit would lead to further overloading.
They agree that the most pressing problem is to develop a more effective
control system. The three existing weighing stations are insufficient, and
their operation relies too much on the objectivity of the weighing station
attendants. The present project will provide for more effective enforcement
of axle weight regulations (para 7.01).
C.   Highway Administration
2.09      For administrative purposes, the highway network is classified into
national or primary highways, departmental or secondary highways and local
or feeder roads. The Direccion General de Vialidad (DGV), which is one of
the General Directorates of MOPC (Chart 17311), has overall responsibility
for planning, constructing and maintaining all national and departmental roads
in the country (about 80% of the total network). MOPC's Directorate of Local
Highway Boards (Juntas Viales) ensures central coordination of construction
and maintenance of local roads. Construction and maintenance of some of the
feeder and development roads are entrusted to the other Directorates within
MOPC. In addition, construction and maintenance of agricultural feeder roads
are carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Army has constructed,
and maintains, about 1,800 km of roads in the Chaco area. The only road
located in that region which is not under military jurisdiction is the
Transchaco Road, of which about 300 km are being built by MOPC with financing
provided by IDB.
2.10      DGV was created in 1947 as a traffic regulatory body, but, in the
late 1960's, it was reorganized to assume full responsibility for preparing
and carrying out highway programs and highway administration. Separate
departments were created for engineering, maintenance, equipment and adminis-
tration. The Director exerts strong authority over all the branches of the
organization. DGV has a staff of about 30 engineers, six of whom are in the
Asuncion Central office. Because of the high demand for, and attractive
salaries offered to, qualified professionals between 1974 and 1976 by the
Itaipu (Brazil-financed) and planned Yacireta-Apipe (Argentine-financed)
hydroelectric works over the Parana River, many experienced engineers left
Vialidad's service; this has created a serious understaffing problem.
2.11      In an attempt to correct the situation, DGV engaged about seven
young engineers in 1976 and granted salary increases up to 25%. This increase,
coupled with incentives such as housing facilities for field personnel, the
use of a Government vehicle and retirement plans, has reduced the exodus of
Vialidad personnel. However, it remains difficult to attract experienced
engineers. The present project would include the establishment of a Project
Unit (para 4.14), which would be in a position to offer competitive salaries
to attract experienced engineers and managers necessary to launch the project.
This temporary solution would provide the time necessary to study a permanent
solution based on an assessment of long-term compensation trends (para 4.15).

D.   Highway Planning
2.12      Until 1975, highway planning was the responsibility of MOPC's Planning
Unit on the basis of very limited data. The Unit never developed sufficient
capacity for the task. Under the Fourth Highway Project, the Government cen-
tralized all highway planning efforts under OCIPT. Since 1976, OCIPT has begun
systematic collection of data relevant to proper transport planning and has
undertaken a series of transport studies, including detailed feasibility
studies for about 400 km of roads. OCIPT also examined about 3,400 km of
roads for inclusion in the ten-year investment program, 1977-1986.
2.13      Highway investments have increased substantially from an average of
US$2.8 million over the period 1970-1975 to some US$23.0 million in 1976
(Table 2.4).  The rapid jump in 1976 is due to expenditures for the Transchaco
route (US$9.0 million), the bridge over the Paraguay River at Villa Hayes
(US$6.0 million) and the two Bank-financed roads, Mbocayaty-Colonia Indepen-
dencia and Encarnacion-Pirapo (US$8.0 million). Construction expenditures
for projects under way through 1978 would average US$29.0 million per year.
OCIPT's plans for investment in highway construction commence in 1979, when
it is expected that the works committed thus far would be completed. The plan
wouLd require an investment in highway construction of about US$33.0 million
(1976 prices) per year through 1986. The plan considers that projected
revenues from road user charges would be adequate to sustain this level of
highway expenditures. Increased importance would have to be given to the
financial programming of current and capital outlays for highways.
2.14      Consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar have recently completed inventories
of the network under maintenance (Table 6.1), but an inventory of the overall
road network has not been carried out. Since such an inventory is essential
for planning purposes, it would be carried out under the project not later
than the end of 1980. The Bank obtained assurances at the time of negotiations
that such inventory would thereafter be updated at least every five years.
E.   Highway Financing
2.15      Highway financing procedures are outlined in paragraph 1.14.  Over
the period 1970-1975, about 40% of total highway construction, averaging about
US$1.1 million per year, was financed by external borrowing. The remaining
funds came from the general budget, with revenues from highway tolls being
earmarked for the Transchaco road and a portion of revenues from taxes on
fuels and the surcharge on imports earmarked for maintenance. Revenues from
road user charges have been growing at about 13.5% p.a. since 1972 (Table 2.4).
The import surcharge constituted 57% of total road user taxes (US$19 million)
in 1975.  Overall road user revenues for the ten-year period have been more
than double (US$11.7 million equivalent p.a.) all highway construction and
maintenance expenditures. It is estimated that, over the next five years,
proceeds from road user charges would be adequate to support increased highway
expenditures, especially for maintenance.
F.   Highway Engineering
2.16      In 1954, DGV adopted a set of design standards that has not since
been updated. Consequently, when major construction is to be carried out,
the consultants preparing the designs are requested to develop standards to



9-
fit the circumstances of the specific project. The standards for the proposed
project (Table 5.1) have been approved by the Government and are acceptable.
However, for an orderly development of the highway network in the future, a
uniform set of design standards and construction specifications for the various
categories of roads and topographic conditions is required and would be devel-
oped under the project. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances
from the Government that, no later than December 1979, DGV would adopt a set
of design standards and construction specifications after consultation with
the Bank.
2.17      DGV prepares designs for minor improvement of feeder roads, but
major designs are normally carried out by consultants. The last five years
have witnessed a rapid development of the local consulting industry. This is
an outcome of Government policy (embodied in a Decree issued in 1972) foster-
ing the participation of local consultants in Government-financed studies,
particularly the major studies undertaken for the large hydroelectric works.
The recently created "Chamber of Paraguayan Consultants" has already registered
19 local consulting firms, four of which, normally associated with foreign
firms, are able to carry out highway design works. DGV usually employs con-
sultants for supervision of large and medium construction projects. Government-
financed minor construction works, either by contract or force account, are
generally supervised by DGV staff.
G.  Highway Construction
2.18      Because of the infant status of the road construction industry,
major construction works have been carried out by foreign contractors with
participation of local firms, mostly as subcontractors. The local construction
industry has developed recently on a modest scale and principally as a result
of the hydroelectric works. At present, there are four local construction
firms capable of carrying out small-scale road works and about 40 small firms
which specialize in drainage structures, minor earthworks and supply of mater-
ials. The local industry needs technical assistance for its further develop-
ment; the Bank, under Loan 1059-PA, provided US$100,000 for engaging consul-
tants to prepare an analysis of the shortcomings of the industry and to assist
in work planning, equipment usage, costing and bid preparation. DGV recently
retained consultants INCONAS (Argentina) for the task on the basis of terms of
reference agreed with the Paraguayan Chamber of Construction Industry.
H.  Highway Maintenance
2.19      Highway maintenance is performed through four district offices which
are subdivided into sections according to maintenance needs (Chart 17311 and
Map IBRD 12831). Routine maintenance works in these districts are carried
out by force account, while minor improvement works and supply of materials
are carried out by contract. Maintenance in the fifth district (the Chaco)
is carried out by the army. DGV is expected to take over the maintenance of
the Transchaco Road when it is completed (by late 1978). In addition to
these countrywide activities, the Juntas Viales and some agricultural colonies
maintain local roads with equipment and financing provided by DGV.
2.20      The Government, with assistance from the Bank, has achieved substan-
tial progress in highway maintenance over the last 15 years. The equipment
provided in 1961 under the First Highway Project (Credit 12-PA, 1961 and



- 10 -
Loan 396-PA, 1964) improved maintenance operations. The quantity of equipment
and the organizational capacity of DGV proved insufficient to cope with the
growing maintenance needs. Support for further improvements was provided
under the Second Road Maintenance Project (Loan 652-PA, para 3.06).
2.21      The growing traffic demand caused by the development of the economy,
further exacerbated by the construction of the two large hydroelectric projects,
has heightened concern in the trucking industry and Government circles about
the need for good maintenance of the road network. The Government's awareness
of the situation is reflected in the yearly maintenance allocations, which in-
creased from a 197 million in 1970 (US$1.5 million equivalent) to a 419 million
in 1976 (US$3.32 million equivalent) (Table 2.4).
2.22      The soil composition and the frequent heavy rains in Paraguay make
it difficult to maintain the country's roads, which generally have poor
drainage and deficient surfacing. With the exception of a few gravel-surfaced
roads, the majority of the dirt road network (about 87%) is built on low
quality soils. The damage caused by the traffic on these roads, if closure
during wet weather were not enforced, would make them impassable and would
require expensive rehabilitation works. As a result of the closure policy
and prompt action of the maintenance crews, the affected roads are open to
traffic for about 70% of the year. However, road closures have a negative
impact on the country's economy, and the Government's long-term target should
be to eliminate closures, as justified by traffic. A growing effort is
required for adequate maintenance of the network and for keeping roads open to
traffic; such an effort has to be coupled with programmed renewal of equipment
and increasing budgetary allocations. Such an effort is the main objective of
the proposed project.
III. PAST AND ONGOING BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A.   Overview
3.01      Over the past 25 years, the Bank has been continuously Involved
with highway development in Paraguay (Table 3.1).  Since 19619 four hlghway
projects (total lending about US$31 million) resulted in (a) upgrading of
more than 600 km of primary roads, that is, more than 65% of the network
presently paved, and (b) building up the maintenance capacity. Three agri-
cultural projects have provided US$17.5 million for improvement and maInte-
nance of more than 1,200 km of feeder roads.
B.   Projects Completed
3.02      The Bank made its first loan with a highway component to Paraguay in
December 1951 (Loan 55-PA, US$5 million). This was basically an agricultural
project, but US$1 million of the loan amount was provided for equipineat to
build feeder roads. The equipment was well utilized, and the project was
completed satisfactorily.
3.03      Prior to the First Highway Construction and Maintenance Project
(Credit 12-PA, US$6 million, October 1961), coordination and control of
maintenance operations were largely ineffective. The 2,500-km road network



- 11 -
did not, in fact, receive systematic and organized maintenance. Workshops
and repair facilities needed urgent improvement. The First Highway Project
included: (a) reconstruction and paving of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road
(302 kni); (b) construction of a major bridge; (c) purchase of maintenance
equipment; and (d) preparation of a master plan for maintenance. However,
redesigning of the road and bridge--to protect them from severe floods such
as those which occurred during the final design stage in 1963--resulted
in undue delays and higher costs. Supplementary financing proved necessary,
and the Bank provided the needed support through Loan 396-PA of US$2.2 million
in December 1964. Execution was further hampered by poor contractor performance
and by flooding in 1965 and 1966. The project was completed in 1970; its total
costs came to almost 25% above the initial estimates.
3.04      The equipment provided under the first project did help to improve
maintenance operations. However, the quantity of equipment on hand was
clearly insufficient to cope with the growing needs.  In spite of insufficient
funds and personnel, DGV developed its maintenance capacity and was able, in
1968, to maintain about 3,900 km of roads out of a total network of about
5,000 km. There was, therefore, a sense of urgency to undertake further
improvement of maintenance operations. The consultant firm Brown and Root (US)
was retained under the first project for the preparation of a maintenance
master plan, and it produced a first report in 1967. This report was updated
in 1969 and provided the basis for developing a four-year maintenance program
(1970-1973) for the continued expansion and improvement of maintenance opera-
tions. The program included the reorganization of the Highway Department as
well as related consulting services, equipment, personnel, shops, and funds.
It defLned coherent standards of maintenance for the different types of roads,
taking traffic volumes and climatic conditions into account. The consultants'
master plan became an effective basis for the preparation and appraisal of the
subsequent Second Road Maintenance Project.
3.05      While implementation of the First Highway Project progressed with
difficulties over the period 1961-1970, the Second Road Project (construction)
(Loan 443-PA, US$2.1 million, April 1966) was prepared and appraised. It pro-
vided Eor: (a) the reconstruction and paving of a 43-km road section
(Coronel Oviedo-Villarica); and (b) feasibility studies for 450 km of roads
in the "Plan Triangulo" area, identified under a UNDP study, and detailed
engineering for about 260 km of those roads with the highest priority. After
considerable delay, the Government selected consultants Louis Berger (US)
in association with SAE (Argentina) to carry out these studies, which got under
way in January 1969 and were completed in 1973; they were the basis for the
preparation of the Fourth Highway Project (para 3.08). The road construction
work was satisfactorily completed in October 1969. Mainly because of the
effects of the 1965/1966 floods and partly because of inadequate design,
additional work was required, which increased total project costs by almost
25% above original estimates. This project was the subject of an Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) Audit Report (No. 558, dated October 30, 1974),
which concluded that it had been completed satisfactorily.
3.06      The Second Road Maintenance Project (Loan 652-PA, US$6.0 million,
January 1970) helped to finance a four-year (1971-1974) highway maintenance
program, which was carried out with the assistance of consultants Jorgensen-
Tecnipar. The project was instrumental in improving maintenance operations



- 12 -
substantially. Some US$5.5 million worth of maintenance equipment was pur-
chased. A central workshop and 13 district workshops were built, and a train-
ing program for engineers, technicians, mechanics and operators was instituted.
As noted in paragraph 2.21, maintenance allocations were increased throughout
the project execution period in compliance with loan covenants. Although some
delays occurred during execution, the project, which was successfully com-
pleted in 1975, created among the Paraguayan authorities, and within the
transport industry in general, a feeling of the importance, and the economic
impact, of good maintenance of the road network. The Project Completion
Report (PCR), detailing the above conclusions, was issued on December 9, 1976.
The OED Audit Report is under preparation.
C.   Projects Under Way
3.07      In 1974, IDA approved Credit 509-PA (US$11.0 million), the Small
Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, to support a lending program to
small farmers in three colonies located in the eastern region of Paraguay.
The credit includes an important road component totalling about one-fourth
of the total project cost of US$15.8 million and involves the construction
of about 250 km of earth roads, including bridges, and 36 km of all-weather
roads. A Second Rural Development Project (Loan 1418-PA, US$22.0 million)
was approved in May 1977. The road component, amounting to US$9.1 million,
includes the construction and maintenance of 99 km of all-weather roads and
238 km of feeder roads. The project will be initiated early in 1978.
3.08      The Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA, US$14.5 million) was
signed on December 12, 1974 and became effective on March 11, 1975; total
project cost is US$20.0 million, of which the Bank is financing the estimated
foreign exchange component. The project has three main components--the
construction and reconstruction of two main roads totalling 102 km, technical
assistance for transport planning and highway maintenance and assistance to
the local construction industry.
(i) Road Construction
3.09      Construction contracts for the two project roads (Mbocayaty-Colonia
Independencia, 26 km and Encarnacion-Hohenau-Pirapo, 76 km) were awarded
through international competitive bidding respectively to Decavial (Argentina)-
Wasmosy (Paraguay) and to Obayashi-Gumi (Japan)-Compania de Construcciones
Civiles (Paraguay). Works on both roads are behind schedule, but corrective
measures have been taken to improve performance by contractors. Completion is
expected by early 1979, which would not be more than six months behind the
appraisal schedule.
(ii) Technical Assistance for Transport Planning
3.10      The project provided US$400,000 for technical assistance and logistic
support to OCIPT. Consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC were engaged in January 1976 for
a period of 12 months to assist OCIPT in carrying out the program of transport
planning and project preparation mentioned in paragraphs 1.15 to 1.18 and 2.12.
OCIPT successfully completed its first-year work program; its findings and
recommendations, presented in a report dated May 1977, are now being reviewed
by various Government departments and agencies. Further support for OCIPT is
proposed under the present project.



- 13 -
(i:Li) Technical Assistance for Highway Maintenance
3.11      The project includes an extension of the highway maintenance program
initiated under Loan 652-PA with the assistance of consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar.
The extension included two components: (a) the strengthening of the highway
maintenance organization for a period of about two years, during which period
the organization was supposed to be staffed and able to carry out all mainte-
nance operations; and (b) the study of future maintenance needs. Regarding
the fLrst component, Loan Agreement No. 1059-PA included two covenants
(Sections 4.05 and 4.06) setting forth the Borrower's obligation to (a) employ
promptly as needed and to retain such qualified staff as required to strengthen
the maintenance organization and (b) to assume all highway maintenance oper-
ations within two years from the effective date of the loan (March 1975). The
latter covenant has been partially implemented, but the problem of the loss of
staff to the hydroelectric projects has impaired DGV's capacity to retain
experLenced technical staff (para 2.10). The study of future maintenance
needs was completed by consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar in April 1977 and served
as a basis for the maintenance component of the proposed Fifth Highway Project.
D.   Summary Assessment
3.12      The development of adequate maintenance capacity has been the over-
riding concern of the Bank. Although much remains to be done, the series
of highway projects has, over the years, transformed a modest and uncoordinated
maintenance department into a dynamic countrywide organization which should,
in the future, be able to cope with growing traffic demands within the limita-
tion of a road network having less than 10% of its roads paved. The previous
projects have established an adequate organizational structure and logistic
support (workshops, communications, etc.). Highway maintenance is recognized
by the Government as a matter requiring continuing attention and budgetary
support. One of the objectives of the present project would be to upgrade
staff and manpower further and to improve equipment management.
IV. THE PROPOSED FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
A.   Project Oblectives and General Description
4.01      The proposed project would assist the Government in:  (a) streng-
thening and expanding the capacity of MOPC to ensure an adequate level of
maintenance of the national highway network; (b) upgrading a high-priority
road; and (c) continuing the strengthening of transport planning and coordi-
nation.
4.02      The maintenance component of the Second (Loan 652-PA) and Fourth
(Loan 1059-PA) Highway Projects contributed to the buildup of MOPC maintenance
capacity through the establishment of field organizations, the acquisition of
equipment and the provision of adequate funding for maintenance operations.
The proposed project largely reflects experience gained under the previous
projects; points of emphasis will be systematic equipment renewal, regular
supply of spare parts, training, strengthening of headquarters' staff and
more stringent enforcement of vehicle weight regulations.



- 14 -
4.03      Specifically, the project consists of the following:
(i) Upgrading, including paving, of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-
San Estanislao Road (about 98 km)
- civil works and supervision of construction.
(ii) Four-Year Maintenance Program (1979-1982)
-  resealing and partial strengthening of the Paraguari-
Encarnacion road (302 km);
-  acquisition of new maintenance equipment to meet the
maintenance requirements of an expanding network for
1979-1982 and replacement of units being retired from
service;
-  a program for betterment of about 5,200 km of roads;
-  acquisition of workshop equipment for improvement of
maintenance workshops;
-  overhaul and intensive maintenance of about 260 equipment
units;
-  acquisition and use of mini-computers and other equipment
necessary to achieve the mechanization of accounting
operations within DGV;
-  strengthening of MOP headquarters' staff through the
establishment of a Project Unit for planning, programming
and supervising implementation of annual maintenance
programs; and
- training for engineers, technicians and operators.
(iii) Transport Sector Management
-  preparation and implementation of measures to improve and
reinforce control of axle weights, including improvement of
existing weighing stations and construction of new ones;
-  preparation of a highway inventory and development of
design standards and construction specifications; and
-  strengthening of OCIPT and provision of related equipment
(traffic counters and miscellaneous vehicles).
Implementation of the project is expected to take about four years (1979-1982).
A detailed description, economic evaluation and specific covenants concerning
each of the project components are provided in subsequent chapters.

B.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$48.1 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$38 million (80%) and a local component
of US$10.1 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$33.0 million amounts to 69%
of the total cost; it would finance the foreign exchange component of project
elements except civil works, to which the Bank would contribute 54% against
an average civil works foreign exchange content of 73%. The Government has
confirmed that it would finance the local cost of US$10.1 million. The
Government expects to obtain financing from a private bank to finance the
US$5.0 million balance of the foreign exchange component. Such financing
would be applied to civil works and would result in 73% of it being financed
externally. Should the private bank loan not be made, the Government has
undertaken to finance this US$5.0 million of foreign exchange requirement.
UNDP has indicated that it would not have funds to finance any of the techni-
cal assistance components of the project.
4.05      A summary of the project cost, based on a Government contribution of
US$5.0 million to foreign exchange costs, is given on the following page. The
estimated costs of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao and Paraguari-
Encarnacion roads were prepared by consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC on the basis of
quantities derived from detailed engineering and current unit prices for
similar works. Cost estimates for consulting services are based on recent
contracts or man-month rates for similar services provided by joint ventures
of Paraguayan and foreign firms. The costs for the road maintenance equipment,
including spare parts, have been estimated on the basis of detailed lists
prepared by consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar. These costs include local prep-
aration and delivery charges, but exclude import taxes, as was the case under
previous and ongoing projects. The Government confirmed, at negotiations,
that equipment would be exempt from import duties. The costs of the accounting
equipment, weight control scales and traffic counters are based on quotations
from suppliers, also excluding taxes.
4.06      The foreign exchange component of the civil works has been estimated
on the following basis: (a) 50% for small civil works contracts for installa-
tion of weighing stations, which would attract only local building contractors;
(b) 732 for major contracts to be awarded for works on the Coronel Oviedo-
Tacuara-San Estanislao road; and (c) 80% for contracts to be awarded for works
on the Paraguari-Encarnacion road. The higher foreign component is due to the
need for increased amounts of bituminous materials for the resealing and surface
strengthening works. Contracts for these works would normally be awarded to
foreign firms with some participation of local contractors, either in joint
ventures or as subcontractors, as was the case under previous Bank projects.
The foreign exchange component of consultant services has been estimated at 70%
for supervision of construction while, for the technical assistance to DGV and
OCIPT, it has been estimated at 80% because a larger foreign participation may
be expected. The cost per man-month is estimated to range from US$2,000 to
US$5,000 equivalent for technicians of different grades among Paraguayans
and foreigners, with an average of US$3,000 per man-month. The various con-
sulting services would require a total of about 590 man-months. The foreign
exchange component for the purchase of road maintenance and other equipment
has been estimated at 95% of total costs.

- 17 -
4.07      A contingency allowance of 10% has been included to cover increases
in construction quantities. About 17% of the project base cost has been
allowed for foreign price variations and 23% for local prices over the imple-
mentation period for equipment, civil works and consultants, assuming inflation
rates as shown at the bottom of the cost table. They reflect guidelines in
effect throughout 1977 and are relevant to Paraguay.
4.08      In the event that private bank financing of US$5.0 million is
obtained, the Bank would require that the Borrower provide satisfactory evidence
that the private bank funds have been used to finance project expenditures
eligible for external financing (para 4.09). The Bank would require that this
be a condition of withdrawal of Bank funds. Additionally, subject to avail-
ability of private bank participation, the Borrower would be required to
furnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports certifying that the funds
disbursed by the private bank have been used to finance eligible project
expenditures and would indicate the specific items so financed and amounts
disbursed for each by categories specified in the Loan Agreement with the
Bank. These arrangements were discussed and confirmed during negotiations.
4.09      Project expenditures eligible for disbursement of the Bank loan are
defined as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for direct imports or 90% of
local expenditures for locally procured goods, for the purchase
of equipment, spare parts, signalization materials, accounting
machines, weight control scales and traffic counters;
(b) 54% of total expenditures for works on the Coronel Oviedo-
Tacuara-San Estanislao road; the Paraguari-Encarnacion road;
and weight control stations; and
(c) 73% of total expenditures for project administration 1/,
construction supervision, and technical assistance to DGV and
OCIPT and training of maintenance personnel.
Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against normal documentation.
Any funds remaining in the loan account on completion of the project might,
with the Bank's prior approval, be used for project-related items such as the
purchase of additional equipment or the extension of consulting services.
C.   Execution and Procurement
4.10      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of MOPC through
four of its Directorates:
1/   For setting up and operating the Project Unit, the proposed Bank loan
would be disbursed against salaries of foreign and local staff. The
amount disbursed against local costs for the Project Unit would be
compensated by the fact that the proposed Bank participation in financing
of civil works is less than the estimated foreign exchange component.



- 18 -
(a) DGV for (1) major civil contracts; (2) the highway maintenance
and betterment programs; and (3) related technical assistance;
(b) OCIPT for the transport planning component;
(c) the Directorate for Transport for implementing the traffic
counts in conjunction with the DGV maintenance districts;
and
(d) the Directorate for Execution and Budgetary Control for
implementing the enforcement of regulations on weight and
dimensions of vehicles.
4.11      Procurement under the project would be in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement" (March 1977). The procurement program for new
equipment and parts indicating lot sizes, estimated costs and proposed excep-
tions to international competitive bidding (ICB) would be subject to prior
approval of the Bank. Lots excepted from ICB with estimated costs of less
than US$75,000 would be advertised locally in accordance with MOPC's regula-
tions, which are satisfactory. These lots, with an estimated total value of
less than US$300,000 equivalent, would account for only a few items in the
total procurement program. Parts for specific makes of existing equipment
would be procured directly from established dealers in accordance with
MOPC's regulations for individual orders of less than US$75,000 up to an
aggregate amount of US$500,000. Construction of weighing stations would be
advertised locally.
4.12      Civil works for upgrading of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao
road and resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road would be carried out on
the basis of unit price contracts awarded in accordance with ICB. For bidding
purposes, the Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao road has been subdivided into two
lots (Coronel Oviedo to Km 49 and Km 49 to San Estanislao). The Paraguari-
Encarnacion road works would be tendered as one lot. Prequalified firms would
be allowed to bid for any one lot or more. DGV considered division into
smaller lots, but found that, while this would not increase local participa-
tion, it might lead to implementation problems since local civil contractors
are mobilized on hydroelectric works and they have limited experience and
ciapacity for bituminous pavement works. Bidding and contracting procedures
w,ere reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
4.13      Terms and conditions for consulting services for supervision of con-
struction and technical assistance to DGV and OCIPT were reviewed and agreed
with the Government during negotiations. The consultants selected for these
assignments should be acceptable to the Bank.
4.14      Because of the shortage of qualified personnel (para. 2.11) and the
additional workload resulting from the implementation of the proposed project,
a Project Unit would be established within DGV to assist in carrying out the
maintenance and construction components of the project. During its initial
stage, the Unit would include three internationally recruited engineers, for
periods of about 12 months, to train local personnel and establish working
procedures. The Unit would also comprise six local engineers and technicians
for the overall project period (48 months): five of them for carrying out the
maintenance component and one for the construction component (Chart 17536).



- 19 -
The salaries of the internationally recruited and local staff would be financed
under the loan (para 4.09, footnote). Since the salaries to be paid would be
competitive with those paid in the hydroelectric works, DGV expects to attract
well qualified individuals. The composition, functions and operation of the
Project Unit, as well as its terms of reference including its staffing plan,
were discussed and agreed during negotiations (Annex 1). Its creation and the
recruitment of at least one internationally recruited engineer and two local
engineers not later than August 31, 1978 would be a condition for disbursing
for equipment and parts. The Project Unit would be fully staffed no later
than March 31, 1979.
4.15      It is expected that, at the end of the project period, DGV would
be able to retain the Paraguayan members of the Project Unit and to integrate
them into its expanded organizational structure. However, it is difficult at
this stage to foresee what the capacity of DGV would be in this respect. The
Government confirmed at negotiations that it would, before the end of the thir.'
year of the program (i.e., 1981), consult with the Bank with a view toward
agreeing on measures to ensure adequate staffing of DGV concerning, in partic-
ular, the functions carried out by the Project Unit.
4.16      The implementation period of the project would be four years.  The
upgrading of the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road would take three
years (1979-1981). The Paraguari-Encarnacion resealing program would take two
years (1979-1980). The maintenance program covers the four years 1979 to 1982.
The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 4.1. The project
implementation schedule is shown in Table 4.2; it was discussed and agreed
during negotiations.
D.   Risks
4.17      Neither the reconstruction nor maintenance elements present special
risks. All road sections have been engineered. The traffic forecasts for the
Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao and the Paraguari-Encarnacion roads are suffi-
ciently conservative that the future economic development required to generate
these growth rates is not in serious question. Appropriate funding of current
expenditures has been thoroughly reviewed and would be the object of specific
commitments which are well within the financial capacity of the Government.
In view of the relatively good performance of Paraguay under similar projects
and the attention devoted during preparation to the question of increased
current expenditure requirements and funding for spare parts and equipment
renewal, the risks have been reduced sufficiently to allow a reasonable
expectation of success concerning the physical and operational objectives of
the project.
4.18      A higher element of risk is attached to the institution-building
objectives. Although specific covenants would ensure continuing Government
support for DGV and OCIPT through the project period, one should recognize
that the building up of DGV's management and the strengthening of )CIPT's
transport planning function are long-term processes depending largely on the
availability of qualified professional staff. Although the project objectives
concerning DGV and OCIPT are realistic, a further measure of assistance may be
necessary beyond the time span of the present project. Special attention
would be attached to these aspects of the project during supervision.

V. UPGRADING OF THE CORONEL OVIEDO-SAN ESTANISLAO ROAD
A.   Description
5.01      The Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara road (about 91 km) is the backbone of
the transportation system of the northeastern part of Paraguay, acting as
collector of the traffic with origin and destination in Asuncion and Puerto
Presidente Stroessner, the two main economic and administrative centers of
the country (Map IBRD 12831). The 7-km spur from Tacuara to San Estanislao
links the main roads with the township of San Estanislao, an important regional
center. Its improvement to paved standards will enhance the economic develop-
ment of the potentially rich area.
5.02      The Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara-San Estanislao road is an earth-surfaced
road which was initially built by the Army and progressively improved by DGV.
The horizontal and vertical alignments are acceptable and would require minor
realignments to correct a few sharp curves and steep grades. Platform width
is generally acceptable, and few widenings are required. Drainage is prac-
tically nonexistent. The present road, with its poor riding surface and the
periodic flooding of some sections, is no longer adequate for the growing
traffic demand (about 400 VPD); maintenance is becoming more and more expen-
sive, and service is precarious because of lack of drainage and the deterior-
ated wooden superstructures of the bridges.
B.   Preparation and Engineering
5.03      The upgrading of the road was identified by consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC
ats one of the highest priority projects in the highway subsector. The same
consultants completed the feasibility study in April 1977 with financing
provided under Loan 1059-PA, and they have completed the detailed engineering
with financing provided by the Preinvestment Fund (Credit 587-PA).
5.04      The proposed work would consist of the upgrading of the existing
road into a two-lane paved road; minor realignments would be carried out,
and the grade would be raised along the areas subject to flooding. The
clrainage system would be totally reconstructed; four temporary bridges
(Tobatiry - 60 m, Hondo - 40 m, Mbutuy - 40 m, and Tapicuari - 60 m) and all
culverts would be replaced by permanent concrete structures; no major foundation
problems are foreseen. Since the horizontal and vertical alignments are
generally acceptable, the amount of earthworks is rather limited (about one
million cubic meters), and the bulk of the work to be performed is basically
the construction of the base and pavement (triple surface treatment); four
gravel quarries have been located, and average transport distances vary from
L.3 to 24 km. The design standards for the project road are shown in Table 5.1.
5.05      Cost estimates based on detailed quantity takeoffs (Table 5.2),
dLraft drawings and a portion of the specifications and bidding documents were
reviewed during appraisal and found adequate. The final drafts of these
documents, as well as final drawings, have been completed and reviewed by the
Bank. The average cost per km for the upgrading works (including bridges
but excluding contingencies) is US$167,860, which is acceptable.



- 21 -
C.   Project Impact
5.06      The proposed highway project would provide less costly and more
reliable transport services to the rich and developing agricultural areas of
the north and northeast of the part of the country east of the Paraguay River.
Despite a road system consisting entirely of dirt roads, subject to frequent
closure because of rain and flooding, the zone of influence of the project
(including the Departments of Concepcion, Amambay, San Pedro, Canendiyu and
part of Caaguazu) has experienced rapid population growth (4%) over the period
1962-1972, compared with a national average of 2.6% (immigration, both inter-
nal and from Brazil, is an important factor). This trend is expected to
continue and could raise the area's share of the country's population from
14% (406,000) in 1972 to 22% (1,200,000) in 2000. Farming, mostly small scale
but with increasing use of modern methods, is the principal economic activity
of the area, with forest exploitation also being important. While some river
transport is used and part of the production finds its way directly across
into Brazil, the great majority of the agricultural production of the area, as
well as livestock and timber, is destined for southern Paraguay for domestic
consumption or export abroad. This traffic, consisting largely of trucks
carrying timber, cattle, cotton, tobacco, soya, wheat, maize and sugar, is
dependent upon the proposed project road for access to these southern markets.
5.07      The overall importance to Paraguay of facilitating the transport of
these products is emphasized by the contribution of the project area, which
accounted for about 28% of national agricultural output over 1965-1974. This
proportion can be expected to increase as Government-promoted colonization of
the area's Departments proceeds and more efficient methods are applied to the
rich and abundant land. Overall growth of gross product of the region is
expected to average about 6% through the 1980s, which is in line with the
Bank's projection of the national growth rate after the impact of the hydro-
electric projects is exhausted. The proposed road project, in addition to
facilitating export of production, would significantly decrease the costs of
essential inputs required to expand production and increase yields and would
provide the people of the region with better general access to consumer goods.
5.08      The spur road to San Estanislao would have an important impact on
economic, commercial and social activity in the farming area surrounding the
town. San Estanislao is the only large town in the area (population 17,000)
and is the regional center for Government administration, commercial activity
and much of the farming production from the area west to the Paraguay River.
5.09      The project would have no adverse environmental impact; on the
contrary, it would reduce the inconvenience caused by dust, which is severe
during the nine-month dry season and which is a health hazard for people who
live in the towns and villages along the road. During the construction
period, project works are expected to provide jobs to about 300 workers.
D.   Economic Evaluation
(i) General
5.LO      The economic justification of the proposed highway project is based
on the comparison of the following quantifiable benefits with project construc-
tion costs:



- 22 -
(a) reduction of operating costs to road users;
(b)  travel time savings;
(c)  elimination of road closures; and
(d)  maintenance cost savings.
5.11      A possible alternative route, to provide direct access to Asuncion
from San Estanislao without passing through Coronel Oviedo, was subjected to
a preliminary appraisal. However, this route proved to be extremely costly
and clearly an inferior alternative to the improvement of the existing route
through Coronel Oviedo.
(ii) Traffic
5.12      Existing traffic volumes on the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara road were
established through a traffic survey conducted in March 1976 by consultants
SAE-EIT-CONTEC. Traffic count data prior to 1976 were useful only as a check
for the 1976 survey since they were sporadic in timing and location. Seasonal
adjustment of the March 1976 traffic volumes to estimate annual average daily
traffic (AADT) was achieved by applying deseasonalizing factors derived from
traffic data on two toll bridges north of Tacuara. Traffic volumes in the
opening year of the road (1982) were estimated using the growth rates described
in paragraph 5.13. Details of traffic flows are provided in Table 5.3. The
AADT for 1982 was adjusted by a factor to take account of the average number
of days (75) that the road is closed each year. Thus, the 1982 traffic
volumes adopted show daily traffic of 543 vehicles (58% heavy) on the Coronel
Oviedo-Mbutuy section (49 km), 401 (61% heavy) on the section from Mbutuy to
Tacuara (42 km) and 370 (46% heavy) on the Tacuara-San Estanislao spur.
Traffic was assumed to operate on sections of road completed during the second
and third years of construction (25% of the road length in 1980 and 65% in
1981). No diverted traffic was assumed since there are no alternative roads
now or in the foreseeable future and diversion from river transport would be
negligible.
5.13      Growth of normal traffic was estimated for a 22-year period (1980 to
2001) at 5.8% for the Coronel Oviedo-Mbutuy section, 5.6% for the Mbutuy-Tacuara
and 5.7% for the San Estanislao spur. These growth rates are based on estimated
growth of population and per capita income in the region. Compared to previous
production and traffic estimates made for the area, e.g., the 1973 Paraguay
Transport Survey, they can be considered fairly conservative. They would
result in daily traffic on the project road of 1,900 VPD by 2001. The great
majority of this traffic would, on the basis of 1976 origin and destination
(0&D) surveys by the consultants, be "long distance" in the sense that "local
traffic," comprising existing and generated trips only along the project road,
would be insignificant.
5.14      Improved reliability and cheaper transport would facilitate the
development of the project area and generate added production and consumption
of goods and services. However, since about two-thirds of existing traffic
originates at varying distances to the north of Tacuara and average trips are
on the order of 200 km, the paving of the 91-km Tacuara-Coronel Oviedo section



- 23 -
would generate only limited traffic. The 24% decline in light vehicle oper-
ating costs and 40% decline in bus operating costs over the length of the road
would cause a first-year increase in passenger traffic of about 9% above
normal traffic on the Coronel Oviedo-Mbutuy section and 10% on the Mbutuy-
Tacuara section. These increases have been estimated using a price elasticity
of demand between generated traffic and reduction in vehicle operating costs
of -1.8 for light vehicles and -1.5 for buses.
5.15      Elimination of the average 75 days of closure on the road would
facilitate the completion of trips which would have otherwise been cancelled
or delayed (para 5.19). However, other roads that feed the Coronel Oviedo-
Tacuara route would still be subject to closures. Only 20% of the traffic
would be completely free of closures when the project road is improved. The
overall effect of eliminating closures would be a first-year increase in
freight (trucks) and passengers (cars and buses) of 3% above normal traffic.
(iii) Benefits from the Project
5.16      Quantifiable benefits from the proposed highway construction proj-
ect are benefits to road users through vehicle operating cost savings, time
savings, benefits from elimination of road closures, and maintenance cost
savings.
5.17      The new paved highway would allow higher average speeds, 1/ which,
in turn, would cause significantly reduced vehicle operating costs (estimated
at about 24% for light vehicles and 40% for buses and trucks). Estimates of
vehicle operating costs were prepared by the consultants based on de Weille, 2/
modified according to recent experience in Paraguay and using local prices
(excluding taxes) to cost the various operating cost components. A summary
of the vehicle operating costs used for the project is shown in Table 5.4.
Vehicle operating cost savings account for about 83% of total quantifiable
beneEits. Benefits derived from reduction in passenger travel time were
included in the evaluation. Value of time was based on estimates of hourly
work income for the working population in the zone of influence of the high-
way. The final values adopted were USJ19/hour for work or business trips and
USO6/hour for other trips, which seem reasonable estimates. Based on the
consultants' O&D survey on the project road, 85% of all passengers in light
vehicles travel for work or business-related purposes. Passenger time savings
account for only about 5.5% of the total quantified benefits.
5.18      The maintenance cost savings included as a benefit for the project
may prove pessimistic. To be consistent with the maintenance requirements and
costs prepared for the maintenance program component of the proposed project,
1/   Based on previous studies and surveys by the consultants, average speeds
of light vehicles and buses would increase from 42 km/hour to 80 km/hour
and 60 km/hour reApectively, while truck speeds would rise on average
from 39 km/hour to 58 km/hour.

1968.



- 24 -
the estimates of consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar were used for this particular
road rather than the original higher estimates of SAE-EIT-CONTEC. The latter
estimates place a greater saving in maintaining a paved road as compared to an
earth surface than did Jorgensen-Tecnipar. Further, the Jorgensen-Tecnipa.
estimates are derived from comparing a good condition dirt road with a paved
road, whereas the Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao road is now in very poor
condition and adequate maintenance in the future, including the bridges, could
prove very costly. This by itself could make the quantified maintenance
savings conservative.
5.19      The last quantified benefit derives from elimination of the average
annual 75 days of closure of the road due to weather conditions. Road closure
causes some light vehicle and bus trips to be postponed and some to be can-
celled altogether. Truck trips are all assumed to be postponed. Only the
value of trips postponed and eventually completed was quantified, and the
benefits were calculated as the vehicle and passenger time savings caused by
paving the road. Vehicle time savings make up about 80% of these benefits,
and, as a whole, elimination of closure benefits constitutes about 11% of
total quantified benefits. There would also be welfare gains to people in
the area to the north of the project road as a result of greater regularity
of supply of farming inputs and manufactured consumer goods. A specific
example is fuel supply to provide electrical power to the city of Concepcion.
Closure of the project road has caused disruption to power supplies in
Concepcion and the surrounding area. Some additional fuel storage facilities
are already under construction to ameliorate the problem, and paving of the
Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara section of the road would obviously reduce future
requirements for storage facilities.
(iv) Benefit Distribution
5.20      The benefits resulting from savings in vehicle operating costs are
expected to be passed on, in large part, to the consumers of transport ser-
vices. This assessment is based on the highly competitive nature of the
trucking industry, as described in Chapter II dealing with the highway sub-
sector. Those benefiting would principally be the rural residents of the
areas along the project road and in the north and northeast of Paraguay,
who engage in productive activities and trade. The population would also
benefit through improved quality and reliability of service and travel time
savings. The benefits arising out of the project would therefore accrue
mostly to producers in the northeastern region, which has lagged behind the
richer south and southeast regions.
(v) Overall Economic Return
5.21      The proposed road project is economically well justified, with an
ER based on generally conservative estimates of about 16% (well above the
opportunity cost of capital, which is estimated at about 11% for Paraguay).
Unquantified benefits, including environmental enhancement (dust abatement)
and reduced disruption to incoming goods supply, suggest that this quantified
ER is conservative. Further, the traffic growth rates which form the basis
of the quantified benefits can be considered minimum expected rates, and
calculated maintenance benefits may be conservative. Sensitivity analyses
have been conducted on the benefits and costs of the project and demonstrate
that, even under adverse circumstances, the ER remains acceptable (Table 5.5).



- 25 -
5.22      The 7-km spur section to San Estanislao has lower estimated opening
year traffic than the main road, 370 VPD in 1982, compared with 540 and 400 on
the Coronel Oviedo-Mbutuy and Mbutuy-Tacuara sections. The Government under-
standably attaches great importance to the completion of this spur, which
would link this important regional center with the main north-south road. A
separate analysis has been undertaken, considering the spur as a marginal
addition to the main project. The engineers' estimates show that the marginal
cost of the spur (i.e., not including mobilization, head office overhead)
would be about 30% below average costs. The first year benefits would amount
to about 12% of this cost, indicating that the inclusion of the section at
this time is justified. This alternative is preferable to attempting to
mobilize a new contractor to build the spur a few years after the completion
of the main road.
VI. THE HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
A.   Background and Preparation
6.01      The need for assisting Paraguay in improving its highway main-
tenance operations has been felt by the Bank since it started highway
operations in that country (paras 3.01, 3.02 and 3.04). Future growth of
the network and increasing traffic volume would require a sustained increase
in the maintenance effort. Considering that the maintenance equipment now in
use, financed under Loan 652-PA, is close to the limit of its economic life,
it should be replaced shortly.
6.02      The 1979-1982 road maintenance and betterment program was prepared
by consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar under financing provided by Loan 1059-PA.
The consultant carried out an inventory of the network under maintenance
indicating--for each road, district by district, by types of surface--the
length in good, fair and bad condition (Table 6.1). The inventory showed a
total length of 6,689 km under maintenance, of which 13% are paved roads, 16%
gravel roads, 35% main earth roads and 36% secondary earth roads.
6.03      Traffic counts were also taken over the inventoried network.  At
key stations, these counts were for five 24-hour days, and, where traffic
was very low, the counts were for one 24-hour day; the average duration for
each count was 48 hours. From these data, the consultants prepared a program
of maintenance service for the four types of road mentioned in paragraph 6.02;
the estimated annual cost (in constant 1976 Guaranies) per km of road is given
in Table 6.2. These levels of maintenance, which appear adequate, have been
determined by the type and condition of the roads and by the volume of average
daily traffic.
6.04      On the basis of the equipment, materials and labor required to carry
out the annual program of operations, the consultants prepared the four-year
maintenance program and established the corresponding budgetary allocations.
To determine the equipment needs, the consultants prepared a complete inven-
tory of the existing fleet and reviewed the status of usage of the different
units to ascertain the remainder of their economic life.



- 26 -
6.05      During the final stage of preparation of the maintenance program, the
Government realized that the Paraguari-Encarnacion road resealing program (302 km)
would require a large lump outlay (roughly estimated at the time between
US$4 million and US$7 million), which could not be met from increases in DGV
maintenance allocations. Therefore, in May 1977, the Government requested Bank
assistance in financing the resealing of this road. Consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC
(Argentina) carried out an engineering and economic study, necessary for the
preparation of this project component, over the period July to October 1977 with
financing provided by the Preinvestment Fund (IDA Credit 587-PA). The consul-
tants conducted traffic counts, undertook a detailed assessment of the condi-
tions of the existing pavement based on systematic deflection measurements
and identified limited sections requiring strengthening. Detailed engineering
and economic evaluation were satisfactorily completed in October 1977.
B.   Description
(i) The Four-Year Maintenance Program
6.06      The maintenance program would continue the institutional improve-
ments carried out under previous loans, mainly in maintenance planning and
training of DGV staff; these two activities would be carried out through,
and under the supervision of, the Project Unit (paras 2.11 and 4.14).
6.07      The program would also include a road betterment element to be
carried out simultaneously with the maintenance program. The betterments
would be carried out on the road sections that cannot be efficiently main-
tained through routine or periodic maintenance operations and are aimed
mainly toward reduction of the length and duration of the closures during
heavy rains (para 2.22). The analysis prepared by the consultants shows that
about 5,200 km of roads have to be improved, of which 880 are gravel-surfaced
and 4,320 are earth-surfaced. During negotiations, the Government and the
Bank reviewed and agreed on a betterment program in accordance with selection
criteria, scope of works, total lengths to be treated and overall budgetary
requirements over the period 1979-1982 (Annex 2). DGV would hold advance
consultation with the Bank on annual tranches of the program starting from
1979.
6.08      A major component of the project would be to renew, overhaul and
enlarge the DGV equipment fleet as necessary to enable it to expand its
annual maintenance program and carry out scheduled betterments. The tentative
list of equipment needs and costs is shown in Table 6.3. Procurement of the
equipment is expected to be carried out over a two-year period (1979-1980).
6.09      A substantial part of MOPC's equipment fleet is in need of over-
haul. The remainder of the fleet is approaching the end of its economic
life and would require intensive maintenance over the next few years. The
project would provide spare parts to overhaul about 110 salvageable units
and to reconstitute stocks necessary for the continued maintenance of about
154 items of aging but still operating equipment. During negotiations, the
Bank obtained assurances from the Government that the overhaul of the equipment
would be completed not later than December 31, 1980 according to a program
acceptable to the Bank. The Government would, not later than September 30, 1978,
submit a detailed overhauling program.



- 27 -
6.10      The continuous expansion of DGV activities has shown that more
advanced systems of cost accounting, budgetary control, inventories, etc., are
required. Consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar have carried out a thorough study of
the problem and recommend mechanization of accounting operations, for which
the purchase of mini-computers is proposed. DGV and the Bank agreed that
this mechanization is urgently needed, and the present project includes
US$120,000 for purchase of the equipment. The equipment would be supplied
and installed by a specialized firm which would also carry out a training
program for the accounting staff of DGV.
(ii)  Resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion Road (302 km)
6.11      The Paraguari-Encarnacion road was built to its present two-lane
paved road standard over the period 1966-1968 under a previous Bank project
(para 3.03). This was one of Paraguay's main trunk roads, and it received
adequate levels of routine maintenance throughout the years, including patch-
ing and pavement repairs. The initial pavement, which consists of a triple
surface treatment, has, after ten years of use, become worn out and needs
resealing and partial strengthening. The structural assessment undertaken by
consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC showed that about 240 km (80%) of the initial
pavement was still in good condition and would, once resealed and protected
from water penetration, withstand projected traffic for the next ten years.
The existing pavement requires strengthening by means of an overlay of
asphaltic concrete over sections totalling about 60 km. A short section (2 km)
requires full reconstruction of the pavement structure. The above works would
be carried out under the project as a major civil works contract awarded on
the basis of ICB (para 4.12). Average cost per km would be about US$15,200 km
at February 1978 prices, excluding contingencies (resealing about US$8,000 per
km, overlay about US$36,000 per km, pavement reconstruction about US$150,000
per km).
C.   Project Requirements
(i) Current Expenditures
6.12      During recent years, the total yearly allocations for maintenance
have been increased substantially (Table 2.4). Such allocations have allowed
for fairly good maintenance of the road network, including some minor improve-
ments. Further increases are needed to allow MOPC to expand the length of the
network under maintenance and to ensure improved serviceability in the face of
increasing traffic volumes. Over the project period 1979 to 1982, maintenance
expenditures would have to be increased gradually from the present US$3.3
million equivalent to about US$6.33 million equivalent in 1982 (end 1976
values). The proposed increases are in line with MOPC's absorptive capacity
and have been agreed by the Ministry of Finance. During negotiations, the
Government confirmed that it would continue to provide adequate funding for
highway maintenance. Minimum estimates of requirements during the project
period, including specific provisions for betterment, and spare parts and
equipment renewal, were reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Table 6.4
shows the consultants' estimates for the above items during the project
period; these estimates are reasonable and should provide the basis for agreed
estimates of requirements.



- 28 -
(ii) Supply of Spare Parts
6.13      Difficulty in obtaining spare parts has been a perennial problem
for MOPC. MOPC has had to purchase parts on the local market, which is not
supplied regularly and which bears substantial markups. To provide MOPC with
a regular flow of parts, the Government confirmed, during negotiations, that,
in the future, DGV would receive sufficient resources in its current budget,
under a separate heading, to cover current spare parts requirements. The
Government also confirmed, during negotiations, that it would continue to
facilitate direct importation of spare parts by DGV, particularly by expe-
diting the handling of related administrative procedures.
(iii) Systematic Renewal of Equipment
6.14      The Government does not have a systematic approach to the renewal
of wornout equipment. Over the past ten years, MOPC has relied mostly on
Bank projects to effect large purchases every four to five years. This
pattern of lump renewal is not conducive to continuity in maintenance
operations or to the adoption of improved fleet maintenance methods. To
provide a planned basis for the systematic renewal of the fleet, the Govern-
ment has agreed to establish an equipment renewal fund, under the authority
of MOPC, with annual allocations sufficient to ensure timely renewal of the
fleet; such allocations would be no less than US$1.3 million (February 1978
values) per year starting in 1981. During negotiations, the Bank obtained
assurances from the Government that such a fund would be established and
managed in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank; such proce-
dures to be sent to the Bank for comment not later than December 31, 1979.
(iv) Planning of Periodic Maintenance of Paved Roads
6.15      The periodic maintenance of paved roads would, in the 1980's,
constitute an important element of DGV's annual maintenance program since the
paved road network is being expanded and existing paved roads are aging. In
view of the time-critical nature of resealing and overlays and the fact that
they represent large lump expenditures, DGV should develop adequate capacity
to plan for future requirements. This would be done with the assistance of
the Project Unit. At the time of negotiations, the Government confirmed
that, no later than the end of 1981, DGV would prepare an assessment of
requirements for resealing and overlays for the next ten years.
D.   Project Impact and Adequacy of Technology
6.16      Aside from the major quantified benefits mentioned below, the project
would provide a more reliable transport service with increased safety and
comfort to the users. In addition, the project would significantly increase
the number and level of qualification of personnel employed in road maintenance,
tlnereby contributing to the creation of permanent and productive employment
olpportunities. Total DGV personnel is scheduled to grow from about 1,300 to
1,600 over the project period. Current and proposed maintenance and betterment
methods generally represent an adequate combination of labor and equipment,
considering the prevailing wages for labor and the relative scarcity of manpower
in areas yet to be developed. The resealing/partial strengthening of the
Paraguari-Encarnacion road would provide work for about 200 laborers, operators
and technicians over a period of two years.



- 29 -
E.   Economic Evaluation
(i) The Four-Year Maintenance Program
(a) General
6.17      The economic evaluation of the proposed maintenance program is
based on the difference in cc-ts to the economy assuming that no maintenance
is undertaken as compared to the proposed program being executed. The follow-
ing benefits were quantified:
(1) Vehicle operating cost savings;
(2) Time savings of road users through the reduction of road
closures;
(3) Time savings of road users through the prevention of road
closures; and
(4) Protection of investment.
6.18      The economic evaluation justifies the costs for a designated year
(1980) of a maintenance program that includes: the purchase of new equipment;
spares and technical assistance proposed for financing by the Bank and also
the continued use of present equipment throughout its useful life; the
labor and materials required; and administrative costs directly associated
with maintenance.
6.19      The costs (and benefits) were aggregated on a link basis by district
and include the total costs for routine as well as minor betterments required
to bring roads tc a maintainable standard. In addition to these costs, a
consideration (about 15% of total) was applied as a contingency for washout
and erosion control. Only a benefit-cost ratio was produced since annual
benefits exceed the annual cost (and would do so in all years of the program).
(b) Traffic
6.20      Existing traffic volumes on the inventoried road network were
established through traffic surveys conducted in 1976 by consultants Jorgensen-
Tecnipar (para 2.04 and Table 2.1). Confirmation of these surveys and cor-
rections for seasonal variations were undertaken by comparison with toll
station data, ferryboat operations and prior census counts taken by MOPC.
The figures have been adjusted, as noted, to take into consideration those
periods when roads are closed because of rain. Indicators of traffic growth
for autos and buses were population growth, projected rate of increase of
gross domestic product (GDP) and rate of increase of income per capita, all
by department. Truck growth rates are based on the projected rate of increase
of GDP by Departments. The methodology selected for rates of growth is con-
sistent with that of the UNDP-financed Paraguay Transport Survey of 1973
(BCEOM France-ENECON Brazil), for which the Bank was Executing Agency. Using
these indicators, the average tariff growth by type of vehicle was estimated
to be 7.5% for light vehicles, 5.2% for buses and 6.3% for trucks. Because



- 30 -
of the nature of the project, neither generated nor diverted traffic was
considered. Traffic was projected to January 1979 and December 1980 in order
to analyze the effect of its growth on the costs of the program.
(c) Benefits from the Project
6.21      Vehicle operating costs savings were determined by comparing the
costs of light vehicles, buses and trucks running on the three main types of
surfaces--paved, gravel and earth--with the surface condition in either a
good, fair or poor state. For each section, the ADT of that section was
used, and the vehicle operating cost savings of keeping the section from
deteriorating from adequate to fair (if the road was in fair condition) and
from adequate to poor (if the road was in poor condition) were compared against
the estimated cost of achieving these improvements in surface condition. Many
of the trunk and secondary earth roads are effectively closed to traffic for
long periods after rains have ceased, mainly because of poor drainage. Better-
ment works included in this maintenance program would improve the drainage and
allow better maintenance. The consultants estimate that the actual closure
time after the rains would be reduced from 5% to 20%, depending on the extent
of the necessary betterment works.
6.22      Time savings associated with vehicle operating costs (wages, interest,
insurance, and administration costs) and vehicle passenger time savings were
taken as benefits to the economy from the reduction in road closures due to
the betterment works and improved maintenance. The value of passenger time
savings used for business trips was the average annual income per capita
divided by the average number of hours worked. For non-business trips, 30% of
this amount was used. O&D surveys indicate that some 85% of the passenger
travel is business-related and 15% is for non-work reasons; this is probably
because of the relatively primitive nature of the network. The following two
benefits, time savings for road users through the prevention of further road
closures and protection of investment, do not provide realizable resources to
the economy unless the project is not carried out.
6.23      The benefits from the prevention of further road closures are cal-
culated considering the fact that inadequately maintained roads deteriorate
prematurely and require earlier reconstruction. The costs to the users are
the increasing time costs as the road deteriorates and traffic must decrease
its speed. If there were no investment in maintenance, the three types of
roads--paved, gravel, and earth--would deteriorate at different levels until
each type was impassable and required reconstruction. The estimate made by
the consultants of this rate of closure, by type of road with no maintenance,
is two years for earth, five years for gravel and ten years for paved. The
percentage of deterioration per year varies according to the type of road:
26.5% for earth, 16.15% for gravel and 6.77% for paved. The benefits con-
sidered for prevention of closures are passenger time savings and vehicle
running cost savings. The cost of reconstruction for each type of road was
treated over ten-year reconstruction cycles, and the construction costs for
each type of road were converted to an annual basis using the present worth
factor (10%) and the capital recovery factor (10%) for the ten-year period.
Benefits from protection of the investment occur from the prevention of
reconstruction through proper maintenance.



- 31 -
(d) Benefits Distribution
6.24      The major benefit from the maintenance program is avoidance of
higher transport costs. Since truck transport and bus transport are highly
competitive,, the tariffs charged to farmers, manufacturers, and passengers
for goods and services would reflect the lower costs or avoided increases.
The benefits attributed to the reduction of closure of roads measure only
the quantifiable economic costs. The nonquantifiable benefits directly
perceived by the users due to this reduction are very important, particulariL
when these users are stranded for several days at a time.
(e) Overall Economic Return
6.25      The proposed road maintenance program is well justified, with a
benefit cost ratio of about 2.9:1 in 1980 considering only vehicle operating
cost savings, passenger time savings and reduction of closure benefits (Tables
6.5 and 6.6); including prevention of closure and protection of investment
benefits, the benefit cost ratio is about 6.6:1. Benefits on the individual
road sections range from a high of 110:1 to a low of 1.4:1. Further benefits
such as reduced spoilage of agricultural products and increased comfort and
safety to road users have not been quantified. To this extent, the benefit
cost ratios are conservative estimates.
(ii) Resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion Road
6.26      The resealing of the Paraguari-Encarnacion road represents a lump
expenditure which, nevertheless, falls within the general framework of the
maintenance program recommended by Jorgensen-Tecnipar. Consequently, it has
been evaluated economically as a separate project component.
6.27      The economic justification of this component, which is basically
conservation of previous investment, rests on the level of existing and
projected normal traffic and savings in subsequent maintenance costs. The
302 km of the project road represents the major part of the 365-km link
between Asuncion and Encarnacion, the two largest cities in Paraguay. The
road crosses the southeastern region, which is the most highly developed part
of the country, rich in agricultural production (wheat, maize, rice, soybean
and cotton) and raising of livestock. With its large and relatively densely
populated area of influence, the road represents the only reliable connection
for producers, exporters and consumers. In addition, there exists important
commercial and tourist traffic with Argentina (at Encarnacion-Posadas through
a passenger/cargo ferry service).
6.28      Historical traffic data are not useful since counts were sporadic,
conducted on varying sections of the road, and consistent methodology was not
used. The Bank's appraisal report of 1961 (Credit 12-PA, paragraph 3.03)
estimated 1965 traffic at 100 VPD, rising to 175 by 1971 (excluding generated
traffic). Although there are no actual counts for this period, the PCEOM-
ENECON study (1973) produced counts for 1972 on two sections o! the road. These
counts suggest that traffic had reached about 250 VPD by 1972, implying that
the appraisal estimates were conservative. The traffic counts conducted by
SAE-EIT-CONTEC in September 1977 on eight sections of the road over a one-week
period provide a good estimate of the 1977 traffic. This estimate of 550 VPD,



- 32 -
when projected at the growth rates assumed for the study, would result in ADT
of around 650 VPD in the opening year of the project, 1980. The estimate
appears consistent with traffic growth projections estimated for recent
projects in Paraguay. The deseasonalization of the counts employed factors
consistent with other recent highway studies in Paraguay.
6.29      Traffic projections were derived from forecast growth of per capita
GDP in the area of influence. The latter were prepared by SAE-EIT-CONTEC for
the ten-year transport program in March 1977. However, the consulltants
projected additional normal traffic which would result from two investments
not directly related to the proposed road expenditure i.e., construction of
the Yacyreta Dam and the Encarnacion-Posadas Bridge. Both works are expected
to be completed in 1984. It was assumed that tourist traffic would be boosted
by completion of the bridge and that truck traffic would be enhanced only during
the construction period of the dam and bridge. This additional traffic would
add from 2% to 4% to "base" traffic over the project period. Overall annual
growth rates assumed over the ten-year project period were about 7% for light
vehicles, 5% for buses and 6% for trucks. In light of anticipated economic
development in the area of influence of the road, these growth rates can
reasonably be regarded as minimum expected rates. Since there are no alter-
native routes and since the present condition of the paved road is quite good,
it was assumed that there would be no diverted or generated traffic.
6.30      Quantified benefits were vehicle operating cost savings, passenger
time savings and maintenance savings. Time savings, because of the expected
good speeds obtainable on the road with or without the project, are small.
Therefore, although calculated by the consultants, time-saving benefits have
not been included in the economic returns given below. Vehicle operating
costs for the project were calculated using the same methodology as for the
Coronel Oviedo-San Estanislao upgrading (para 5.17). It was assumed that, in
the "with-project" case, vehicle operating costs would remain at about the
existing level. The "without-project" case, based on the intensive routine
road maintenance policy explained below, considered that vehicle operating
costs would gradually increase by about 12% over the period 1980-1989. These
costs would eventually reach the level of operating costs on a gravel road
which, based on recent Bank experience elsewhere in Latin America, would be
the approximate condition of the road. The savings then calculated represent
about 66% of total benefits. The ER from vehicle operating cost savings only
is 49%.
6,.31     Maintenance cost savings were calculated as the difference between
normal routine maintenance with the project (the cost of necessary periodic
resealing was included in the project cost streams in 1983) and the cost of an
intensive routine maintenance policy.  The cost in 1976 of such a policy for
this road was estimated by the Jorgensen-Tecnipar study at US$1,600 per km.
Consultants SAE-EIT-CONTEC assumed that this cost would increase at a steady
rate to US$5,200 per km in 1984. Maintenance expenditures were assumed
to remain constant thereafter until the end of the project period in 1989, by
which time the road, still a paved surface in 1984, would have deteriorated to
the equivalent of a gravel surface. Maintenance benefits, calculated as the
savings due to the project, represent 34% of total benefits.

6.32      This proposed project component, being basically conservation of an
existing fairly heavily trafficked road, has high economic returns. The ER is
estimated at well in excess of 50%.   A sensitivity test, assuming much higher
civil works costs which would result if substantial additional resurfacing
were found to be required, showed that the project would still be justified
with an ER of over 50%. This is well above the estimated social opportunity
cost of capital for Paraguay (11%).
VII. IMPROVEMENT OF SECTOR MANAGEMENT
A.   Enforcement of Vehicle Weight Regulations
7.01      Previous loans included covenants for the enforcement of weight
regulations, but such enforcement has not been effective. Three fixed scales
were installed in 1969, and, under Loan 652-PA, portable scales were purchased,
but scale operators have not proven sufficiently reliable. MOPC, with assis-
tance of consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar, has studied the problem and proposed
the purchase of automatic fixed scales which would print cards with vehicle
weights. The proposed project would provide for the purchase of seven
automatic scales (three of which would replace the existing manually operated
scales) and for the construction of the stations. The study prepared by the
consultants recommended the location of the stations and proposed revisions
to the Decree, dated October 1968, which established the weights and dimen-
sions of vehicles as well as updating of current regulations. The study,
however, did not include the design of the stations, nor the staffing, oper-
ational procedures, policing, etc. These questions have to be examined if the
enforcement is to be carried out on a rational basis. The project would
therefore also include a study of the regulatory framework and institutional
arrangements for effective enforcement of vehicle weight regulations. This
study would be carried out by DGV with technical assistance provided under the
project following terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. At the time of
negotiations, the Government confirmed that the study would be initiated by
September 30, 1978 and that, by December 31, 1979, it would adopt an enforcement
program acceptable to the Bank. Adoption of such a program would be a condition
for disbursing for the scales and weighing stations.
B.   Technical Assistance to DGV
7.02      In order to carry out the highway inventory mentioned in paragraph 2.14,
DGV would require technical expertise and logistic support; these would be
provided under the project. Two experts would be needed for a total of about
24 man-months, and the equipment would include two specially equipped pickups.
DGV would also need the service of one experienced highway engineer for about
six months to develop design standards and construction specifications, as
mentioned in paragraph 2.16. The technical assistance required for the highway
inventory and for the design standards and specifications would be provided by
individual consultants or a consulting firm under terms and conditions accept-
able to the Bank. DGV would also carry out the study for the design and opera-
tion of weight control stations (para 7.01), which would be implemented by
MOPC's Directorate for Execution and Budgetary Control (para 4.10(d)).



- 34 -
C.   Strengthening of Transport Planning
(i) Support of OCIPT
7.03      As mentioned in paragraph 1.13, OCIPT would need further technical
assistance to pursue and develop its role as the central unit for planning and
management of the transport sector. The proposed technical assistance would
continue on through late 1979, at which time it is hoped that OCIPT would have
sufficient experienced staff. A stronger measure of Government support would
also be necessary to allow OCIPT to become more independent of external exper-
tise and therefore achieve a greater degree of integration into MOPC.  The
work program of OCIPT for the period 1978-1981 and related resource require-
ments have been reviewed and tentatively agreed with MOPC and are presented in
Annex 3. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that it would, in the
future, provide OCIPT with necessary resources. The OCIPT work program for
the period 1978-1981 and the related staffing and budget requirements were
confirmed during negotiations.
7.04      The project would include technical assistance to OCIPT for the
study, inter alia, of road projects as part of the updating of the transport
program. OCIPT, as part of its work plan for 1978-1981, would develop a
transport model to project flows of cargo and passengers between distinct
zones in the country and to allocate this traffic among the different modes
servicing the distinct zones. This network approach would permit identifica-
tion of specific projects for more detailed study and would also provide the
basis to plan further upgrading of the road system.
7.05      OCIPT is proposing to undertake identification and economic evaluation
studies identified in the previous highway network analysis and having a high
prima facie justification of the following routes:
(a)  Concepcion to Route 3                         100 km
(b)  Concepcion to the Transchaco route            150 km
(c)  Asuncion-Pilar-Itapiru                        200 km
(d) Villarica-Coronel Bogado
(a rail/road comparison) 1/                  200 km
(e)  Mbutuy/Tacuara-Salto del Guaira               250 km
These studies, plus those planned during 1977, may, after review, offer the
basis for the development of future highway projects.  Engineering (preliminary
and detailed as appropriate) for specific projects could be financed under the
Preinvestment Credit (Credit 587-PA).
(ii) Traffic Counting
7.06      The present project would also provide the necessary facilities
(two pickup trucks and 25 traffic counters) to establish a permanent program
1/   Updating of feasibility study carried out under the Second Road Project.



- 35 -
of traffic counts, which is a basic requirement for proper highway planning.
A more systematized method for collection and analysis of traffic data is
required. Consultants Jorgensen-Tecnipar have recommended a system of annual
traffic counts, including the use of automatic traffic counters, which would
provide the data required to administer the maintenance program properly.
The Directorate General of Transport, in coordination with DGV, would carry
out the permanent program of traffic counts. During negotiations, the Bank
obtaiLned assurances from the Government that it would establish a program
of traffic counts according to an agreed timetable (para 2.04).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following:
(a) over the project period, the Government (i) not to undertake
investments in PCAL's permanent way and rolling stock without
prior review by OCIPT and (ii) to transmit the findings of the

(n)  no later than the end of 1981, DGV to prepare an assessment
of requirements for resealing and overlays for the next
ten years (para 6.15);
(o)  by September 30, 1978, DGV to initiate study for weight
control program following terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, and, by December 31, 1979, the Government to
adopt an enforcement program acceptable to the Bank for
vehicle weight regulations (para 7.01);
(p)  the Government to provide OCIPT with necessary resources;
OCIPT work program for the period 1978-1981 and the related
staffing and budget requirements were confirmed (para 7.03);
and
(q)  the Government to establish a program of traffic counts accord-
ing to an agreed timetable (para 7.06).
8.02      Creation of the Project Unit and the recruitment of at least
one internationally recruited engineer and two local engineers should be
completed not later than August 31, 1978 and would be a condition for disburs-
ing for equipment and parts (para 4.14).
8.03      Adoption of an enforcement program for vehicle weight regulations
would be a condition for disbursing for the scales and weighing stations
(para 7.01).
8.04      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$33 million equivalent to the Republic of Paraguay. The loan would have
a term of 17 years, including a grace period of four years.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Road Betterment Program
1.        The Road Betterment Program under the project will be carried out
simultaneously with the maintenance works according to the tentative scope
of works and yearly targets set forth below in accordance with the study dated
April 1977 entitled Technical Economic Report on a Maintenance Program and
Study of Maintenance Needs for 1979-1982 prepared by consultants
Jorgensen-Tecnipar.
2.        The selection criteria for the betterment works to be carried out
is that such works will improve the condition of road sections which cannot
be maintained efficiently through routine maintenance operations; these works
will not include major reconstruction or upgrading of design standards. On
that basis and as a result of a detailed inventory of the road network under
maintenance, DGV has determined that the aggregate length of roads requiring
betterment over the period 1979 to 1982 totals about 5,200 km. In addition to
periodic regraveling, the tentative amount of works to be carried out over
that length is:
(a)  construction of culverts                    M.L.           14,000
(b)  earthworks                                  m3         1,100,000
(c) construction of about
50 small wooden bridges
3.        The tentative length of roads, in km, to be improved during the
project period is year by year:
1979                      800
1980                    1,420
1981                    1,270
1982                    1,710
5.200
