for\n            West Bank and Gaza were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            program design needs to be realistic, taking into account\n            the political economy, the context of fragility, technical\n            and other relevant challenges and risks. Specifically the\n            technical challenges of implementing specific reforms ought\n            to be taken into account in operation design. The reform\n            aimed at introducing a payroll system in two ministries on\n            pilot basis was not implemented as intended. This was\n            evidently not due to inadequate ownership on the\n            government's side, but rather because of the technical\n            challenge of implementing the reform within a given\n            timeframe turned insurmountable. Future operations should\n            assess not only the readiness to implement particular\n            reforms, but also the technical feasibility, when proposed\n            reforms have to undergo an implementation process that may\n            be technically challenging. Single tranche operations can\n            and should be designed with a medium-term agenda in mind\n            whenever possible. While it will probably not be appropriate\n            to design a programmatic DPG, given the high level of\n            uncertainty in West Bank and Gaza, this operation was\n            designed with some medium term objectives in mind and has\n            been successfully used as a platform to support the dialogue\n            with the authorities on the medium term program, even when\n            the implementation of some of its actions had to be\n            postponed. Finally, the medium term outlook has been a\n            useful tool in the preparation of a follow up operation."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
