                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Government is pursuing implementation of the PNDP and is improving public financial systems. The decline in external donor assistance has caused strong new fiscal pressures to
                         which the authorities have responded with efforts to control public spending while improving revenue administration. Important aspects of the latter depend on cooperation from GOI.
