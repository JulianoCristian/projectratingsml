Authority (PA)\n            to implement the new National Development Plan which will\n            specifically support efforts to improve the fiscal position\n            and increase government transparency and accountability.\n            This document is the fourth Development Policy Grant (DPG)\n            to the PA in support of the new National Development Plan\n            2011-2013. After a successful episode of implementing the\n            Palestinian Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP 2008-2010),\n            the caretaker government put forward the new National\n            Development Plan (NDP 2011-2013). Under the earlier PRDP\n            2008-2010, the caretaker government set out towards\n            restoring the basic operating systems of the PA while\n            reforming and creating stronger public institutions that\n            will form the basis of a future Palestinian state. The\n            current NDP 2011-2013 aims to move the PA fiscal and\n            institutional performance beyond recovery and towards\n            sustainability, by gradually reducing dependence on foreign\n            assistance while continuing to improve the welfare of\n            citizens. In February 2011 the PA cabinet resigned with the\n            expectation of formation of a new cabinet within five weeks.\n            This did not happen and the existing cabinet has continued\n            in an acting capacity. On May 4, 2011, the PA in the West\n            Bank signed a reconciliation agreement with the leadership\n            in Gaza, calling for the formation of an interim unity\n            government and announcing a plan to hold national elections\n            by 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
