Implementation is generally\n            satisfactory. The objective of the PRERC in reform of\n            centralized payments, is to strengthen public expenditure\n            management, and the methodology established will permit the\n            government to reform its billing, and payments systems with\n            other utilities. The Development Credit Agreement states\n            that two general conditions must be met at the time of\n            meeting the PRERC public utilities (centralized payments)\n            tranche release: 1) the Association is satisfied with the\n            progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the\n            Program; and, 2) the macroeconomic policy framework of the\n            Borrower is satisfactory, as measured on the basis of\n            indicators, agreed upon between the Borrower and the\n            Association. Overall progress in implementation of the\n            PRERC-financed program is satisfactory and timely, and\n            Government's commitment remains firm. The Borrower has\n            met the condition for the release of the public utilities\n            (centralized payments) floating tranche of the PRERC. All\n            conditions for the release of the Centralized Payments\n            Tranche of the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit\n            have therefore been met. Overall execution of the program is\n            satisfactory. The macroeconomic framework is consistent with\n            the objectives of the program, and execution is\n            satisfactory. The Government has therefore been advised that\n            the Centralized Payments Floating Tranche, is now available\n            for disbursement."}, "docdt": "2004-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
