Some lessons learned\n            included:  deep reforms changing the patterns of governance\n            and public sector management require adequate preparation,\n            including political economy assessment, consensus building\n            effort and wide political and social ownership. In the\n            absence of such thorough preparation, the likelihood of\n            success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run\n            gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict\n            environment, a development policy operation (DPO) instrument\n            can be effective if the reform program is well calibrated to\n            a context of weak technical capacity and multiple\n            priorities. In both countries, and for each operation,\n            ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only\n            assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt\n            relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments\n            followed a pattern of temporary commitment to reforms for\n            immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and\n            ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the\n            ambitious reform agenda in both counties."}, "docdt": "2011-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
