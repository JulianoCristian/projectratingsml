          Economic Recovery Credit for Congo were as follows: the\n            outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely,\n            the institutional development impact was modest, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project: When a reform program\n            supported by a quick-disbursing operation has a relatively\n            long implementation phase, a multi-year operation with\n            enough flexibility to account for evolution on the ground\n            and for unforeseen technical difficulties is likely to be\n            more suitable. Using adoption of an action plan as the\n            tranche release condition was a way to disburse the funds\n            quickly while tackling a large problem. In quick-disbursing\n            operation, it is important to limit the scope of the\n            immediate objectives so that they can reasonably be achieved\n            during the relevant time-frame. It was not possible to make\n            payment of retirees a tranche release condition because the\n            Government needed the tranche to pay the retirees.\n            Alternatively, the operation should be synchronized with the\n            Government's budget cycle, so that adequate allocations\n            could be made in the State budget to carry out the reform\n            programs. Also, comprehensive programs of capacity building\n            for Ministries and Government Agencies are important to\n            improve implementation; donors should be prepared to provide\n            assistance for this purpose. In the context of post-conflict\n            fragile states, a case could be made for a hybrid lending\n            instrument where funds provided by the Bank would be\n            earmarked for specific purposes but the involvement of the\n            Bank would not be as extensive as in investment projects."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
