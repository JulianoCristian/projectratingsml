A. 
Project Development Objectives 
1. 
Project 
development 
objectives: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
main 
goal 
of 
the Second 
Multicountry 
HIV/AIDS 
program 
(MAP2), 
the 
overall project 
objectives 
are 
to 
assist 
the 
Government 
of 
Djibouti 
in 
setting 
up 
and implementing 
a response 
against 
HIV/AIDS, 
sexually transmitted 
infections 
(STIs), 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
(TB), 
of 
which 
the 
latter 
two 
are 
important 
risk 
cofactors. 
Djibouti 
meets the 
criteria 
for 
MAP2 
eligibility; 
only 
the 
key 
features 
highlighted 
below 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
in 
Djibouti 
and 
the 
Djibouti HIV/AIDS, 
Malaria 
and Tuberculosis 
Control 
Project. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
support 
the 
three 
National 
Strategic  Plans 
to 
control 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria,  and 
tuberculosis 
(Plan 
stratdgique 
national 
de 
prdvention 
du 
VIHNDA, 
Plan 
stratdgique 
national 
de 
lutte contre le 
Paludisme, 
et 
Plan 
stratdgique 
national 
de 
lutte contre 
la 
Tuberculose) 
for 
the 
period 
2003-2008. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
change 
in 
behavior 
of 
the 
Djiboutian 
population 
in 
order 
to 
contain 
or 
reduce the 
spread 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic, 
to 
mitigate 
its 
impact 
on 
infected and 
affected 
persons, 
and 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
control 
of 
malaria and 
tuberculosis. 
It 
will 
do 
so 
through 
a 
multisector 
approach: 
(i) 
preventing 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
by 
reducing 
transmission, 
in 
particular 
among 
high-risk 
groups; 
(ii) 
expanding 
access 
to 
treatment 
of 
opportunistic 
illnesses, 
malaria, and 
tuberculosis, 
and 
providing 
care, 
support, 
and 
treatment 
to 
People 
Living 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA) 
in 
Djibouti; 
and 
(iii) 
supporting multisectoral, 
civil 
society, 
and 
community 
initiatives 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
and 
care, 
and 
malaria and 
tuberculosis 
prevention. 
In 
the context 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
strategic 
plans, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
and promote 
civil 
society 
and 
community 
initiatives, 
for 
prevention 
and 
care 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis developed 
by 
beneficiary 
groups 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
technical quality, 
cost-effectiveness, 
and 
likely 
impact 
of 
their 
proposals. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
With 
regard 
to HIV/AIDS, 
studies 
have 
been carried 
out 
to 
provide 
baseline 
data 
on 
the 
general 
population 
and 
on 
some 
specific 
groups. 
Given 
the nature 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
and 
the 
experience 
gained 
from 
other 
countries, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
impact 
of 
project-supported 
activities, 
within 
the five-year 
implementation 
period, 
would 
be difficult 
to 
assess 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
reduction 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
in 
the 
overall 
population, 
or 
increased 
life 
expectancy. 
Measurable 
impact 
can 
be 
expected, 
however, 
among 
key 
target groups 
which 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
the outcome indicators. 
A 
more 
extensive 
list 
of 
indicators 
is 
provided 
in 
Annex 
1. 
In 
addition, 
some 
interim 
output/process 
indicators 
have been 
identified 
to 
assess 
early 
progress 
so 
that 
modifications 
to 
project 
design become 
a 
normal 
part 
of 
the 
implementatiodsupervision 
process 
(see 
Annex 
1). 
Outcome 
indicators 
By 
project 
end: 
o 
Fifty 
percent 
of 
persons 
in 
high-risk 
groups 
(persons 
in 
uniform, commercial 
sex 
workers 
(CSW), 
and 
dockers) 
will 
have 
used 
a 
condom 
during 
their 
last 
non-union 
sexual 
encounter 
(present 
rate 
of 
use 
is 
20 
percent); 
Ninety 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
of 
Djibouti 
aged 15-49 
will 
be 
able 
to 
identify 
at 
least 
three 
methods 
of 
protection 
against 
HIV/AIDS 
(at 
present 
53 percent); 
Fifty 
percent 
of 
women 
attending prenatal consultations 
in 
centers 
offering Voluntary 
Counseling and Testing 
(VCT) 
will 
accept 
voluntary 
testing 
for 
HIV 
(at 
present 
voluntary 
testing 
has 
only just 
started 
being 
offered to 
pregnant 
women 
in 
end 
March 
2003); 
HIV 
prevalence 
among 
pregnant 
women 
aged 
between 
15-24 
will 
be 
decreased 
from 
2.7 
percent 
to 
2.0 
percent; 
o 
o 
o 
-2- 
Page  9
o 
o 
o 
o 
STI 
prevalence rate 
among 
pregnant 
women 
decreased 
by 
25 
percent 
(baseline 
survey 
will 
be carried 
out 
in 
September 2003 
in 
the 
sentinel 
sites); 
Rate 
of 
“lost 
cases” 
of 
tuberculosis 
will 
be 
reduced 
from 
24 
percent 
to 
15 
percent 
nationally; 
Hospital mortality 
due 
to 
malaria 
will 
be 
reduced 
by 
50 
percent 
(baseline 
data 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
National 
Malaria 
Program Report 
for 
2002); 
and 
At 
least 
15,000 
households 
will 
be 
using 
impregnated 
bednets. 
Output/process 
indicators

A 
Monitoring

Evaluation Plan 
which 
was  developed 
using 
a 
participative 
approach, 
was 
reviewed 
and 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
(M&E) 
will 
be 
subcontracted, 
and 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
(ES) 
will 
be 
the 
contractor’s 
counterpart. 
The 
ES 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
following 
up 
with 
the 
different 
entities 
to 
ensure 
that 
data 
are 
collected 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
and 
that they 
are 
available 
when 
analysis 
is 
scheduled. 
As 
specified 
in 
the 
M&E 
Plan, 
some 
data 
will 
be 
analyzed 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis 
and 
others 
less 
frequently. 
The 
Terms 
of

(TOR) 
of 
the 
long-term 
M&E 
consultant 
include 
capacity 
building 
and 
howledge

to 
strengthen 
and 
sustain the 
M&E 
system. 
Moreover, 
the 
firm, 
expected 
to 
start 
shortly 
after 
effectiveness, 
will 
assist 
the 
ES 
and 
its 
partners 
in 
strengthening 
the 
mechanisms 
for 
data 
collection and 
identifying 
the 
information 
that 
each 
partner 
will 
need 
to 
collect. 
Following 
an 
assessment 
during 
project 
implementation, 
a 
Planning, 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
Unit 
(PMEU) 
may 
be 
created 
if 
the 
ES 
cannot 
assume 
the 
role 
of 
counterpart 
to 
the 
contractor 
because 
of 
the 
workload 
generated 
by 
the project.

The project 
supports 
the 
third 
CAS 
objective 
of 
improving 
human  development 
indicators 
by 
raising 
school enrollment, 
improving 
access 
to 
health 
services, 
and containing 
the spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
such 
as 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB, 
as 
well 
as 
improving 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
basic 
services 
and 
to 
economic  opportunities 
and 
targeting 
assistance 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable. 
In 
particular,  the 
project 
will 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
containing the 
spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
By 
supporting 
services 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
STIs, 
malaria, 
tuberculosis, 
opportunistic 
diseases, 
and, 
to 
a 
limited 
extent, 
AIDS 
through 
the 
pilot 
project 
on 
the 
use 
of 
ARVs 
(included 
in 
the 
Public 
Health 
Sector 
Response Component), 
the 
project 
will 
increase 
access 
to 
basic 
health 
services 
and 
to 
treatment 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
Through 
its 
community 
intervention 
response 
and 
its 
information 
activities, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
socio-economic

Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
government strategy: 
Despite 
its 
relatively 
high 
nominal 
per 
capita 
income 
of 
US$780 
(compared 
to 
an 
average 
of 
US$5 
10 
for 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa, 
US$320 
for 
Yemen, and 
US$1 
10 
for 
Ethiopia), 
Djibouti 
has 
one 
of 
the poorest 
sets 
of 
social indicators 
in 
the 
world. 
Gross 
primary 
school 
enrollment 
is 
less 
than 
half 
the 
average 
for 
Africa 
(39 percent 
of 
the 
school-age 
population,  compared 
to 
78 percent 
for 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa). 
Health 
indicators 
are 
below 
regional 
averages. 
Approximately 
33 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
lacks 
access 
to 
potable 
water; 
sanitary 
conditions 
are 
often 
very 
precarious; 
and 
many 
are 
very 
poor. 
The 
incidence 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
such 
as 
HN/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
TB 
is 
high 
and 
rising. 
Nationwide, 
the 
HN/AIDS 
sero-prevalence 
rate 
is 
estimated 
at 
3.0 
percent 
for 
the 
whole population 
(3.1 
percent 
for women 
and 
2.9 
percent 
for 
men), 
which 
is 
lower 
than 
expected. 
However, 
analysis 
of 
the 
data 
by 
age 
groups shows 
a 
prevalence 
higher 
than 
5 
percent 
among 
persons aged 
20-35, 
indicating 
that 
early 
on 
HIV 
infects 
the 
economically productive and 
sexually 
active 
persons. 
Malaria 
has 
only 
been 
a 
problem 
in 
Djibouti 
since 
the late 
1980s. 
Before 
1973, 
when 
there was 
little 
urbanization, 
no 
irrigation, and 
an 
active attempt 
to 
control 
the 
vector 
during 
the 
rainy 
season, 
more 
than 
80 percent 
of 
the 
notified 
cases 
migrated 
from 
neighboring 
countries. 
From 
1973 
to 
1987, 
more 
Djiboutian 
cases 
appeared 
along 
the 
main 
transport 
axes 
linking 
Djibouti 
to 
neighboring 
countries, 
and 
after  1987 
cases 
appeared 
in 
the 
urban 
areas. 
During 
this 
period, 
thousands 
of 
refugees 
resettled 
in 
Djibouti. 
Since 
1988, 
the 
spread 
of 
malaria 
has 
increased 
steadily, 
reaching 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
northern districts 
of 
Tajourah 
and 
Obock 
where 
it 
was 
previously 
inexistent. 
Uncontrolled 
urbanization 
with 
inappropriate 
water 
supply, 
nonexistent 
wastewater 
evacuation 
system, 
settlement 
of 
nomad  population 
in 
rural 
areas, 
increased 
irrigated 
areas, 
and 
frequent 
inundations 
contributed 
to 
the 
endemicity 
of 
malaria. 
Pro- 
active interventions 
are needed 
to 
prevent 
malaria 
from 
becoming more 
prevalent. 
With 
588 
cases 
of 
TB 
per 
100,000 
inhabitants, 
Djibouti 
has 
the 
second 
highest rate 
of 
TB 
in 
the 
world, 
after  Swaziland. 
However, 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
cases 
come  fkom 
neighboring 
countries, 
in 
particular 
from 
Ethiopia, 
which 
inflates  the 
rate. 
Foreigners 
come 
to 
Djibouti 
because 
it 
offers 
more 
and 
better-quality 
services (and 
free 
of 
charge). 
Nevertheless, 
TB 
patients 
are 
present 
in 
Djibouti 
and 
can 
infect 
people 
around 
them. 
As 
in 
other countries 
the 
link 
between 
HN 
and 
TB 
is 
apparent. 
Although 
the 
sero-prevalence 
rate 
in 
the 
general 
population 
is 
less 
than 
3 
percent, 
it 
is 
23 
percent among 
TB 
patients. 
In 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
two 
main 
factors 
contributed 
to 
the 
weakening 
of 
the 
national 
program. 
Although 
it 
remains 
one 
of 
the best 
in 
the 
region 
with 
72 
percent 
therapeutic 
success 
(treatment 
completed and 
patients 
cured) 
in 
2000, 
an 
acute 
lack 
of 
personnel and the 
departure 
of 
the 
French 
Cooperation, 
which 
ceased 
all 
assistance 
(financial and 
technical) 
in 
June 2002, 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to maintain 
past 
performance 
levels. 
Over

and 
the 
departure 
of 
the 
French 
Cooperation, 
which 
ceased 
all 
assistance 
(financial and 
technical) 
in 
June 2002, 
makes 
it 
difficult 
to maintain 
past performance levels. 
Over 
the 
next 
three 
years, 
drugs 
are 
being 
supplied 
through 
the 
Global 
Fund 
Facility. 
The 
World 
Health 
Organization 
(WHO), 
and 
to 
a  lesser  extent, 
the 
Government 
of 
Djibouti 
(10 
percent 
of 
the 
budgeted 
US$150,000) 
provide 
some 
financial 
assistance, 
but 
the 
prograq 
remains 
in 
increasing 
need 
of 
financial 
assistance. 
Infant 
mortality 
is 
106 per thousand 
live 
births, 
compared 
to 
an 
average 
of 
92 for 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa, 
45 
for 
the 
Middle 
East and 
North 
Africa, 
and 82 
for 
Yemen. 
High 
maternal 
mortality 
(740 
per 
100,000 
live 
births) 
can 
be 
largely 
attributed 
to 
high 
fertility 
rates, 
anemia 
caused 
by 
malnutrition, and 
poor 
health 
care 
facilities 
saturated 
with 
patients 
from 
neighboring Ethiopia 
and 
Somalia. 
Free 
health 
care 
contributes 
to 
the 
influx 
of 
patient-refugees 
seeking treatment 
in 
Djibouti, 
in 
particular 
for 
TB. 
Although 
the 
country 
spends 
about 
7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
on 
health, 
well 
above 
the 
regional 
average 
of 
5 percent, 
service 
delivery 
is 
very 
poor.  External 
assistance, 
notably 
from 
France, 
Italy, 
and 
Spain,  accounts 
for 
30 percent 
of 
health 
care 
expenditures; 
but 
external 
assistance  has 
declined, 
putting 
additional 
pressure 
on 
an 
overtaxed 
and 
inefficient 
system.

The 
first 
AIDS 
cases 
were 
reported 
in 
Djibouti 
in 
1986. 
Since 
then  the  situation 
has 
been 
worsening 
steadily: 
at the 
end 
of 
2000, 
there 
were 
2,179 
registered 
AIDS 
cases. 
Between 
1994 
and 
2000 
several surveys, 
including 
pregnant 
women 
and 
blood 
donors, 
showed that prevalence 
was 
particularly 
high 
in 
some 
groups 
(as 
early 
as 
1994, 
it 
was 
55 
percent 
among commercial 
sex 
workers 
(CSWs), 
24 
percent 
among 
women working 
in 
bars, 
and 
22.2 
percent 
among 
STI 
patients; 
but 
information 
for 
the 
general 
population 
was discordant, 
varying 
from 
4 
to 
6 
percent 
in 
1995 
to 
1.9 
percent 
in 
2000. 
However, none 
were 
as 
high 
as 
the 
1999 
UNAIDS 
estimate 
among 
Djiboutian 
adults aged 15-49 
(1 
1.9 percent). 
As 
the strategy was 
not 
to 
be 
the 
same 
if 
the 
rate 
was 
inferior 
or 
superior 
to 
5 percent, 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
carry 
out 
a sero-prevalence 
survey 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the  project. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
the  rate 
was 
found 
to 
be 
2.9 
percent 
following 
the 
results 
of 
the 
survey, 
and 
is 
still 
low. 
It 
should 
be 
underlined 
that the rate 
is 
more 
than 
5 
percent 
among 
persons aged 
20-35, 
which 
confirms 
that the rate 
is 
on 
the 
increase, 
and 
that 
the 
critical 
threshold 
of 
5  percent, 
(when 
the 
infection 
reaches 
the 
exponential 
growth 
rate), 
affects the 
most 
sexually active 
and economically productive 
age 
group. 
This 
situation 
is 
cause 
for 
concern 
and 
calls 
for 
a 
multisectoral 
response 
along 
with 
the 
full 
recognition 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
as 
a 
developmental 
issue.

The 
analysis 
of 
the 
AIDS 
cases 
reported 
in 
1998 
and 
1999 
indicates 
that: 
0 
0 
The 
transmission 
is 
mostly 
heterosexual  (95.6 
percent 
of 
declared 
cases 
among 
women 
and 
91.6 
percent 
among 
men). 
Persons 
aged 15-29 
represent 
47.4 percent 
of 
registered 
AIDS 
cases, 
which 
shows 
that 
people 
are 
infected 
at an 
early 
age 
and 
was 
confirmed 
by 
studies 
carried 
out 
in 
2002. 
Women 
are 
infected 
at 
a 
younger 
age 
than men: 
women 
aged 
15-29 
represent 
54.3 
percent 
of 
declared 
cases, 
while 
men 
of 
the 
same  age 
group 
represent 
only 
42.7 
percent. 
Risk 
factor 
specific to 
Djibouti 
Trade: 
Djibouti 
is 
a 
highly 
urbanized 
state 
(more than 80 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
lives 
in 
urban 
areas) 
with 
economic 
activity 
centered 
around 
the 
port, 
which 
serves 
the 
Hom 
of 
Africa 
and 
services 
the 
French 
military 
bases. 
In 
addition, 
about 
a 
thousand transport 
trucks 
enter 
in 
and out 
of 
Djibouti's 
port 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
to 
supply 
Ethiopia's 
needs 
(a 
country 
about 
100 
times 
larger 
in 
population 
according 
to 
the 
World 
Development 
Social 
Indicators 
Database). 
The 
prevalence 
rate 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
the 
adult 
population 
of 
Ethiopia 
is 
11 
percent 
(end 
1999). 
Djibouti 
is 
therefore 
highly 
susceptible 
to 
the 
spread 
of 
HIVIAIDS 
through 
the transport 
sector, 
and 
the 
disease 
is 
likely 
to 
spread 
to 
the 
whole 
subregion 
along 
the 
truck 
routes. 
In 
addition, 
taking 
into 
account 
that the 
city 
of 
Djibouti 
is 
a 
gravitational 
center 
for 
trade 
as 
well 
as 
the 
location 
of 
French 
military 
bases, 
prostitution 
is 
highly 
prevalent.  Another factor 
contributing 
to 
the spread 
of 
the 
epidemic, 
STIs 
are 
frequent, 
with 
the 
number 
of 
infections 
being 
estimated  at 
25,000 
per 
year. 
The 
population 
is 
young, 
and 
the 
age 
for 
first 
sexual contact 
is 
precocious. 
Finally, 
condoms 
are 
not 
readily 
available and 
are 
expensive. 
Migration: 
The situation 
is 
further 
complicated 
by 
the 
large 
influx 
of 
refugees 
and displaced 
persons. 
Cooperation 
with 
neighbors,  such 
as 
Ethiopia, 
Somalia, 
and  Eritrea, 
in 
assessing 
prevalence 
rates, 
in 
providing 
voluntary 
testing 
and  counseling, 
in 
formulating 
consistent 
behavioral 
change 
communication 
messages, 
and 
in 
treating 
TB, 
is 
a 
strategic 
option 
that 
Djibouti 
and 
its 
neighbors 
need 
to 
explore 
to 
mutual 
benefit. 
This 
could 
be 
done 
through 
the 
Hom 
of 
Africa 
Regional 
HIV/AIDS 
project, 
which 
is 
being 
developed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
MAP2, 
possibly 
in 
partnership 
with 
the 
Intergovernmental 
Authority 
on 
Development 
(IGAD), 
a 
regional 
development 
organization 
comprising 
seven 
countries 
(Djibouti, 
Ethiopia, 
Kenya, 
Somalia, 
Sudan, 
and Uganda) based 
in 
Djibouti. 
Such 
discussions 
could 
also 
be 
carried out through 
NGOs 
functioning 
inter-regionally, 
such 
as 
Save 
the 
Children, a 
US-NGO 
financed 
by 
USAID-Ethiopia 
that 
has 
carried out 
a 
Knowledge, 
Attitudes, 
Beliefs, 
and  Practices 
(KAl3P) 
survey 
on 
the 
DjiboutiIAddis 
Ababa 
corridor. 
Gender 
Inequality: 
Women 
are 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
segment 
of 
the 
Djiboutian 
society. 
Economically, women 
have 
low 
participation 
rates, 
and 
low 
levels 
of 
education. 
(In 
the 20-29 
age 
range, 
60 
percent 
of 
women,  compared 
to 
30 
percent 
of 
men, 
have 
never 
attended school.) 
In 
terms 
of 
health, 
matemal 
mortality 
is 
740 
per 
100,000 
births 
(according 
to 
estimates 
of 
the 
Safe 
Motherhood 
project 
financed 
by 
UNFPA), 
one 
of 
the 
highest 
rates 
in 
the 
world. 
This 
is 
due 
to 
high 
fertility 
rates, 
anemia caused 
by 
malnutrition, 
and 
the 
widespread 
practice 
of 
female 
genital 
cutting 
(FGC). 
About 
99 percent 
of 
women 
have 
been 
subjected 
to 
FGC 
(mostly infibulation, 
i.e., 
the 
most 
extreme 
type 
of 
female 
genital 
cutting), 
which 
tends 
to 
lead 
to 
other 
health 
problems. 
A 
law 
prohibiting 
the 
practice 
was adopted 
in 
1995, 
but 
the 
private 
nature 
of 
the procedure makes 
it 
difficult 
to 
enforce. 
UNICEF, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
CARITAS 
(a 
Catholic charity 
NGO), 
and 
UNFPA 
jointly 
initiated 
a 
project 
to 
reduce 
FGC 
in 
1999. 
A 
multi-institutional 
professional 
team 
-6- 
Page  13
conducted 
awareness 
meetings 
with 
a 
number 
of 
decision-makers. 
In 
addition,  sensitization 
meetings were conducted 
with 
religious 
leaders 
to 
address 
the 
problem 
of 
FGC 
and 
to 
identify 
ways 
to 
limit 
and/or  eradicate 
it. 
The 
project 
approach, 
which 
emphasizes gender 
as 
a 
key 
issue, 
is 
consistent 
with 
one 
of 
the 
key 
levers 
of 
IDA's 
regional 
strategy. 
Government 
response 
to 
HIVIAIDS 
In 
the 
early 
1990s, 
some 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
activities 
- 
mostly 
IEC 
activities 
- 
took 
place 
when 
financing 
from 
the 
Global 
Program 
for 
AIDS 
(GPA) 
was available. 
However, 
since 
the 
end 
of 
the 
GPA, 
the 
National 
AIDS 
Control 
Program 
(NACP) 
has 
been 
dormant. 
In 
2001, 
the 
Government 
of 
Djibouti 
carried  out 
a 
health 
sector 
study 
that 
was 
used 
to 
develop  the 
governmentk health 
sector 
reform 
program, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
medium-term 
plan 
for 
the 
sector's 
development. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
this 
reform 
program, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
respond 
more 
equitably 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the population, 
it 
was decided 
to 
reinvigorate 
the 
NACP 
and the 
treatment 
for 
STIs. 
In 
October 
2001, 
the 
president 
of 
the 
Republic 
himself 
endorsed the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
when 
he 
inaugurated 
the 
new 
NACP 
and 
treatment 
of 
STIs 
facility, 
which 
energized 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
About 
a 
year 
ago, 
the 
HN/AIDS 
program 
was 
reorganized: 
a 
new 
director 
was 
nominated;  the 
program 
moved 
to newly 
renovated 
offices 
(with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
French 
Cooperation); 
and 
certain 
staff 
were  trained 
in 
counseling. 
Some 
timid 
awareness 
campaigns 
were 
conducted. 
Outreach programs 
remained 
very 
limited 
and 
mainly 
involved 
some 
newly 
created 
NGOs 
in 
scattered 
activities, 
which 
were, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
conducted 
in 
the 
context 
of 
International 
AIDS 
day 
in 
December 
2001 
and 
2002. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Social 
Affairs 
and 
Promotion 
of 
Women 
is 
carrying 
out 
some 
HIV/AIDS 
IEC 
activities. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Defense 
distributes 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
condoms. 
During 
the 
appraisal 
of 
the 
Health 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
(HSDP), 
in 
May 
2002, 
HIV/AIDS 
was 
identified 
as 
an 
emergency  situation; 
and 
the 
government, 
through 
the 
president and the 
minister 
of 
Health, 
who 
strongly and 
publicly back 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
subsequently 
requested 
IDA's 
assistance 
to 
address 
the 
problem. 
A 
National 
HIV/AIDS 
Strategic plan, 
using 
a 
participative 
approach, 
was 
initiated. 
The 
Plan 
was 
completed and 
approved 
during 
a 
consensus 
seminar 
in 
December 
2002. 
The 
government 
recently 
created 
an Interministerial Committee 
against 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and 
TB 
(IC), 
as 
required 
in 
its 
National 
HIV/AIDS 
Strategic Plan, 
which 
will 
have 
a 
policy role 
(see 
section 
C4 
on 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
more 
details), 
and 
a 
Technical  Interministerial 
Committee 
(TIC), 
which 
will 
be 
the 
technical 
arm 
of 
the 
IC, 
to 
manage  the 
response 
to 
HIV/AIDS. 
These 
two 
entities 
are 
to 
be 
assisted 
by 
an Executive 
Secretariat 
(ES). 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health hired 
a 
consulting 
firm 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
National 
HIV/AIDS 
Strategic Plan. 
The 
prevalence 
surveys 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation 
provide 
baseline 
data 
for 
the  general 
population, 
STI 
patients, 
military 
personnel, 
and CSWs. 
The 
prevalence 
surveys 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
identify 
the 
Priority 
Vulnerable 
Groups 
(PVG). 
Also 
during 
project 
preparation, 
KABP 
studies 
were 
carried out  among 
the 
general 
population,  school  children, 
military 
personnel, 
and 
dockers 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
survey 
being 
carried 
out 
by 
Save 
the 
Children 
mentioned 
above. 
UNICEF 
is 
implementing 
a 
Mother-to-Child 
Transmission 
(MTCT) 
pilot 
program 
which 
started at 
the 
end 
of 
March 
2003. 
The 
UNAIDS 
Thematic Group 
has 
also 
been 
reinvigorated. 
It 
has 
prepared 
a 
work 
plan 
that made 
it 
possible 
to 
coordinate activities 
while 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Plan 
was 
being 
developed, 
and 
the 
coordinating 
bodies were 
being 
created 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
duplication. 
During 
the 
identification 
mission, 
it 
was decided that 
all 
documents 
and 
minutes produced 
by 
the 
Thematic 
Group 
would 
be 
sent 
to 
IDA, 
which 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
"virtuall'  member 
of 
the  Thematic 
Group, 
because 
the 
World 
Bank 
Group 
does 
not 
have 
a 
Country 
Office 
in 
Djibouti. 
In 
addition, 
the Thematic 
Group 
is 
informed 
of 
all 
visits 
planned 
by 
the 
country director or 
the 
sector 
director. 
The  country 
director 
and 
sector 
director 
will 
be 
informed 
of 
the 
planned 
Thematic 
Group 
meeting 
dates 
so 
that 
they 
may 
participate 
in 
the 
meetings  whenever  possible 
in 
order 
to 
raise  the 
level 
of 
attention 
among 
donors 
and 
UN 
-7- 
Page  14
agencies. 
Whenever 
the 
IDA 
mission 
comes 
to 
Djibouti, 
the 
Thematic 
Group 
organizes meetings; 
and 
there 
is 
regular communication between the 
president 
of 
the Thematic 
Group 
(the 
UNICEF 
resident 
representative) 
and the 
team. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
institutional 
structure 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis, 
the 
mandate 
of 
the 
National 
Program 
for 
AIDS 
Control 
(NPAC) 
changed. 
The 
NPAC 
has 
been renamed 
the 
Program 
for 
AIDS 
Control 
(PLS). 
The 
PLS 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH) 
will 
limit 
its 
coordinating 
and planning 
role to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
A 
new 
director 
has 
been 
nominated, 
and 
a 
new 
organigram 
for 
the 
PLS 
has 
been 
developed. 
The 
mandate 
of 
the 
Center 
Yonis 
Toussaint 
has 
also 
been 
redefined. 
It 
will 
be 
a 
reference 
center 
for 
ambulatory 
treatment 
of 
STIs  and 
of 
opportunistic 
diseases, 
and 
later, 
when 
the 
ARV 
pilot 
program 
is 
put 
in 
place, 
as 
an 
Ambulatory 
Treatment 
Center 
for 
the 
MOH. 
New 
job 
descriptions 
are 
being 
prepared, 
and 
the 
MOH 
is 
planning 
to 
staff 
the 
Center 
so 
that 
it 
is 
completely functional 
when 
the 
project 
becomes 
effective. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
basic 
issue 
is 
how 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and 
tuberculosis, 
in 
a 
multisectoral 
manner. 
With 
regard 
to 
HIVIAIDS, 
the 
Multicountry 
HIV/AIDS 
Program 
for 
the 
Africa 
Region 
(MAP) 
provides 
the 
requisite 
framework 
and 
is 
the concept 
upon which 
is 
based 
the 
Djibouti 
HIVIAIDS, 
Malaria 
and 
Tuberculosis 
Control 
Project. 
Djibouti 
is 
eligible 
for 
MAP 
funding, 
because 
it 
has 
satisfied the 
four 
MAP 
eligibility 
criteria, 
namely: 
Satisfactory 
evidence 
of 
a 
strategic 
approach 
to 
HIVIAIDS. 
Djibouti 
has 
the 
basic 
ingredients 
for 
a  strategic 
approach 
with 
which 
to 
build 
upon, 
including 
a 
situation 
analysis 
and 
an 
HIV/AIDS 
strategic 
plan. 
These 
have 
been prepared 
through 
a 
participatory 
process. 
A 
high-level 
HIV/AIDS 
coordinating 
body. 
The 
Interministerial  Committee 
(IC) 
was 
established 
under 
the 
presidency 
of 
the 
prime 
minister. 
The vice 
president 
is 
the minister 
of 
Health. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
the 
Interministerial Committee 
includes eleven 
ministries: 
National 
Education; 
Economy, 
Finance 
and 
Plan; 
Interior  and 
Decentralization; 
Defense;  Justice 
and Penitentiary 
and 
Religious 
Affairs; 
Ministry 
of 
Wakfs 
and 
Islamic 
Affairs; 
Employment 
and 
Solidarity; 
Equipment and 
Transport; 
Communication,  Telecommunications 
and 
Culture; 
Women 
Promotion 
Social 
Affairs 
and 
Family 
Welfare; 
and 
Youth 
and 
Sport. 
The 
IC 
will 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
set 
national policies 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis, 
and 
will 
stimulate 
the 
multisectoral 
approach. 
A 
Technical 
Intersectoral 
Committee 
(TIC) 
was 
established, 
and 
it 
includes 
civil 
society, 
as 
well 
as 
representatives 
of 
the 
IC 
ministries. 
The 
TIC 
will 
have 
a 
technical 
role, 
and 
the 
responsibility, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
ES, 
to 
review 
the annual 
work 
plans 
and 
budgets 
and 
to 
ensure 
that they 
are 
implemented 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Plan. 
In 
addition, 
the 
ES 
will 
have the 
responsibility 
to 
manage 
the 
project 
(see 
below, section 
C4 
“Institutional 
Arrangements”). 
Government 
agreement 
to 
use 
appropriate implementation 
arrangements. 
The 
govemment 
has 
indicated, 
in 
principle, 
its 
willingness 
to 
accelerate 
project implementation 
by 
channeling 
funds 
to 
communities, 
civil 
society, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
Government 
agreement 
to 
use 
and 
fund 
multiple 
implementation 
agencies. 
The 
govemment 
has agreed 
to 
progressively expand 
HIV/AIDS 
activities 
to 
cover 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
ministries, 
districts, 
and 
local 
entities 
as 
well 
as 
to 
fund 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
nongovernmental 
organizations, 
community-based 
organizations, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
as 
capacities 
are 
being 
strengthened 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
created.

Other 
sector issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Weak 
institutional 
capacity 
and 
limited 
partnership 
with 
civil 
society. 
The 
intensification 
of 
the 
prevention 
effort 
and  the 
introduction 
of 
care 
will 
require  significant 
strengthening 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
concerned 
institutions, 
services, 
and 
systems, 
notably: 
Systems 
and 
procedures 
to 
channel 
funds 
more efficiently 
and 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
to 
the 
grassroots 
level. 
Developing 
capacity 
at  the 
district 
level 
through 
accelerated 
training 
of 
health 
personnel 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
Voluntary 
Counseling and Testing 
(VCT) 
(especially 
for 
pregnant 
women), 
treatment 
of 
opportunistic 
infections 
(01) 
and 
STIs, 
and 
procedures 
to 
ensure 
safe 
blood 
supplies 
and 
the 
safe 
handling 
of 
medical 
waste. 
Partnerships 
within 
the 
civil 
society 
to 
strengthen 
and 
develop 
local 
capacity 
to 
deliver prevention 
and 
care. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation, 
which 
will 
become 
more 
complex 
as 
a 
result 
of 
greater 
grassroots 
involvement. 
Procurement 
of 
drugs, 
testing 
kits, 
and related 
services 
to 
ensure 
that 
district 
services 
are 
supplied 
efficiently 
and 
on 
time. 
Assessing the 
feasibility 
of 
a 
social 
marketing 
program. 
Training 
of 
multilevel 
health 
services. 
Prevention 
at 
the 
grassroot 
level. 
Although 
there 
is 
now 
broad 
agreement 
on 
prevention 
as 
a 
national priority, 
much 
work 
is 
still 
to 
be 
done, 
particularly 
with 
regard 
to: 
Youth 
(aged 
15-19) 
must 
be 
educated about 
the 
means 
of 
disease 
transmission and 
protection, 
and 
encouraged 
to 
postpone 
first 
sexual 
contacts. 
This 
gropp 
must 
be 
reached 
in 
the 
last 
years 
of 
primary 
school, 
before 
sexual 
activity 
begins. 
Truck 
drivers  and 
dockers 
(Ethiopia-Djibouti  corridor 
personnel), 
who 
are 
major 
carriers 
and 
spreaders 
of 
the 
disease. 
Specific activities 
need 
to 
be 
set 
up 
at 
all 
major 
truck 
stops 
and 
in 
the 
port. 
CSWs 
and 
high 
HIV-prevalence 
women 
who 
work 
in 
bars, 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
peer 
education, 
special 
STI/HIV  prevention 
measures, 
and 
condoms 
(free 
and/or 
at 
the 
least 
possible 
cost). 
Persons 
in 
uniform 
need 
to 
be  informed 
about 
prevention  and 
have 
condoms 
available 
at 
all 
times. 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
decentralize 
TB 
screening 
to 
treat patients 
in 
the 
districts 
and 
periphery 
near 
country 
borders 
and 
to 
avoid 
a  greater 
influx 
of 
TB 
patients 
into 
Djibouti-Ville.  This 
measure 
should 
decrease 
the 
risk 
of 
infection to 
the 
Djiboutian 
population. 
As 
mentioned 
in 
section 
B2, malaria 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
mainly 
caused 
by 
human 
factors: 
urbanization 
and 
settlement 
of 
nomads. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
involve 
communities 
in 
malaria control 
in 
order that they 
improve 
their 
environment, 
protect 
themselves, 
and 
control 
the 
vector. 
Health 
sector 
issues. 
The 
current 
health 
system 
needs a 
significant 
input 
of 
human 
and 
financial 
resources 
to 
ensure 
the 
provision 
of 
services 
and 
drugs 
on 
a 
regular 
basis at 
the 
national level. 
However, 
many 
of 
the 
issues 
concerning 
the 
health 
sector are 
being 
addressed 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
HSDP 
mentioned 
above. 
In 
February 
2002, a 
Round 
Table 
was 
held 
in 
Djibouti-Ville 
and 
development 
partners. 
Significant financial 
resources 
have been 
pledged 
in 
support 
of 
the 
health 
-9- 
Page  16
sector, 
comprising 
allocations 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and 
tuberculosis. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
HSDP, 
financed 
by 
IDA 
and effective 
since 
November 
2002, 
provides 
support 
to 
the 
pharmaceutical 
sector, 
by 
establishing 
a 
Centrale 
d'Achats 
pour 
les MCdicaments 
et 
MatCriels 
Essentiels 
(CAMME), 
to 
the 
reproductive health 
system 
(including  the  reduction 
of 
female 
genital 
cutting), 
to 
the 
Integrated Management 
of 
Childhood 
Illnesses 
(IMCI) 
Program, 
and 
to 
training 
of 
healthcare personnel. 
Its 
specific  objectives 
are 
to: 
(i) 
improve 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
services 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
low 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
the 
poor 
management 
of 
healthcare 
facilities; 
(ii) 
address 
emergency 
drug 
needs 
as 
well 
as 
long-term 
drug 
supply 
to 
remedy 
the 
existing 
shortage 
of 
drugs 
in 
health facilities 
and 
the 
current 
high 
cost 
of 
drugs 
in 
the 
private 
sector; 
(iii) 
support 
malaria 
programs 
given 
the 
resurgence 
of 
malaria 
in 
the country; 
(iv) 
support 
vaccination programs suffering 
from 
inadequate 
resources; 
(v) 
increase 
the capacity 
to 
train 
more 
para-medics 
by 
strengthening 
the 
national 
health training 
center 
to 
provide 
up-to-date 
and quality 
training, 
and 
(vi) 
support 
the 
ministry's 
capacity 
to monitor 
health 
conditions 
and 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
reform 
program, 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
sound 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
procedures. 
It 
should 
be 
underlined 
that 
for 
the 
present 
project 
to 
be 
effective, 
it 
is 
essential 
that the 
HSDP 
be 
carried 
out 
and that 
services 
and 
medical 
supplies 
to 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
sector 
be 
made 
readily 
available. There 
are 
numerous 
links 
between the 
two 
projects. 
The 
HSDP 
is 
presently 
buying 
a 
one-year 
STI 
drug 
supply 
to 
be 
used 
in 
the  context 
of 
the 
STI 
subcomponent 
of 
the 
present 
project, 
i.e., 
these 
drugs 
will 
be 
available 
when 
the 
project 
becomes 
effective. 
In 
addition, 
included 
in 
the emergency 
drug 
procurement, 
are 
needed 
drugs, 
including 
drugs 
for 
the treatment 
of 
01s 
and 
ARV, 
for 
the 
AIDS 
global 
treatment 
pilot 
project 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place 
when 
the project 
becomes 
effective. 
Finally, 
in 
the pharmaceutical 
sector, 
the 
CAMME 
will 
have 
a 
critical role 
to 
play 
to 
ensure 
that 
drugs 
are 
available 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
for 
the 
present 
project 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
HSDP 
to 
function. 
Some 
malaria-related 
activities 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
HSDP, 
because 
they 
needed 
immediate 
financing; 
but 
the 
second-year 
activities and 
onward 
will 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
present 
project 
once 
it 
becomes 
effective. 
As 
mentioned 
earlier, 
one 
of 
the 
main 
goals 
of 
the 
MAP 
projects 
is 
to 
reinforce 
capacities. 
It 
is 
expected 
that the 
National 
Training 
Center, 
being 
strengthened 
under the HSDP, 
will 
play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
the 
project's 
capacity-building 
activities. 
The 
creation 
of 
new 
courses 
of 
studies, 
such 
as 
counseling, 
and 
the 
proper 
use 
of 
ARVs, 
are 
being 
envisaged 
in 
two 
to 
three 
years 
once the center 
is 
fully 
functioning. 
C. 
Project 
Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
a 
detailed description and 
Annex 
3 
for 
a 
detailed 
cost 
breakdown): 
The 
project 
will 
support the 
implementation 
of 
Djibouti's 
HN/AIDS 
National 
Strategic Plan, the 
National Malaria 
Strategic 
Plan, 
and 
the 
National 
Tuberculosis 
Strategic 
Plan through 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
public 
sector agencies, 
private and 
non-governmental 
organizations, 
and 
community- 
based organizations. 
The 
project 
will 
include 
four 
major 
components 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
capacity 
building 
and 
policy 
development; 
(2) 
public 
health 
sector 
responses 
to 
HNIAIDS, 
management 
including 
prevention, 
treatment, 
and 
care 
of 
STIs 
and 
TB, 
and prevention, 
control and 
treatment 
of 
malaria; 
(3) 
multisector 
response 
to HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
and 
care; 
and 
(4) 
support 
to 
community-based 
initiatives 
for 
the three 
diseases. 
These 
activities 
will 
take 
into 
account 
the 
existing 
conditions and 
Djibouti's 
capacity 
both 
at 
the 
central 
and 
the 
district 
levels, 
recognizing 
that 
at 
present 
capacity 
is 
weak at 
both 
levels. 
Presented 
below 
are 
the 
main 
subcomponents 
of 
each 
component 
(for more 
details, 
see 
Annex 
2). 
Component 
1. 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Policy 
Development 
(total 
cost 
US$4.9 
million) 
This 
component 
would 
aim 
at  strengthening 
Djibouti's 
capacity 
to 
control 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
by 
supporting: 
(i) 
the 
work 
of 
the 
IC, 
the 
TIC, 
and 
the 
- 
10- 
Page  17
ES,including 
project 
coordination and 
facilitation; 
(ii) 
the 
updating 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic Plans 
(for 
each 
of 
the three 
diseases) 
and 
annual 
action 
plans; 
and 
(iii) 
strengthening 
of 
public, 
private, 
and 
nongovemmental institutions 
in 
preparing and 
implementing 
prevention, 
care, 
and 
treatment 
interventions. 
Human 
resources 
are 
very 
limited 
both 
in 
number 
and 
in 
quality. 
The 
acute shortage 
of 
human 
resources 
remains 
the 
most 
important 
constraint 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
project. 
For 
instance 
in 
the 
MOH 
the 
number 
of 
qualified 
persons 
is 
not 
only 
limited 
but 
most 
are already 
engaged 
in 
the 
launching 
of 
the 
HSDP 
and/or 
in 
implementing 
the 
ministry’s 
programs. 
In 
order 
to 
address 
this 
problem, 
it 
has 
been 
agreed 
with 
the 
government 
that: 
(a) 
some tasks 
would 
be 
contracted 
out 
(Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation); 
(b) 
some 
Djiboutian 
experts 
will 
be 
recruited 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
competitive 
process 
and 
hired 
with 
one-year 
contracts 
renewable 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
performance; 
(c) 
training 
will 
be 
organized, 
in 
particular, 
for 
specialized 
tasks 
and 
for 
NGOs 
and 
community- 
based 
organizations 
(CBOs) 
before they 
are 
awarded 
financing 
to 
implement 
a 
project;  and 
(d) 
two 
long-term international 
technical 
assistants 
(a 
procurementhmplementation 
specialist 
and 
a 
social 
communication 
expert) 
and 
some 
short-term 
experts 
for 
specialized 
tasks 
(for 
example, 
training 
in 
counseling 
or 
development 
of 
a 
condom distribution 
strategy) 
will 
be 
recruited. 
All 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
of 
the 
technical 
assistants 
specify that 
one 
of 
their 
tasks 
is 
to 
transfer 
competencies. 
Each 
technical 
assistant 
(TA) 
will 
have 
an 
official 
counterpart 
named 
or 
recruited 
by 
the 
Djiboutian 
authorities. 
This 
component 
will 
also 
include training 
activities, under contract 
with 
local 
institutions, 
for 
the 
NGOs 
and governmental 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
supervising 
and 
training local 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
and 
for 
the 
ministries’ 
PLS 
unit, 
local 
NGOs, 
and 
associations 
implementing 
activities. 
Some 
study 
tours 
may 
be 
included 
as 
part 
of 
this 
training 
as 
well 
as 
for 
selected 
members 
of 
the 
IC, 
TIC, 
and 
ES. 
Finally, 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
reference 
laboratory 
at  the 
Peltier 
General  Hospital,  and 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
building 
next 
to 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
AIDS 
Control Program 
of 
the 
MOH 
and 
the 
Center 
Yonis 
Toussaint, 
will 
be 
included 
in 
this 
component. 
The 
laboratory 
equipment 
is 
being 
financed under the 
HSDP, 
but 
the 
laboratory 
building 
itself 
is 
presently 
located 
in 
unsafe 
or 
temporary 
buildings 
that 
need 
to 
be 
replaced 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
The 
rehabilitation 
work 
being 
envisaged 
will 
provide 
space 
for 
expanding the 
role 
of 
Yonis 
Toussaint 
Center 
as 
a 
reference 
center 
for 
counseling, 
voluntary 
testing, 
and 
care 
and 
treatment 
of 
sero-positive 
persons. 
It 
will 
also 
provide 
a 
space 
where 
information 
is 
available 
and 
where 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
can 
meet. 
This 
will 
be 
one 
of 
the 
centers 
in 
the 
AIDS 
treatment 
pilot 
project 
included 
in 
the 
public 
health 
component 
(see 
next 
section 
and 
Annex 
2 
for more 
details). 
Component 
2. 
Public 
Health 
Sector 
Response 
to 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs, 
Malaria 
and 
Tuberculosis 
(total 
cost 
US$3.8 
million) 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH) 
and 
more  broadly 
the 
health 
community, 
have 
special 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
prevention 
and 
management 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs, 
malaria, 
and 
opportunistic 
infections 
(malaria 
and 
TB). 
This 
sector 
therefore 
warrants 
a 
separate 
component, 
to 
provide 
prevention, 
care, 
and 
treatment 
from 
a 
health 
sector 
perspective. 
This 
component 
will 
aim 
at 
expanding 
access 
to 
preventive 
measures 
such 
as 
condoms; 
to 
treatment 
of 
STIs, 
OIs, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis; 
and 
to 
care, 
support, 
and 
treat People 
Living 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA) 
in 
Djibouti. 
In 
addition, 
a 
subcomponent’s 
objective 
is 
to 
increase 
clinical 
safety 
and 
to 
ameliorate 
the 
treatment 
of 
solid medical 
waste.

Under 
this 
component,  the 
project 
will 
include: 
(a) 
development 
of 
Voluntary 
Counseling and 
Testing 
(VCT) 
protocols 
as 
well 
as 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
training 
counselors 
and 
in 
carrying out 
VCT 
activities 
and follow-up; 
(b) 
implementation 
of 
syndromic algorithms 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
case 
management 
of 
STIs; 
(c) 
strengthening 
of 
the 
health 
system 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs, 
malaria, 
and 
OIs, 
in 
particular 
TB; 
(d) 
setting 
up 
measures 
to 
prevent 
the transmission 
of 
the 
HIV 
in 
clinical 
settings; 
(e) 
procurement 
of 
condoms 
and 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
their 
distribution; 
(f) 
scaling-up 
of 
activities 
targeting vulnerable/potentially 
high-transmitter 
groups 
in 
collaboration 
with 
other 
sector  partners; 
(g) 
support 
to 
the  decentralization 
program 
for 
TB 
screening 
and 
treatment; 
(h) 
strengthening 
of 
the 
detection, 
prevention, 
and 
response 
to 
malaria; 
and 
(i) 
financing 
drugs, 
test 
kits, 
and 
medical 
consumables, 
all 
of 
which 
may 
be 
bought 
from 
the 
CAMME 
once 
it 
is 
established. 
It 
was  also 
decided that 
WHO 
would 
enter 
into 
a 
partnership 
agreement 
with 
the 
ES to 
supervise 
some 
of 
the  above-mentioned 
activities, 
which 
will 
be 
discussed 
in 
detail 
with 
the 
MOH, 
the 
ES, 
and 
the government, 
during 
the 
post-appraisal 
mission 
of 
May 
2003. 
The 
Bank 
has  also 
been 
working 
closely 
with 
its 
UNAIDS 
partners, 
drug 
companies, 
and 
developing-country 
governments 
on 
access 
to 
ARV 
therapy. 
This 
is 
an 
evolving 
situation 
that 
progressively 
allows for 
low-cost 
choices 
and 
alternative options. 
The 
project 
intends 
to 
support 
the  development 
of 
guidelines 
and 
the  strengthening 
of 
health 
infrastructure 
to 
allow 
ARV 
therapy 
drugs 
to 
be 
used 
in 
a 
safe, 
effective, 
and 
sustainable 
manner. 
It 
will 
assist 
the 
MOH, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
other  partners 
(e.g., 
the 
French 
Cooperation, 
WHO, 
and 
UNICEF) 
in 
implementing 
a 
one-year 
pilot 
project, 
including 
the  treatment 
with 
ARV 
of 
sero-positive 
persons, 
in 
the 
three 
public 
health 
systems 
of 
the 
country 
(Ministry 
of 
Health, 
Ministry 
of 
Defense, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
EmploymentlOuganisme 
de 
Protection 
Sociale 
[OPS]). 
This 
pilot 
project 
will 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
the feasibility and 
cost 
of 
extending the 
treatment 
program 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
The 
drugs 
for 
the 
pilot 
project 
are 
being 
included 
in 
the 
first 
purchase 
procured 
under 
the 
HSDP. 
Moreover,  the Government 
of 
Djibouti 
is 
now 
eligible 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
Global 
Fund 
and 
is 
preparing 
a 
proposal 
for 
the 
next 
round. 
It 
is 
hoped 
that 
in 
the 
future, 
at 
least 
part 
of 
the 
drugs 
for 
the 
program 
can 
be 
bought 
with 
Global 
Fund 
financing. 
The 
prevention 
of 
mother-to-child 
transmission 
(PMTCT) 
of 
HIV 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
project, 
because 
UNICEF 
is 
presently  establishing 
a 
PMTCT 
pilot 
program 
in 
two 
Djiboutian 
health 
centers 
(one 
in 
a 
public 
maternity 
center 
and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
Maternal 
Child 
Health (MCH) 
Center 
of 
OPS). 
As 
the 
pilot 
program 
may 
be 
scaled 
up, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
training 
of 
counselors 
and 
to 
providing 
artificial 
milk 
for 
mothers 
who 
decide 
not to 
breast-feed, 
as 
well 
as 
psycho-social 
support. 
Finally, regarding 
condoms, 
a 
consultant 
may 
be 
recruited 
either under the 
PPF 
or 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
project 
launch, 
to 
develop 
a 
condom distribution 
strategy. 
Condoms 
will 
be 
provided 
free 
of 
charge 
to 
STI 
patients, 
but 
condoms 
also 
must 
be 
made available 
outside 
of 
the 
health 
system 
as 
needed 
(based 
on 
the 
strategy developed). 
Component 
3. 
Multisector 
Responses 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
Prevention 
and 
Care 
(total 
cost 
US$3.7 
million) 
As 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
in 
other 
countries, 
and 
in 
order 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
to 
be 
effective, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
multisectoral 
approach 
to 
better target 
Priority 
Vulnerable 
Groups. 
Although 
the 
multisectoral 
response 
is 
presently 
very 
limited, 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Social 
Affairs 
and 
Women 
Promotion, 
and 
Defense, 
already 
carry 
out 
some 
IEC 
and  condom 
distribution 
activities. 
The 
project 
will 
reinforce on-going activities and 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
following key 
ministries 
outside 
of 
the 
MOH: 
the 
ministries 
of 
(a) 
Economy, 
Finances, 
and 
- 
12- 
Page  19
Planning, 
(b) 
Youth 
and 
Sport, 
(c) 
National 
Education, 
Women 
Promotion, 
(d) 
Social 
Affairs 
and 
Family 
Welfare, 
(e) 
Defense 
(army), 
(0 
Employment 
and 
National 
Solidarity, 
(g) 
Communication, Telecommunication and 
Culture, 
(h) 
Justice, 
Penitentiary, 
and 
Religious 
Affairs, 
(i) 
Ministry 
of 
Wakfs 
and 
Islamic Affairs, 
6) 
Interior 
and Decentralization 
(police), 
and 
(k) 
Equipment 
and 
Transport. 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
these 
ministries 
with 
resources 
and 
training to improve 
their 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic, emphasizing 
prevention 
and 
care. 
Most 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
ministries 
are 
finalizing 
their action 
plans, 
which 
include 
performance 
indicators and define 
monitoring 
systems 
and 
budgets. 
The action 
plans 
are 
targeted 
at 
line 
ministry 
staff 
and focus 
on 
training 
peer 
educators 
on 
issues 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs, 
the 
importance 
of 
condoms 
in 
the 
control 
of 
these 
diseases, 
including 
other support 
mechanisms 
to 
encourage  a  change 
in 
behavior. 
These 
plans 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
ministries' ongoing 
operations. 
At 
this 
point, 
there 
are 
no 
plans 
for 
the 
project 
to 
assist 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Transport, 
because 
Save 
the Children, 
financed 
by 
USAID/Ethiopia, 
is 
providing 
such support 
and 
could 
also 
receive 
additional 
support 
through 
the 
Regional  Project 
for 
the 
Horn 
of 
Africa 
being 
developed 
by 
ActAfrica 
in 
the context 
of 
the 
MAP2. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Communication 
will 
have 
a 
special 
role 
to 
play: 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the project, 
it 
will 
assist 
the 
international 
specialist 
and 
the 
Djiboutian 
counterpart 
in 
communication  and 
in 
developing 
a 
national 
communication 
strategy 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HN/AIDS, 
Malaria 
and Tuberculosis. 
At 
this 
stage, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communication's 
role 
in 
the 
strategy 
will 
be 
defined. 
At 
a 
later 
stage, 
it 
is 
expected 
that the 
Ministry 
of 
Communication 
will 
disseminate 
audio-visual  and 
written 
materials prepared 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
communication 
strategy. 
The 
preparation 
of 
these 
materials 
will 
be 
contracted 
out. 
Activities 
in 
the 
ministries 
will 
be 
financed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
annual 
work 
plan 
and budget. 
The 
ministries 
will 
receive 
a 
first 
tranche 
which 
it 
will 
have 
to 
justify 
in 
order 
to 
receive the 
second 
tranche. 
The 
administrative 
and 
financial 
manager 
of 
each 
ministry, 
who 
will 
manage 
these 
funds, 
will 
receive 
training 
if 
necessary. 
Component 
4. 
Support to 
community-based initiatives (total 
cost 
US2.6 
million) 
In 
order 
to 
enlist communities 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
to provide them 
with 
the 
means 
to 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
epidemic, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
provide 
resources 
at the 
local 
level. 
The 
objectives 
of 
this 
component 
are 
to: 
(a) 
strengthen 
communities 
and 
Djiboutian 
associations 
and 
NGOs 
so 
that 
they 
can 
implement 
essential 
activities 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
vulnerability to 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis; 
and 
(b) 
strengthen 
institutional 
capacities 
of 
Djiboutian 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
so 
that 
they 
can 
deliver 
essential services 
needed 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Project 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
community 
interventions 
are 
complementary and 
in 
synergy 
with 
interventions 
carried out 
by 
governmental 
services 
and 
other 
potential 
partners. 
In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
this 
component 
takes 
into 
account 
Djiboutian 
realities, 
a 
pilot 
project 
will 
be 
developed, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
an 
NGO, 
to 
provide nutritional 
support 
to 
PLWHA 
in 
Djibouti-Ville 
and 
the 
Hospital Paul 
Faure 
(TB 
Hospital). 
This 
will 
be 
done 
during 
the  preparation 
phase 
of 
the 
project 
so 
as 
to 
fine 
tune 
the  mechanisms 
of 
interventions 
and define 
an 
acceptable 
and 
reasonably 
priced 
social package 
(which could 
also 
include 
assistance 
for 
disabled 
HN/AIDS 
persons). 
Essential activities 
identified 
for 
community 
interventions can 
be 
classified 
in 
three categories: 
(i) 
prevention 
of 
HIV, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis  transmission; 
(ii) 
reduction 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
(including 
psycho-medico-social 
support 
and 
care 
to 
PLWHA 
and 
their 
families; 
social/economic 
support, 
including 
food, 
to 
PLWHA 
and their 
families; 
and 
income-generating 
activities 
for 
the 
families 
of 
PLWHA); 
and 
(iii) 
legal 
support 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
more 
details 
on 
activities).

Page  20
In 
order 
to implement 
the above activities, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
project 
to 
finance 
support 
activities 
to 
strengthen the 
institutional 
capacities 
of 
the 
Djiboutian 
NGOs. 
In 
order 
to do 
so, 
NGO 
personnel 
will 
be 
trained 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
(a) 
management 
and 
development 
of 
social 
projects; 
(b) 
basic 
information 
on 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis; 
(c) 
analysis 
of 
vulnerability 
and 
identification 
of 
appropriate  solutions; 
(d) 
quality control 
for 
activities 
being 
financed 
at 
the 
community 
level; 
(e) 
mobilization 
and 
promotion 
of 
community 
participation; 
and 
(0 
supervision 
and 
evaluation 
of 
services. 
The 
modalities 
of 
this 
training 
would 
require 
prior 
government approval. 
However, 
there 
are 
options 
for 
training 
to 
be 
contracted 
out 
either 
to 
local 
institutions, 
or 
based 
on 
government 
approval, 
to 
the 
UNDP 
in 
the context 
of 
their 
2003-2006 
program, (through 
cost-sharing 
or 
other 
arrangements). 
The 
need 
for training 
and 
supervision 
of 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
was 
assessed 
during 
the 
development 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Strategic 
Plan.  Support 
to 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
the governmental and non-governmental 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
training 
and 
supervision (called 
NGO 
Supporting 
Organizations). 
The 
preparation 
team 
is 
conscious 
of 
the fact 
that even the 
capacities 
of 
these 
organizations 
will 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the training, 
an 
evaluation 
will 
identify 
the 
best 
5 
to 
10 
organizations, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
criteria defined 
during 
a 
consensus 
workshop 
on 
training and 
supervision. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
the 
ES 
will 
prepare  the  Procedures 
Manual 
for  Community 
Interventions. 
It 
will 
be 
finalized through 
a 
consensus 
workshop 
organized 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
UN 
agencies 
and 
attended 
by 
all 
ministries 
that 
are 
involved 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HN/AIDS, 
civil 
society, 
and other 
partners. 
The 
consultant 
being 
recruited 
under the 
HSDP 
to 
prepare the 
project 
Procedures 
Manual 
will 
be 
requested 
to 
prepare 
the 
Project 
Operations 
Manual 
(POM) 
(the 
Procedures 
Manual for 
Community 
Interventions 
has 
been prepared 
and 
needs 
fine 
tuning), 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
model 
elaborated 
by 
the 
ActAfrica 
team 
(to 
be 
financed under the 
PPF). 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
local 
projects 
for 
community 
interventions 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the project, 
it 
will 
be 
done 
in 
a 
realistic 
manner. 
It 
will 
prioritize 
learning and 
the 
development 
of 
capacities 
of 
the 
personnel 
involved 
as 
well 
as 
quality 
control. 
Coverage 
will 
be 
gradually 
increased. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
response 
analysis 
carried 
out 
in 
2002, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
about 
30 
community 
projects 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
2004. 
These 
projects 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
25-30 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations  assisted 
by 
5-10  supporting  organizations 
and 
by 
the 
ministry 
dealing 
with 
the 
same 
vulnerable 
groups 
and 
the 
Community 
Intervention 
Support 
Unit 
(CISU) 
of 
the 
ES. 
The 
preparation 
and 
selection 
process 
of 
community 
subprojects 
to 
be 
financed under the 
project 
will 
be an 
annual process 
carried out 
in 
each 
district 
(or 
neighborhood) under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
regional 
HIV/AIDS 
Councils. 
The 
subprojects 
will 
be 
identified 
and 
selected 
takmg 
into 
account 
the 
essential 
activities 
necessary 
to 
reduce 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
priority 
groups 
in 
each 
district 
of 
the 
country and neighborhood 
of 
Djibouti-Ville 
as 
well 
as 
governmental interventions 
identified 
in 
the 
sectoral 
plans. 
The 
implementation 
of 
these 
subprojects 
will 
be 
monitored and 
supervised at the 
central 
level 
by 
the 
CISU 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
person 
responsible 
for 
sectoral 
response 
in 
the 
ES 
and 
at 
the 
regional 
level 
with 
the supporting 
organizations, the 
HIV/AIDS 
regional 
committees, 
and 
the 
M&E 
consultant, 
who 
will 
be 
contracted 
out. 
The 
modalities 
of 
these 
arrangements are 
defined 
in 
the 
M&E 
Plan. 
Community 
project 
and supporting 
organizations’ 
contract 
financing 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
CISU 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Procedures 
Manual for Community 
Intervention, 
which 
will 
need 
to 
be 
finalized 
prior 
to 
project 
effectiveness. 
The 
mechanisms 
to 
channel 
funds 
from 
the 
CISU 
to 
communities 
was 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the 
appraisal 
mission. 
The 
selection

process 
of 
the 
projects 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
an

2. 
Key 
policy 
and institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
project 
is 
not 
designed 
to 
support 
policy reform 
in 
any 
sector. 
The 
Project 
will 
assist 
in 
carrying out 
the 
comprehensive 
National 
Strategic 
Plans 
(HIV/AIDS, 
malaria,  and tuberculosis) 
that 
will 
bring 
together, 
in 
a 
coordinated 
manner, 
various 
initiatives. 
By 
supporting the 
IC 
in 
the 
prime 
minister's 
office, 
the 
TIC, 
and 
the 
ES, 
it 
will 
encourage 
deepening 
recognition 
that 
HIV/AIDS, 
in 
particular, 
is 
a 
multisectoral,  development 
issue, 
and 
that 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
government, 
with 
an 
enhanced 
inter-ministerial 
coordination, 
have 
taken the 
lead. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
build 
up 
the 
capacity 
of 
line 
ministries and 
of 
local 
communities 
and 
allow 
them 
to 
address 
their 
developmental 
challenges, 
including 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis. 
To 
prepare and 
implement 
projects, 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
communities, 
associations, 
NGOs, 
and 
more 
generally 
civil-society 
organizations 
will 
be 
enhanced. 
3. 
Benefits 
and target 
population: 
Economic 
Bene$&: 
Preliminary 
analysis 
of 
potential 
macroeconomic impacts 
of 
the 
epidemic 
in 
Djibouti 
suggest 
that, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
policy 
interventions,  the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
will 
continue 
to 
spread 
rapidly, 
with 
devastating 
consequences 
on 
the 
size 
and composition 
of 
the 
labor 
force, 
productivity, health 
expenditures, 
and 
growth. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
would 
be 
reduced 
on 
average 
by 
1.6 
percent 
per 
year 
and  that 
HIV/AIDS-related 
expenditures 
could 
surpass 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
even under 
conservative 
assumptions 
about 
access 
to 
treatment. 
Through 
cost-effective  interventions 
and 
strong 
community 
participation,  the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
reduce 
these  costs. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
project 
will 
help 
reduce the 
number 
and frequency 
of 
sick-days 
and 
that, 
by 
increasing the 
use 
of 
community-based 
programs, 
the 
project 
would 
also 
help 
reduce 
the 
unit 
costs 
of 
caring 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
Cost 
savings 
are 
expected 
from 
the 
decrease 
in 
future 
needs 
for 
treatment, 
care, 
and 
support. 
Social 
Benefits: 
The 
entire 
population 
will 
benefit 
from 
the project. 
Care 
will 
be 
taken 
during 
project implementation 
that 
communities 
are 
not 
left 
behind, 
and, 
on 
the other 
hand, 
that 
high- 
powered 
groups 
do 
not 
receive disproportionate 
support 
from 
the 
project. 
As 
specified 
in 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Strategic  Plan, 
some 
interventions 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
those 
who 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
AIDS 
such 
as 
pregnant 
women, 
commercial 
sex 
workers, persons 
in 
uniform, 
and 
the 
young 
in 
general 
and 
orphans 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
particular. 
Because 
of 
Djibouti's 
position 
as 
a 
- 
15 
- 
Page  22
transport 
hub, 
truck 
drivers 
and 
others passing 
through 
the 
port 
and 
the 
Djibouti/Addis 
corridor 
would 
be 
targeted 
by 
specific 
interventions 
to 
help 
reduce 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
disease. 
Project 
interventions 
targeted 
to 
widows, 
women, persons 
in 
uniform, 
and 
transporters 
will 
mitigate 
the 
economic and social 
impact 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
It 
will 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
local 
communities 
to 
provide 
support 
to 
groups 
affected 
by 
HIV/AIDS. 
It 
will 
promote 
the establishment 
of 
a social 
support 
system, 
such 
as 
counseling 
services, support  groups 
for 
patients 
and 
their 
families 
or 
caregivers, 
which 
should 
help 
reduce 
the 
economic 
and 
social 
burden 
on 
the affected 
families 
(i.e., 
assisting orphans 
through 
education, 
providing 
support 
to 
community 
clinics, 
assisting 
in 
revenue-generating 
activities, 
etc.). 
It 
will 
streamline 
the 
procedures 
for 
transferring 
resources 
to 
local 
communities. 
Institutional 
Benefits: 
Capacity 
building 
of 
key 
stakeholders 
including community 
groups 
to 
coordinate, 
manage, 
and 
implement 
the 
proposed interventions. 
Development 
of 
an 
improved 
national 
system 
for monitoring 
HIV/AIDS 
that 
would 
exchange 
information 
with 
subregional 
information 
systems 
such 
as 
those 
in 
Ethiopia 
and 
Eritrea. 
Health 
Benefits: 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
to lowering 
Djibouti's 
burden 
of 
diseases 
due 
to 
infections 
such 
as 
STIs, 
malaria 
and tuberculosis 
through 
targeting 
these 
and other 
01s. 
Early 
disease 
detection and interventions  should 
help 
reduce transmission. 
The 
risk 
of 
an 
even 
higher 
child 
mortality 
rate 
will 
be 
lowered 
by 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
HIV-infected 
newborns. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The 
implementation 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
will 
follow 
general 
MAP 
guidelines, 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
IC 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
prime 
minister, 
and 
a 
TIC 
to 
be 
assisted 
by 
an 
ES. 
This 
was 
deemed 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate mechanism 
for 
implementing 
the 
project 
given 
the 
multisectoral 
nature 
of 
the 
activities 
being 
proposed, 
and 
the 
coordination efforts 
needed 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
use 
of 
funds 
and 
impact 
of 
project 
activities. 
The 
IC 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
prime 
minister, 
with 
the 
vice-presidency 
held 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Health. 
The 
IC 
serves 
as 
the 
policy 
focal 
point 
and 
will 
be 
made 
up 
of 
representatives 
from 
sectoral 
ministries. 
The 
IC 
will 
have 
responsibility 
for 
coordinating 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic Plans 
(HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis), 
increasing 
awareness 
and 
mobilizing 
civil 
society 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
prevention 
measures 
regarding 
HIV 
infection, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis, and 
providing 
guidance 
to 
the 
project.  The 
IC 
will 
meet 
at least 
twice 
a 
year. 
The 
TIC 
is 
the 
technical 
arm 
of 
the 
IC 
and 
will 
oversee 
the 
preparation 
of 
annual 
action 
plans 
and 
budgets 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
activities. 
The 
TIC 
will 
have 
responsibility 
for 
ensuring 
that 
the 
integration 
of 
activities 
(HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and tuberculosis) 
are 
executed 
in 
the 
public, 
para-public, 
and 
private 
sectors 
to 
promote 
the 
multisectoral impact 
of 
the 
actions 
being 
carried 
out, 
and 
will 
validate and 
supervise 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
multisectoral action 
plans 
and 
associated budgets 
through 
its 
executing 
arm, 
the 
ES. 
The 
TIC 
will 
meet 
at least 
four 
times 
a 
year 
and 
will 
have 
representatives 
from 
the concerned 
ministries, 
civil 
society, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
The 
TIC 
will 
need 
to 
coordinate closely 
its 
efforts 
with 
the 
UNAIDS 
Thematic 
Group. 
Project 
funds 
will 
be 
budgeted 
in 
the 
prime 
minister's 
office 
and 
delegated 
to 
the 
ES, 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
day-to-day 
implementation 
of 
the three 
National 
Strategic Plans 
(HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and  tuberculosis). 
To 
do 
so, 
the 
ES 
will 
be 
comprised 
of 
about 
ten 
full 
time 
professionals 
(including 
two 
international 
technical 
assistants); 
it 
will 
include 
an 
Administrative 
and 
Financial 
Unit 
(AFU), 
a 
Multisectoral 
Unit, 
a 
Community 
Intervention 
Support 
Unit 
(CISU), 
and a Social 
Communication 
Unit 
(SCU). 
In 
addition, 
if 
necessary, 
a 
Planning, 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Unit 
(PMEU) 
will 
be 
created. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
project, 
these 
tasks 
will 
be 
contracted 
out 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
ES. 
The 
technical 
assistance 
will 
include 
a 
specialist 
in 
procurement and 
project implementation 
for 
five 
years 
and a 
social 
communication 
specialist 
who 
will 
be 
hired 
to 
transfer competencies 
to 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
ES. 
The 
ES 
will 
be 
responsible 
for

project 
execution, 
coordination, 
follow-up, and 
monitoring 
of 
project 
interventions. 
The 
ES 
will 
coordinate 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
proposed 
action 
plans 
presented 
by 
the 
MOH 
(through the 
Public 
Hygiene 
Prevention 
Department), 
ministerial focal 
points, 
and 
the 
communities. 
The 
ES 
will 
also 
need 
to 
closely 
liaise 
with 
the 
MOH's 
Planning 
Unit, 
the 
Direction 
of 
Primary 
Health 
Care, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
national 
technical 
experts, 
who 
may 
be 
called 
upon 
to 
provide 
assistance, 
either 
as 
TAs 
or 
as 
specialist trainers. 
The 
ES 
will 
also 
need 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the Regional 
Counsels, 
who 
should 
be 
in 
place 
once 
the decentralization 
efforts 
take 
place 
early 
in 
2003. 
The 
ES 
will 
prepare 
all 
documentation 
for 
the 
TIC 
(meeting 
documents, 
minutes, 
progress 
reports 
on 
the 
national 
program, 
inter-ministerial project 
activities, 
and 
community 
interventions) and the 
IC. 
It 
is 
expected 
that the 
relationship 
between the 
new 
structure 
(IC, 
TIC, 
and 
ES) 
and 
the 
MOH 
will 
be 
satisfactory 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
(a) 
the 
MOH 
has 
been 
the architect 
of 
the 
new 
structure 
and 
has 
defended 
it 
so 
that 
it 
could be 
ratified; 
(b) 
the 
Minister 
of 
Health 
is 
the 
vice 
president 
of 
the 
IC; 
(c) 
the president 
of 
the 
TIC 
is 
the General 
Secretary 
of 
the 
MOH; 
and 
(d) 
the 
Executive 
Secretary has 
been 
selected 
among 
the 
key 
health 
civil 
servants. 
The 
organization 
still 
designates 
an important 
role 
to 
the 
MOH, 
which 
is 
closely 
involved 
in 
the 
new 
structure. 
The 
different 
stakeholders 
will 
need 
to 
prepare 
annual 
action 
plans 
with 
associated 
estimated 
budgets. 
These 
action 
plans 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
ES 
who 
will 
need 
to 
ascertain whether the 
plans 
match 
the actions 
to 
be 
undertaken under the 
National 
Strategic Plans. 
The 
CrU 
will 
play 
a 
particular 
role 
within 
the 
ES 
to 
ensure 
that the activities submitted 
by 
the 
communities 
respond 
to 
the 
targeted 
populations,  and 
fall 
within 
the predefined 
criteria 
established 
in 
the 
POM. 
The 
selection 
of 
community 
subprojects 
will 
be handled 
out 
by 
a 
tripartite committee 
(government, 
donors, 
and 
civil 
society). 
Given 
the 
shortage 
of 
existing 
capacity 
in 
the country, 
and 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
project 
that 
requires 
in-depth follow-up, 
the responsibilities 
under 
the 
PMEU 
for 
M&E 
will 
be 
subcontracted 
out, 
and part 
of 
the 
civil 
works activities 
may 
be 
subcontracted 
out to 
the Agence 
Djiboutienne 
&Execution 
de 
Travaux 
d'IntCr&t 
Public 
(ADETP) 
pending 
an 
assessment 
of 
their  capacity 
to 
undertake 
this 
type 
of 
civil 
works 
management. 
In 
addition, 
as 
mentioned 
above, 
two 
long-term 
technical 
advisors 
will 
be hired 
to 
assist 
with 
procurement 
and 
social 
communication.  Finally, 
a 
partnership 
with 
WHO 
has 
been 
agreed 
upon 
and 
other partnerships 
are 
envisaged 
with 
other 
UN 
agencies 
as 
well 
as 
the 
French 
Cooperation, 
which 
are 
present 
in 
the 
field 
and 
may 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
in 
supervision 
of 
activities. 
Until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
above 
arrangements 
are 
running 
and 
functional, the 
Credit 
Administration 
Unit 
(CAU) 
of 
the 
MOH 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
project 
activities 
in 
the "transition" 
phase, 
and 
with 
oversight 
and 
executive 
responsibility 
for 
the project's 
Project 
Preparation 
Facility 
(PPF). 
The 
financial 
management 
and 
procurement 
capacities 
of 
the 
CAU 
were 
partially 
evaluated 
during 
the appraisal 
mission 
and 
were 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
Partnership. 
Project 
preparation 
has 
been 
carried out 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
UN 
agencies, 
in 
particular 
those 
represented 
in 
the 
UNAJDS 
Thematic 
Group, the 
bilateral 
donors, 
and the 
NGOs. 
Interventions 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
project 
have been 
selected 
after discussion 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic Plans 
with 
the 
various 
partners. 
As 
mentioned 
above 
in 
the section 
C4 
on 
'Institutional 
Arrangements', 
it 
will 
be 
the 
role 
the 
TIC 
and 
the 
ES 
to 
coordinate 
donor 
interventions  and 
ensure 
that 
they 
are 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
strategic 
plans 
as 
well 
as 
complementary. 
In 
addition, 
PPF 
funds 
were 
used 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
PAPFAM 
study, 
which 
will 
provide 
baseline data needed 
for 
the 
M&E 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
activities, 
being 
carried out 
by 
the 
UNFPA. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
it 
is 
envisaged 
to 
continue 
this 
close 
collaboration 
(see 
above 
on 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
supervision). 
These 
partnerships 
(including 
WHO), 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
participate 
in 
specific 
areas, 
and 
allow 
the 
Bank 
to 
delegate 
certain 
aspects 
of 
program 
supervision 
thereby  fi-eeing 
up 
supervision 
funds. 
- 
17- 
Page  24
However, 
these 
partnerships 
still 
need 
to 
be 
discussed 
in 
detail 
with 
the 
ES 
and 
the 
MOH. 
This 
could be 
undertaken 
during 
the  post-appraisal 
mission, 
and 
in 
particular, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
donor’s 
conference 
that the 
Djiboutian 
authorities 
will 
organize 
in 
mid-May 
2003. 
If 
the 
Global 
Fund 
proposal 
results 
in 
additional 
resources 
for Djibouti, 
it 
may 
free 
up 
some 
project 
funds 
which 
could 
be 
reallocated 
to 
other 
needs 
and 
which 
could 
not 
be 
included 
at 
the 
time 
of 
preparation. 
If 
the 
funds 
were 
to 
be 
allocated 
to 
HIV/AIDS, 
they 
could 
contribute 
to 
increasing 
the number 
of 
persons treated 
with 
ARVs 
after the 
end 
of 
the 
pilot 
project. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Originally, 
a 
small-scale 
component 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
and related 
diseases 
was 
considered 
under the 
proposed 
Health 
Sector 
Development Project 
(HSDP). 
However, 
given 
the magnitude 
of 
the 
problem, the inter-linkages 
with 
other 
country 
HIV/AIDS 
programs (namely 
Ethiopia 
and 
Eritrea 
at 
this 
time), 
and 
the 
cross-sectoral 
dimension 
needed 
to 
combat 
the pandemic, 
the 
proposal 
was 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
a stand-alone 
project. 
It 
is 
also 
to 
be 
noted 
that the 
HSDP 
will 
focus 
primarily 
on 
restructuring 
the 
health 
system 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
improving 
the 
state 
of 
the 
current 
health 
system. 
All 
of 
this 
leads 
to 
a 
very 
large intervention, 
where 
the focus 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
may 
be 
lost. 
IDA 
considered 
and 
discussed 
whether 
it 
would 
be 
feasible 
to 
include 
the 
Djibouti 
HIV/AIDS 
project 
in 
a 
regional 
funding 
program; 
it 
was 
rejected 
as 
the surrounding 
countries 
have 
already 
launched 
their 
own 
program 
at 
this 
stage. 
In 
addition, 
it 
made 
more 
sense 
in 
a stand-alone 
project 
to 
include 
a 
M&E 
system 
that 
could 
be 
linked 
to 
a 
wider 
regional 
database 
in 
the future. 
Another 
alternative was 
to 
limit 
the 
project 
to 
HIV/AIDS. 
However, 
there 
is 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
TB 
in 
Djibouti, 
in 
part 
because 
many 
people 
from 
neighboring 
countries come 
to 
Djibouti to 
be 
treated. 
Their 
presence 
on 
Djiboutian 
soil 
can 
infect 
others. 
The National 
Tuberculosis 
Program 
received 
assistance 
(financial 
and 
technical) fi-om 
the 
French 
Cooperation 
until 
June 
2002. 
Since 
then 
it 
has 
received financing 
from 
the 
Global 
Drug 
Facility 
funds, 
which 
covers 
TB 
drugs 
for 
three 
years; 
but 
the 
program 
does 
not 
receive 
much 
additional 
support.  Because 
TB 
and 
AIDS 
are 
linked, 
it 
was 
decided that 
support 
to 
the 
TB 
program 
should 
be 
included 
in 
the 
present 
project. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
National 
Malaria 
Program, 
the 
program 
will 
receive 
support 
under 
the- 
HSDP 
project 
for 
the 
first 
year, 
namely 
treatment and 
prophylaxis 
to 
fill 
in 
the 
gap 
until 
the 
present 
project 
is 
effective. 
Given 
that 
malaria 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
largely 
man-made, 
i.e., 
poor 
sanitation 
in 
growing 
urban 
areas 
and 
settlement 
of 
nomads 
who 
build 
ponds 
and cultivate 
irrigated 
areas, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
develop 
a 
large 
community 
education 
program 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
larva 
habitat, 
to 
work 
with 
community 
to 
enforce vector 
control 
measures, 
and 
to 
encourage 
them 
to 
use 
impregnated 
bed-nets. 
Because 
of 
this 
community 
dimension 
to 
malaria 
control, 
it 
was 
decided that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
appropriate 
to 
include 
support 
to 
the 
National 
Malaria Control 
in 
the 
present 
project, 
as 
it 
has a 
large 
community-intervention 
component. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
these 
prevention 
measures 
would 
be 
quite 
cost-effective, 
as 
they 
could 
significantly 
reduce 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
rates due 
to 
malaria. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
project 
preparation, 
it 
was 
decided that procurement 
would 
be 
subcontracted. 
However, 
after 
preliminary 
examination, 
it 
became 
apparent 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
and 
very 
expensive 
to 
contract 
out 
procurement 
to 
a 
firm; 
because 
Djibouti 
is 
situated 
primarily 
in 
an 
Anglophone 
region 
(language 
being 
the 
main 
barrier), 
and 
there 
are 
no 
firms 
with 
the 
necessary 
expertise 
in 
Djibouti. 
It 
was 
then 
decided that 
a 
long-term 
technical 
assistant, 
who 
was 
a 
specialist 
in 
procurement and 
project 
implementation, 
might 
be 
better suited 
to 
assist 
with 
this 
task 
provided 
that 
(a) 
she 
would 
have 
a 
Djiboutian 
counterpart; 
and 
(b) 
it 
be 
specified 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
that 
transfer 
of 
competencies 
and 
capacity 
building 
would 
be 
a 
large 
part 
of 
herhis 
duty 
and 
would 
weigh heavily 
on 
the annual 
performance 
review 
of 
hidher 
assistance. 
- 
18- 
Page  25
Finally, 
the 
consultant 
could 
play 
the 
role 
of 
“facilitator” 
and 
assist 
with 
the 
launching 
of 
project 
activities. 
The 
project  team 
was 
guided 
by 
the 
work 
done 
under  the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Multicountry 
HIV/AIDS 
Program 
for 
the 
Africa  Region 
(MAP) 
and 
the 
lessons 
learnt 
from 
those 
projects and 
contained 
in 
the 
Memorandum 
and 
Recommendation 
of 
the 
President 
for 
MAP2 
(Report 
No. 
P 
7497 
AFR 
of 
December 20, 2001). 
In 
addition, 
the 
team 
drew 
upon field 
experience 
from 
other 
African 
countries  (particularly 
Senegal 
and 
Chad) 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
program 
would 
be 
truly 
multisectoral and 
would 
focus 
heavily 
on 
the empowennent 
of 
communities 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS.

Major 
related 
projects financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
and/or other development 
agencies 
(completed,  ongoing, 
and 
planned). 
Although 
it 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
list 
below, 
because 
the 
financing 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
granted, 
it 
should 
be 
mentioned 
that 
Djibouti 
applied 
to 
the 
Global

against 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
in 
support 
of 
the 
programs 
for 
malaria and 
tuberculosis. 
When 
it 
applied, 
it 
was 
not 
yet eligible 
to

3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the project 
design: 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
HIV/AIDS 
program 
development 
and 
implementation 
in 
other 
countries 
show 
that 
preventive 
measures, 
e.g. 
IEC/CBC 
interventions 
designed 
to 
bring 
about 
behavior 
change, 
condom 
use, 
treatment 
of 
STIs 
and 
01s 
(such 
as 
TB), 
VCT, 
improvement 
in 
blood 
supply, 
and preventing mother-to-child 
transmission, 
have 
all 
proven 
highly 
effective 
in 
reducing 
HIV 
transmission. 
Community-based  programs 
have  been 
especially 
effective 
in 
enhancing prevention, 
care, 
support, 
and 
treatment 
for 
those 
infected 
and 
affected 
by 
HIV/AIDS. 
Lessons 
learned 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
effective 
HN/AIDS 
programs 
in 
various 
countries 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
project 
as 
appropriate. 
Specific 
lessons 
taken 
into 
account and learned 
from 
international 
experience 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
programs 
(MAP) 
include: 
Importance 
of 
political 
leadership and commitment. 
Experience showed that strong 
commitment 
from 
the  top 
political 
and 
religious 
leadership 
in 
the 
country 
is 
important 
for 
the 
success 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
efforts. 
In 
recent 
months 
the 
president 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Djibouti,  including 
several 
ministers, 
has 
demonstrated 
strong 
support 
for 
the program. 
Need 
for 
a 
multisectoral approach. 
Experience 
in 
many 
countries 
in 
Africa 
has 
shown 
that 
HIV/AIDS 
control 
activities 
start 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
but 
need 
to 
be 
expanded 
to 
other 
sectors. 
However, 
past experience 
has 
demonstrated 
difficulties 
in 
implementing 
projects 
across 
multiple 
ministries. 
Obviously 
a 
multisectoral 
HIV/AIDS 
project 
must 
engage 
a 
number 
of 
line 
ministries 
and 
other 
govemment/public 
sector 
mechanisms. 
The risks 
inherent 
in 
this 
arrangement 
will 
be 
mitigated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
project 
is 
to 
be 
“coordinated” 
by 
the 
IC, 
placed 
under 
the 
prime 
minister’s 
office. 
Social 
Assessments: 
Experience 
in 
previous projects 
has 
shown 
the 
importance 
of 
conducting 
social 
assessments, 
and 
MAP 
guidelines 
also 
reinforce 
that 
which 
has 
benefited project 
preparation. 
A 
qualitative social 
assessment 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
AIDS 
on 
people  infected and 
affected 
by 
the 
disease 
was  conducted; 
the 
study 
found 
nutrition, 
poor  medical 
and  counseling 
services, 
and 
financial 
constraints 
to 
be 
primary 
problems 
(see 
Annex 
13 
on 
Social 
Assessment). 
PLWHA 
were 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
study, 
and 
based 
on 
the 
study’s 
findings 
a 
pilot 
nutritional program 
was 
put 
in 
place 
during 
preparation. 
Stakeholder 
Consultation. 
Key 
stakeholders, 
particularly 
those 
with 
an important 
role 
in 
implementation,  should 
be 
involved 
as 
early 
in 
the process 
as 
possible. 
Project 
identification 
has 
been 
done 
in 
consultation 
with 
line 
ministries, 
including 
that 
of 
Religious 
Affairs, 
NGOs 
(including 
the 
NGO 
“Oui 
u 
la 
vie” 
which 
includes 
PLWHA), 
UNAIDS 
and 
UN 
agencies, 
other 
IDA 
projects, 
OPS, 
and donor 
agencies. 
Several 
workshops 
have taken 
place 
in 
the 
five 
districts 
and 
in 
Djibouti-Ville 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Strategic 
Plan 
and 
to 
discuss 
the 
KABP 
studies. 
The 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Strategic 
Plan 
was 
approved 
during 
a 
consensus 
seminar that 
included 
all 
the partners 
consulted 
for 
project identification. 
Additional 
regional 
workshops 
will 
be held 
annually 
to 
set 
community- 
and district-

level 
priorities 
and 
activities 
planned 
for 
the 
year. 
It 
should 
also 
be 
noted 
that 
PLWHA 
have 
been very 
much 
involved 
in 
project 
preparation, 
and 
in 
the design 
and 
implementation 
of 
the  social 
assessment 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
AIDS 
on 
families  and 
individuals 
(carried 
out 
in 
December, 
2002). 
Need 
for 
community 
participation. 
Local 
communities have 
a 
key 
role to play 
in 
the 
prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
the 
care 
of 
infected 
people, 
and 
the 
support 
to 
affected 
groups. 
They 
also 
have 
a 
role to play 
in 
sanitation 
and controlling 
malaria. 
The 
spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
and 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
particular 
results 
in 
a 
heavy 
burden 
on 
local 
communities. 
They 
need 
support 
to 
cope 
and 
to 
be 
able 
to 
express 
their 
needs. 
Appropriate 
mechanisms 
must 
be 
put 
in 
place 
to 
facilitate 
the 
provision 
of 
support and 
resources 
to 
communities 
(such 
as 
education 
of 
communities 
to 
better 
engage 
them 
in 
the 
process, 
and 
so 
that 
adequate 
controls 
on 
financing 
mechanisms 
are 
put 
in 
place). 
It 
is 
recognized that 
experience 
with 
NGOs 
has 
been 
difficult 
in 
Djibouti. 
An 
NGO 
institutional 
analysis 
carried 
out 
during 
preparation 
indicated 
that 
NGOs 
were 
very 
weak, 
lacked 
expertise, 
professionalism, 
and 
know 
how. 
These 
finding 
suggests 
that 
in-depth 
systematic 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
is 
necessary. 
Consequently 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
have 
capacity-building 
activities 
up 
front 
before 
launching 
community 
interventions 
(see 
annex 
2 
section 
4, 
for 
further 
details). 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
intends 
to 
select 
5 
to 
10 
NGOs 
or 
other 
institutions 
with 
recognized 
capacities 
to 
train; 
and, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
competition, 
select 
5 
of 
them 
as 
supporting 
organizations. 
These 
will 
have the 
responsibility 
of 
training 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations, 
assist 
them 
with 
subproject 
preparation, 
and 
supervise 
and control 
the 
quality 
of 
their activities. 
This 
two-tier 
system 
should 
ensure 
close supervision. 
Finally, 
a 
pilot 
project 
to provide 
support 
to 
sero-positive persons 
and 
their families 
is 
being 
carried out 
during 
project 
preparation. 
At 
the  end 
of 
this 
project, 
the 
following 
will 
be 
identified: 
(1) 
mechanisms 
to 
better 
work 
with 
NGOs 
and 
local 
associations; 
and 
(2) 
means 
to avoid 
some 
of 
the past 
constraints. 
This 
pilot 
project 
will 
also 
assist 
in 
defining 
the social 
package 
to 
be 
provided 
to 
infected and 
affected 
persons. 
MAPprojects 
tended 
to 
lose momentum after 
Board 
approval. 
A 
PPF 
was 
requested 
and 
approved 
to 
sensitize 
representatives 
of 
public 
sector 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations, 
to 
establish 
program 
coordination 
and 
implementation 
mechanisms, 
to 
start 
pilot 
operations 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
and 
to 
carry 
KABP 
studies. 
Funds 
available 
under 
a 
PHRD 
grant 
were 
used 
to  provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a  strategic 
plan 
and 
the 
carrying out 
of 
a  sero-prevalence  survey, 
dissemination 
workshops, 
and 
establish 
a 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system. 
Importance 
of 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
M&E 
system 
should 
focus 
on 
who 
will 
use 
the 
indicators 
and 
how 
they 
will 
influence 
the 
decision-making 
process. 
Baseline 
data 
are 
essential 
for 
proper 
monitoring 
and 
have 
been collected 
during 
the 
preparation 
phase 
(see 
the above 
point). 
The 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
Plan 
was 
prepared; 
this 
task 
will 
be 
subcontracted 
out 
to 
ensure 
that 
it 
is 
carried out 
by 
qualified 
experts. 
Capacity 
building 
and 
transfer 
of 
competences 
will 
be 
a 
big 
part 
of 
the 
contractor’s 
TOR. 
e 
Overall 
implementation 
experience 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
has 
shown 
that 
by 
having 
the 
project 
implemented 
by 
a 
unit 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
there 
is 
better 
coordination 
among 
the 
different 
partners 
(government, 
civil 
society,  stakeholders) 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a sectoral 
committee 
established at 
that 
level, 
as 
well 
as 
better 
coordination 
between 
the 
donors. 
The 
Implementation 
Unit 
has a 
better 
grasp 
of 
the 
reform 
process 
and 
how 
the 
different 
interventions 
fit 
in. 
There 
are 
now 
regular meetings between the donors 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education, 
and 
these 
have 
led to 
better 
synergy 
in 
impact 
interventions.

Indications 
of 
recipient 
commitment and 
ownership 
Over 
the 
years 
the government 
has 
urgently 
requested 
IDA 
support 
for 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
reiterated 
its 
request 
during 
high-level 
meetings 
between  the 
government 
and 
IDA’s 
top 
management. 
In 
addition, the government 
specifically indicated 
its 
interest 
in 
IDA 
support 
for 
an 
HIV/AIDS 
control 
project.  Concrete evidence 
of 
recipient commitment 
is 
further manifested 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
IC, 
the 
TIC, 
and the 
ES 
under 
the 
prime 
minister’s 
presidency, 
outside 
of 
the 
MOH. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Multicountry 
HIV/AIDS 
Program 
for 
the 
Africa 
Region 
places 
HIV/AIDS 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
development 
agenda 
for 
work 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
deceleration 
of 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV 
is 
pivotal 
if 
human 
development 
and 
overall 
development 
goals  are 
to 
be 
achieved 
in 
Djibouti 
and 
in 
neighboring 
countries. 
In 
addition, 
IDA’s 
comparative 
advantage 
is 
its 
past 
and 
present 
involvement 
in 
the 
sector, 
and 
its 
flexibility 
to 
work 
across  sectors, 
which 
will 
facilitate 
the 
proposed 
multisectoral 
approach 
being 
considered 
here. 
Furthermore,  there 
are 
clear 
links 
with 
other 
IDA-funded 
projects, 
such 
as 
the 
Social 
Fund 
and 
Public 
Works 
Project, 
the 
School 
Access 
Improvement 
Project and 
the proposed 
HSDP, 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
using 
these 
entry points 
to 
disseminate the 
message 
on 
HIV/AIDS. 
Given 
the 
potential 
macroeconomic 
impact 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
Djibouti, 
IDA’s 
involvement 
with 
structural 
adjustment, 
public 
sector 
reform 
and 
close 
working 
partnership 
with 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
(IMF) 
will 
help 
reduce 
expenditures 
on 
nonpriority 
areas, 
thereby 
freeing 
up 
resources 
for 
the 
health and 
education 
sectors 
primarily. 
IDA’s 
involvement 
will 
also 
be 
key 
in: 
(i) 
ensuring better 
coordination among 
key 
stakeholders; 
(ii) 
preventing duplication 
of 
efforts; 
and 
(iii) 
exploiting 
the  complementary 
aspects 
of 
the 
different 
projects 
currently 
being 
financed 
by 
IDA. 
As 
IDA 
is 
a 
key 
partner 
in 
the 
global 
“STOP 
TB” 
initiative 
in 
collaboration 
with 
UNAIDS 
and 
in 
the 
“Roll 
back Malaria” 
initative, 
the 
ability 
to play 
a 
facilitating 
role 
in 
identifying 
expertise 
and possible 
partners 
is 
also 
an 
asset.

The 
Economic Analysis 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
contained 
in 
the 
Multicountry 
HIV/AIDS 
Program 
for 
the 
Africa  Region 
(MAP) 
Project Appraisal 
Document 
(Report 
No. 
20727 
AFT, 
Annex 
5) 
and 
the 
Second 
Multicountly 
HIVIAIDS 
Program 
(MAP2) 
(APL) 
for 
the 
Africa 
Region  (Report 
No. 
P7497 
AFR), 
provides 
the 
economic 
justification 
for 
projects 
implemented 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
MAP 
Program. 
As 
it 
indicates, 
HIV/AIDS 
undermines 
the 
three 
major 
determinants 
of 
economic 
growth, 
namely 
physical,  human, 
and 
social 
capital. 
Due to 
its 
long 
incubation 
period 
(7-10 
years), 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
is 
likely to 
be 
drawn 
over 
time 
with 
the rate 
of 
growth 
of 
physical and 
human 
capital 
and the 
efficiency 
of 
social 
capital 
declining 
slowly 
in 
parallel 
with 
the 
maturing 
of 
the 
HIVIAIDS 
epidemic. 
Over 
time, 
the 
GDP 
movement 
would 
reflect 
a 
similar 
gradual 
downward 
reduction 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
growth 
(or  increased 
rate 
of 
contraction), 
rather than 
a 
sudden 
fall 
in 
GDP 
per 
capita. 
Available 
data 
indicate 
that 
Djibouti 
represents 
the 
classic 
case 
of 
a 
country 
in 
which 
the 
rapid 
spread 
of 
the 
virus 
is 
likely. 
Poverty, 
refugees, 
high 
levels 
of 
sexually transmitted 
infections 
and 
opportunistic infections, inequality, 
gender 
inequality 
are 
all 
part 
of 
the 
mosaic. 
Once 
HIV 
levels 
reach 
5 
percent, 
the 
infection 
spreads 
exponentially 
with 
the  prevalence 
rate 
sometimes 
increasing 
by 
50 
percent 
every 
year. 
Should 
the 
epidemic 
not 
be 
checked, 
it 
will 
prevent 
an 
increasing 
share 
of 
the 
population 
from 
participating 
in 
the economy 
and result 
in 
the reduced 
economic 
growth 
and increased 
poverty, thereby 
accelerating the 
vicious 
cycle.

An 
economic 
analysis 
and 
simulation 
model 
on 
the 
effect 
of 
HIV/AIDS on 
the  economy 
of 
Djibouti 
has 
been undertaken 
(see 
annex 
4), 
primarily 
as 
Djibouti 
is 
small 
in 
size, 
mostly 
an 
urban 
country, 
and 
heavily 
dependent 
on 
services 
(unlike 
most 
other 
African 
countries). 
The 
analysis 
clearly 
shows 
that the economic 
impact 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
on 
Djibouti 
would 
be 
devastating 
if 
the 
epidemic were 
not 
checked. 
It 
also shows the 
importance 
of 
prevention 
interventions 
such 
as 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
nonunion 
sexual 
partners, 
increasing the 
use 
of 
condoms, 
especially 
during 
sexual contacts 
with 
nonregular 
partners, 
and treating STIs. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
A 
large 
amount 
of 
resources (about 
20 
percent 
of 
resources, 
excluding 
civil 
works and long-term 
TA), 
will 
be 
directed 
at 
community 
interventions. 
The  project 
will 
rely 
on 
civil 
society 
organizations. 
Mechanisms 
on 
how 
to 
provide 
project 
resources 
to 
NGOs 
and 
community 
groups 
were 
identified 
during 
preparation. 
The 
fiscal 
burden 
of 
the 
program 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
low. 
The 
need 
for 
additional 
recurrent 
costs 
will 
be 
limited 
and 
consist 
mainly, 
besides 
the 
costs 
of 
drug 
test 
kits, 
of 
condoms 
(some 
of 
which 
will 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
HSDP 
and 
other 
donors 
such 
as 
UNFPA, 
WHO, 
and 
the 
French 
Cooperation) 
and 
the 
costs 
related 
to 
the 
coordination 
of 
program 
implementation, 
financial 
management, 
and 
M&E. 
The 
financial 
analysis 
will 
compare annual 
recurrent 
costs 
with 
ongoing 
expenditures 
in 
key 
sectors. 
However, 
given Djibouti's level 
of 
resources 
and 
the 
long-term 
nature 
of 
the epidemic, 
financial 
sustainability can 
only 
be 
assured 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
donor community. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
will 
incorporate 
accepted 
practices 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
responses 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
MAP 
and 
by 
UNAIDS 
pamers 
taken 
into 
account 
experiences 
in 
other 
African 
countries. 
The 
project 
will 
tailor 
these 
general 
principles 
to 
the specific 
Djibouti 
situation and 
will 
follow 
best 
accepted 
and 
applicable practices 
in 
technical 
standards 
for 
the 
handling 
of 
medical 
supplies, 
medical 
tests, 
and 
medical 
waste 
to 
minimize 
any environmental  impact. 
Protocols 
for 
the 
effective 
care 
of 
STIs 
have 
been revised 
to 
be 
adapted 
to 
the 
Djiboutian 
epidemiological 
situation. 
Messages 
will 
be 
tailored 
to 
their 
respective 
audiences 
and 
take 
into 
account 
Djibouti's 
cultural 
realities.  Target 
groups 
have been identified. 
Line 
ministries 
will 
prepare 
their 
annual 
action 
plans 
in 
keeping 
with 
national 
technical 
standards 
and 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
National 
Strategic Plan. 
Technical 
personnel 
at 
the national and district levels 
will 
receive 
adequate 
training 
and 
will 
ensure 
that 
proposals 
are 
technically 
sound  and 
cost 
effective. 
Most 
components 
will 
include  training 
programs 
to 
ensure 
that 
staff involved 
in 
implementation have 
the capacity 
to 
deliver 
services 
as 
expected. 
4. 
Institutional: 
Success 
in 
implementation 
will 
depend 
in 
great 
part 
on 
the 
effective collaboration 
between 
the 
IC, 
the 
TIC, 
and 
the 
ES, 
and 
their 
collaboration 
with 
their 
partners, 
in 
particular 
with 
the 
MOH 
and 
the 
UNAIDS 
Thematic Group. 
Both 
Committees have been 
created, 
and 
the 
TIC 
and 
the 
ES 
are 
in 
the process 
of 
being 
established. 
The 
IC 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
prime 
minister, 
with 
the 
minister 
of 
Health 
holding 
the vice-presidential 
chair. 
The 
IC 
has 
ultimate responsibility 
for 
sensitizing 
and 
mobilizing 
civil 
society, 
promoting 
prevention 
measures 
against 
HIV/AIDS, 
and 
seeking 
support 
from 
and 
ensuring 
a 
smooth 
coordination 
among 
donors. 
The 
TIC 
is 
the technical 
arm 
of 
the 
IC 
and 
has 
oversight 
responsibility 
for 
project 
planning 
activities and integration 
between the 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
programs, 
and 
for 
ensuring 
a 
more 
effective 
multisectoral 
approach. 
The 
ES 
is 
responsible 
for 
the day-to-day 
implementation 
of 
activities 
included 
in 
the 
annual 
plan 
and 
manages 
the 
project. 
Long- 
and short-term technical 
assistance 
will 
focus 
on 
-

Page  30
procurement and project implementation 
issues 
and communication efforts 
and 
would 
facilitate 
project 
execution. 
During 
preparation, 
and 
until 
the 
ES 
is 
completely 
functional,  the 
CAU 
of 
the 
MOH 
will 
ensure 
the 
transition. 
The 
CAU 
has 
the capacity 
to 
carry 
out 
preparation 
activities, such 
as 
recruitment 
of 
experts, 
management 
of 
the 
PPF, 
etc. 
(see 
section 
C4 
above 
for 
more 
details). 
The 
IC 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
policy 
issues 
concerning 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and 
tuberculosis. 
The 
IC 
will 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
make 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
project 
implementation, 
if 
necessary. 
Lastly, 
it 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
organizing 
consultations 
with 
the 
different 
partners, 
in 
particular through biannual 
activity 
reviews. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
IC 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
ES. 
Project activities 
may 
be 
adjusted 
at those 
times 
to 
accommodate 
changes 
in 
the 
sectors 
andor 
the 
pace 
of 
implementation and 
to 
coordinate 
with 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
and 
other 
partners (donors/co-financiers, 
private 
sector, 
civil 
society, 
and 
NGOs). 
A 
procurement 
and financial 
assessment 
was 
partially 
carried out 
during 
the 
appraisal 
mission. 
Since 
the 
Administrative and 
Financial 
Unit 
of 
the 
ES 
was 
not 
in 
place, 
the 
assessment 
focused 
on 
the 
CAU’s 
ability 
to 
manage 
the transition 
phase. 
The 
assessment 
found 
the 
CAU’s 
capacity 
to 
undertake the 
transition 
phase 
of 
managing 
project 
activities 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
CAU 
has 
been 
managing 
the 
PHRD 
grant 
and 
the 
PPF 
for 
this 
project 
since 
the 
start 
of 
project 
preparation. 
The 
Executive 
Secretary 
of 
the 
ES 
has 
been nominated. 
The 
Chief 
of 
the 
Administrative 
and Financial 
Unit 
(AFU) 
and the 
accountant 
have been 
recruited, 
which 
fulfills 
the 
condition 
of 
Board 
presentation. 
The 
recruitment 
of 
additional 
staff 
is 
underway, 
which 
will 
lead 
to 
a 
functioning 
ES 
prior to 
Board 
presentation. 
A 
second 
assessment 
will 
take 
place 
in 
mid- 
May 
2003, 
once 
the 
AFU 
of 
the 
ES 
is 
fully 
staffed; 
and an action 
plan 
will 
be 
established 
to 
ensure 
sound 
project 
implementation, 
A 
draft 
procurement 
plan 
was 
reviewed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
negotiations. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
ES, 
as 
Secretariat 
to 
the 
IC 
and 
to 
the 
TIC, 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
management, 
implementation, 
and  coordination 
activities. 
Ministries, 
public 
agencies, 
and 
civil 
society 
organizations 
will 
implement project 
activities 
with 
support 
from 
the 
ES. 
The 
IC 
and 
TIC 
will 
coordinate 
efforts 
in 
their 
respective 
areas 
of 
responsibilities. 
A 
POM, 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA, 
will 
be 
developed 
using 
previous 
experience 
in 
the 
MAP 
program. 
It 
will 
delineate 
processes 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
general 
management, 
procurement 
activities, 
and 
financial 
management 
and 
control, 
including 
TORS 
for 
internal (community 
fund) 
and external 
audits 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
POM 
will 
take 
into 
account 
lessons 
learned 
from 
other 
countries  that 
are 
implementing 
or 
have 
implemented 
a 
MAP 
project. 
The 
POM 
will 
be 
adopted 
by 
the 
Recipient 
before 
December 
31,2003. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
day-to-day 
coordination 
of 
project 
activities 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
ES 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
TIC, 
to 
be 
chaired 
by 
the 
Secretary 
General 
of 
the 
MOH. 
The 
ES 
will 
ensure 
that 
the 
action 
plans 
of 
the 
sectorial 
ministries 
involved 
in 
the 
project 
are 
in 
line 
with 
the 
National 
Strategy 
and 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
allocated 
budget. 
It 
will 
also 
be 
responsible 
for 
supervising 
community 
interventions 
and 
the 
subcontractors. 
In 
addition, 
the 
ES 
will 
need 
to 
ensure 
good coordination 
with 
the 
regional 
councils, 
which 
will 
be 
established 
as 
part 
of 
the 
government’s 
decentralization 
efforts. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
procurement functions 
of 
the 
AFU/ES 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
long-term 
technical 
assistant, 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
capacity 
to 
manage 
complex 
procurement 
procedures. 
In 
addition,  the 
planning, 
monitoring,  and 
evaluation 
tasks 
will 
be 
- 
24 
- 
Page  31
subcontracted 
out 
to 
a 
private 
firm. 
A 
community intervention 
specialist 
and 
an accountant 
for 
the 
CISU, 
and 
an 
administrator responsible 
for 
following 
up 
with 
sectoral 
line 
ministry 
activities 
will 
be 
hired 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis. 
The recruitment 
of 
the 
accountant 
is 
a 
condition 
of 
project 
effectiveness. 
Although 
the 
role 
of 
the 
ES 
will 
be 
mainly 
coordination, 
it 
will 
also 
play 
an administrative role. 
It 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
managing 
project 
funds, 
preparing 
disbursement 
requests, 
supervising 
contractors, 
ensuring 
the 
liaison 
with 
the 
Project 
Task 
Team 
and 
IDA 
in 
general, 
preparing 
and 
submitting 
semi-annual progress 
reports 
to 
IDA. 
The 
ES 
will 
work 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
entities 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
the 
project 
components. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
4.3 
Procurement 
Issues 
A 
review 
of 
the 
national 
procurement 
policies 
and 
procedures was 
carried 
out 
under 
the 
HSDP. 
Certain 
wealmesses 
were 
highlighted 
(see 
HSDP 
PAD 
for 
further 
details). 
Regardless, 
the 
procurement 
for 
all 
IDA-financed 
activities 
will 
be carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank's 
Guidelines 
for 
procurement  under 
IBRD 
loans 
and 
IDA 
credits  (January 
1995, 
revised 
in 
January 
and 
August 
1996, 
September 
1997, 
January 
1999 and 
May 
2002), 
in 
particular,  section 
3.15, 
"Community 
participation 
in 
procurement." 
Consulting 
services 
will 
be 
awarded 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank's 
Guidelines: Selection and 
employment 
of 
consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
borrowers 
(January 
1997, 
revised 
in 
September 
1997 
and 
January  1999). 
A 
procurement 
assessment 
was 
partially 
carried out 
during 
the 
appraisal 
mission. 
A 
second 
assessment 
will 
take 
place 
in 
May 
2003 
(see 
section 
E, 
paragraph 
2). 
It 
was agreed that 
an international 
expert 
in 
procurement 
with 
project 
management 
skills 
will 
be  hired 
no 
later 
than 
June 
15, 
2003. 
Advertisement 
for 
Expression 
of 
Interest 
was 
launched 
in 
the 
UNDB 
on March 
14, 
2003 
and 
expressions 
are 
to 
be 
received 
by 
April 
4, 
2003. 
The 
expert 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
setting 
up 
the  procurement 
unit 
in 
the 
ES 
(within 
the 
AFU) 
and 
guiding 
all 
procurement 
activities  for 
smooth 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
Procurement performance 
will 
be 
assessed 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
in 
the 
form 
of 
random 
audits 
by 
an 
external 
agency 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
supervision missions. 
UN 
agencies 
may 
be 
used 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
certain 
goods, 
such 
as 
condoms,  essential 
medicines, 
and 
vehicles. 
The 
HSDP 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
setting 
up 
a 
CAMME. 
When 
the 
CAMME 
is 
functional, 
and 
if 
it 
has 
procurement 
procedures satisfactory 
to 
IDA, 
the 
possibility 
of 
buying 
essential 
drugs 
and 
medical 
and 
consumables 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be 
explored 
and 
the 
Development Grant 
Agreement amended 
accordingly. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
AFU 
within 
the Secretariat 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
overall coordination 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
of 
project 
activities, accounting and 
reporting 
consolidation 
of 
all 
project 
activities, 
and 
annual 
external 
auditing 
arrangements. 
The 
Unit 
is 
not 
yet 
operational, 
but 
the 
Chief 
of 
the 
AFU 
and 
the 
accountant have 
been recruited. 
Discussions were 
held 
during 
the pre-appraisal and 
appraisal 
missions and 
agreement reached 
with 
the 
Djiboutian 
authorities 
regarding 
the 
financial 
management 
function, 
its 
structure,  and 
the 
flow 
of 
funds. 
Also, 
to 
ensure 
that 
satisfactory 
financial 
management arrangements 
are 
in 
place 
prior to 
project 
effectiveness, 
a 
set 
of 
actions 
were 
discussed 
and 
agreed 
with 
the 
authorities 
during 
the 
pre-appraisal 
mission 
and 
progress 
reviewed 
during 
the appraisal 
mission. 
An 
updated 
implementation 
schedule 
of 
these 
actions 
is 
summarized 
below 
and 
detailed 
in 
annex 
6. 
As 
stated 
above, 
the 
final 
institutional 
arrangements 
to carry 
out 
the 
project activities 
are 
being 
established, 
The 
appraisal 
mission 
reported  a 
slow  implementation 
of 
the 
agreed actions 
to 
- 
25 
- 
Page  32
establish 
minimum 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
As 
such, 
there  were 
no 
institutional 
arrangements 
to 
be 
assessed 
during 
the appraisal 
mission 
at 
the 
ES 
level. 
However, the 
mission 
had 
discussions 
with 
various 
other 
implementing 
ministries 
and 
parties 
regarding 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
and 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity. 
The 
various 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
rely 
on 
their 
existing 
structures 
to 
implement 
the 
activities 
including 
accounting 
for 
the 
grant 
proceeds; 
they 
will 
designate a 
small 
team 
as 
the 
vis-&vis 
of 
the 
ES 
in 
implementing 
the 
activities 
at each 
level. 
This 
core 
team 
will 
include 
a 
person 
with 
some 
accounting 
background 
to 
ensure 
that  the 
funds 
are 
properly 
used and 
accounted 
for 
during 
the  implementation 
of 
the 
activities 
under 
their 
agency's 
responsibility. 
Most 
of 
the 
agencies seemed 
to 
have 
the 
structure 
in 
place 
and 
are 
willing 
to 
meet the 
requirements. 
The 
financial 
management 
function 
of 
the 
project 
at 
the 
AFU 
level 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
AFU 
Chief 
and 
an 
accountant. 
These 
two 
positions 
are 
currently 
being 
evaluated and 
will 
be filled 
shortly. 
Given 
the 
small 
size 
and 
high 
number 
of 
community 
transactions, 
on 
one hand, 
and 
the 
low 
management 
capacity 
at 
the 
community 
level, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
an 
additional 
accountant 
to 
follow-up 
on 
the 
accounting 
and 
disbursement 
of 
such 
community 
development activities 
will 
also 
be 
recruited. 
Two 
special accounts 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
AFU, 
one 
for 
the community-based activities and 
one 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
activities. 
As 
is 
the 
case 
for 
all 
the 
project 
activities, 
the 
financial 
management 
function 
will 
rely 
on 
the various 
partners' 
existing 
structures 
with 
a 
coordination 
at 
the 
AFU 
level. 
The 
various 
working 
relationships and 
reporting 
requirements 
will 
be 
defined 
and 
will 
be 
part 
of 
the 
Procedures 
Manual 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
section 
of 
the 
POM 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Procedure 
Manual for 
Community 
Interventions. 
The 
AFU 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
consolidation 
of 
all 
the 
financial 
information including 
that 
of 
the 
disbursement 
and accounting 
records. 
It 
will 
have 
the 
responsibility 
of 
submitting 
to 
IDA 
the 
periodic 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs). 
The 
flow 
of 
funds 
will 
be 
channeled 
through 
advance  accounts 
at 
each 
of 
the 
implementing 
agencies. 
Accounts 
will 
be 
opened 
in 
commercial 
banks. 
The 
two 
special 
accounts 
will 
be 
maintained 
by 
the 
AFU 
and 
will 
receive 
transfers 
from 
the grant 
proceeds. 
Initially 
advances 
will 
be 
made 
by 
the 
AFU 
to 
the various 
partners' 
advance  accounts 
based 
on 
an 
agreement 
to 
be 
signed  between  the 
ES 
and 
the 
implementing 
partners 
for 
their  respective  activities. 
Each 
implementing 
agency 
will 
receive 
a 
90-day 
advance 
from 
the 
main 
special 
account, 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
actual 
needs 
to 
finance their activities 
over 
a 
90-day 
period.  Once an 
initial 
advance 
is 
made, 
no 
further 
advances 
will 
be 
permitted, 
unless 
and 
until, 
the concemed 
implementing 
agency 
submits 
a 
replenishment 
request 
and 
the 
documentation 
justifying 
the 
use 
of 
the 
advance 
funds. 
Replenishments 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the cost 
of 
the 
activities 
included 
in 
the 
annual 
work 
plan 
for 
the 
next 90 
days.  These 
procedures 
will 
be 
specified 
in 
the 
POM. 
In 
order 
to  properly 
handle 
the 
financial 
management 
functions 
and 
meet 
IDA'S 
financial 
management  requirements, 
the 
format 
and  the 
content 
of 
the 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
need 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
for 
approval 
prior to 
project 
effectiveness. 
In 
addition, an 
accounting 
system, 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
acceptable 
reporting 
will 
be 
adopted 
and 
put 
in 
place 
before December 
31, 
2003 
(dated 
covenant). 
In 
particular, the regular 
FMRs 
(including project financial 
statements, 
procurement, 
and physical 
progress reports) 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
generated 
by 
the 
system 
in 
place, 
and external 
independent auditors 
acceptable 
to 
IDA 
will 
be 
appointed 
annually, 
and their 
audit 
reports 
transmitted 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
to 
IDA. 
These 
requirements 
will 
be 
spelled 
out 
in 
the 
POM.

A 
consulting 
firm 
will 
be 
appointed 
to 
assist 
the 
AFU 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
financial 
management system 
and 
procedures, 
the 
selection 
of 
an 
adequate 
accounting 
software, 
and 
the 
training 
of 
personnel 
on 
the established 
system. 
All 
these steps 
and 
requirements 
were 
discussed 
and 
agreed 
with 
the 
Djibouti 
authorities. 
A 
detailed timetable 
is 
included 
in 
annex 
6.b. 
The 
lack 
of 
preparedness 
in 
the 
implementation 
and 
financial 
management arrangements 
is 
due 
to 
the 
delay 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
ES. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
expected that 
this 
will 
cause 
delays 
in 
project 
implementation, 
primarily 
because 
the 
CAU, which 
is 
presently managing 
the 
PPF, 
is 
doing 
so 
in 
a  manner  satisfactory 
to 
IDA, 
and 
will 
be 
able 
to 
ensure 
project 
management 
responsibilities 
until 
the 
ES 
is 
in 
place.

Environmental: 
Environmental 
Category: 
B 
(Partial 
Assessment) 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The program 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
have a 
major 
environmental impact. 
The 
handling 
and disposal 
of 
clinical 
and 
in 
particular 
of 
HIV/AIDS-infected 
materials 
is 
the 
most significant 
issue. 
Although 
an environmental 
plan 
was 
prepared 
for 
the 
HSDP, 
a 
more 
substantive 
assessment 
on 
medical 
solid 
waste 
was 
prepared 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
Infoshop 
on 
February 
27,2003. 
The 
plan 
includes 
recommendations 
for 
improvements 
to 
the 
legal 
text 
on 
sanitary waste 
management, 
training 
on 
how 
to 
safely 
dispose 
of 
contaminated 
blood 
and  other 
materials, 
wider 
dissemination 
of 
information to 
the 
general 
population, 
health 
supplies such 
as 
gloves, waste disposal 
canisters, 
incinerators, 
etc., 
and 
M&E. 
Health 
facilities 
benefiting 
from 
proceeds 
of 
the 
grant 
will 
be 
required 
to 
demonstrate that 
they 
have 
safe 
methods 
of 
waste  disposal 
and 
that  the 
training 
provided 
to 
their 
staff 
includes 
precautions 
in 
handling 
sensitive materials. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
are 
as 
follows: 
development 
of 
a 
national 
policy 
on 
waste 
management, 
and 
the appropriate 
guides 
and 
legal 
texts; 
training 
of 
key 
personnel 
in 
all 
health 
facilities; 
dissemination 
to 
the 
wider 
population through 
different 
means 
of 
media 
coverage; 
improvements 
to 
waste 
collection 
methods and purchase 
of 
needed 
supplies 
toward 
that 
end; 
and 
M&E 
of 
activities 
undertaken.

stakeholders 
been consulted 
at the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening 
and 
(b)

Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were consulted? 
Health 
personnel 
were 
consulted, 
as 
well 
as 
reference hospitals. 
In 
addition, 
interviews 
were 
held 
with 
local 
communities 
that 
suffer 
the 
effects 
of 
having 
waste  disposal 
sites 
located 
in 
their 
vicinity 
and 
with 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
the 
health 
sector.

6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives 
and specify 
the project’s social 
development 
outcomes. 
See 
paragraph 
83 
of 
the 
Multicountry 
HIV/’DS 
Program 
for 
the 
Africa 
Region  (Report 
No. 
20727 
AFR) 
and 
paragraph 
106 
of 
the 
MAP2 
(Report 
No. 
P7497 
AFR). 
Six 
key 
desired 
social 
development 
outcomes 
for 
the 
project 
are: 
(i) 
ensuring 
access 
to 
HIV/AIDS-related 
information, 
prevention, 
treatment, 
and psychosocial support 
regardless 
of 
gender, 
age, 
occupation, 
ethnicity, 
or 
nationality; 
(ii) 
reducing 
the taboos 
surrounding 
AIDS 
and 
the 
stigmatization 
of 
PLWHA 
so 
that 
they 
may 
seek 
treatment 
and 
reduce cross-infection; 
(iii) 
ensuring 
communities 
are 
better 
able 
to 
protect 
themselves 
from 
HIV 
infection 
and 
to 
care 
for 
those 
among 
them 
who 
are 
affected 
by 
AIDS; 
(iv) 
reducing 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
of 
AIDS 
infection 
among 
the 
general 
population; 
(v) 
improving 
life 
expectancy 
and 
productivity 
of 
PLWHA 
and 
ensuring better 
livelihood 
prospects 
for 
AIDS 
orphans, 
widows, 
or 
other 
dependents; 
(vi) 
improving 
the 
knowledge and 
understanding 
of 
opinion 
leaders. 
The 
project 
will 
strengthen 
community-based organizations 
which 
will 
have 
a 
beneficial impact 
on 
other 
development 
initiatives. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
Stakeholders 
were 
extensively 
consulted 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
project, 
through 
participatory 
workshops 
held 
to 
formulate 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Plan 
for 
the 
Control 
of 
HN/AIDS. 
Workshop 
participants 
consisted 
of 
local 
community 
leaders 
(traditional  and 
religious), 
elected 
officials, 
and 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society, 
women’s 
groups, 
and youth. 
The 
workshops were 
held 
in 
all 
districts 
and 
Djibouti-Ville. 
In 
addition,  focus 
group 
discussions were 
conducted 
with 
specific vulnerable  groups 
such 
as 
CSW 
and 
dockers 
to 
identify 
attitudes 
and 
practices exposing 
them 
to 
infection. 
PLWHA 
(especially 
the 
only 
NGO 
directly 
representing 
their 
interests, 
“Oui 
a 
la 
Vie”) 
were extensively consulted 
so 
that 
their 
needs 
and 
priorities 
are 
integrated 
into 
project 
design. 
A 
social 
assessment 
of 
PLWHA 
was 
conducted 
in 
partnership 
with 
“Oui 
a 
la 
Vie,” 
and 
its 
findings 
were 
discussed 
with 
key 
stakeholders 
(service 
providers, 
civil 
society, 
PLWHA 
etc) 
(see 
Annex 
13 
on 
Social 
Assessment). 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Waqfs and 
Islamic 
Affairs 
is 
among 
the 
ministries 
that have developed 
a 
plan for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
In 
addition, 
there  was  extensive 
coordination 
with 
various 
donors 
financing 
surveys 
targeting 
vulnerable 
groups, 
and 
information 
was 
shared 
through 
dissemination and 
consensus 
workshops. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
regional priorities 
will 
be 
set 
annually 
through participatory 
regional 
workshops. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
NGOs 
and 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations have been 
engaged 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
National 
HIV/AIDS 
strategy. 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs, 
among 
other 
civil 
society organizations, 
have 
already 
been consulted 
and 
involved 
in 
project 
design, 
and 
are 
expected 
to 
play 
an 
active 
role 
in 
project 
implementation. 
CBO 
and 
NGO 
activities 
will 
consist 
of 
(i) 
providing 
care 
and 
support 
for 
PLWHA 
and their 
dependents 
(e.g., 
nutrition for 
AIDS 
patients, 
income-generating 
activities); 
(ii) 
information 
and 
CBC 
activities 
for 
prevention 
(e.g., 
peer 
and 
gender-based 
sex 
education) 
and 
destigmatization 
of 
PLWHA; 
(iii) 
distribution 
of 
condoms; 
and 
(iv) 
integration 
of 
traditional 
healers 
in 
counseling.  Resources 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
using 
simple contractual 
agreements 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
conduct specific 
subprojects 
on 
a 
larger 
scale 
covering their 
work 
in

evaluation 
and 
research. 
Capacity-building 
initiatives, 
including 
training 
for 
budgeting, 
management, 
and 
proposal 
writing, 
and 
implementing 
specific 
actions, 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
project. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
participatory 
approach 
used 
in 
project 
preparation 
will 
be 
continued 
during 
project 
implementation. 
The 
project 
will 
ensure 
that 
community 
initiatives 
are 
identified 
and 
selected 
in 
a 
transparent 
manner 
by 
establishing 
clear 
criteria 
of 
participation and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
broad- 
based selection 
committee. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
the 
TIC 
and 
the 
ES 
will 
oversee 
project-funded 
initiatives; 
the 
ES 
will 
also 
be 
assigned a 
TA 
in 
communications 
to 
support 
all 
communication 
activities related 
to HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and 
tuberculosis. 
The 
CISU, 
which 
will 
train, 
support, 
and 
supervise 
CBOs 
and 
NGOs, 
will 
be 
established. 
The 
project 
will 
also 
provide 
tools 
(such 
as 
counseling 
and 
peer 
education 
guides) 
in 
order 
to 
harmonize 
all 
messages. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development 
outcomes? 
Two 
beneficiary 
assessments 
will 
be 
conducted,  one at 
project 
mid-term 
and 
again 
at the 
end 
of 
the 
project 
(the 
KABP 
will 
be 
the 
baseline). 
The 
Interministerial Committee 
will 
provide 
regular 
oversight 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan. 
The 
MOH, 
and 
subsequently 
the 
ES, 
will 
review 
progress 
in 
meeting 
key 
indicators. 
Indicators 
of 
beneficiary 
satisfaction 
are 
included 
in 
project 
design and 
will 
be 
regularly 
monitored 
during 
project 
implementation.

project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
The 
only 
potential environmental

been prepared (along 
standardized 
guidelines 
of 
other

F. 
Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The 
sustainability 
of 
the 
project 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
degree 
to which 
the 
strategy 
and 
activities 
become 
fully 
owned 
by 
the 
various 
partners 
at 
national, district, 
and 
local 
levels. 
It 
will 
hinge 
on

Risk Rating 
- 
H (High Risk), 
S 
(Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), 
N 
(Negligible 
or 
Low Risk) 
The 
project 
is 
rated 
as 
a 
"high 
risk" 
because 
of 
the 
social stigma 
associated 
with 
the 
disease, 
the 
burdening 
poverty 
faced 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
the population, 
Djibouti's 
highly 
porous 
borders, 
and 
the 
high 
volume 
of 
transit 
traffic 
through 
the 
port 
of 
Djibouti 
and 
its 
subsequent 
impact. 
It 
is 
also 
and 
foremost 
a 
high-risk 
project 
because 
of 
the 
shortage 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
the 
limited 
- 
30- 
Page  37
capacities 
available 
in 
Djibouti. 
Finally, 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
are weak, 
and past 
experiences have 
been 
mixed. 
One 
way 
of 
mitigating 
this 
risk 
has 
been 
to 
put 
added emphasis 
on 
capacity 
building 
and 
strengthening 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
project. 
3. 
Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
Some 
religious 
leaders 
may 
object 
to 
condom 
promotion 
and 
sexual 
education 
of 
young 
people. 
In 
order 
to 
prevent 
this, 
the 
preparation team 
met 
with 
religious 
groups. 
The 
prime 
minister 
and 
the 
president 
are 
also 
playing 
a 
role to 
inform 
religious 
leaders and 
to 
moderate 
their 
opinions.

Detailed Project Description 
DJIBOUTI: HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis Control Project 
By 
Component: 
Project Component 
1 
- 
US$4.9 
million total 
cost 
This 
component 
would aim 
at strengthening 
Djibouti’s 
capacity 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
to 
control malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
by 
supporting: 
(i) 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Interministerial 
Committee, 
the Technical 
Intersectoral Committee, 
and 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat-including 
project 
coordination 
and facilitation; 
(ii) 
the 
updating 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic 
and 
Annual 
Action 
Plans 
for 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, and 
tuberculosis; 
(iii) 
the 
development 
of 
capacities 
of 
governmental and non-governmental organizations responsible 
for 
controlling 
the 
quality 
of 
essential 
activities  (supporting 
organizations/agencies 
d’encadrement); 
and 
(iv) 
strengthening 
of 
public, 
private,  and non-governmental  institutions 
in 
preparing and 
implementing 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention and 
care 
interventions. 
Four 
subcomponents 
would 
address 
the 
following 
areas: 
(a) 
National 
Strategic Plans 
and 
Action 
Plans; 
(b) 
project coordination and 
administration, 
which 
will 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat; 
(c) 
capacity 
building 
and 
training, 
which would 
include 
on-the-job 
training 
for 
health 
personnel,  advocacy, 
and 
communication 
training 
as 
well 
as 
support 
to 
existing institutions (public 
and non-governmental) 
to 
develop and 
implement 
interventions 
aimed 
at 
controlling 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis; 
and 
(d) 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
(M&E), 
i.e., 
including 
behavioral 
surveillance, 
operational 
research 
and 
pilot 
testing, 
and 
other 
M&E 
activities. 
It 
was decided 
during 
the 
appraisal 
mission 
that 
M&E 
activities 
would 
be 
subcontracted 
out 
under the 
supervision 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat. 
Training, 
institutional 
development, 
and quality-control 
activities 
will 
be 
given 
a 
high 
priority 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project. 
These 
activities 
are necessary 
to 
ensure 
increased 
quality 
coverage 
of 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Capacity 
Building and 
Policy 
Development 
Project Component 
2 
- 
US$3.8 million total 
cost 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(MOH) 
and 
more 
broadly 
the 
health 
community 
have 
special 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
prevention and 
management 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs, 
malaria, 
and 
other 
opportunistic 
infections 
- 
including 
malaria 
and  tuberculosis. 
This 
sector 
therefore  warrants 
a 
separate 
component, 
making 
provision 
for 
prevention, 
treatment, 
and 
care 
from 
a 
health-sector 
perspective, 
whether 
public 
or 
private. 
To 
this 
effect, 
this 
component 
will 
provide 
the 
resources 
to 
the 
health 
sector 
through 
the 
MOH 
to 
strengthen 
its 
key 
programs  such 
as 
HIV/AIDS, 
reproductive 
health, 
control 
of 
communicable 
diseases, 
STIs, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis. 
It 
will 
also 
complement the 
Health 
Sector 
Reform 
Project 
(HSDP) 
financed 
by 
IDA 
and 
the 
programs that 
are 
currently 
implemented 
or 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
MOH 
and 
its 
health 
development 
partners. 
The 
implementation 
of 
this 
component 
will 
be 
guided 
by 
the 
HIV/AIDS, 
Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis 
National 
Strategic 
Plans 
in 
terms 
of 
priority 
interventions 
and 
which 
aspects 
of 
its 
HIV/AIDS/STIs, 
malaria, and 
tuberculosis 
activities can 
be 
scaled 
UP. 
Health 
Sector 
Responses 
to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs, 
Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis 
Under 
this 
component, 
the project 
will 
include: 
(a) 
development 
of 
Voluntary 
Counseling 
and 
Testing 
(VCT) 
protocols 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
as 
well 
as 
implementing 
VCT 
activities 
and follow-up; 
(b) 
strengthening the 
health 
system 
for 
the 
comprehensive 
treatment 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs 
(using 
the syndromic 
algorithm 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
case 
management), 
and 
opportunistic 
infections 
- 
including 
TB; 
(c) 
development 
of 
measures 
to 
prevent 
the 
transmission 
of 
HN 
in 
clinical 
settings; 
(d) 
the dissemination 
of 
information 
and 
the scaling-up 
of 
activities 
targeting vulnerable  groups 
in 
collaboration 
with 
other 
sector  partners; 
(e) 
strengthening 
of 
the 
TB 
program 
including 
screening 
and 
treatment 
as 
well 
as 
program 
decentralization; 
(0 
strengthening 
of 
the 
malaria 
program 
in 
terms 
of 
detection, 
prevention, 
and 
treatment; 
(g) 
the 
procurement 
and distribution 
of 
condoms; 
and 
h) 
the 
financing 
of 
drugs, 
test 
kits, 
and medical 
supplies, 
which 
may 
be 
bought 
from 
the 
CAMME 
once 
it 
is 
set 
up 
(see 
section 
on 
goods, 
Procurement, 
Annex 
6A). 
The 
activities 
included 
under 
this 
component have 
been 
identified 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic Plans 
and 
take 
into 
account 
the interventions 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the other 
development 
partners 
(for 
example, 
blood 
transfusion 
is 
being 
supported 
by 
the 
French Cooperation and 
prevention 
of 
mother-to-child 
transmission 
is 
being 
supported 
by 
UNICEF).

Page  43
IDA 
has  also  been 
working 
closely 
with 
its 
UNAIDS 
partners, 
drug 
companies, 
and  developing-country 
governments 
on 
improving 
access 
to 
antiretroviral 
(ARV) 
therapy 
in 
order 
to allow 
for 
low-cost 
choices and 
alternative 
options 
for 
comprehensive 
care 
of 
AIDS 
patients. 
The 
project 
will 
therefore 
support 
the 
development 
of 
guidelines and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
health 
infrasmcture 
to 
pilot 
the 
use 
of 
ARV 
therapy 
in 
a 
safe, 
effective, 
and sustainable manner. 
It 
will 
assist 
the 
MOH, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
other partners 
(e.g., 
the 
French 
Cooperation, 
WHO, 
and 
UNICEF) 
in 
putting 
in 
place a 
one-year 
pilot 
project including 
the 
treatment 
with 
ARV 
of 
sero-positive 
persons 
in 
the 
three 
public 
health 
systems 
of 
the 
country 
(Ministry 
of 
Health, 
Ministry 
of 
Defense, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
EmploymentBocial 
Protection Organization 
[SPO]). 
(This 
organization 
is 
a 
parastatal 
institution 
providing 
basic 
health 
services 
to 
private 
sector 
employees 
[Organisation 
de 
la 
protection 
sociale 
(OPS)]. 
This 
pilot 
project 
will 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
feasibility 
and 
cost 
of 
extending 
the 
treatment 
program 
to 
the 
whole 
country. 
The 
drugs 
for 
the 
pilot 
project 
(including 
ARV) 
will 
be 
procured 
under 
the 
HSDP. 
The 
Government 
of 
Djibouti 
is 
now 
eligible 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
Global 
Fund 
and 
is 
preparing 
a proposal 
for 
the 
next 
round. 
It 
is 
hoped 
that 
in 
the 
future 
at 
least 
part 
of 
the 
drugs 
for 
the 
program 
can 
be 
bought 
with 
Global 
Fund 
financing. 
The 
prevention 
of 
mother-to-child 
transmission 
of 
HIV 
(PMTCT) 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
project, 
because 
UNICEF 
is 
presently establishing a 
PMTCT 
pilot 
program 
in 
two 
Dijboutian 
health 
centers 
(one 
in 
a 
public 
maternity 
center and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
Maternity 
Child 
Health 
(MCH) 
Center 
of 
the 
SPO). 
However, 
as 
the 
pilot 
program 
may 
be 
scaled 
up, 
the 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
the 
training 
of 
counselors 
and 
provision 
of 
artificial 
milk 
for 
mothers 
who 
decide 
not 
to 
breast-feed, 
as 
well 
as 
psycho-social 
support. 
Finally, 
regarding 
condoms, 
a 
consultant 
may 
be 
recruited 
either 
under 
the 
PPF 
or 
at 
the outset 
of 
the 
project 
launch 
to 
develop a 
condom 
distribution 
strategy. 
Condoms 
will 
be 
provided 
free 
of 
charge 
to 
STI 
patients, 
but 
condoms 
should 
also 
be 
made 
available 
outside 
of 
the 
health 
system 
as 
needed 
(based 
on 
the  strategy 
developed). 
This 
component 
would 
be 
primarily 
implemented 
by 
the 
MOH, 
its 
Directorates, 
and 
its 
Programs. 
However, 
it 
has 
been decided 
that 
WHO, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
an 
Agreement 
with 
the 
ES, 
will 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
MOH. 
The 
details 
of 
this 
Agreement 
will 
be 
finalized 
during 
the post-appraisal 
mission. 
Moreover, 
the 
other 
existing health 
systems, 
namely,  the 
Army, 
Police 
and 
SPO 
would 
also 
participate 
in 
specialized 
training 
programs 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
counseling 
and 
the 
use 
of 
the 
syndromic 
algorithm for 
the 
treatment 
of 
STIs 
and 
receiving 
(or 
in 
the 
case 
of 
SPO, 
purchasing) condoms 
and 
drugs 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
opportunistic 
diseases 
and 
STIs. 
The 
PLS 
will 
work 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Interministerial 
Committee and 
will 
be 
represented 
in 
the 
Intersectoral 
Technical 
Committee. 
Project Component 
3 
- 
US$3.7 
million 
total 
cost 
As 
demonstrated 
in 
other countries, 
in 
order 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
to 
be 
effective, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
multisectoral 
approach 
to 
better 
target 
Priority 
Vulnerable 
Groups. 
The 
preparation 
process 
of 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Plan 
has 
demonstrated that  the 
MOH 
could 
not 
by 
itself 
deliver 
all 
the 
essential 
prevention-  and 
impact-reduction activities 
and 
cover 
all 
the 
vulnerable 
groups 
identified. 
Although 
the 
multi-sectoral 
response 
is 
presently very 
weak,  the 
ministries 
of 
Social 
Affairs 
and 
Women 
Promotion, 
of 
Interior, 
and 
of 
Defense, 
already 
carry out 
some 
IEC 
and 
condom-distribution 
activities. 
The 
objectives 
of 
these 
component 
are 
to: 
(i) 
strengthen 
the 
management 
quality control 
capacities 
of 
the 
ministries 
participating 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HN/AIDS; 
(ii) 
support 
these 
ministries 
so 
that 
they 
can 
implement 
essential 
activities aimed 
at 
preventing 
HIV 
infection 
and 
reducing 
the 
impact 
of 
AIDS 
on 
their 
own 
personnel 
and 
on 
the 
vulnerable 
groups 
for 
which 
they 
are 
responsible. 
Multisector 
Responses 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
Prevention 
and 
Care 
The 
11 
ministries, 
other 
than 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
that 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Interministerial 
Committee 
are 
the 
following: 
(i) 
Ministry 
of 
Economy,  Finances 
and 
Planification; 
(ii) 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Youth 
and 
Sports; 
(iii) 
Ministry 
of 
National 
and 
Higher 
Education; 
(iv) 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Women 
Promotion,  Social 
Affairs 
and 
Family 
Welfare; 
(v) 
Ministry 
of 
Defense 
(Forces 
armies 
Djiboutiennes 
- 
FAD);(vi) 
Ministry 
of 
Employment 
and 
National 
Solidarity 
(through 
the 
Organisme 
de 
Protection 
sociale-OPS); 
(vii) 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communication, 
Telecommunications and 
Culture; 
(viii) 
Ministry 
of 
Justice 
and Penitentiary 
and 
Religious 
Affairs; 
(ix) 
Ministry

of 
Wakfs 
and 
of 
Muslim 
Affairs; 
(x) 
Ministry 
of 
the 
Interior 
and 
of 
Decentralization 
(Force 
nationale 
de 
Police- 
FNP); 
and 
(xi) 
Ministry 
of 
Equipment and 
Transport. 
Most 
the above-mentioned 
ministries 
have 
already 
developed 
action plans 
that 
include 
performance indicators 
and 
define 
monitoring 
systems 
and 
budgets. 
The 
action 
plans 
are 
targeted 
to 
the 
staff 
of 
line 
ministries and 
focus 
on 
the development 
of 
reference guides 
for 
the 
essential 
activities they 
plan 
to 
carry 
out, 
social communication, 
and 
peer 
education  activities. 
They 
include 
activities 
such 
as 
training 
peer 
educators 
on 
issues 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs, 
the 
importance 
of 
condoms 
in 
the 
control 
of 
these 
diseases, 
including 
other 
support 
mechanisms 
to 
encourage  a change 
in 
behavior 
practices. 
These 
plans 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the ministries' 
ongoing 
operations. 
In 
addition, 
training 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
staff to 
transfer 
knowledge 
to 
their 
partners and 
to 
groups 
for which 
they 
are 
responsible 
(e.g., 
student-parent  associations, 
dockers' 
associations, truckers, 
women's 
groups, 
health 
committees,  CSWs), 
so 
as 
to 
promote 
effective 
HIV/AIDS/STI 
prevention, 
and 
how 
best 
to 
access 
health 
care 
facilities, 
care, 
and 
treatment. 
At 
this 
point 
it 
is 
not 
planned 
that the 
project 
assists 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Transport 
because  Save 
the 
Children,  financed 
by 
USAID/Ethiopia, 
is 
providing 
support 
to 
that 
ministry, 
which 
could 
in 
addition 
receive 
additional 
support 
through 
the 
Regional 
Project 
for 
the 
Horn 
of 
Africa 
being 
developed 
in 
the context 
of 
the 
MAP2. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Communication 
will 
have 
a 
special 
role to 
play: 
at the 
beginning 
of 
the project, 
it 
will 
assist the 
international 
specialist 
in 
communication 
and the 
Djiboutian 
counterpart 
in 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat, 
in 
developing 
a 
national communication 
strategy 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, and 
tuberculosis, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
advocacy 
and 
use 
of 
modem 
media. 
During 
this 
process, 
its 
role 
in 
the 
strategy 
will 
be 
defined. 
At 
a 
later 
stage, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
it 
will 
disseminate audio- 
visual 
and 
written 
materials prepared 
in 
the context 
of 
the 
communication 
strategy. 
The 
preparation 
of 
these 
materials 
will 
be 
contracted 
out. 
The 
activities 
implemented 
by 
these 
ministries 
will 
be 
integrated 
in 
the 
local 
plans developed 
by 
the districts and 
city 
neighborhoods 
of 
Djibouti-Ville. 
The 
operational 
process 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
regional 
committees 
for 
the 
control 
of 
against 
transmissible 
diseases, 
and activities 
will 
be implemented 
in 
a 
formal 
partnership 
with 
local 
NGOs 
and ABCs. 
The 
mandate 
of 
each 
of 
the 
ministries 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
the respective support 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
Project 
are 
specified 
below. 
Each 
ministry 
will 
have 
to 
supervise 
and 
ensure 
the 
quality 
of 
the activities

During 
this 
process, 
its 
role 
in 
the 
strategy 
will 
be

defined. 
At 
a

stage, 
it 
is 
expected 
that

Ministry 
for 
the 
Promotion 
of 
Women,  Social 
Affairs, 
and 
Family 
Welfare 
(MPWSAFW): 
Its 
mandate 
will 
include 
the 
implementation 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
activities 
for 
young 
women 
who 
are 
attending 
the 
professional 
training institution 
under the 
authority 
of 
this 
ministry 
and 
the development 
of 
the 
social 
package 
for 
persons 
infected 
and  affected 
by 
the 
HIV/AIDS. 
A 
pilot 
project 
will 
be 
implemented 
during 
the preparation 
of 
the 
project 
to 
identify 
the 
best 
strategy 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
the 
social 
package 
by 
the 
persons 
infected and 
affected 
by 
the 
HIV/AIDS. 
The 
ES 
and 
the 
MPWSAFW 
will 
follow 
up 
this 
project and 
coordinate the results 
analysis. 
This 
Ministry 
will 
then be 
in 
charge 
of 
implementing 
the 
strategies 
identified 
thanks 
to 
the 
pilot 
project. 
Project 
support 
to 
this 
ministry 
will 
include: 
(a) 
social 
communication 
activities; 
(b) 
peer 
education; 
(c) 
training 
of 
cadres 
of 
the 
ministry 
and 
professional 
training 
centers 
for 
young 
women; 
and 
(d) 
logistical 
support 
to 
the 
focal 
point. 
At 
this 
point 
it 
is 
not 
planned 
that 
the 
project 
assist 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Transport, 
because 
Save 
the  Children, 
financed 
by 
USAID/Ethiopia, 
is 
providing 
support 
to 
that 
Ministry, 
which 
could, 
in 
addition, receive 
additional 
support 
through 
the 
Regional Project 
for 
the 
Horn 
of 
Africa 
being 
developed 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
MAP2. 
This 
approach 
will 
be 
revisited 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the project, 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
nominated 
a 
focal 
point 
who 
follows 
activities related 
to 
the 
project 
and 
will 
be kept 
informed. 
Activities 
in 
the ministries 
will 
be 
financed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
agreed 
annual 
workplan 
and 
budget. 
Each 
ministry 
will 
receive 
advances. 
The 
first 
advance 
will 
have 
to 
be 
justified 
by 
the concerned 
ministry 
(invoice, 
receipts, reports, 
etc.) 
before 
receiving 
the 
second advance. 
The 
Administrative and Financial Manager 
of 
each 
ministry, 
who 
will 
manage these 
funds, 
will 
receive 
training 
as 
necessary. 
Project 
Component

- 
US$2.6 
million 
total cost 
In 
order 
to 
enlist communities 
in 
controlling 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis, 
and 
to 
provide them 
with 
the 
means 
to 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
diseases, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
provide 
resources  at 
the 
local 
level. 
This 
component 
will 
be 
implemented 
by 
local 
NGOs 
and 
CBAs. 
The 
NGOs 
and 
CBAs 
will 
submit 
projects 
for 
financing 
to 
the 
ES 
on 
an 
annual 
basis. 
These 
projects 
will 
be 
developed 
taking 
into 
account 
criteria 
for 
eligibility 
and 
will 
be 
implemented 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
complement 
governmental 
services 
identified 
in 
the 
multi-sectoral 
component. 
Support 
to 
Community-Based 
Initiatives 
The 
objectives 
of 
this 
community 
intervention 
component 
are 
: 
(a) 
to 
strengthen 
communities 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
Djiboutian 
associations 
and 
NGOs 
so 
that 
they can implement 
essential 
activities 
for 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
vulnerability to 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis; 
and 
(b) 
to 
strengthen 
institutional 
capacities 
of 
Djiboutian 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
so 
that they 
can deliver 
essential 
services 
to 
the 
neediest 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Project 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
ensure 
that 
community 
interventions 
are 
complementary 
and 
in 
synergy 
with 
interventions 
carried out 
by 
governmental 
services 
and other 
potential 
partners. 
Essential 
activities 
identified 
for 
community 
interventions 
can be 
classified 
in 
three categories: 
(a) 
prevention 
aimed 
at 
reducing 
vulnerability 
to 
the 
infection 
by 
HIV, 
malaria, and 
tuberculosis; 
(b) 
essential 
activities aimed 
at 
reducing 
the 
impact 
of 
HIVIAIDS 
on 
infected 
and affected 
persons, 
including 
adults 
and 
children 
of 
affected 
families; 
and 
(c) 
legal 
essential 
activities 
aimed 
at 
supporting 
persons 
affected 
by 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
victims 
of 
sexual violence. 
The 
essential 
prevention 
activities 
identified 
during 
project 
preparation 
are 
the 
following 
: 
(a) 
information 
and 
promotion 
of 
the various activities and 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
public 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
those 
provided 
at 
the 
community 
level; 
(b) 
social 
communication 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
and feminine 
genital 
cutting, 
through 
theater 
and 
other 
traditional communication 
means; 
(c) 
sexual 
education  carried 
out 
by 
peers 
of 
the 
same  gender; 
(d) 
-

- 
Page  47
revenue-generating activities 
for 
infected and 
affected 
persons; 
and 
(e) 
condom distribution 
or 
sale, 
according 
to 
the 
strategy 
that 
will 
be 
defined. 
Essential 
activities 
related 
to impact reduction 
as 
identified 
are 
the 
following: 
(a) 
social and 
nutritional 
support 
to 
affected 
persons, 
in 
particular 
orphans; 
and 
(b) 
revenue-generating 
activities 
for 
families 
of 
PLWHA. 
Because 
of 
cultural 
specificities  (to 
be 
identified 
as 
a 
PLWHA 
or 
to 
be 
related 
to 
a 
PLWHA 
is 
still 
very 
stigmatizing), 
psychological 
support 
activities 
will 
not be 
developed 
at 
the 
community 
level 
during 
the 
first 
years 
of 
the project. 
Essential 
legal activities 
at 
the 
community 
level 
are: 
(a) 
information 
and 
education 
to 
strengthen the 
defense 
and 
negotiation 
capacity 
of 
women, 
young 
boys, 
and 
young 
girls; 
and 
(b) 
legal 
counseling 
and 
assistance 
for 
victims 
of 
sexual 
violence and 
persons 
living 
in 
affected 
families and 
whose 
social 
rights 
are 
threatened 
or 
violated. 
The 
implementation 
of 
essential 
activities 
will 
require 
the 
development 
of 
several 
support activities 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
capacities 
of 
Djiboutian 
NGOs 
and 
associations. 
Project 
support 
will 
include 
training 
of 
the 
cadres 
of 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
(a) 
management 
and 
development 
of 
social 
projects; 
(b) 
analysis 
of 
vulnerability 
situation 
and 
identification 
of 
appropriate 
solutions; 
(c) 
implementation 
of 
the  essential 
activities mentioned 
above; 
(d) 
mobilization 
and 
promotion 
of 
community 
participation; 
and 
(e) 
supervision 
and 
quality control 
of 
services 
being 
provided. 
The 
needs 
for 
training 
and supervision 
of 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
were 
assessed 
during 
the development 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Strategic 
Plan. 
Support 
to 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
govemmental 
and 
non-govemmental  institutions 
which 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
training 
and  supervision 
(supporting 
organizations). 
A 
very 
important 
step 
for 
this 
component 
will 
be 
to 
identify, 
in 
a consensual 
and 
participative 
manner,  9-10 
institutions/NGOs  that have the 
potential 
to train 
and 
supervise 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
that 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
carrying out community 
interventions. 
IDA 
is 
conscious 
of 
the 
fact that 
even 
the capacities 
of 
these 
supporting 
organizations 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
In 
particular, 
the 
personnel 
who 
conduct the 
training 
and supervision 
will 
need 
to 
be 
trained 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
guides 
prepared 
for 
each 
essential 
activity, and 
those 
who 
are 
responsible 
for 
quality 
control 
of 
the delivered 
services 
will 
need 
to 
be 
trained 
in 
accordance 
with 
established 
protocols. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
training, 
an exam 
will 
identify 
the best 
5-10 
institutions 
to 
serve 
as 
supporting 
organizations, 
taking 
into 
account 
the criteria 
defined 
during 
a 
consensus 
workshop 
on 
training 
and 
supervision. 
This 
selection 
will 
be 
based 
on 
three 
dimensions: 
(a) 
a 
technical 
dimension 
related 
to 
the essential 
or 
support activities 
the 
NGO 
will 
be 
concerned 
with; 
(b) 
a 
social dimension 
related 
to 
the 
priority 
vulnerable groups 
which 
need 
to 
be 
covered; 
and 
(c) 
a 
geographical 
dimension 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
the  neighborhoods 
of 
Djibouti-Ville 
and 
the 
districts 
of 
the 
country 
are  covered. 
One 
supporting 
organization 
can cover 
several 
technical 
areas, 
or 
several 
vulnerable 
groups, 
or 
several 
districts, 
depending 
on 
its 
real 
capacities. 
Prior 
to 
effectiveness, 
the 
ES 
will 
prepare 
the 
Procedure 
Manual 
for Community 
Interventions. 
This 
manual 
will 
include 
procedures 
on 
programmatic and financial 
management 
for 
the 
interventions carried 
out 
by 
civil 
society 
and 
on 
project 
selection. 
The 
institutions 
wishing 
to 
apply 
to 
become 
supporting 
organizations, 
will 
need 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
ES 
projects 
which 
take 
into 
account 
the 
prerequisites 
stipulated 
in 
the Procedure 
Manual 
for 
Community 
Interventions. 
These 
prerequisites 
will 
concern: 
programmatic  and  financial 
management 
capacities; 
qualified 
human 
resources; 
and 
agreements 
of 
the 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
with 
whom 
they 
intend 
to 
work 
with. 
The 
Procedure 
Manual for 
Community 
Interventions should 
be 
finalized 
in 
a 
consensus 
workshop 
organized 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
UN 
Agencies 
and 
in 
which 
all 
the 
ministries 
concerned 
with 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
civil 
society, 
and 
other partners 
would 
participate. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
local 
sub-projects 
for 
community 
interventions 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project, 
it 
will 
be 
done 
in 
a 
realistic 
manner that 
will 
prioritize leaming 
and 
the capacity 
development 
of 
the 
personnel 
involved 
and 
quality control 
aspects. 
Coverage, 
which 
will 
be 
gradually 
increased, 
will 
not 
be 
a 
priority 
during 
the 
first 
year. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the analysis 
of 
the 
response 
carried 
out 
in 
2002 and 
of 
the advice 
of 
the 
ES, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
about 
30 
community 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
formulated 
for 
2004. 
These 
sub-projects 
will 
be implemented 
by 
25 
to 
30 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
assisted 
by 
5-10 
supporting 
organizations, the 
-41

ministry 
dealing 
with 
the 
same 
vulnerable group and 
the 
Community Intervention 
Support 
Unit 
(CISU) 
of 
the 
ES 
. 
The 
preparation 
and 
selection 
process 
of 
community 
sub-projects 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
project 
will 
be 
an annual 
process  that 
will 
be  carried out 
in 
each 
district 
(or 
neighborhood) 
under 
the 
responsibility 
and 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
regional 
HIV/AIDS 
Councils. 
The 
sub-project 
will 
be 
identified 
and 
selected 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
essential 
activities 
necessary 
to 
reduce 
the 
vulnerability 
of 
priority 
groups 
in 
each 
neighborhood 
of 
Djibouti-Ville 
and 
district 
of 
the 
country. 
Annual 
regional 
workshops 
will 
be 
held 
by 
groups 
in 
each 
district 
of 
the 
country 
and 
neighborhood 
of 
Djibouti- 
Ville 
in 
order 
to 
identify portfolio 
of 
priority 
projects taking 
into 
account governmental interventions 
identified 
in 
sectoral plans. 
The 
“partnership  tables” 
will 
underline 
the 
complementarity 
of 
the 
actions 
proposed 
by 
the 
local 
actors 
for 
each 
vulnerable 
group. 
The 
first 
regional 
workshops 
will 
be 
organized  after 
the 
supporting 
organizations 
for 
the 
training 
and 
supervision 
of 
local 
NGOs 
and 
associations 
have 
been 
selected. 
The 
management 
staff 
of 
the 
supporting 
organizations, 
be 
they  governmental 
or 
non-governmental, 
will 
participate 
as 
facilitators 
in 
the 
regional 
workshops. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
initial 
analysis 
of 
local 
NGOs 
and association capacity, 
the 
ES 
estimates that the 
following 
number 
of 
sub-projects 
could 
be 
developed 
per 
vulnerable 
group: 
(a) 
in 
the 
Addis-Djibouti 
corridor, 
4 
sub- 
projects 
for 
truckers, 
3 
sub-project 
for 
CSWs, 
2 
sub-projects 
for 
Nomads 
living 
along 
the 
corridor; 
(b) 
2 
sub- 
project 
for 
the dockers; 
(c) 
2 
sub-projects 
for 
other 
private 
sector workers; 
(d) 
4 
sub-projects 
for 
out 
of 
school 
youth; 
(e) 
2 
sub-projects 
for 
youth 
in 
school; 
5 
sub-projects 
for 
young women 
in 
difficulty; 
(0 
2 
sub-projects 
for 
young 
Khat 
users; 
(g) 
3 
sub-projects 
for 
immigrants/refugees; 
and 
one 
sub-project 
for 
street 
children. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
these 
community 
sub-projects 
will 
cover about 
14,000 
vulnerable 
persons 
the 
first 
year. 
These 
sub-projects 
will 
also 
be 
complementary and 
in 
synergy 
with 
the 
sectoral 
interventions 
and that 
of 
the 
SPO. 
The 
implementation 
of 
these 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
monitored 
and 
supervised 
at 
the 
central 
level 
by 
the 
CISU 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
person 
responsible 
for 
sectoral response 
within 
the 
ES 
and 
at the 
regional 
level 
with 
the supporting 
organizations,  the 
HIV/AIDS 
regional 
committees, 
and the consultant 
to 
which 
M&E 
will 
be 
contracted 
out. 
The modalities 
of 
these 
arrangements 
will 
be 
defined 
in 
the 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Plan. 
The 
financing 
of 
community 
sub-projects 
and 
contracts 
with 
supporting organizations 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
CISU 
in 
agreement 
with 
the 
Procedure 
Manual for Community 
Interventions. 
The 
mechanisms 
to 
channel 
finds 
from 
the 
CISU 
to 
communities 
were 
agreed 
upon 
during 
the appraisal 
mission. 
The 
selection 
of 
sub-projects 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
an 
independent 
committee 
including 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
representatives 
of 
government, 
civil 
society, 
and 
donors. 
The 
selection 
modalities 
will 
be 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Procedure 
Manual 
for Community 
Interventions. 
Community 
response 
will 
be 
coordinated 
between 
associations 
and  between 
the  associations 
and 
the 
government 
in 
a partnership 
framework 
at 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
level 
of 
the 
neighborhoods, and 
the 
district 
level 
through 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
Regional 
Committees and 
the 
ES. 
Legal 
texts 
and 
simple 
partnership 
agreement 
letters 
will 
stipulate 
the 
right 
and duties 
of 
all 
the  actors 
as 
required 
by 
the 
Procedure 
Manual 
for 
Community 
Interventions.

Annex 
4: 
Economic 
Analysis 
DJIBOUTI: 
HIVIAIDS, 
Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis Control 
Project 
This 
Annex 
presents 
the 
main 
results 
of 
the  economic  analysis 
of 
the 
Djibouti 
HIVIAIDS 
project. 
We 
show 
that 
the 
project 
is 
likely 
to 
bring 
considerable 
benefits 
to 
the 
Djiboutian 
society 
by 
contributing 
to 
reduce 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rates 
and 
the 
associated 
economic 
costs. 
Conservative 
estimates 
put 
the 
net 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
during 
the 
next 
25 years 
between 
USD 
50 
and 
60 
million 
or 
close 
to 
10 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP’. 
The 
intemal 
rate 
of 
retum 
of 
the 
project 
is 
most 
likely 
in 
the 40-60 
percent 
range. 
No 
large recurrent 
costs 
are 
expected. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
project 
will 
reduce 
the 
pressure 
over  the 
health 
budget. 
Indeed, 
the 
analysis 
estimates 
that 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
project health 
expenditures 
related 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
could 
surpass 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
year 2010. 
No 
large recurrent 
costs are 
expected 
from 
the 
project, 
and therefore 
there 
are 
no 
negative 
fiscal 
impacts. 
On 
the contrary, 
by 
reducing 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
the 
project 
will 
reduce 
the 
future 
pressure 
on 
the 
health 
sector 
budget. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
various 
interventions 
and 
therefore  the 
full 
realization 
of 
the 
project’s 
benefits require 
progress 
in 
two 
areas. 
First, 
identifying 
appropriate mechanisms 
to 
supply 
and 
price 
condoms, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
public 
absorbs 
a 
fair 
share 
of 
the 
costs. 
Second, 
and 
more 
importantly, 
advancing 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
health 
sector. 
Financing 
mechanisms, 
budget 
process, 
and 
delivery 
systems 
need 
to 
be 
reviewed 
to  improve 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources, 
reduce 
costs, 
and 
bring 
higher 
quality 
and 
access. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
these 
reforms 
the 
health 
sector 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
the 
public 
interventions 
necessary 
to 
keep 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic under control. 
The 
Annex 
is 
organized 
in 
four 
sections. 
Section 
1 
discusses 
the 
main 
channels 
through 
which 
the 
HIV 
epidemic 
can 
affect 
the  economy. 
Section 
2 
briefly 
summarizes 
the 
rationale 
for 
public 
financing 
of 
the 
current 
project. 
Section 
3 
presents  estimates 
of 
the 
economic 
costs 
of 
inaction. 
Section 
4 
illustrates 
how 
alternative 
project 
interventions 
could 
contribute 
to 
reduce 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rates, 
estimates associated 
benefits, 
and 
computes 
intemal 
rates 
of 
retum. 
Section 
5 
proffers 
the 
conclusion. 
1. 
The 
economic 
impact 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
The 
economics 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
have 
been 
a 
fertile 
area 
of 
research 
during 
the last 
two 
decades. 
Several 
papers 
have 
attempted 
to 
provide 
estimates 
of 
the 
microeconomic 
and 
macroeconomic 
implications 
of 
the epidemic 
in 
various  countries 
(see 
Robalino 
et 
al. 
2002a 
and 
World 
Bank 
2001 
for 
a 
review). 
In 
general, 
there 
are 
three 
main 
channels 
through 
which 
the epidemic affects 
the 
economy. 
First, 
through  higher 
mortality 
and 
morbidity 
among 
young 
adults 
in 
their 
most 
productive 
ages, 
HIV/AIDS 
reduces the 
productive 
capacity 
of 
a 
country. 
Premature 
deaths 
imply 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
labor 
force. 
Higher 
morbidity 
often 
implies  lower  productivity 
of 
the 
labor 
force, 
for 
instance, 
given 
higher 
labor 
tumover. 
Second, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
appropriate 
risk 
management instruments, 
HIV/AIDS 
can 
hrther 
compromise 
the 
accumulation 
of 
human 
capital 
by 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
Assumes 
a 
10 
percent discount rate.

orphans 
who 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
develop 
fully 
their physical and intellectual 
capacities2, 
and 
by 
forcing 
households 
to 
recur 
to 
welfare-decreasing 
coping 
mechanisms 
(e.g., 
reduction 
in 
food 
consumption, sending 
children 
to 
work). 
Third, 
the 
need 
to 
finance 
additional health 
expenditures 
and 
reallocate 
resources 
towards curative and preventive 
measures 
reduces 
economic 
efficiency 
and 
can 
slow 
the 
accumulation 
of 
produced 
capital. 
0 
Regarding 
the 
last 
point, 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
epidemics 
on 
the 
health 
system 
can 
vary 
widely from 
one 
country 
to 
another, 
depending 
on 
the 
type 
of 
technologies 
and 
services 
provided 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
In 
general, 
however, 
the 
epidemic 
brings 
higher 
demand 
for 
health 
services, 
higher 
prices, 
and 
therefore 
higher 
expenditures. 
The 
macroeconomic 
consequences 
depend, 
in 
part, 
on 
how 
additional 
expenditures 
are 
financed. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
governments 
have 
the 
choice between increasing 
taxes, 
issuing 
debt, 
or simply 
reducing 
other 
types 
of 
expenditures 
(consumption  or 
investment). 
For 
instance, 
higher 
expenditures 
in 
HIV/AIDS 
curative interventions 
could 
crowd-out 
other 
health 
or 
education 
expenditures 
(see 
Figure 
1). 
Higher 
private 
expenditures 
could 
also 
be 
financed 
either 
by 
reducing 
savings3 
or 
substituting 
consumption. 
If 
lower 
savings dominate, 
then 
new 
investments 
and 
growth 
would 
be 
compromised. 
In 
all 
cases, 
necessary 
adjustment 
to 
finance 
additional health 
expenditures 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
welfare 
decreasing. 
Efficiency 
losses 
may 
also 
result 
as 
private 
and 
public 
resources 
used 
to 
supply 
HIV/AIDS-related 
services are 
reallocated 
away 
from 
other 
more 
productive 
uses.

A 
recent analysis 
of 
the 
macroeconomic 
impact 
of 
the 
epidemic 
in 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
North 
Africa 
(MENA) 
region 
showed that 
the 
costs 
could 
be 
considerable, 
even 
if 
most 
countries, 
excluding 
Djibouti, 
still 
have 
low HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rates 
(World 
Bank, 
2002~). 
The 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
for 
the 
period 
2000-2025 
could be 
reduced, 
on 
average 
by 
0.27 
percent 
per 
Research 
has 
shown 
that 
beyond 
the 
psychological impact, 
among 
low-income 
populations, 
the 
death 
of 
one 
parent 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
deterioration 
of 
nutritional 
status 
can 
lower 
school 
enrollment 
rates. 
(Ainsworth 
and Koda, 
1993). 
See 
also 
Bell 
et 
al. 
2002. 
Private 
savings 
can 
also 
be 
reduced 
if 
HIViAIDS 
increases 
discount 
rates, 
thus 
favoring 
present 
consumption.

year 
in 
Yemen 
and 
Jordan, 
to 
0.36 
percent 
in 
Lebanon, 
and 
over 
1 
percent 
in 
Djibouti. 
Lower 
economic 
growth 
would 
result 
in 
output 
losses 
for 
the 
period 
2002-2025 
equivalent 
to 
31.4 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP 
in 
Yemen, 
36 
percent 
in 
Algeria, 
44.3 
percent 
in 
Egypt, 
and 
over 
100 
percent 
in 
Djibouti. 
In 
year 
201 
5, 
HIV/AIDS-related 
health 
expenditures 
could 
average  1.2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
By 
year 
2025, 
the 
labor 
force 
could 
be 
reduced 
by 
2.5 
percent 
in 
Yemen 
to 
4 
percent 
in 
Algeria 
and 
22 
percent 
in 
Djibouti. 
Thus, 
regardless 
of 
the 
distribution 
factors 
that 
affect 
the 
different 
countries’ 
vulnerability 
(differences 
in 
unemployment 
rates, 
the 
share 
of 
labor 
in 
total 
inputs, 
the 
growth 
rate 
of 
labor productivity), 
HIV/AIDS 
poses 
a serious threat. 
In 
low-income 
countries 
such 
as 
Djibouti, 
the 
epidemic 
is 
likely to 
severely 
jeopardize 
current 
strategies 
to 
reduce 
poverty. 
First, 
lower 
economic 
growth 
will 
reduce the 
number 
of 
people 
lifted 
out 
of 
poverty. 
Second, 
the 
economic 
impact 
of 
the 
epidemic 
is likely 
to 
be 
more 
severe 
among 
the 
poor. 
The 
non-poor 
can 
hedge 
their 
losses 
in 
wage 
income 
due 
to 
AIDS 
with 
other 
assets, 
but 
for 
the 
poor 
the 
main 
or 
only 
source 
of 
revenue 
is 
their 
labor 
force. 
Coping 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
poor 
are 
more 
limited 
and usually 
involve 
changes 
in 
consumption 
patterns 
(e.g., 
reducing 
education,  food, 
and health 
expenditures) 
or 
sending 
children 
to work. 
These 
mechanisms 
result 
in 
human 
capital 
loss 
as 
a 
result, 
among 
others, 
of 
high 
child 
malnutrition 
or 
lower 
school enrollment 
rates. 
While 
in 
MENA 
countries 
informal 
coping 
mechanisms 
to 
manage 
risks 
are 
diverse 
- 
ranging 
from 
family 
support 
and 
kinship 
ties 
to 
religious 
charitable 
organizations 
- 
research 
has 
shown 
that 
they 
are 
usually insufficient 
to 
hedge 
against 
adverse 
shocks 
(World 
Bank 
2002b). 
Studies 
show 
that  reductions 
in 
consumption 
in 
low-income 
households 
following 
the 
death 
of 
an 
adult household member 
would 
reduce 
food 
expenditures 
by 
32 
percent 
and 
food 
consumption 
by 
15 
percent 
(Over 
et 
al., 
2001). 
This 
occurs 
not only 
as 
household 
income 
is 
lost and funeral 
expenditures need 
to 
be 
financed 
(on 
average 
households 
spend 
50 
percent 
more, 
or 
$800-$900, 
on 
funerals 
than they 
do 
for 
medical 
care), 
but 
also 
because 
households 
that 
experience a 
death 
cut back 
on 
the 
number 
of 
hours they 
work 
for 
wages 
(Beegle,  1996). 
In 
most 
MENA 
countries 
the 
poor 
already 
face 
problems 
of 
access 
to 
health 
services. 
As 
health 
systems 
become 
financially 
constrained, 
these 
problems 
can 
be 
exacerbated. 
At 
the 
same 
time, the 
poor 
are 
more 
exposed 
to 
infectious 
diseases, 
and, 
complicated 
with 
under- 
nutrition, 
are 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
the 
deterioration 
of 
their 
immune 
system. 
2. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
government 
Governments 
have 
a 
key 
role 
in 
developing 
and 
financing 
the 
implementation 
of 
policies 
to 
confront 
HIV/AIDS. 
Indeed, 
individuals 
alone cannot devise appropriate mechanisms 
to 
contain 
the epidemic. 
First, 
individuals 
do 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the social 
costs 
of 
the 
risks 
they 
take, 
or 
the 
social benefits 
of 
the 
preventive 
measure 
they 
adopt. 
In 
an 
unregulated 
market 
we 
would 
observe 
an 
excess 
of 
risky 
behavior 
and 
too 
little 
prevention 
from 
a 
social 
point 
of 
view. 
A 
second reason 
is 
information-related problems. 
Individuals 
may 
not 
have enough 
information 
about 
the 
risks 
of 
HIV 
and 
may 
lack 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
related 
to 
preventive 
behaviors. 
Finally, 
culturalheligious 
values 
may 
constrain 
individuals’ 
actions 
in 
ways  that render 
them, 
and 
society, 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
HIV/AIDS. 
The 
role 
of 
governments 
in 
providing 
information 
and 
subsidizing interventions 
to 
reduce 
risky 
behaviors 
is 
therefore 
critical. 
Governments 
can 
only 
intervene, 
however, 
if 
there 
are 
cost-effective interventions 
at 
their 
disposal. 
Fortunately, 
international 
experience 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
this 
is 
the 
case 
with 
HIV/AIDS. 
Recent 
studies 
show 
that 
interventions 
that  focus 
on 
reducing risks 
(through 
information 
and 
preventive 
behaviors  and 
services) 
in 
those 
population 
groups 
most 
likely 
to 
contract  and 
spread 
HIV 
can 
be 
highly 
cost-effective 
(Jenkins 
et 
al., 
2001a, 
Kahn, 
1996). 
Interventions 
such 
as 
reproductive health 
and 
HIVIAIDS 
education 
in 
schools, 
targeted 
treatment 
- 
47 
- 
Page  54
of 
sexually 
transmitted 
infections 
(STIs) 
for 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups, 
and 
reduction 
of 
infection 
by 
intravenous 
drug 
use 
(IDU) 
have 
also 
proved 
to 
be 
cost-effective 
(Jenkins 
et 
al., 
2001b). 
As 
discussed 
intensively 
in 
Kremer 
(1996a,  1996b), 
the 
social benefits 
from 
obtaining 
treatment 
for 
sexually  transmitted 
diseases, 
condom 
distribution, 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
many 
times 
the 
private 
benefits. 
To 
implement 
these 
interventions 
several 
instruments 
are 
available 
including 
direct 
provision 
of 
services 
and 
of 
information, 
subsidies, 
taxes, 
and 
regulatory power. 
In 
general, 
early interventions 
bring 
higher 
benefits 
and 
lower 
costs, 
both 
economic 
and 
social. 
Previous 
MENA 
Country 
studies 
have 
looked 
at 
the 
impact 
of 
increasing 
condom 
use 
by 
30 
percent 
and expanding 
access 
to 
safe needles 
for 
IDUs 
by 
20 
percent 
(World 
Bank, 
2002~). 
The 
results showed that 
these 
two 
interventions can considerably reduce 
GDP 
losses 
for 
the 
period 
2002-2025 
from 
an 
average 
of 
5 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Yemen 
to over 70 
percent 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Djibouti. 
Across 
all 
MENA 
countries 
savings 
(net 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
the interventions) 
could 
average 
20 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP. 
On 
average, 
this 
translates 
to 
an 
increase 
of 
0.2 
percentage 
points 
in 
the 
yearly 
GDP 
growth 
rate. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
waiting 
to 
intervene 
can 
cost 
countries 
an 
average 
of 
6 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP 
(20 percent 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Djibouti). 
Hence, 
the 
Government 
of 
Djibouti 
is 
taking 
an 
important 
step 
forward 
by 
preparing 
the 
current 
HIV/AIDS 
project. 
In 
the 
following 
sections 
we 
discuss 
the 
costs 
for 
the 
Djiboutian 
society 
of 
not 
implementing 
the 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
net 
benefits 
from 
its 
implementation. 
3. 
The 
costs 
of 
inaction 
in 
Djibouti 
A 
nationally 
representative 
zero-prevalence 
survey conducted 
in 
March 
2002 
as 
part 
of 
the 
preparation 
of 
this 
project 
reveals 
an 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
of 
2.9 
percent 
(CREDES, 
2002). 
In 
the 
city 
of 
Djibouti 
the 
prevalence 
rate 
is 
higher 
(3.4 percent), 
while 
in 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
country 
it 
is 
close 
to 
one percent. 
In 
the 
city 
of 
Djibouti 
the prevalence 
rate among 
men 
(3.1 
percent) 
is 
slightly 
lower 
than among 
women 
(3.4 
percent). 
Risks 
are 
higher 
among 
young 
adults 
in 
their 
most productive 
years 
(age 
25 
to 
34). 
The 
probability 
of 
infection 
among this 
group 
is 
three 
to four 
times higher 
than 
that 
of 
individuals 
younger 
than 
20 
or 
older than 
35. 
Four 
important 
risk 
factors 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
major 
epidemic 
are 
present: 
1. 
Large population 
flows 
are 
observed 
between 
Djibouti 
and 
Ethiopia, 
where  the  adult 
prevalence 
rate 
is 
close 
to 
11 
percent, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
migration 
and 
transportation activities 
(close 
to 
1,000 
trucks 
enter 
and 
exit 
Djibouti 
port 
on 
a 
daily 
basis). 
2. 
Prostitution 
is 
widespread, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
condoms 
is 
rare. 
A 
survey 
conducted 
in 
1994 
among 
men 
suffering STIs 
showed that 
57 
percent 
of 
men 
did 
not know 
their 
partners 
and 
that 
53.8 
percent 
had had 
rapports 
with 
sexual 
workers 
(see 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
2002). 
Yet, 
only 
2.5 
percent 
of 
them 
had 
used condoms. 
The 
strong 
foreign 
military 
presence 
contributes 
to 
the development 
of 
night-bars 
where 
the 
majority 
of 
sex 
workers 
operate. 
Condoms 
are 
not 
readily 
available 
and 
are 
expensive. 
3. 
While 
an 
exact estimate 
is 
not 
currently 
available, there 
is 
evidence 
that 
the prevalence 
of 
STIs 
is 
high. 
Close 
to 
8,500 
new 
STI 
cases 
are 
reported 
each year 
(Ministry 
of 
Health, 
2002). 
However, 
most 
patients 
suffering 
from 
STIs, 
particularly 
women, 
do 
not 
consult 
a 
health 
professional. 
Hence, 
it 
is 
estimated  that  there 
are 
currently 
25,000 
STI 
cases. 
Assuming 
that 
these 
occur 
in 
the 
population 
15-49, 
the 
implied 
prevalence rate 
is 
close 
to 
10 
percent. 
4. 
High 
poverty 
rates 
combined 
with 
income 
and 
gender 
inequality 
create 
an  ideal 
environment 
for 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Indeed, 
two 
studies  (Over, 
1997 
and 
World 
Bank 
2002c) 
have 
shown 
that 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rates increase 
when 
income 
per 
capita 
decreases, 
and 
when 
income 
and 
gender 
inequality 
- 
48 
- 
Page  55
(proxied 
by 
the 
gap 
between 
male 
and 
female literacy) 
increase. 
In 
Djibouti, 
despite a 
relatively 
high 
GDP 
per 
capita 
(US$800) 
compared 
to 
countries 
such 
as 
Yemen 
(US$320) 
and 
Ethiopia 
(US$1 
lo), 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
is 
considered 
poor. 
With 
a 
Gini 
coefficient 
of 
39, 
Djibouti 
is 
one 
of 
the 
countries 
with 
the highest 
concentration 
of 
income 
in 
the 
MENA 
region. 
Gender 
inequalities 
also 
seem 
to 
be 
pervasive. 
Women 
have 
a 
low 
participation 
rate 
in 
the 
labor 
force 
and 
a 
lower level 
of 
education 
than 
men 
(60 
percent 
of 
women 
aged 
20-29 
never 
attended 
school 
compared 
to  30 
percent 
for 
men). 
Population 
group 
Children 
and 
youth 
To 
evaluate the 
economic 
costs 
related 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
Djibouti, 
we 
use a 
modified 
version 
of 
the 
model 
developed 
in 
Robalino 
et 
al. 
(2002a) 
to 
generate 
plausible 
diffusion 
scenarios 
for 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
in 
Djibouti 
and 
estimate associated 
costs. 
The 
original model 
simulates 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic 
through 
two 
channels: 
sexual intercourse 
(which 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sexually transmitted 
diseases) 
and 
exchange 
of 
infected 
needles 
among 
injecting 
drug 
users. 
While 
the 
model 
is 
highly 
stylized, 
it 
is 
able 
to 
capture 
key 
features 
of 
the 
diffusion 
process. 
In 
the 
version 
used 
here 
we 
have 
ignored 
transmission 
through 
needle 
exchange, 
which 
is 
irrelevant 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Djibouti, 
and 
added 
mother-to-child 
transmission 
as 
an 
additional 
mechanism. 
We 
have 
also 
left 
out 
the 
macroeconomic 
module 
of 
the 
original 
model. 
Thus, 
the 
analysis 
presented 
here 
is 
not 
a 
general 
equilibrium 
analysis. 
We 
focus 
on 
estimating 
three 
categories 
of 
costs: 
i) 
treatment 
of 
AIDS 
patients 
(public 
and 
private 
costs); 
ii) 
costs 
of 
antiretroviral 
drugs; 
iii) 
other 
costs 
faced 
by 
households 
foregone 
revenue 
from 
higher 
morbidity 
and 
funeral 
costs); 
and 
iv) 
costs 
related 
to 
the years 
of 
life 
lost 
due 
to 
premature 
deaths. 
We 
do 
not 
assess 
how 
alternative 
financing 
mechanisms 
affect 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
economy and social 
welfare 
(see 
Robalino 
et 
al., 
2002a 
and 
Robalino 
et 
al., 
2002b). 
We 
also 
ignore 
the 
effects 
of 
the epidemic 
on 
total 
factor 
productivity, 
the 
accumulation 
of 
human 
capital, 
and 
economic 
growth. 
Hence, 
our 
estimates 
of 
costs 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
lower 
bound 
(see 
World 
Bank 
2000, 
for 
a 
similar 
approach).

Methods and 
assumptions 
We 
divide 
the 
Djiboutian 
population 
into 
four 
groups: 
(1) 
children 
and 
youth-age 
0 
to 
14; 
(2) 
males-age 
15 
to 
49; (3) 
women 
who 
do 
not 
engage 
in 
sexual 
work-age 
15 
to 
59, 
and 
(4) 
women 
who 
engage 
in 
sexual 
work-age 
15 
to 
40. 
The 
share 
of 
each 
population 
group 
is 
given 
in 
Table 
1. 
The total population 
evolves 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
age- 
and 
sex-specific 
fertility 
and 
mortality 
rates, 
which 
have 
been 
projected 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
Health, 
Nutrition, 
and 
Population 
group 
(see 
Figure 
2). 
The 
total 
population 
in 
year 
2002 
is 
estimated 
at 
658,000. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
fertility 
rates 
and 
mortality 
rates 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
decline,  thus 
increasing 
the 
share 
of 
the 
population 
over 
age 
23 
(see 
Figure 
3). 
From 
the 
projections 
of 
the 
total population 
by 
age 
and 
sex, 
the 
composition 
of 
our four 
subgroups 
follows 
naturally 
if 
we 
assume 
a constant 
share 
of 
sex 
workers 
in 
the 
female 
population. 
This 
share 
is 
more or 
less 
arbitrary,  since surveys 
of 
sex 
workers have 
not 
been conducted 
yet. 
We 
estimate 
that 
there 
are 
close 
to 
4,000  sex 
workers 
in 
Djibouti, 
which 
seems 
a 
conservative 
number 
given 
the 
large 
number 
of 
night-clubs 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Djibouti 
and 
the 
important foreign 
military 
presence4. 
Keeping 
the 
demand 
constant, a 
small 
population 
of 
sex 
workers 
speeds-up 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic.

Level and 
heterogeneity 
of 
sexual 
activity. 
Given 
scant 
information 
about sexual behaviors, 
the 
parameters 
determining 
the 
level 
and 
heterogeneity 
of 
sexual 
activity 
have been 
calibrated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Rehle 
et 
al., 
(1998) 
and 
anecdotal 
facts. 
Table 
3 
presents 
the 
average 
number 
of 
partners 
across 
population 
groups 
and 
the 
average 
number 
of 
sex acts 
per 
year. 
It 
is 
assumed 
that, 
on 
average, 
males 
have 
two 
female partners 
who 
are 
not 
sex 
workers, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
30 
sex 
acts 
per 
year 
with 
each 
partner. 
Moreover, 
the 
average 
male 
frequents 
eight 
to 
ten 
sex 
workers 
per 
year 
with 
an 
average 
number 
of 
sex 
acts 
of 
two 
to 
three 
per

with 
each

Prevalence 
of 
STIs 
and 
transmission 
probabilities. 
As 
previously 
discussed, 
there 
are 
no 
good 
data 
regarding 
the 
prevalence 
of 
STIs. 
To 
illustrate 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
variable 
on 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the epidemic 
we 
work 
with 
four 
values: 
0 
percent, 
5 
percent, 
10 
percent, 
and 
15 
percent. 
The 
current 
estimate 
is 
closer 
to 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15 
to 
49. 
Transmission probabilities 
by 
sex 
are 
based 
on 
Rehle 
et al. (1998). 
The 
values 
of 
the 
different 
parameters 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
4. 
Source:  Based 
on 
Rehle 
et 
al. 
(1998) and discussion

technical 
staff 
at 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
in 
Djibouti 
Use 
of 
condoms 
and 
effectiveness. 
We 
differentiate  between the 
utilization 
of 
condoms 
in 
groups 
2-3 
(men 
having 
sex 
with 
non-sex workers) 
and 
2-4 
(men 
having 
sex 
with 
sex 
workers). 
- 
51 
- 
Page  58
The 
data 
on 
utilization 
are 
also weak, 
but 
it 
is 
very 
unlikely 
that condoms 
are 
being 
used 
between 
spouses, 
and 
the 
utilization 
of 
condoms 
with 
sex 
workers 
or unknown 
partners 
seems 
to 
be 
considerably 
low 
(below 
2.5 
percent 
according 
to 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
2002). 
Nonetheless, 
we 
take 
a 
conservative  approach 
and 
consider  the 
following 
three 
cases 
for 
the  prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
between 
groups 2-3 
and 
2-4: 
low-case 
(2.5 
percent 
and 
5 
percent),  base-case 
(5 
percent 
and 
7.5 
percent), 
and 
high-case 
(5 
percent 
and  10 
percent). 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
a 
condom 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
98 percent 
(Le., 
the 
probabilities 
of 
transmission 
presented 
in 
Table 
4 
are 
reduced 
by 
98 
percent). 
Costs. 
The 
final 
ingredient 
for 
the 
analysis 
is 
the 
cost 
of 
various 
factors 
associated 
with 
the 
epidemic. 
As 
previously 
discussed, 
we 
look 
at 
four 
types 
of 
costs: 
costs 
of 
treatment 
excluding 
antiretroviral 
drugs 
(public 
and 
private); 
cost 
of 
antiretroviral 
drugs; 
other 
costs 
for 
households 
(foregone revenue 
and 
funerals); 
and 
the 
cost 
of 
years 
of 
life 
lost. 
The 
various 
assumptions 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
5. 
Costs 
of 
treatment 
excluding 
Antiretroviral 
(AR 
y) 
drugs. 
In 
terms 
of 
treatment, 
no 
reliable 
data 
are 
available 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Djibouti, 
although 
it 
is 
known 
that 
expenditures 
focus 
on 
opportunistic 
diseases. 
A 
1996 
report 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
states 
that 
12 
percent 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
in 
the 
Peltier 
Hospital 
were attributed 
to AIDS. 
Furthermore, 
eight 
percent 
of 
registered 
deaths 
were 
caused 
by 
the 
AIDS6. 
However, 
there 
are 
no 
data 
regarding 
the 
operational 
costs 
of 
the 
hospital. 
Thus, 
in 
our 
analysis 
we 
rely 
on 
estimates 
from 
the literature. 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
treatment  estimated 
from 
cross-country 
studies  ranges 
between 
two 
and 
three 
times 
GDP 
per 
capita 
(see 
Floyd 
and 
Gilks, 
2001). 
The 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
Chad 
Second 
Population 
and 
AIDS 
Project 
suggests 
an 
average 
annual 
cost 
of 
US$560 for 
Chad, 
and 
cites 
an 
average 
cost 
of 
US$125 
for 
Cote 
d’Ivoire 
(see 
World 
Bank, 
2000). 
Here 
we 
consider 
three 
plausible 
values 
for 
the 
annual 
cost 
of 
treatment:  US$lOO, 
US$300, 
and 
US$500. 
Costs 
of 
Antiretroviral 
(ARV) 
drugs. 
ARVs 
are 
almost 
nonexistent 
in 
Djibouti 
at 
the 
moment. 
A 
few 
AIDS 
patient 
are 
buying 
ARVs 
privately 
and 
a 
few 
others, 
no 
more 
than 
100 
patients, 
are 
treated 
with 
extemal 
funds. 
Hence, 
roughly 
0.5-1 
percent 
of 
all 
patients 
have 
access 
to 
ARVs. 
The 
cost 
of 
antiretroviral 
drugs 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$80-100 
per 
month 
per 
patient, 
including 
the 
tests  necessary 
to 
follow-up 
the  patient. 
In 
our 
analysis 
we 
use  a 
conservative 
figure 
of 
US$l,OOO 
per 
year 
per 
patient. 
We 
assume 
that 
individuals receiving 
ARVs 
face 
mortality 
rates 
equal 
to 
those 
of 
individuals 
who 
are 
not 
infected 
with 
HIV. 
The 
simulation program 
keeps 
track 
of 
the 
number 
of 
individuals 
by 
age 
and 
sex 
who 
are 
receiving 
ARVs 
at 
a 
particular 
point 
in 
time. 
This 
is 
like 
to 
be 
a 
underestimation 
given 
that 
most 
many 
deaths 
are 
registered 
are caused 
by 
opportunistic 
6 
infectious, even 
though 
the 
primary 
cause 
is 
AIDS.

Another 
source 
of 
uncertainty 
regarding 
costs 
relates 
to 
the 
level 
of 
foregone revenue due 
to 
sickness 
and 
the 
cost 
of 
funerals. 
The 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
Chad's 
Second 
Population 
and 
AIDS 
project 
(see 
World 
Bank, 
2002) 
reports 
that 
AIDS 
patients loose 
on 
average 
17.4 
days 
of 
work 
per 
month, 
compared 
to 
2.1 
days 
for non-AIDS 
patients 
(more 
than 
a 
50 
percent 
loss). 
Expenditures 
for 
funerals  represented 
twice 
the 
monthly 
income. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Tanzania, 
Over 
et 
al., 
(2001) 
reports 
funeral 
expenditures 
of 
US$800-900. 
In 
this 
analysis 
we 
use 
three  values 
for 
the 
foregone 
revenue: 
10 
percent, 
20 
percent, 
and 
50 
percent 
of 
average 
income 
in 
the 
formal 
sector 
(US$500 
per 
year 
according 
to 
the 
databases 
of 
contributors 
of 
private 
workers 
pension 
funds). 
The 
cost 
of 
funeral 
expenditures 
has 
been 
fixed 
at 
US$200.

Projections 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
Our 
assumptions  about 
the 
parameters 
determining 
the 
difhsion 
of 
the  epidemic 
outline 
48 
scenarios: 
four 
combinations 
of 
parameters 
determining 
the  heterogeneity 
and 
frequency 
of 
sexual 
acts 
(Table 
3); 
four 
values 
for 
the 
prevalence 
of 
STIs 
(Table 
4), 
and 
three 
cases 
for 
the 
prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
(see 
paragraph 
use 
of 
condoms  and 
effectiveness). 
All 
the 
other 
parameters 
determining 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic 
(e.g., 
the 
probabilities 
of 
transmission) 
are 
kept 
constant 
across scenarios. 
Not 
all 
of 
the 
scenarios 
resulting 
from 
the 
various 
combinations 
of 
parameters 
are 
equally 
likely. 
For 
instance, 
the prevalence 
of 
STIs 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
definitely 
higher 
than 
zero.  Nonetheless, 
by 
exploring 
this 
wide 
range 
of 
scenarios 
we 
are 
able 
to 
illustrate 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
different 
parameters 
in 
determining 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Below 
we 
present 
the 
main 
messages 
from 
the 
analysis. 
In 
what 
we 
consider 
the baseline 
scenario, 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate 
in 
Djibouti 
could 
attain 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15 
to 
49 
by 
year 2010. 
In 
this 
scenario, 
the 
average 
number 
of 
sexual 
partners 
who 
are 
sex 
workers 
is 
set 
to 
eight 
per 
year 
and 
the 
average 
number 
of 
sexual 
acts 
to 
two 
per 
year 
per 
partner. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
STIs 
is 
set 
at 
10 
percent 
(close 
to 
current 
estimates), 
and the prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
at 
2.5 
percent 
among 
groups 2 
and 
3, 
and 
5 
percent 
among 
groups 2 
and 
4. 
All 
the 
other 
parameters 
- 
53 
- 
Page  60
are 
set at 
the 
values 
indicated 
in 
Tables 
2 
to 
3. 
Under 
this 
scenario, 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
among 
sex 
workers 
could 
reach 
60 
percent 
by 
year 
2012 
(see 
Figure 
4). 
New 
infections 
per 
year 
could 
grow 
from 
close 
to 
3,000 
per 
year 
today 
to 
10,000 
in 
year 2010.

Average number 
of 
sexual workers partners 
is 
set 
to 
8. 
Average  number 
of 
contacts per partner 
(sex 
worker) 
is 
set 
to 
2 
per year. 
Prevalence 
of 
STIs 
is 
set 
at 
10 
percent.  Prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
is 
set 
at 
2.5 
percent among groups 
2 
and 
3, 
and at 
5 
percent among 
groups 
2 
and 
4 
(men 
with 
sex 
workers). 
Source: 
Authors' 
calculations. 
A 
key 
factor 
determining 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
epidemic 
is 
the prevalence 
of 
STIs. 
If 
in 
the 
previous 
scenario 
the  prevalence 
rate 
was 
0 
percent 
instead 
of 
10 
percent, 
the 
HIVIAIDS 
prevalence rate 
would 
remain 
below 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15-49 
(see 
Figure 
5). 
The 
prevalence rate 
among 
sex 
workers 
would 
decrease 
slightly. 
This 
occurs 
because 
the 
probability 
of 
infection 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
STI 
is 
10 
to 
30 
times 
higher than 
without 
an 
STI. 
These 
results 
show 
the 
importance 
of 
treating 
STIs, 
particularly 
among 
sex 
workers 
(see 
next 
Section). 
Small 
changes 
in 
the 
use 
of 
condoms 
have 
little 
incidence 
in 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the epidemic. 
For 
instance, 
if 
in 
the 
first 
scenario 
the 
prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
increased 
from 
2.5 
percent 
to 
5 
percent 
among 
groups 
2 
and 
3, 
and 
from 
5 
percent 
to 
7.5 
percent 
among 
groups 
2 
and 
4, 
the 
prevalence rate 
in 
year 
2010 
would be 
reduced 
by 
less 
than 
one 
percentage 
point 
(see 
Figure 
6). 
Hence, 
our 
current 
uncertainty 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
condoms, 
0 
to 
5 
percent, 
does 
not 
affect 
considerably our 
estimates 
of 
future 
prevalence 
rates. 
This 
being 
said, 
however, larger 
changes 
(in 
the order 
of 
20 
percentage 
points) 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
condom 
use 
can have 
dramatic 
impacts 
on 
the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic 
(see 
next 
Section). 
The 
heterogeneity 
and 
frequency 
of 
sexual 
acts are also 
key 
factors 
influencing 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
If 
in 
the 
first 
scenario 
the 
average 
number 
of 
partners 
who 
are 
sexual 
workers 
increased 
from 
eight 
to 
ten 
and the 
average 
number 
of 
contacts 
from two 
to 
three 
per 
partner, 
then 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
in 
year 
2010 
could 
attain 
20 
percent 
(see 
Figure 
7). 
Thus, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
next 
section, 
interventions 
that 
promote 
changes 
in 
sexual  behaviors 
are 
essential 
components 
of 
a strategy 
to 
fight 
the epidemic.

In 
conclusion, 
the 
combination 
of 
an 
already 
important 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate, 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
STIs, 
widespread 
commercial 
sex, 
and 
virtually 
no 
condom 
use 
sets 
the 
ideal 
conditions 
for 
the development 
of 
a 
major 
epidemic 
in 
Djibouti. 
In 
the 
next 
section 
we 
look 
at 
the 
potential 
costs 
of 
this 
epidemic. 
-

Page  62
Potential 
costs 
To 
illustrate  the  magnitude 
and 
dynamics 
of 
various 
costs, 
we 
use 
the 
baseline 
scenario 
discussed 
in 
the 
previous 
section7. 
We 
look 
at 
nine 
costs scenarios 
combining 
three 
values 
for 
the 
cost 
of 
treatment 
(mostly 
treatment 
of 
opportunistic 
diseases) 
and 
three values 
for 
the 
level 
of 
foregone 
revenue 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
We 
keep constant 
across 
scenarios 
the 
cost 
of 
funerals. 
Given 
that 
the 
use 
of 
ARVs 
is 
marginal 
the 
associate costs are 
not 
included 
in 
this 
part 
of 
the 
analysis. 
We 
find 
that 
even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
most 
conservative  scenario 
(cost 
of 
treatment 
excluding 
ARVs 
equal 
to 
USD 
100 
per 
year 
and forgone 
revenue equal 
to 
USD 
50 
per 
year), 
the 
total 
costs 
of 
the epidemic, 
excluding 
the 
years 
of 
life 
lost, 
would 
approximate 
two 
percent 
of 
GDP 
per 
year. 
In 
addition, 
the 
costs 
of 
years 
of 
life 
lost 
could 
represent 
10 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
year 
2010 
and 
exceed 
20 
percent 
by 
year 
2020 
(see 
Figure 
8). 
With 
more 
realistic 
assumptions 
about 
costs 
(Le., 
treatment 
costs 
USD 
300 
per 
year 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
patients 
forego 
USD 
150 
per 
year), 
the 
costs 
of 
the epidemic 
(excluding 
years 
of 
lost 
life) 
could 
surpass 
four 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
year 2010, 
and 
peak 
at 
six 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
year 
2015 
(see 
Figure 
9). 
If 
the 
cost 
of 
treatment 
approximated 
USD 
500 
per 
year 
and 
the 
revenue 
foregone 
due 
to 
the 
disease 
was 
closer 
to 
USD 
250 
year, 
then 
costs 
by 
year 
2010 
would 
surpass 
eight percent 
of 
GDP 
(see 
Figure 
10). 
Our

In 
summary,  the 
epidemic 
will 
impose large 
costs 
on 
the 
Djiboutian 
society. 
The 
cumulative 
costs 
of 
treatment 
and 
foregone revenue 
for 
the 
period 
2002-2028 
could 
range 
between 12 
and 
57 
percent 
of 
current 
GDP 
(see 
Table 
6). 
The 
12 
percent 
figure 
corresponds 
to 
very 
conservative 
assumptions  about 
unit 
costs. 
Most 
likely, 
the 
average 
cost 
of 
treatment  and 
the 
average 
foregone  revenue 
will 
be 
above 
USD 
300 
and 
USD 
150, 
respectively. 
Cumulative 
costs 
then 
would 
be 
over 
30 
percent 
of 
current 
GDP. 
If 
on 
top 
of 
that 
we 
add 
the cost 
of 
years 
of 
life 
lost 
due 
to 
premature 
deaths (22.4 
percent 
in 
year 
2015), 
the 
present 
value 
of 
aggregate costs 
could 
represent several 
times 
today's 
GDP.

4. 
The 
net 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
Not 
all 
the 
interventions 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
can 
be 
easily 
evaluated 
in 
monetary 
terms; 
for 
instance 
those 
related 
to 
community 
projects. 
Here 
we 
focus 
on 
three 
core 
preventive 
interventions: 
i) 
increasing 
the prevalence 
of 
condom 
use; 
ii) 
treating 
STIs; 
and 
iii) 
changing 
sexual behaviors. 
In 
addition 
we 
assess 
the 
economic 
and 
epidemiological 
consequences 
of 
providing 
access 
to 
ARVs. 
To 
illustrate 
economic 
costs 
and 
benefits, 
we 
have 
defined 
a 
few 
conservative 
targets 
for 
the 
various interventions. 
Given 
the 
project 
budget, 
USD 
12 
million, 
we 
compute internal 
rates 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
across 
a 
large 
number 
of 
epidemiological 
and 
economic 
scenarios. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
this 
analysis 
will 
guide 
the 
allocation 
of 
project 
resources. 
Impact 
of 
selected 
interventions 
Increasing condom 
use 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
sexual 
acts 
with 
sex 
workers 
and 
to 
25 
percent 
of 
sexual 
acts 
with 
non-sex 
workers. 
If 
these 
targets 
are achieved, 
the 
number 
of 
new 
infections 
each 
year 
could 
be 
reduced 
by 
30 to 
60 
percent 
from 
the 
baseline 
(see 
Table 
7). 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
baseline 
scenario 
2,300 
infections 
could 
be 
averted 
in 
2005  and 
over 
10,000 
infections 
by 
2025. 
These 
targets 
imply 
that 
additional 
3 
to 
4.3 
million 
condoms 
will 
be 
consumed 
each 
year, 
costing US$2.2 
to 
3.2 
million. 
The 
project 
will 
finance 
initially 
(Le., 
during 
the 
first 
four 
years) 
part 
of 
these 
costs, 
but 
mechanisms 
for 
a 
more 
sustainable 
delivery 
of 
condoms 
are 
necessary. 
Further 
analyses  are 
required, 
for 
instance, 
to 
establish  the 
viability 
of 
social 
marketing 
in 
Djibouti.

Reducing 
by 
half 
the 
average 
number 
of 
sexual 
partners 
who 
are 
sexual 
workers. 
This 
intervention 
could 
avert 
2,100 
new 
infections 
in 
year 2005 
and 
up 
to 
7,000 
infections 
by 
year 
2025. 
To 
achieve 
this 
target, 
the 
project 
will 
allocate 
resources 
to 
support 
community 
development 
to  provide 
other  income-generating 
activities 
to 
sex 
workers  and 
to 
carry 
out 
information 
campaigns about 
the 
risks 
of 
engaging 
in 
sex 
work. 
While 
the effectiveness 
of 
these 
interventions 
remains 
unknown, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
demand 
for 
commercial 
sex 
in 
determining 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the epidemic 
justifies 
allocating project 
resources 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis.

Reducing by 
two-thirds 
current 
prevalence 
of 
STIs. 
This 
intervention 
could 
also 
avert 
3,000 
infections 
in 
year 
2005 
and 
close 
to 
7,000 
new 
infections 
by 
year 2025. 
At 
this 
stage, 
the 
costs 
of 
treatment 
of 
various 
STIs 
in 
Djibouti 
are 
not 
available. 
Nonetheless, 
in 
other 
countries, 
studies 
have 
demonstrated the cost-effectiveness 
of 
this 
intervention 
(see 
Jenkins 
et 
al., 
2002 
for 
a discussion). 
Thus, 
this 
project 
will 
allocate 
an important 
share 
of 
resources 
to 
increase 
access 
to 
treatment 
and 
ensure 
the 
availability 
of 
the 
necessary 
medical 
inputs 
and 
drugs. 
Providing 
access 
to 
antiretroviral 
drugs. 
While 
the 
demand 
for 
antiretroviral 
drugs 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
high, 
our 
analysis 
suggests 
that 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
intervention 
would 
not 
be 
affordable. 
The 
current  annual 
cost 
of 
ARV 
drugs 
(US$l,OOO) 
is 
over  10 
times 
the 
current 
level 
of 
per-capita 
expenditures 
in 
health. 
As 
an 
illustration, 
providing 
access 
to 
ARVs 
to 
50 
percent 
of 
current 
HIV/AIDS 
infected 
individuals 
would 
initially 
cost 
USD 
5.5 
million. 
Hence, 
the 
project 
could 
finance 
roughly 
two 
years 
of 
drugs. 
We 
have 
simulated 
the 
economic 
and 
epidemiological 
impacts 
of 
providing 
access 
to 
ARVs 
to 
20 
percent 
of 
newly 
infected 
patients. 
Our 
results 
show 
that, 
due 
to 
the 
fact that 
individuals 
receiving 
ARVs 
continue 
to 
be 
infective, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
other interventions, 
providing 
access 
to 
ARVs 
could 
increase 
the prevalence 
rate 
(see 
Table 
7). 
This 
relatively 
modest 
intervention 
in 
terms 
of 
outreach, 
would still 
cost 
over 
US$1 
million 
per 
year. 
More 
importantly, 
the 
cost 
of 
each 
life 
saved 
using 
this 
strategy 
would 
increase 
over 
time 
reaching 
1,800 
per 
life 
saved 
in 
year 
2025. 
This 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
expansion 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
condom 
use, 
where 
the 
cost 
per 
life 
saved 
decreases 
over 
time 
reaching US$336 
in 
year 2025. 
With 
this 
consideration, 
the 
current 
project 
will 
minimize 
the 
level 
of 
resources 
that 
are 
allocated 
to 
ARV. 
Instead, 
the focus 
in 
the 
area 
of 
treatment 
will 
be 
in 
enforcing institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
health 
centers 
receiving 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
Implementing 
simultaneously the 
three 
preventive interventions. 
Our 
results 
show 
that 
the 
combined 
preventive  interventions 
could 
significantly 
reduce, 
and  almost 
eliminate, 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
over 
the 
next 
25 
years. 
The number 
of 
new 
infections 
averted 
could 
increase 
from 
1,300 
in 
year 
2005 
to 
over 
15,000 
in 
year 
2025 
(see 
Table 
7). 
We 
notice 
that 
when 
combining 
the 
preventive interventions 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
ARVs, 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
over 
the 
long-run 
remains 
at  1.6 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15-49. 
Again,  this 
is 
because 
of 
individuals 
who 
continue 
to 
display 
risky 
behaviors can 
be 
infective 
over longer 
periods 
of 
time. 
Inevitably 
therefore, 
to 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
years 
of 
life 
gained through 
the 
use 
of 
ARVs, 
policy 
makers need 
to 
subtract 
not only 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
treatment 
itself, 
but 
also 
the 
costs 
associated 
with 
a 
potentially 
higher 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate. 
To 
minimize 
these 
costs, 
when 
ARVs 
are 
used 
patients 
should 
be 
carefully monitored 
and 
counseling 
used 
to 
promote 
safe 
sexual behaviors. 
The 
potential 
net 
benefits 
of 
the 
project and 
its 
financial 
sustainability. 
The 
project 
has 
a 
total 
cost 
of 
US$12 
million, 
over 
a 
period 
of 
four 
years. 
If 
the 
project 
is 
able 
to 
achieve 
simultaneously the 
targets 
defined 
in 
the previous 
section 
(except 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
ARV 
drugs), 
the 
present 
value 
of 
net 
benefits 
for 
the 
period 
2003-2027 
would 
approximate 
10 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP. 
The project 
generates 
high 
intemal 
rates 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
across 
a 
large 
number 
of 
scenarios 
(see 
Figure 
11). 
In 
the 
two 
panels 
of 
Figure 
1 
1 
each 
bar 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
given 
intemal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR). 
The height 
of 
the 
bar 
represents 
the 
number 
of 
explored 
scenarios 
that 
generate 
that 
particular 
IRR. 
We 
observe 
that even 
as 
early 
as 
year 
2008 
the 
IRR 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
positive 
in 
most 
cases. 
The 
few 
instances 
where 
internal 
rates 
of 
return 
are 
negative refer 
to 
scenarios 
with 
low 
unit 
costs 
and 
low 
levels 
of 
sexual interaction. 
By 
year 
2025, 
none 
of 
the 
scenarios 
would 
generate 
negative 
IRRs 
and 
in 
most 
cases 
the 
IRRs 
would 
be 
above 
30 
percent.  Hence, 
the economic rationale 
for 
the 
project 
is 
very 
strong.

Clearly,  the 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
various  interventions 
is 
today 
at 
risk. 
While 
the 
government 
should 
not 
aim 
at 
subsidizing 
in 
full 
condoms 
and 
ARVs, 
a 
minimum 
budget 
is 
necessary 
to 
sustain 
community 
interventions, 
screening 
and 
monitoring 
systems, 
and 
information 
campaigns. 
Given 
the  current 
financial 
crisis 
of 
the 
health 
sector, 
the 
necessary 
resources  are 
not 
likely 
to 
be 
available 
over 
the 
medium-term 
without 
donor 
support. 
The 
financial 
crisis 
of 
the 
health 
sector 
reflects 
not only 
inappropriate 
financing 
mechanisms, 
but 
also 
low 
levels 
of 
technical 
and 
allocative efficiency. 
The 
very 
high 
costs 
of 
medical inputs and 
in 
particular 
drugs, 
is 
an 
illustration 
of 
the 
problem 
(see 
CREDES 
2002). 
It 
is 
expected that the 
Health 
Sector 
Reform 
Project 
will 
address 
these 
problems. 
The 
project 
will 
not only 
to review 
financing 
mechanisms, 
but 
also 
seeks 
to 
rationalize 
the 
budget 
process 
to improve 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources 
across 
levels  and 
types 
of 
interventions. 
Introducing 
these 
reforms 
is 
a 
pre- 
condition 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the current project. 
5. 
Conclusions 
This 
short 
note 
presents 
the 
results 
of 
the 
economic 
analysis 
of 
the 
Djibouti 
HIV/AIDS 
project. 
The note 
discusses 
the mechanisms 
through 
which 
the 
epidemic can affect 
the 
economy 
and 
provides 
justifications 
for 
government 
intervention. 
Projections 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
rate 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
sexual 
behaviors 
are 
developed. 
These 
projections 
are 
based 
on 
a 
model 
that 
simulates the 
diffusion 
of 
the 
epidemic 
through 
two 
channels: 
sexual 
intercourse 
and 
mother-to-child 
transmission. 
Given 
limited 
epidemiological 
and 
behavioral 
data, 
the 
analysis 
explores 
large 
regions 
of 
the  parameter 
space. 
We 
find 
that 
even 
under 
conservative 
assumptions about 
the 
heterogeneity 
and 
frequency 
of 
sexual 
acts, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
STIs, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
condoms, 
Djibouti 
could 
experience a 
major 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic. 
In 
the 
baseline 
scenario 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate 
could 
attain 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
aged 
15-49 
by 
year 
2010. 
In 
more 
pessimistic 
scenarios 
the 
prevalence rate 
could 
attain 
20 
percent. 
The 
economic 
costs 
of 
the 
epidemic 
are 
considerable. 
In 
the 
baseline 
scenario, 
the 
costs 
of 
treatment 
(excluding 
ARVs) 
and 
the 
foregone 
revenue 
of 
individuals 
affected 
by 
the 
epidemic 
could 
surpass 
six 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
year 
2010. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
years 
of 
life 
lost 
due 
to 
premature 
deaths 
could 
exceed 
30 
percent 
by 
year 2010.  These 
are 
considered 
low-end 
estimates 
as 
the 
analysis 
ignores 
the 
impact 
that  the 
epidemic 
can 
have 
on 
the 
accumulation 
of 
human 
capital, 
total 
factor 
productivity, 
and 
through 
this 
channel economic 
growth. 
Indeed, 
previous 
analyses 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
could 
reduce 
the 
growth 
rate 
of 
GDP 
in 
Djibouti 
by 
at 
least one percentage 
point.

Page  68
In 
a  second 
part 
the 
note 
discusses 
the 
impact 
of 
three 
core  interventions 
targeted 
by 
this 
program: 
increasing 
the 
use 
of 
condoms; 
reducing 
the 
prevalence 
of 
STIs; 
and 
changing 
sexual 
behaviors 
to 
reduce 
the 
demand 
for 
commercial 
sex. 
The 
results 
of 
the analysis 
show 
that 
these 
interventions can have 
dramatic effects 
on 
the 
dynamics 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Individually, 
each 
of 
these 
interventions 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
reduce 
new 
infections 
by 
30-60 
percent 
per 
year. 
The 
project 
can 
be 
of 
great 
benefit 
to 
the 
Djiboutian 
society. 
If 
the 
targets 
of 
the 
project 
are achieved, 
the 
present 
value 
of 
net benefits 
for 
the 
period 
2002-2028 
can 
surpass 
10 
percent 
of 
today’s 
GDP. 
Across 
a 
large 
number 
of 
scenarios 
the 
internal 
rates 
of 
retum 
of 
the 
project 
are 
positive 
starting 
in 
year 
2008. 
By 
year 
2025 
internal 
rates 
of 
retum 
surpass 
30 
percent 
in 
most 
cases. 
No 
large recurrent 
costs are expected, 
and 
therefore 
there 
are 
no 
negative 
fiscal 
impacts. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
by 
reducing 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate 
the 
project 
will 
reduce 
the 
pressure 
on 
the 
public 
health 
budget. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
various interventions and 
therefore the 
full 
realization 
of 
the 
project’s benefits require 
progress 
in 
two 
areas. 
First, 
identifying 
appropriate mechanisms 
to 
supply 
and 
price 
condoms, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
public 
absorbs 
a 
fair 
share 
of 
the 
costs. 
Second, 
and 
more 
importantly, 
advancing 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
health 
sector. 
Financing 
mechanisms, 
budget 
process, 
and 
delivery 
systems 
need 
to 
be 
reviewed 
to 
improve 
the 
allocation 
of 
resources, 
reduce 
costs, 
and 
bring 
higher 
quality 
and 
access. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
these 
reforms 
the 
health 
sector 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
the 
public 
interventions 
necessary 
to 
keep 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
under 
control.

Procurement 
General 
1. 
Public 
procurement 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
National 
Procurement 
Decree 
of 
1995. 
The 
“Commission 
des 
March& 
is 
the 
national 
agency 
that 
evaluates 
all 
bids 
for 
amounts 
which 
exceed 
FDJ 
5,000,000 
(roughly 
US$28,000). 
The  Commission 
includes 
13 
permanent  members 
from 
different 
govemment offices and 
is 
headed 
by 
the  Secretary 
General 
of 
the 
Govemment. 
While 
preparation 
of 
technical drawings 
and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
civil 
works and 
goods, 
and 
RFPs 
for 
consultant 
services 
are 
decentralized 
to 
the 
line 
ministries,  evaluation 
of 
bids 
and 
proposals 
are 
conducted 
with 
the 
Commission. 
For 
each 
contract 
higher 
than 
the above-mentioned threshold, 
the 
Commission 
assigns 
the 
evaluation 
subcommittee 
with 
a 
representative 
from 
the 
ministry 
concerned. 
This 
subcommittee 
conducts 
the 
evaluation 
of 
bids/proposals 
and 
submits 
its 
report 
with 
an 
award 
recommendation 
to 
the 
“Commission” 
for 
approval. 
An 
evaluation 
of 
the  “Code 
des 
marchis” 
was 
carried out 
during 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Health 
Sector 
Development 
Project 
(HSDP) 
(see 
Project Appraisal 
Document). 
A 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR) 
has 
not 
been 
carried 
out 
to 
date. 
However, 
the 
first 
CPAR 
for 
Djibouti 
is 
scheduled 
for 
delivery 
to 
the 
authorities 
in 
early 
FY04, 
with 
a 
set 
of 
findings 
of 
weaknesses 
in 
the  current 
legal framework 
as 
well 
actionable 
recommendations 
to 
a 
phased-manner 
reform 
(given 
Djibouti’s 
institutional 
capacity 
constraints) 
of

will 
be 
carried 
out 
in

with 
the  guidelines 
for 
Procurement

would 
be 
used where 
practicable, 
particularly 
for

Procurement Capacity 
Assessment 
5. 
A 
first 
phase 
procurement capacity 
assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
the February 2003 mission. 
As 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
was 
not 
fully 
staffed 
or 
fully 
functional,  the 
assessment 
focused 
on 
the 
Credit Administration 
Unit 
(CAU) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
The 
CAU 
is 
currently 
responsible 
for 
the 
HSDP 
and 
has 
also 
been 
responsible 
for 
the management 
of 
the 
PPF 
and the 
Japanese 
Grant accorded 
to 
the 
AIDS 
project. 
The 
main 
conclusions 
of 
this 
first 
assessment 
is 
that  the 
CAU 
will 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened 
first 
by 
a 
procurement 
assistant 
given 
that 
the 
procurement 
unit 
in 
the 
CAU 
is 
at present 
only 
staffed 
with 
one 
person 
(the 
Procurement 
Officer). 
As 
the 
HSDP 
is 
currently 
underway,  the 
management 
of 
the transitory 
phase 
will 
put 
added 
pressure 
on 
the 
CAU 
and the 
Procurement 
Officer. 
To 
follow 
up 
on 
management 
capacity, 
the 
Procurement 
Officer 
will 
participate 
in 
a 
procurement 
course 
on 
goods 
in 
Dakar, 
Senegal 
in 
AprilMay 
2003 
(to 
be  financed 
under  the  HSDP). 
The 
second 
recommendation 
is 
that technical 
assistance, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
consultant 
specialized 
in 
procurement 
and 
project 
management, 
be  recruited 
under 
the 
AIDS-PPF 
financing, 
who 
can 
assist 
the 
CAU 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
present 
project 
(HIV/AIDS). 
Such technical 
assistance, 
particularly 
in 
procurement 
planning 
and administration 
aspect, 
as 
well 
as 
carrying out 
a 
serious 
skills 
transfer 
program 
to 
the 
existing 
CAU 
procurement 
staff 
and the 
Procurement 
Unit 
to 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
(ES), 
as 
the 
agency 
ultimately 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
the project. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
TA 
be 
recruited 
by 
mid-June  2003. 
In 
addition, 
the 
CAU 
is 
currently 
in 
the process 
of 
selecting 
a 
firm 
to 
prepare 
the 
operations 
manual 
for 
the 
HSDP. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that the 
same 
firm’s 
TOR 
be 
extended 
to 
include 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Project  Operational 
Manual 
and 
the 
Community 
Intervention 
Manual  for 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
project.

to 
assess 
the 
ES 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
before 
the 
end 
of 
May 
2003. 
In 
summary, 
the 
timeline 
is

Procurement 
Plan 
7. 
Draft 
procurement plans were 
to 
be 
prepared 
during 
appraisal, 
however,  the 
lone 
Procurement 
Specialist 
in 
the 
CAU 
had 
only 
made 
a start 
on 
the contract 
packaging and 
scheduling 
for 
items 
to 
be 
procured 
under 
the 
PPF. 
A 
first 
working 
draft 
was 
subsequently presented at 
negotiations and 
found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
The 
National 
Strategic Plan, 
which 
was prepared 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
consultants 
funded 
under 
a 
PHRD 
grant, 
has 
been 
validated. 
This 
comprises the 
basic 
elements 
for 
the procurement activities 
to 
be 
financed  under the project, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
other 
donors. 
The 
overall 
activities, 
budget 
cost, 
and 
responsibility 
matrix 
have been 
approved 
by 
the 
stakeholders 
concerned. 
As 
this 
is 
a 
multi-sector 
project, 
the 
exact 
mix 
of 
procurement 
will 
be 
determined 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
during 
joint 
reviews 
between 
the 
ES, 
line 
ministries, 
IDA, 
and 
other partners 
where 
a 
draft 
procurement 
plan 
as 
well 
as 
multi-sectoral 
work 
for 
the 
following 
financial 
year 
will 
be 
presented 
and 
agreed 
upon. 
Procurement 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
8. 
The 
overall coordination 
of 
program 
implementation 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
ES, 
with 
each 
participating 
line 
ministry 
and 
community 
group 
responsible 
for 
implementation 
of 
their 
relevant 
work 
programs 
or 
sub-projects. 
Procurement 
by 
the 
line 
ministries 
would 
be 
limited to 
expenditures 
of 
US$20,000. 
The project 
will 
recruit 
an 
international 
procurement expert 
to 
assist 
the 
ES 
for 
at 
least the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the project, 
to 
be 
extended 
following 
an 
assessment 
of 
project 
performance. 
9. 
As 
the 
project 
has 
a 
community 
subproject 
component,  the 
procurement  undertaken 
for 
this 
activity 
will 
be 
governed 
by 
the Project Operational 
Manual 
(POM), 
and paragraph 
3.15 
of 
the guidelines 
will 
apply. 
The 
ES 
will 
oversee 
procurement 
management 
and 
will 
ensure 
that procurement 
procedures, 
funding, 
and 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
subprojects 
agreed 
with 
IDA, 
and 
described 
in 
the 
POM, 
are 
satisfactorily  compliance 
with. 
As 
there  are 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
NGOs 
capable 
of 
handling 
the 
procurement 
requirements, the 
ES 
will 
carry 
out 
all 
procurement activities 
until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
NGOs 
and 
associations are 
trained 
in 
the procurement requirements 
for 
the 
project. 
Once 
the 
NGOs/associations 
are 
fully 
trained, 
the 
bidding 
process 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
them 
using 
simpler documentation 
(to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
POM). 
Community 
subprojects 
will 
be small 
in 
general, 
averaging 
$2,000 
to 
$5,000. 
Procurement Methods 
10. 
Civil 
Works: 
Civil 
works 
estimated 
to 
cost 
approximately 
US$l 
.O 
million 
under the 
project 
will 
comprise 
mainly 
the 
renovation 
of 
the 
biology 
laboratory 
of 
the Peltier 
General 
Hospital 
and 
the 
renovatiodnew 
construction 
of 
the 
Centre 
Yonis 
Toussaint. 
It 
is 
foreseen that 
this 
would 
concern 
predominantly 
local 
enterprises 
that 
have the 
capacity 
to 
undertake 
this 
type 
of 
construction; 
at least 2-3 
construction 
companies have 
the 
capacity 
to 
undertake 
large 
construction 
jobs. 
In 
addition, 
ADETP 
may 
be 
sought 
for 
certain 
renovation 
activities, 
which 
would 
be 
evaluated 
at the 
time 
of 
the 
request. 
The 
contracts 
being 
considered 
are 
too 
small 
to 
attract 
the  interest 
of 
foreign 
construction 
companies outside 
Djibouti; 
therefore, 
all civil 
works 
contracts 
will 
likely 
be 
awarded under 
NCB 
procedures. 
The 
technical drawings and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project 
are 
being 
developed. 
IDA 
will 
review 
all 
architectural drawings 
as 
well 
as 
the 
bidding 
documents 
for 
all civil 
works 
contracts.

1. 
Goods: 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
goods 
is 
estimated at 
US$2.1 
million 
and 
would 
comprise: 
(a) 
drugs, 
testing 
kits, 
condoms, 
and 
medical 
consumables; 
(b) 
furniture, 
computers, 
information 
systems, 
vehicles, 
documentatiodguides,  and 
general equipment; and 
(c) 
food 
supplies 
(World Food 
Program). 
With 
regard 
to 
medicines and 
medical 
supplies, 
due 
to 
existing 
shortages 
(and 
because 
the 
HSDP 
covers 
only 
an 
emergency purchase 
for 
the 
first 
year, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
first 
stock 
for 
the 
still 
to 
be 
established 
Centrale 
d 
’Achats 
de 
Mddicaments 
et 
de 
Matbriels 
Essentiels 
(CAMME)), 
the 
current 
project 
will 
purchase 
needed 
medicine 
at 
least 
for 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
project for 
the 
pilot 
project, 
STIs, 
ARVs, 
as 
well 
as 
condoms. 
Condoms 
may 
be 
purchased 
through 
the 
UNFPA 
program, 
which 
is 
currently 
providing 
condoms 
for 
national health 
projects. 
Once the 
CAMME 
is 
functional,  and 
if 
it 
has 
developed procedures 
acceptable 
to 
IDA, 
the 
possibility 
of 
purchasing 
drugs 
and 
medicine 
from 
the 
CAMME 
will 
be 
explored 
as 
needed, 
and 
the 
Development 
Grant 
Agreement 
may 
be 
amended once 
the 
evaluation 
is 
satisfactory. 
12. 
Procurement 
of 
goods 
will 
be 
bulked 
where 
feasible 
into 
packages 
valued 
at  US$55,000 
equivalent 
or 
more and 
will 
be procured through 
ICB.

below 
US$lOO,OOO 
equivalent, 
and 
up 
to 
an

may 
be 
procured 
through 
National

may 
be

by 
soliciting 
at  least  three 
competitive

from 
suppliers. 
Standard request 
forms and 
establishment 
of 
guidelines 
for 
using 
shopping 
methods 
will 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank’s memorandum 
of 
June 
8, 
2000 
on 
“guidance 
procurement 
note 
on

Consultant 
Services. 
Under 
consulting 
services, 
the 
project 
will 
finance 
several consultant 
services 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
various 
activities 
under 
the 
project, 
such 
as 
setting 
up 
sound 
surveillance 
systems, 
training 
on

In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
finance the 
audit 
fees 
for 
the 
project. 
14. 
Services 
to be 
contracted 
include long-term 
and short-term 
international and national 
consultants. 
Quality-Cost-Based 
Selection 
(QCBS) 
will 
be 
the 
preferred 
method 
to 
be 
used 
for 
the 
employment 
of 
firms. 
However, and 
as 
deemed 
necessary, 
consultant 
firms 
equal 
to 
or 
below 
US$50,000 
equivalent 
per 
contract, 
up 
to 
an aggregate 
amount 
of 
US$500,000  equivalent, 
may 
be 
selected 
using 
Consultant’s 
Qualifications 
(CQ) 
procedures, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
training institutes 
(for 
contract 
amounts 
not 
exceeding 
US50,OOO). 
Single-source 
selection 
(SS) 
would 
be 
accorded, 
on 
a 
prior-review 
basis, 
for 
very 
small 
assignments 
below 
US$5,000. 
Single-source selection 
(SS) 
is 
also accorded 
for 
managing 
works 
under 
component 
1 
of 
the 
project 
for 
an  amount 
not 
exceeding  US$150,000  based 
on 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
firm 
by 
IDA 
prior 
to 
award, and the 
WHO 
for 
managing parts 
of 
components 
1 
and 
2 
for 
an 
amount 
not 
exceeding US$400,000. 
Individual 
consultants 
would 
be procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
Section 
V 
of 
the 
consultant 
guidelines. 
15. 
Multisectoral 
sub-projects 
would 
comprise 
the 
purchase 
of 
small 
quantities 
of 
goods, 
consultant 
services 
for 
small 
assignments, 
dissemination 
seminars, etc. Purchases 
that 
require 
grouping 
for 
cost- 
efficiency, 
and consultant services 
which 
would 
cover 
larger 
targeted groups 
would 
be 
hired 
by 
the 
ES. 
The 
modalities 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
multisectoral 
subprojects 
would 
be  defined 
in 
the 
POM. 
Community 
sub-grants 
would 
comprise 
the 
purchase 
of 
small 
quantities 
of 
goods and services 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
as 
grants 
for 
community-based 
sub-projects 
by

issued 
during 
the 
first 
year 
will 
be 
reviewed and 
cleared 
with 
IDA 
on 
a 
prior-review 
basis, 
as 
the 
ES 
is 
a 
new 
institution.  Based 
on 
performance, 
the 
second year’s 
prior-review 
will 
be 
assessed. 
In 
general, 
all 
ICB, 
all

contracts, 
and the 
first 
three 
NCB 
contracts 
for 
goods regardless 
of

and 
subsequently 
all 
contracts 
for 
goods estimated 
to 
cost 
the equivalent 
of 
$80,000 
or 
more 
will 
follow 
the procedures 
set 
forth 
in 
paragraphs 
2 
and 
3 
of 
appendix

would 
be 
subject 
to 
post-review 
in 
accordance 
with 
paragraph

appendix 
I 
of 
the 
guidelines. 
All 
TORS 
for 
consultant 
contracts 
(firms 
and 
individuals) 
will 
be 
subject

prior-review 
by 
IDA. 
All 
consulting 
contracts 
costing 
US$lOO,OOO 
equivalent 
or 
more 
for 
firms 
would be 
subject 
to 
IDA 
prior-review. 
For 
consulting 
contracts 
costing 
less 
than 
US$lOO,OOO, 
but 
more 
than 
US$50,000, 
the 
Recipient 
will 
notify 
IDA 
of 
the results 
of 
the technical evaluation 
prior to 
opening the financial 
offers. 
With 
respect 
to 
each 
contract 
for 
employment 
of 
individual 
consultants 
estimated 
to

Modalities for 
IDA 
prior-review 
and 
post-review 
18. 
For 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project, 
IDA 
will 
review 
all 
contracts, regardless 
of 
value, 
for 
conformity 
with 
procedures, 
including 
all 
architectural 
drawings  and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
civil 
works 
planned 
under 
the 
project. 
Before 
the 
second year 
of 
the 
project, 
IDA 
will 
review 
whether 
the 
threshold 
for 
prior 
review 
in 
the 
DGA 
based 
on 
performance 
and 
actual values 
of 
procurement 
implemented. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
of 
procurement 
performance 
at 
all 
levels 
(national 
and community) 
would 
be 
carried out 
during 
supervision  missions 
for 
contracts  above 
prior-review 
threshold, 
and through 
annual  ex-post 
procurement 
reviews. 
This 
will 
involve 
two 
out 
of 
10 
contracts 
in 
the 
ES 
and 
one 
out 
of 
3 
contracts 
managed 
by 
the

Overall 
Procurement 
Risk 
Assessment 
High 
19. 
IDA 
was 
unable 
to 
conduct 
a 
full 
assessment 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
(ES) 
at 
the 
time 
of 
appraisal, 
as 
the 
ES 
was 
not 
fully 
functional 
at 
that time, 
The 
assessment 
focused 
on 
the 
CAU 
who 
is 
currently managing 
the 
HSDP, and 
which 
also 
manages 
the 
PPF 
for 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
project. 
The 
CAU 
was found 
to 
be 
satisfactory. 
The 
ES 
is 
currently 
recruiting 
key 
staff, 
and 
a second 
IDA 
assessment 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
May 
2003 
to 
complete 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
ES 
and 
to 
provide 
conclusions. 
The 
Risk 
Assessment 
is 
rated 
as 
High, 
mainly 
because 
the 
CAU 
has 
pressure 
to 
deliver 
the 
HSDP, 
and 
is 
understaffed 
to do 
so, 
and 
the 
added 
burden 
of 
a 
new 
project 
may 
stretch 
it's 
limits, 
without 
additional 
assistance 
as 
related 
above 
in 
the 
para. 
on 
Capacity 
Assessment. 
20. 
Frequency 
of 
procurement 
supervision 
missions 
proposed: 
One every 
6 
months 
(includes 
special 
procurement 
supervision 
for 
post-review/audits). 
The 
first 
year 
will 
require 
intensive supervision 
missions 
to 
ensure 
proper implementation 
start-up 
and 
ES's 
familiarity 
with 
IDA 
procedures. 
Thresholds 
generally 
differ 
by 
country 
and 
project.

to 
be 
operated 
by 
the 
CAU 
during 
the 
transition 
phase, 
and 
then 
by 
the 
ES 
under 
terms 
and 
conditions 
satisfactory 
to 
IDA. 
The 
SA-A 
will 
be 
established 
to 
run 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
project 
(Components 
1-3) 
except 
the 
Community  Intervention 
Sub-grants 
(Component 4). 
25. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
of 
the 
SA-A 
will 
be 
established at 
US$1.0 
million, 
which 
represents 
about 
4 
months 
of 
estimated 
disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
grant. 
Initially, 
the allocated 
amount 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
US$0.7 
million, 
until 
disbursement 
reaches 
US$3.0 
million 
equivalent, 
at 
which 
time 
the 
full 
Authorized Allocation could 
be 
claimed. 
Application for 
the 
replenishment 
of 
the 
SA 
would 
be 
submitted 
monthly 
or 
when 
one-third 
of 
the 
initial 
deposit 
has 
been 
utilized,  whichever 
comes 
first. 
The 
replenishment 
application 
would 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
necessary 
documentation, 
bank 
statements 
of 
the 
SA, 
and a 
reconciliation 
of 
these 
bank 
statements 
against 
the 
Association 
records. 
The 
SA 
would 
be 
audited annually 
by 
independent 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Association. 
26. 
The 
second Special 
Account 
(SA-B) 
will 
be 
established 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Community 
Intervention 
Sub-grants. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
of 
US$500,000  represents  about 
3 
months 
of 
estimated  disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
Grant. 
Initially, 
the 
allocated  amount 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
US$250,000, 
until 
disbursement reaches 
US$1.5 
million 
equivalent, 
at 
which time 
the 
full 
Authorized 
Allocation could 
be 
claimed. 
The 
same 
procedures 
apply 
as 
in 
the 
above paragraph. 
Project Preparation 
Fund 
(PPF): 
27. 
To 
advance 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
project, a 
PPF (Q322-0-DJI) 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$350,000 
was 
approved 
on 
March 
14,2002, 
and countersigned 
by 
the 
Recipient 
on 
March 
26, 
2002. 
A 
second 
PPF 
was 
established 
(4322-1-DJI) 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
US$380,000 
to 
cover 
the 
cost 
of 
additional 
activities, 
which 
was 
approved 
on 
December 
24, 2002, 
and countersigned 
on 
January 
3, 
2003.  Disbursements 
under 
the 
PPF 
are 
made 
using 
traditional 
Bank 
disbursement 
methods. 
The 
PPF 
funds 
are 
managed 
by 
the 
Credit 
Administration 
Unit 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health.

Evaluation 
of 
the 
Project’s 
Financial Management 
System 
and 
Measures 
to 
Implement 
a 
Satisfactory System 
Administrative 
and Financial 
Capacities 
of 
the 
Implementing 
Agency 
During 
the 
appraisal 
mission 
focused 
on 
assessing 
the 
existing 
management 
capacities 
of 
the 
administrative 
and financial 
functions 
of 
the 
implementation 
agency. 
The 
appraisal 
mission 
determined that 
the 
action 
plan 
left 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
pre-appraisal 
mission 
of 
October 
2002 
had 
not 
been 
carried 
out 
according 
to 
the 
planned 
timeframe. 
This 
led 
the 
mission 
to 
reassess 
and 
clarify 
the 
project 
set-up 
and functionalities 
with 
the 
newly 
appointed 
Executive 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat, 
responsible 
for 
the management 
of 
the 
project, and the 
necessary 
actions 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
implement 
the outstanding activities.  Decisions were taken 
to 
implement 
the 
minimum 
required. 
A 
follow-up 
assessment 
will 
be 
undertaken 
during 
a 
post-appraisal 
mission 
(May 
2003). 
Institutional 
organization 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
interministerial institutional 
framework 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
project, 
and 
is 
justified 
considering 
the 
different 
stakeholders 
involved 
in 
this 
project, 
particularly 
in 
view 
of 
the 
participation 
of 
eleven 
ministries 
and 
a 
substantial 
community 
intervention 
element 
(roughly 
ten 
supervisory 
NGOs 
and 
about 
thirty 
community-based 
organizations). 
The 
President 
of 
Djibouti 
recently 
signed 
the 
decree 
establishing  the 
authority 
and 
attributes 
of 
the 
different governing 
bodies 
of 
the 
project. 
This 
decree establishes:

is 
a 
requirement, 
the 
ES 
is 
appointed

Memorandum 
of 
understanding 
Contractual 
organization 
Grant 
agreement 
Organizational 
relations 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
activities and 
financing 
will 
be 
governed 
by 
formalized 
contractual 
agreements, 
on 
the 
one hand, 
between the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
and the 
ministries 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
and, 
on 
the other 
hand, 
between 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
community 
support 
structures 
in 
the 
form 
of 
financing 
or 
grant 
agreements. 
The 
following 
chart 
shows 
the 
different 
relationships. 
The 
memoranda 
of 
understanding 
are 
to 
provide 
a 
clear 
description 
of 
the relations between the 
Technical 
Committee, 
represented 
by 
the 
ES, 
and 
the 
ministries, 
particularly 
with 
regard 
to 
the levels 
of 
authority, 
appointment 
of 
the 
focal 
point, 
and operating 
procedures. 
The 
grant 
agreements 
must 
contain 
the 
following: 
(i) 
a 
description 
of 
the 
purpose, 
with 
a 
brief 
description 
of 
activities, 
conditionalities, 
approval, evaluation, 
financing, and supervision 
processes; 
and 
(ii) 
suspension 
or 
termination 
clauses. 
The mission 
was 
informed 
that 
an 
agreement 
model 
has 
previously 
been used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
finalizing 
agreement content. 
The 
mission brought 
to 
the attention 
of 
the 
ES 
the 
conditions 
for 
receiving 
grants, 
so 
that 
a 
procedure can 
be 
developed 
that 
responds 
both to 
the 
concerns 
of 
associations 
that 
seek 
simplicity 
in 
relations, 
and the 
constraints 
of 
the 
ES, 
whose  procedures 
for 
receiving 
grants 
are 
subject 
to 
verification 
that 
the subsidized 
activities have been implemented. 
Multi-year 
agreements 
are 
necessary 
because 
they 
seem 
to 
be 
more 
suitable 
for 
strengthening 
overall 
funding 
efficiency 
than  yearly 
agreements. 
The 
memoranda 
of 
understanding 
are 
to 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
same 
principles. 
In 
all 
cases, 
the 
use 
of 
funds 
have 
to 
be 
justified. 
A 
grant that 
is 
not 
used, 
or 
a 
grant used 
in 
a 
manner inconsistent 
with 
its 
purpose, 
must 
be 
retumed 
to 
the 
ES. 
Regarding 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
an 
association, 
the 
mission 
provided 
recommendations 
for 
processing 
procedures 
for 
grant 
applications. 
They 
must 
allow 
an 
association that 
- 
77 
- 
Page  84
is 
applying 
for 
a 
grant 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
it 
meets 
the 
general 
and special 
conditions 
for 
being 
awarded a 
grant. 
These 
pertain 
primarily 
to: 
(i) 
information 
about 
the 
association's 
identity 
(proof 
of 
its 
existence, 
articles 
of 
agreement, 
length 
of 
time 
in 
existence, 
activities  and 
human 
resources,  and 
financial 
information 
in 
terms 
of 
turnover); 
and 
(ii) 
information 
about 
the 
activity 
under consideration 
as 
part 
of 
its 
work 
in 
the 
project 
(description 
of 
the 
work 
and 
budget 
estimates). 
Organization 
and 
implementation 
procedures 
Here, 
the 
mission identified 
the 
procedure 
to 
be 
followed 
for project 
monitoring, 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
organization 
and 
planned 
information monitoring 
systems, 
and 
more specifically, 
the 
type 
of 
information 
sources, 
collection 
method, 
processing 
method, 
and 
presentation 
of 
results. 
I 
- 
Structures: 
Although 
no 
official 
organizational 
chart 
has 
been 
prepared, 
the 
human 
resources 
will 
be 
assigned 
as 
follows: 
For 
the 
Executive Secretariat 
The 
Executive 
Secretariat's 
staff 
will 
consist 
of 
15 
people: 
13 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
project 
(including 
two 
technical 
assistants), 
while 
two 
are 
on 
temporary 
assignment, 
theoretically 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
(in 
red). 
The 
Chief 
Administrative 
and 
Financial Officer 
and 
the 
accountant have 
been 
recruited. 
The 
accountant 
(CISU/ES) 
will 
be 
hired 
prior 
to 
project 
effectiveness. 
The 
profiles 
match 
those 
identified 
during 
the 
pre- 
appraisal 
mission 
of 
October 
2002. 
The 
responsibility 
for 
planning, 
monitoring 
and evaluation, 
devolved 
to 
the 
Planning, 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Unit, 
will 
be 
subcontracted 
out through 
a competitive 
process. 
For 
the 
ministries 
The 
mission 
met 
with 
several 
focal 
point 
representatives: 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education; 
Ministry 
of 
the 
Interior 
and Decentralization; 
Ministry 
of 
Communication; 
Ministry 
of 
Youth, 
Sports, 
Recreation 
and 
Tourism; 
-

Page  85
Ministry 
of 
Justice, 
Penitentiary 
and Religious Affairs, 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Wakfs 
and 
of 
Muslim 
Affairs; 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
Generally, the organizational 
measures 
that 
the 
ministries have adopted 
are 
based 
on 
assigning 
ministry 
employees 
to 
what 
is 
called 
a 
specialized 
unit 
to 
carry 
out project 
activities. 
These 
units 
are 
or 
will 
be 
placed 
under the 
authority 
of 
a 
technical 
directorate. 
Some 
activities 
may be 
decentralized 
(Police, 
National 
Education, 
etc.). 
Thus, 
(i) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
the Interior, 
the specialized 
unit 
is 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Police 
Department; 
(ii) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
National 
Education 
and 
Higher 
Education, 
under the 
authority 
of 
the 
General Directorate 
of 
Pedagogy; 
(iii) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Youth 
and 
Sports, 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Directorate 
of 
Youth 
and 
Sports; 
and 
(iv) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
three 
specialized 
units 
(tuberculosis, 
malaria, 
and 
STIs/AIDS),  under 
the authority 
of 
the Directorate 
of 
Public 
Hygiene. 
The focal 
points have 
been appointed 
in 
each 
ministry. 
The mission found 
that 
most 
of 
the persons 
met 
already  have 
project 
management 
experience. 
As 
managers 
of 
delegated 
funds, 
they 
will 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
the 
budgetary appropriations that 
will 
be 
assigned 
to 
them. 
Moreover, 
the 
mission 
highlighted to 
the 
ES 
the  responsibilities 
of 
each: 
(i) 
to 
accredit 
themselves 
with 
their 
respective 
accountants, 
to 
whom 
their 
spending orders 
will 
be 
submitted, 
in 
other 
words, 
to inform 
them 
of 
their 
appointment 
and 
provide 
a 
specimen 
of 
their 
signature, 
with 
a 
copy 
to 
the 
ES; 
and 
(ii) 
of 
opening 
an 
account 
with 
a 
commercial 
bank. 
Nonetheless,  some 
practical 
issues 
were 
addressed, 
especially the 
accountant’s 
capacity. 
The mission pointed 
out that 
it 
was essential 
to 
separate 
this 
function 
from 
that 
of 
funds 
manager. 
Generally, the 
rule 
is 
that 
two 
signatures  are 
required 
to 
issue 
checks: 
(i) 
that 
of 
the 
funds 
manager; 
and 
(ii) 
that 
of 
a 
de 
jure 
or 
defacto 
public 
accountant 
(the 
directorate 
to which 
the 
focal 
point or 
the 
ministry’s 
Financial 
Manager 
is 
assigned). 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
special circumstance 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communication 
and the 
Ministry 
of 
Justice, 
wherein 
the 
focal points 
do 
not fall 
under 
the 
actual 
ministry, 
the 
mission 
asked 
the 
ES 
to 
clarify 
this 
situation 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible, 
so 
that the 
accountant’s 
scope 
of 
authority 
could be 
defined. 
Actually, 
(i) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Communication, 
the 
appointed 
focal 
point 
is 
a 
person 
assigned 
to 
a 
public 
entity. 
The mission 
believes that 
this 
situation 
must 
be 
viewed 
as 
management 
for 
third 
party 
account, 
with 
this 
person 
carrying 
out 
the financial 
transactions 
that the 
requester, 
in 
other words, 
the 
ES, asks 
it 
to 
carry 
out. 
With 
this 
in 
mind, 
the accountant 
should 
be 
appointed 
from 
within 
the 
public 
entity, 
in 
this 
case, 
SociCtC 
de 
TClCvision 
de 
Djibouti; 
and 
(ii) 
for 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Justice, 
the 
focal 
point 
appointed 
is 
an 
individual, 
serving 
as 
legal 
counsel. 
The 
most 
prudent solution 
would 
be for 
this 
person 
to 
be 
under the 
financial 
control 
of 
the 
ministry 
who 
assigned 
him 
this 
task. 
In 
any 
case, 
these 
provisions 
are 
to 
be 
clarified 
before 
the 
planned 
memoranda 
of 
understanding 
are 
prepared, 
before 
July 
3 
1,2003.

and 
quarterly 
financial 
monitoring 
reports. 
The  mission  identified 
some 
but 
not  all 
of 
the 
main 
transactions  that 
may 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
administrative 
and financial 
monitoring 
officers: 
Opening 
of 
accounts. 
The 
proper 
management 
of 
project 
expenditures 
assumes 
that 
two 
conditions 
will 
be 
met: 
(i) 
a 
condition 
of 
substance: 
the 
existence 
of 
debts 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
spending 
by 
submitting 
an 
annual 
activity 
plan 
translated 
into 
budget 
terms 
(document  subject 
to 
IDA’S 
approval); 
and 
(ii) 
a

condition 
of 
form, 
of 
budgetary 
law, 
with 
annual 
authorization 
given 
by 
the budget. 
Entry 
in 
the 
General 
State 
Budget for 
a 
budget 
year 
allows 
the 
chief 
authorizing 
officer 
(the 
Prime Minister) 
to 
cover 
the 
different 
expenses. 
The 
funds 
are 
then 
delegated 
to 
the 
ES 
officer 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Technical Interministerial Committee 
for 
the 
Control 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis. 
Budget 
entries 
in 
the 
ES’s 
accounts 
are 
broken 
down, 
at 
a 
minimum, 
by 
component. 
A 
portion 
of 
the 
expenses 
(linked 
to 
the 
activity) 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
the 
ministries 
or 
deconcentrated 
government bodies 
that 
are 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
project. 
Expense 
commitment 
documentation. 
Budget 
transactions 
result 
in 
expenditures 
of 
funds 
for 
a 
given 
heading. 
For 
any 
expenditure, 
supporting 
documents, 
such 
as 
a 
contract 
or 
order form, 
must 
only 
be 
established once 
the 
availability 
of 
committed 
funds, 
eligibility 
and 
validity 
of 
the expenditure 
have 
been 
verified 
and 
validated. 
For 
accounting,  the 
expenditure 
of 
funds 
is 
recorded 
on 
a 
commitment 
sheet, 
prepared 
by 
the 
funds 
manager. 
The commitment 
sheet 
should specify 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
expense, 
the 
performance 
period, 
the 
name 
of 
the 
supplier, 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
goods 
or 
services, 
the budget 
allocation, 
and 
its 
cost 
allocation 
(activity). 
The 
advantage 
of 
this 
presentation 
is 
that 
it 
identifies 
the reasons 
for 
the 
expense 
and 
facilitates 
consistent  data 
consolidation. 
A 
consistent 
model 
must 
be 
prepared 
and 
distributed 
to 
the 
focal points. 
This 
model 
must 
be 
part 
of 
the 
project 
procedures 
manual 
to 
be 
prepared. 
The 
following 
agreements 
have been 
reached: 
0 
Capital 
expenditures, 
such 
as 
vehicles, 
computer 
equipment, 
etc., 
would 
be 
incurred 
by 
the 
ES 
in 
compliance 
with 
IDA’S 
procurement 
procedures. 
The 
items 
would 
then 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
recipients. 
Certain 
expenditures, 
such 
as 
drugs, 
printed 
materials, 
television 
announcements, 
etc., 
which, 
when 
combined, 
may 
generate a 
substantial 
economic 
advantage, 
will 
be 
procured 
by 
the 
ES 
on 
behalf 
of 
other 
stakeholders. 
Expenditures 
incurred 
for 
contractual 
employees 
hired 
for 
the 
ministries 
or 
other governmental 
bodies 
will 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
following 
rules: 
(i) 
the 
beneficiary 
will 
interview 
and 
select 
the 
employees; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
ES 
will 
prepare 
the 
employment 
contract 
and 
the 
salary 
and 
payment 
vouchers. 
0 
0 
Thus, 
for 
the 
funds 
delegated 
to 
the ministries,  the 
expenditures 
that 
these 
ministries incur should be 
related 
mainly to 
their 
activities, 
such 
as 
the 
preparation 
of 
seminars, 
room 
rentals, 
training 
services, 
small 
supplies, etc. 
Authorization 
transactions: 
for 
expenses 
incurred 
and 
paid,  the  accounting 
entries 
are 
made 
after 
ascertaining: 
(i) 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
expenditure, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
valid 
supporting 
documents, 
in 
particular: 
the  order 
form, 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
contract 
and 
compliance 
with 
procurement 
procedures, 
invoices, 
itemization 
documents,  startup 
advance, 
etc.; 
and 
(ii) 
the accuracy 
of 
the 
calculations 
of 
the 
itemizations 
relative 
to 
the contract and 
liquidation 
clauses. 
Financial 
flows:

Collection 
and 
processing 
media: 
Currently,  the 
ADETIP 
has 
an 
integrated 
management 
and 
financial 
system, 
which 
fully 
captures 
the 
different 
key 
stages 
of 
an 
expenditure 
file 
and the 
transactions 
for 
paying 
the 
expense, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
steps 
involved 
in 
updating 
the 
databases. 
In 
its 
design, 
the 
system 
processes 
eight 
main 
modules 
(i) 
parameters, 
(ii) 
general 
accounting, 
(iii)

For 
this 
application, 
the 
plan 
is 
to 
differentiate 
between 
transactions 
related 
to 
the 
projects  and 
their 
funding 
source; 
this 
should make 
it 
possible 
to 
translate 
the  objectives  and 
activity 
of 
a 
project 
into 
financial 
and 
accounting 
terms. 
The 
concept 
that 
has 
been  developed 
should 
permit monitoring 
of 
transactions 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
grant 
and, 
in 
particular: 
(i) 
by 
budget 
classification; 
(ii) 
by 
component 
and 
subcomponent; 
(iii) 
by 
use 
(type 
of 
establishment, site 
and 
district); 
(iv) 
by 
category 
of 
expenditure; 
and 
(v) 
in 
local 
and 
foreign 
currencies. 
The 
extraction 
of 
multicriteria 
data 
is 
planned; 
this 
facilitates a 
dynamic 
approach 
as 
required 
for 
the  management 
of 
project monitoring. 
It 
should 
also 
permit 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
results 
of 
project 
monitoring 
and 
their 
interpretation, 
as 
well 
as 
retrieval 
of 
information 
on 
actual 
transactions 
of 
the 
project 
stakeholders 
(State, 
bA 
and 
Auditor). 
All 
the  procedures 
are 
programmed 
in 
the 
transactional 
mode. 
All 
system 
users 
have 
access 
to 
certain 
authorized 
transactions 
that 
allow 
them 
to 
enhance 
the 
information 
in 
the 
system. 
The mission 
recommends that the 
ES: 
(i) 
launch 
at 
this 
time 
the 
competitive 
bidding 
process 
for 
the 
project 
financial 
monitoring information 
system, 
based 
on 
the 
description 
of 
the 
special 
conditions of 
the 
functionalities 
for 
this 
application; 
(ii) 
ascertain  that 
all 
of 
these 
functionalities 
are 
present 
in 
the 
information 
system 
to 
be 
chosen 
and 
that 
they 
meet 
the 
requirements, 
mainly 
those 
of 
producing 
the 
data 
required 
in 
the 
FMR; 
and 
(iii) 
ascertain that  the 
monitoring 
of 
procurement 
operations 
are 
functional, 
including 
the processing 
of 
specific 
operations, 
namely 
the 
launch 
of 
the 
competitive 
bidding 
process 
for 
the 
contract. 
Failing 
that, 
the 
mission 
suggests 
the 
development and 
implementation 
at 
this 
time 
of 
an 
application 
that 
meets 
this 
requirement. 
It 
should 
be 
designed 
to 
monitor 
the contracts and 
identify 
any 
issues. 
The 
data 
managed 
could 
include 
but 
not 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
following: 
(i) 
the 
competitive 
bidding 
number; 
(ii) 
procurement 
method; 
(iii) 
date 
of 
publication; 
(iv) 
date 
for submitting 
bids; 
(v) 
date 
for 
receipt 
of 
bids; 
(vi) 
number 
of 
bidders; 
(vii) 
date 
for 
convening 
the 
selection committee; 
(viii) 
date 
of 
bid 
opening; 
(ix) 
date 
of 
award; 
and 
(x) 
date 
for 
IDA 
“no 
objection,” 
etc. 
By 
way 
of 
information, 
and 
without incurring 
any 
additional 
major 
costs, 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
to 
use 
Excel 
or 
Access-type 
software 
from 
Microsoft. 
IV 
- 
Administrative 
management: 
Above 
and 
beyond information 
systems, 
the 
mission 
recommends 
that 
the 
organizational guidelines and 
management procedures 
be 
outlined 
in 
the 
procedure 
manual for 
the 
following 
purposes: 
(i) 
ensure 
full 
comprehension 
of 
the 
data 
processing 
system; 
(ii) 
procedure 
consistency; and 
(iii) 
access 
to 
reliable information. 
The 
mission 
requests that the 
ES 
organize 
working 
meetings 
with 
the 
different 
stakeholders 
so 
that actions 
are 
taken 
to 
prepare: 
(i) 
a 
general 
organization 
manual 
that 
would 
identify 
the 
relationships  between 
the 
ES 
and 
the 
ministries;  and 
(ii) 
an 
intemal 
procedures 
manual 
for 
the 
ES, 
which 
would 
provide 
a description 
of 
its 
own 
operations. 
These 
manuals 
would 
include: 
(i) 
supporting 
documents 
for 
inflows 
and outflows; 
(ii) 
information 
channels; 
(iii) 
tasks 
assigned 
to 
each employee; 
(iv) 
processing 
carried 
out; 
and 
(v) 
control 
points. 
Furthermore, 
the 
mission: 
- 
provided 
the 
ES 
with 
a copy 
of 
the 
“Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
for 
World 
Bank-Financed 
Projects: 
Guidelines 
for 
Borrowers.” 
In 
collaboration 
with 
the 
ES, 
it 
has 
been 
agreed: 
(i) 
that 
the 
tabular 
models 
used 
will 
be 
those 
described 
in 
“Annex 
A 
Example 
1;” 
and 
(ii) 
to 
add 
in 
the 
special 
conditions 
of 
the 
bidding 
document 
for 
the 
information 
software 
the 
parameters 
for 
the 
output 
statements needed. 
- 
made the 
ES 
aware 
of 
the 
fact that 
activities 
funded 
under 
the 
PPF 
currently 
managed 
by 
the 
Credit 
Administration 
Unit 
(CAU) 
need 
to 
be 
officially 
transferred 
to 
the 
ES 
and that 
the 
procedures 
for 
transferring 
data 
are 
integrated 
in 
the 
overall 
project 
data. 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat’s 
(ES) 
management 
capacities 
to 
perform 
the 
administrative 
and 
financial 
monitoring 
of 
the 
future 
project: 
The 
contacts  made 
with 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
ES, 
focal 
points,  and 
the 
financial 
directors 
of 
certain 
ministries 
have 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
refine 
the 
organizational  and 
management procedures 
to 
be 
implemented 
to 
effectively 
perform 
the 
administrative 
and 
financial 
monitoring 
of 
the 
project. The mission 
regrets 
that the 
activities 
planned 
during 
the 
pre-appraisal 
mission 
of 
October 
2002 
had 
not 
been 
fulfilled. 
Clearly, 
with 
the 
many 
- 
83 
- 
Page  90
stakeholders 
involved 
in 
this 
project 
(1 
1 
ministries 
and considerable 
community 
interventions 
by 
about 
ten supporting 
organizations and 
around 
30 
community-based 
NGOs), 
special 
procedures need 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
procedures that 
must 
be 
adopted 
for 
project monitoring, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
organization 
and 
monitoring information 
systems, 
and 
more  specifically, 
for 
the 
type 
of 
sources 
of 
information, 
collection 
and  processing 
methods,  and 
presentation 
of 
results. 
This 
complex 
set 
of 
activities, 
with 
the 
ensuing 
coordination 
issues, 
should 
not 
be 
underestimated. 
To 
harness 
both 
intemal 
and 
external 
management  constraints, 
the 
mission 
recommends: 
(i) 
standardization 
of 
data 
processing and consolidation,  proceeding 
with 
the 
acquisition 
of 
management 
software 
appropriate 
for 
project 
monitoring, 
such 
as 
the 
software used 
currently 
by 
ADETP, 
or 
at the 
very 
least,  software 
with 
similar 
functionalities, 
(ii) 
that  the

make 
every 
effort 
to 
recruit 
the 
employees 
necessary 
for 
preparing 
the 
project and 
organize 
working 
meetings 
with 
all 
the 
relevant 
stakeholders, 
so 
that 
it 
can 
do 
identify 
the 
organizational 
aspects 
of

Furthermore, 
it 
may 
be 
necessary 
to 
prepare  procedures 
manuals 
that 
outline 
the 
functionalities 
which 
characterize

management. 
It 
was 
agreed that 
these 
activities 
would

In

the 
objective 
of 
setting-up 
specific

is 
to 
improve 
the 
coordination 
of 
activities 
which 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
ministries. 
As 
such, 
the 
relationships 
need 
to

of 
understanding that 
include 
a 
concise 
description

In 
terms 
of 
general 
organization, the relevant 
implementation 
structures 
(ES, 
focal 
points and regional 
committees) 
seem 
satisfactory 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
qualification and number 
of 
employees 
assigned 
to 
or 
to 
being 
considered 
for 
the 
project. 
Beyond 
intentions, 
the 
creation 
of 
programming 
and  implementing 
units, 
the 
nomination 
of 
the 
Executive 
Secretary 
and  focal 
points, 
as 
well 
as 
clarifications 
on 
management 
procedures 
are 
all 
elements 
which 
presuppose 
ownership 
by 
the 
different 
project 
stakeholders.

Prepared 
by: 
The 
project 
was 
prepared 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and the 
Program 
to 
Fight 
Against 
AIDS 
(Programme 
de 
Lutte 
contre 
le 
SIDA) 
(PLS). 
In 
addition, 
once 
the 
Executive 
Secretariat 
(ES) 
for 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STI, 
malaria, and tuberculosis 
was established 
and 
the 
Secretary nominated,  the 
project benefited 
from 
their 
input. 
The 
project 
team 
also 
worked 
closely 
with 
the 
UNAIDS 
Thematic 
Group 
in 
Djibouti, 
the 
multilateral 
donor 
agencies, 
bilateral 
agencies, 
and 
participating 
stakeholders, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
living 
with 
HIVIAIDS. 
The 
Credit 
Administration 
Unit 
(CAU) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
is 
currently managing 
the 
PHRD 
grant, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
PPF 
for 
the 
project (financial 
and procurement 
aspects). 
The 
CAU 
will 
continue 
to 
do 
so 
until 
such 
time 
as 
the 
Administrative 
and 
Financial 
Unit 
of 
the 
ES 
is 
in 
place. 
Preparation assistance: 
The 
project  benefited 
from 
a 
Country-Executed 
PHRD 
grant  (TF026825), 
under 
which 
the 
consultant 
fim 
CREDES 
prepared, 
with 
the 
government, 
the 
National 
Strategy 
on 
HN/AIDS/STI, 
Malaria 
and Tuberculosis, 
as 
well 
as 
certain 
components 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
addition, a 
PPF was requested and granted 
to 
the 
government 
to 
undertake 
preparatory activities, 
focusing 
on 
carrying 
out 
the 
populatiodtarget 
group 
surveys, 
qualitative 
study 
on 
infectedlaffected  population 
groups, 
and  an

SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS 
DJIBOUTI: HIVIAIDS, Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis 
Control 
Project 
The 
project 
will 
require intensive 
supervision, 
given 
its 
multisectoral 
and 
multi-agency 
nature, 
fast-track preparation, 
and large 
span 
of 
activities. Moreover, 
some 
of 
the actors 
to 
be 
involved 
(Le.  associations 
of 
PLWHA, 
local 
NGOs, 
and 
CBOs) 
have 
relatively 
limited 
experience 
with 
Bank 
operations. 
Some 
of 
the 
slulls 
required 
for 
supervision 
will 
be 
needed 
on 
a 
regular 
basis 
while 
others 
will 
be 
required 
on 
an 
ad-hoc  basis. 
Therefore, 
a 
core  supervision 
team 
will 
be 
established, 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
other technical 
specialists, 
as 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
Recipient. 
The 
core 
team 
would 
carry 
out 
annually, 
on 
average, 
2 
three-week 
supervision 
missions 
comprised 
of 
approximately 
5 
staff. 
Other 
technical 
experts 
would 
provide 
support 
periodically, 
as 
required. 
During 
the 
first 
year, 
a 
heavier supervision 
program 
would 
be 
expected, 
with 
3 
missions, 
tapering 
down 
over 
subsequent years. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
as 
the 
project 
grows, 
more 
people 
will 
be 
involved,  and 
the 
need 
for 
continuous, 
intensive 
assistance 
will 
increase. 
IDA’S 
supervision 
task 
would 
be 
facilitated 
by 
the 
continuous 
monitoring 
of 
the 
Procurement 
and 
Project 
Implementation International 
Specialist 
in 
the 
Administrative and 
Financial 
Unit, 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Social 
Communication 
International 
Specialist 
in 
the 
Social 
Communication 
Unit 
of 
the 
ES and 
the 
work 
done 
by 
the 
firm 
that 
will 
be 
subcontracted 
for 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation. 
The 
core 
team 
would 
be 
comprised 
of 
the 
following 
experts 
from 
headquarters 
and 
from 
the 
Egypt 
and 
the 
Yemen country 
offices: 
(i) 
task 
team 
leader 
with 
experience 
in 
health 
projects, 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
HN/AIDS 
operations; 
(ii) 
operation 
officer 
who 
would 
oversee 
day-to-day 
implementation 
of 
project; 
(iii) 
financial 
management specialist 
who would 
review 
adherence 
to 
Bank 
procedures 
with 
regard 
to 
fiduciary 
responsibilities; and 
(iv) 
procurement/implementation 
specialist 
who 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the procurement, 
implementation, 
and 
institutional 
issues. 
In 
addition, 
a 
consultant 
specialist 
in 
community-based and 
multi-sectoral intervention should 
be 
part 
of 
the 
team. 
The 
core 
team 
could 
also 
include 
representatives 
from 
Djibouti’s 
development 
partners 
active 
in 
the 
control 
of 
HN/AIDS/STI, 
malaria, 
and 
tuberculosis 
and 
present 
in 
Djibouti, 
e.g., 
UNICEF, 
WHO, 
UNDP, 
and 
WFP. 
As 
mentioned 
in 
section 
C4 
on 
“Implementation 
Arrangements,” 
these 
partnership 
are 
not 
as 
yet 
finalized. 
As 
begun 
during 
project 
preparation,  partners 
from 
the 
extended 
UNAIDS 
Thematic 
Group 
in 
Djibouti 
would 
be 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
supervision 
missions 
to 
ensure 
complementarity 
of 
interventions, 
build 
strong 
partnerships, 
and 
facilitate 
a 
cross-fertilization 
of 
experiences. 
During 
preparation, 
WHO, 
UNICEF, 
UNDP, 
and 
the 
French 
Cooperation were 
involved 
in 
project 
preparation, 
while 
all 
other at-large 
UNAIDS 
partners 
were 
involved 
in 
specific 
discussions 
as 
well 
as 
during 
regular 
mission briefings 
and 
debriefings. 
UNAIDS 
has 
appointed 
a 
regional 
AIDS 
program 
officer (for 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
North 
Africa) 
based at 
the 
UNDP 
office 
in 
Djibouti, 
and 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
recruiting 
a 
country 
program 
advisor 
who 
should 
contribute 
to 
the  supervision  and 
facilitation 
of 
the 
HN/AIDS 
program 
implementation.

will 
be primarily 
responsible 
for 
the

information 
and 
conclusions 
of 
site 
visits 
conducted 
by 
the supervision 
team 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
discussions. 
Progress 
reviews 
would 
include 
a 
presentation 
by 
the 
ES 
on 
progress 
attained, 
problems 
encountered, 
and 
future 
steps. 
A 
progress 
report 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
annual

attendees 
to 
be 
distributed 
at least one 
week 
prior to 
the

M&E 
system 
and 
observations 
made 
during 
site 
visits. 
Other 
information 
available 
at 
the  time, 
including 
studies 
conducted 
by

ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT PLAN 
DJIBOUTI: 
HIVIAIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis Control 
Project 
Health 
Care 
Waste 
Management 
Plan 
Executive 
Summary 
1. 
Objective 
The 
inappropriate 
handling 
of 
infectious 
materials 
constitutes 
a 
serious 
danger 
to public 
health, 
particularly for 
health 
facility 
staff. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
study 
is 
to 
improve 
public 
health 
by 
developing 
a 
system 
of 
health 
care waste 
management 
(HCWM) 
and 
an 
implementation 
plan. 
Both 
the 
study 
and 
the 
HCWM 
plan 
will 
take 
into 
account  environmental, 
technical, 
and 
sociocultural 
concerns. 
The 
HCWM 
will 
reinforce 
better 
coordination 
by 
determining 
the 
requisite 
changes 
in 
management 
and 
will 
identify 
needs 
in 
terms 
of 
specific 
investments, 
capacity-building 
programs, 
and training 
programs. 
2. 
There 
are 
52 
health facilities 
in 
Djibouti 
with 
a 
980-bed 
global 
capacity: 
7 
Hospital 
Medical 
Centers 
(CMH); 
11 
Health 
Centers 
(CS); 
22 
Health 
Posts 
(PS); 
3 
private 
clinics; 
6 
private 
medical 
centers; 
2 
dental 
and 
pharmaceutical 
centers. 
The 
health 
staff 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
is 
comprised 
of 
930 
agents, 
among 
them: 
98 
doctors; 
130 
midwifes; 
and, 
60 
nurses. 
The solid 
waste 
production 
in 
health facilities 
is 
estimated 
at 
2,144 
kg/day, 
and 
Health 
Care 
Waste 
(HCW) 
represents 
nearly 634 
kgJday. 
Main 
acknowledgements 
of 
the 
study 
The 
main 
problems 
identified 
are 
structured 
on 
the 
following: 
2.1. 
The 
institutional 
and legal 
framework 
is 
deficient 
with 
regard 
to 
HCW 
management 
The 
national health 
policy 
does 
not 
set 
HCW 
management 
as 
a 
priority. 
There 
is 
no 
HCW 
legal 
framework,  and 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
absence 
of 
regulations 
pertaining 
to 
HCW 
and 
to 
HCW 
procedures 
within 
health 
facilities. 
Neither 
can sound 
HCW 
management 
be 
construed, 
nor 
can 
individual 
responsibilities 
be 
defined. 
2.2. 
The 
organization 
and 
equipment 
of 
HCW 
management 
are 
not 
performing 
Health 
facility 
HCW 
management 
is 
deficient, 
despite 
the efforts 
noted 
in 
some 
health 
centers. 
The 
major 
constraints 
are: 
lack 
of 
a 
plan 
or 
internal 
management procedures; 
absence 
of 
viable 
data 
regarding 
HCW 
production 
and 
characterization; 
no 
responsible 
person 
designated 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
HCW 
management; 
insufficient 
amount 
of 
appropriate 
collection 
supplies 
and protection 
equipment; 
no 
systematic 
separation 
of 
HCW 
and 
mixing 
of 
HCW 
with 
household 
waste; and, 
constraints 
in 
designing, 
building, 
and 
operating 
local 
(craft) incinerators. 
2.3. 
The 
behaviors 
and 
practices 
of 
HCW 
management 
are 
generally 
poor 
In 
general, 
the 
medical 
staff 
have 
no 
knowledge 
of 
HCW 
management; 
in 
practice, 
attitudes are 
poor. 
Among 
hospital 
support 
staff 
(cleaners, 
caretakers, etc.) 
training 
and 
sensitizing 
is 
needed. 
- 
96

Page  103
2.4. 
Civil 
society 
is 
not 
involved 
in 
HCW 
management 
The 
civil 
society 
does 
not 
take 
part 
in 
HCW 
management. 
This 
causes 
a 
major 
constraint 
in 
the 
professionalization 
of 
the 
sector. 
For 
external 
transportation, 
the 
inexistence 
of 
companies 
specializing 
in 
HCW 
collection 
constitutes 
a 
major 
constraint 
for 
health 
centers 
in 
need 
of 
extemal 
treatment. 
2.5. 
The financial 
resources 
allocated 
to 
HCW 
management are 
insufficient 
Without 
regular 
and 
significant 
HCW 
budget allocations, 
sustainable 
improvement 
of 
HCW 
management 
is 
impossible 
to 
consider. 
Compared 
to 
the 
financial 
resources 
allocated 
to 
medical 
care, 
the 
financial 
resources 
generally allocated 
to 
HCW 
management are 
purely 
symbolic. 
3. 
Main 
recommendations 
Plan 
of 
Action. 
The objective 
of 
the 
HCW 
Management 
Plan 
is 
to 
trigger 
a 
process 
and 
to 
support the respective 
local 
response. 
The 
plan 
will 
stress 
preventive 
measures, 
especially 
actions 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
health 
and environmental 
risks 
related 
to 
the current 
practices. 
Pertinent 
actions 
must 
eventually

mais 
surtout 
en 
direction 
du 
public  en

et 
des  dCcideurs 
en

sont 
essentiels 
pour 
rCduire 
les 
risques

Dans 
la 
mesure 
du 
possible, 
les programmes

d’implication 
des

a 
amCliorer 
leurs

a 
participer 
au 
dkveloppement 
de 
leur 
localit6  et 
sont 
ainsi 
des 
partenaires  incontournables. 
Sous 
ce

le 
projet 
devra 
privilkgier 
les 
formes 
locales 
qui 
bCnCficient 
de 
l’effet 
de 
proximitC 
et 
de

C’est 
pourquoi, 
dans

devra 
baser 
son

locales, 
ayant 
une 
prCsence

Objectif 
3 
: 
Former 
le 
personnel 
hospitalier 
dans 
la 
GDS. 
I1 
s’agit 
d’informer 
et 
de 
former 
le 
personnel 
de 
santk, 
les 
agents 
d’entretien 
sur 
les 
dangers 
liks 
a 
une 
mauvaise 
gestion 
des 
DS. 
En 
outre, 
au 
niveau 
des 
modules 
de 
formations 
du 
CFPS, 
il 
conviendra 
d’intkgrer 
la 
problkmatique 
de 
la 
GDS 
notamment 
pour 
les 
agents 
qui 
s’occupent 
de 
la 
manutention 
des 
dkchets  (personnel 
hospitalier, manipulateurs 
de 
dkchets, 
collecteurs municipaux),  d’klaborer 
et 
de 
diffuser 
un 
programme 
national 
de 
formation 
des 
formateurs 
sur 
les 
risques 
sanitaires 
et 
les 
bonnes pratiques 
de 
gestion 
des 
DS. 
Les 
activitks 
de 
formations 
du 
MS 
sont 
gkntralement 
axkes 
vers 
la 
qualitk 
des 
soins 
de 
santt 
concemant les 
agents 
mkdicaux 
et 
paramtdicaux, 
et 
a 
un 
degrt 
moindre 
vers 
la 
prkvention 
des 
infections. 
C’est 
pourquoi 
il 
est 
ntcessaire 
de 
renforcer 
les 
connaissances, 
mais 
surtout d’amkliorer  les pratiques 
de 
ces 
agents dans 
la 
manipulation 
et 
la 
gestion 
des 
DS. 
La 
formation 
devra  concemer 
aussi 
les 
operateurs 
prives 
et 
les 
techniciens 
municipaux 
actifs 
dans 
les 
travaux 
d’entretien, 
de 
nettoiement 
et de 
gestion 
des 
dkchets solides. 
En 
effet, 
les 
services 
publics municipaux 
aident 
a 
collecter  les 
dkchets solides 
dans 
certaines 
formations 
sanitaires. 
La 
plupart 
des agents 
collecteurs 
n’ont 
rep 
aucune 
formation 
sur 
les 
DS 
qui 
sont 
mklangks 
avec 
les 
autres 
ordures 
dans 
les containers 
qu’ils 
collectent. 
Les 
impacts 
qui 
rtsultent 
de 
cette 
situation  concement 
l’exposition 
de 
la 
santk  des 
agents  face 
aux 
risques 
d’infection, 
le 
rejet 
anarchique 
des 
dtchets 
solides 
dans 
les dkp6ts 
sauvages 
d’ordures mtnageres 
et 
surtout  les  risques 
de 
contamination 
du 
milieu 
environnant 
par 
ces 
dkversements 
non 
contrdles. 
Objectif 
4 
: 
Sensibiliser 
les 
populations 
et 
les 
collecteurs 
de 
dCchets. 
Prksentement, 
au 
niveau 
du 
Service 
d’Education 
Pour 
la 
Santk 
du 
MS, 
il 
n’existe 
pas  de 
programmes 
opkrationnels 
d’information  et 
de 
sensibilisation 
des 
populations 
axes de 
fagon 
explicite 
sur 
les 
prkoccupations 
likes 
a 
la 
gestion 
des 
DS. 
Pour 
l’essentiel, 
les 
programmes 
dtja 
rkalisks 
ou 
en 
cours couvrent les 
domaines 
liks 
la 
santk 
en 
gknkral 
(soins 
de 
sante, 
prkvention 
des 
maladies, 
etc.), 
comme cela 
a 
ttk 
le 
cas 
concernant 
la 
formation 
pour 
les 
agents 
de 
santk 
communautaires, 
les 
associations 
de 
quartiers, 
etc. C’est 
pourquoi, 
il 
s’avere nkcessaire 
de 
rkaliser 
des 
programmes 
de 
sensibilisation 
en direction 
surtout 
des 
populations foumissant 
ou 
recevant 
des 
soins 
de 
santt 
a 
domicile, 
des 
personnes 
utilisant 
des 
objets 
recycles 
ou 
vivant 
A 
proximitk 
des 
dkcharges 
d’ordures 
ainsi 
que 
des 
rtcupkrateurs 
de 
dkchets. 
Ces 
programmes devraient 
Ctre 
menks 
avec 
l’appui 
des 
ONG 
et 
OCB 
ayant 
une large 
expkrience 
des 
questions 
d’environnement 
et 
de santk. 
Objectif 
5 
: 
Impliquer 
les 
opCrateurs 
privCs 
dans 
GDS. 
A 
ce 
niveau, 
le plan 
de 
gestion 
qui 
sera 
proposk 
devra 
dkvelopper une 
approche 
de 
professionnalisation 
de 
la 
filibre 
afin 
qu’elle 
puisse genkrer 
des 
revenus 
et 
des 
profits. 
Une 
telle 
option 
suppose 
que 
le 
plan 
prenne 
en 
compte  l’exigence 
du 
soutien 
aux  initiatives 
privkes 
et 
du 
dkveloppement 
du 
partenariat 
publiclprivelsociktk 
civile pour 
assurer 
le 
financement  de 
la 
filikre. Dans 
ce 
cadre, 
il 
serait 
souhaitable 
de 
dkterminer 
des 
mkcanismes 
de 
financement autonomes 
pour l’klimination 
des 
DS, 
de 
dkvelopper 
des 
ressources 
financieres 
spkcifiques 
et 
d’inciter 
les 
partenaires 
publics 
et 
privks 
a 
s’engager 
dans 
le 
financement 
de 
la 
filiere 
en 
renforgant  leurs 
capacitks  techniques  et 
manageriales 
en 
vue 
de 
favoriser  l’kmergence 
d’une  expertise  et 
d’un 
leadership 
dans  ce 
domaine. 
En 
effet, 
le 
choix 
de technologies approprikes nkcessite une expertise eprouvke et 
des 
ressources 
financieres 
conskquentes. 
C’est 
pourquoi 
les gestionnaires 
de 
dkchets solides 
devront 
Ctre 
encourages 
a 
participer 
a 
des 
rencontres 
techniques  (skminaires, 
conftrences, 
etc.) 
qui 
leur 
offrent 
des 
opportunitks 
d’echanges 
d’expkriences 
avec 
d’autres. 
Ainsi, 
ils 
pourront bknkficier 
de 
paquets 
de 
formation 
orientke 
principalement 
vers 
les 
domaines 
suivants 
: 
(i) 
choix 
d’kquipements 
appropriks 
de 
collecte, 
(ii) 
moddes 
de 
planification

des 
circuitsiitinkraires 
de collecte, 
(iii)

(iv)

Intervention 
paths. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Sanitary 
Waste 
Management 
Plan 
(PGDS) 
proposed 
herein 
is 
to 
initiate 
a 
process 
and 
support 
the 
national 
response 
to 
the 
question 
of 
managing 
health 
care 
waste. 
It 
will 
emphasize 
preventive 
measures, 
in 
particular 
initiatives 
to 
be 
adopted 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reducing 
the 
health 
and 
environmental 
risks 
associated 
with 
current 
practices, 
starting 
from 
concrete 
steps 
which 
should 
ultimately 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
induce 
a 
change 
in 
behavior 
and 
bring 
about 
the 
ecologically 
sustainable 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste 
and 
the 
protection 
of 
all 
parties 
concerned 
against 
risks 
of 
infection. 
In 
this 
perspective, 
the 
intervention 
strategy 
of 
the 
project 
should 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
number 
of 
measures, 
the 
most 
important 
of 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
following 
points: 
0 
strengthening 
institutional 
and 
technical 
capacities 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
consultation 
with 
government 
authorities 
to 
initiate 
the 
formulation 
of 
policies 
and 
regulations 
on 
the 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
appropriate 
organizational 
frameworks 
and 
developing 
adequate 
management 
tools;

training 
activities 
for 
the 
various 
parties 
(health 
personnel, 
maintenance 
staff, 
municipal 
and 
private

collectors, 
etc.); 
l 
engaging 
in 
information,

aimed 
at 
grassroots 
populations 
regarding 
the 
stakes 
involved 
in 
the 
ecologically 
sustainable 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste; 
* 
supporting 
partnership 
initiatives 
with 
public 
agencies, 
private 
operators, 
and 
civil 
society 
as 
regards 
sanitary 
waste 
collection 
and 
management. 
These 
activities 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
estimates 
and 
will 
constitute 
an 
integral 
part 
of

at 
the 
health 
centers, 
but 
especially 
at 
the 
public 
in 
general 
and 
decision-makers 
in 
particular, 
are 
essential 
for 
reducing 
the 
risks 
of 
infection 
and 
contamination 
from 
sanitary 
waste. 
To 
the 
greatest 
extent 
Page  114
possible, 
the 
information 
and 
public 
awareness 
programs 
on 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
should 
be 
tied 
to 
the 
broader 
campaigns 
to 
combat 
HIV/AIDS/ST1 
that 
are 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
community, 
sector, 
regional, 
or 
national 
level. 
In 
conducting 
these 
programs, 
it 
will 
be 
advisable 
to 
make 
use 
of 
current 
and 
reliable 
information 
regarding 
sanitary 
waste, 
the 
approaches 
to 
its 
management, 
the 
precautions 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
handling 
same, 
impacts 
on 
individuals 
and 
the 
environment, 
etc. 
To 
the 
greatest 
extent 
possible, 
the 
campaigns 
should 
be 
integrated 
with 
existing 
policies 
and 
programs, 
in 
particular 
within 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
Information, 
education, 
and 
conrmunication 
(IEC) 
for 
behavioral 
change 
must 
be 
focused 
principally 
on 
the 
public 
health 
problems 
associated 
with 
sanitary 
waste 
and 
the 
prevention 
and 
management 
methods 
for 
addressing 
these 
problems. 
These 
activities 
must 
target 
achieving 
qualitative 
and 
sustained 
change 
in 
people’s 
behavior. 
Successful 
implementation 
assumes 
the 
dynamic 
interaction 
of 
the 
health 
services 
and 
of 
all 
members 
of 
the 
community 
(parents, 
various 
associations, 
leaders 
in 
the 
health 
sector, 
etc.). 
In 
this 
perspective, 
the 
health 
sector 
leaders 
and 
local 
elected 
officials 
responsible 
for 
health 
matters 
should 
receive 
additional 
training 
in 
order 
to 
better 
assume 
responsibility 
for 
behavioral 
change 
communications. 
The 
production 
of 
training 
materials 
must 
be 
advanced, 
and 
it 
is 
important 
to 
make 
rational 
use 
of 
all 
existing 
information 
channels 
and 
support 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
transmission 
of 
appropriate 
health 
messages. 
The 
public 
media 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
enhancing 
public 
awareness 
about 
AIDS 
by 
rebroadcasting 
the 
messages 
regularly 
delivered 
by 
the 
national 
and 
local 
authorities. 
The 
structures 
of 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
will 
also 
have 
to 
be 
called 
upon 
to 
contribute 
to 
enhancing 
public 
awareness. 
Partnership

Partnership 
framework. 
The 
strategy 
of 
the 
Program 
for 
AIDS 
Control 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
integration 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
all 
public 
entities, 
private 
entities, 
NGOs, 
associations, 
and 
civil 
society 
so 
as 
to 
guarantee 
the 
consistency 
of 
the 
efforts 
undertaken 
and 
achievement 
of 
the 
objectives 
pursued. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
strategy 
for 
involving 
the 
people 
and 
the 
partners 
in 
a 
formal 
partnership 
framework 
should 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
determine 
the 
potential 
roles 
and 
responsibilities, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
anticipated 
contributions, 
of 
each 
category 
of 
stakeholders. 
Involvement 
of 
civil 
society. 
People 
are 
more 
and 
more 
frequently 
organized 
into 
formal 
or 
informal 
structures, 
among 
which 
youth 
groups 
and 
women’s 
groups 
are 
proving 
to 
be 
the 
most 
dynamic. 
These 
organizations 
endeavor 
to 
improve 
the 
living 
conditions 
of 
their 
constituencies 
and 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
development 
of 
their 
communities, 
which 
makes 
their 
partnership 
vital. 
Given 
this 
relationship, 
the 
project 
should 
devote 
special 
attention 
to 
local 
ways 
of 
leveraging 
the 
effect 
of 
proximity 
and 
familiarity 
with 
the 
surroundings. 
For 
this 
reason, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
partnership 
strategy 
the 
project 
should 
base 
its 
choice 
on 
a 
priority 
basis 
on 
local 
self- 
management 
structures 
that 
have 
an 
effective 
grassroots 
presence, 
acknowledged 
experience 
in 
IEC 
activities 
(in 
particular 
with 
respect 
to 
HIV/AIDS), 
as 
well 
as 
a 
solid 
familiarity 
with 
and 
genuine 
motivation 
to 
work 
in 
the 
intervention 
area. 
The 
introduction 
of 
rationalized 
and 
sustainable 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
should 
focus 
on 
the 
following 
strategic 
objectives: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management; 
(ii) 
improving 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
in 
medical 
facilities; 
(iii) 
training 
health 
personnel 
about 
sanitary 
waste 
management; 
(iv) 
enhancing 
the 
awareness 
of 
trash 
collectors 
and 
the 
general 
public 
of 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
sanitary 
waste; 
(v) 
involving 
private 
operators 
in 
sanitary 
waste 
management; 
and 
(vi) 
supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Sanitary 
Waste 
Management 
Plan 
(PGDS).

Objective 
1: 
Improving 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
For 
this 
component, 
the 
first 
step 
will 
be 
to 
establish 
a 
PGDS 
steering 
and 
monitoring 
structure, 
and 
then 
to 
draft 
a 
policy 
orientation 
document 
complemented 
by 
legal 
provisions 
(indicating 
the 
principles 
and 
national 
objectives 
applicable 
to 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
and 
specifying 
the 
responsibilities 
and 
obligations 
of 
the 
various 
institutions), 
but 
also 
to 
draw 
up 
sanitary 
waste 
technical 
management 
guides. 
In 
addition, 
at 
the 
central 
level 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
define 
policies, 
laws, 
and 
regulations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
complementing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
orders 
and 
other 
procedures 
adopted 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
in 
particular 
by 
the 
municipalities. 
Furthermore, 
technical 
support 
from 
the 
central 
level, 
as 
well 
as 
strengthened 
management 
capacities, 
will 
be 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
control 
of 
the 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
process. 
Unless 
procedures 
are 
defined 
and 
responsibilities 
clearly 
delineated, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
make 
any 
notable 
improvement 
in 
the 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
process. 
If 
the 
aim 
is 
to 
promote 
a 
rational 
system 
for 
the 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
draw 
up 
national 
technical 
directives 
and 
to 
standardize 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
procedures. 
These 
directives 
should 
place 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
sortin 
.g 
waste 
at 
the 
source. 
Objective 
2: 
Improving 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
in 
medical 
facilities. 
This 
should 
include 
the 
following 
activities: 
(a) 
Regulate 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
at 
medical 
facilities. 
In 
particular, 
this 
will 
involve 
defining 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
various 
public 
institutions 
in 
sanitary 
waste 
management; 
(b) 
Designate 
an 
official 
in 
charge 
of 
monitoring 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
This 
official 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
waste 
sorting 
at 
the 
source, 
the 
application 
of 
best 
practices 
by 
health 
personnel, 
and 
the 
collection, 
transport, 
and 
domestic 
elimination 
of 
sanitary 
waste; 
(c) 
Provide 
medical 
facilities 
with 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
equipment 
and 
materials. 
This 
will 
involve 
providing 
medical 
facilities 
with 
appropriate 
disposal 
containers 
for 
pre-collection, 
processing, 
and 
storage 
of 
sanitary 
waste, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
high 
performance 
systems 
for 
the 
processing 
and 
ecological 
elimination 
of 
solid 
and 
liquid 
sanitary 
waste; 
(d) 
Introduce 
the 
systematic 
sorting 
of 
sanitary 
waste 
and 
rational 
management 
of 
dangerous 
waste 
(such 
as 
needles, 
cutting 
implements, 
etc.), 
Considering 
the 
difficulties 
facing 
health 
care 
facilities 
(shortage 
of 
waste 
disposal 
containers, 
deficient 
processing 
systems, 
etc.), 
priority 
should 
be 
accorded 
to 
management 
of 
the 
most 
dangerous 
waste 
(with 
sharp 
edges 
and 
points); 
(e) 
Promote 
the 
use 
of 
recyclable 
materials. 
The 
use 
of 
recyclable 
materials 
(medicine 
containers 
or 
other 
plastic 
containers, 
vials, 
empty 
bottles, 
etc.) 
constitutes 
an 
interesting 
option 
in 
the 
process 
of 
minimizing 
waste 
volume, 
especially 
as 
it 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
reduce 
the 
waste 
requiring 
incineration 
or 
other 
processing; 
(f) 
Select 
a 
sanitary 
waste 
processing 
system 
for 
medical 
facilities. 
This 
will 
entail 
identifying 
the 
most 
appropriate 
processing 
systems 
for 
each 
type 
of 
medical 
facility 
(referral 
hospital, 
health 
centers 
with 
doctors 
(CMHs), 
health 
centers, 
health 
posts) 
for 
the 
, 
elimination 
of 
solid 
and 
liquid 
waste; 
and 
(g) 
Provide 
sufficient 
budgetary 
resources 
to 
finance 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
Introduce 
specific 
budget 
lines 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
at 
the 
health 
center 
level. 
Objective 
3: 
Train 
hospital 
personnel 
in 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
This 
objective 
addresses 
the 
issue 
of 
informing 
and 
training 
health 
services 
personnel 
and 
maintenance 
staff 
on 
the 
dangers 
associated 
with 
the 
improper 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste. 
In 
addition, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
training 
modules 
for 
the 
CFPS, 
the 
problems 
associated 
with 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
should 
be 
included, 
in 
particular 
for 
staff 
involved 
in 
handling 
waste 
(hospital 
personnel, 
waste 
handlers, 
municipal 
trash 
collectors), 
and 
a 
national 
program 
should 
be 
developed 
and 
disseminated 
to 
train 
trainers 
on 
health 
risks 
and 
on 
best 
practices 
associated 
with 
the 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
training 
activities 
are 
generally 
focused 
on 
quality 
of 
care 
and 
addressed 
to 
medical 
and 
paramedical 
personnel; 
they 
focus 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree 
on 
the 
prevention 
of 
infections. 
This 
is 
why 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
enhance 
knowledge, 
but 
especially 
to 
improve 
the 
practices 
of 
these 
personnel 
in 
handling 
and 
managing 
sanitary 
waste. 
Training 
should 
also 
target 
private 
operators 
and 
municipal 
technicians 
active 
in 
maintenance 
3 
Page  116
and 
cleaning 
work 
and 
the 
management 
of 
solid 
waste. 
Indeed, 
at 
some 
medical 
facilities 
the 
municipal 
public 
services 
assist 
with 
collecting 
solid 
waste. 
Most 
trash 
collectors 
have 
received 
no 
training 
about 
the 
sanitary 
waste 
that 
is 
commingled 
with 
other 
trash 
in 
the 
containers 
they 
pick 
up. 
The 
impacts 
resulting 
from 
this 
situation 
relate 
to 
the 
health 
risk 
of 
the 
employees’ 
exposure 
to 
infection 
risks, 
the 
uncontrolled 
discharge 
of 
solid 
waste 
at 
unregulated 
dumps 
for 
household 
waste, 
and 
especially 
the 
risks 
of 
environmental 
contamination 
from 
the 
related 
uncontrolled 
runoff. 
Objective 
4: 
Enhancing 
public 
awareness 
and 
the 
awareness 
of 
trash 
collectors. 
At 
present, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health’s 
Education 
for 
Health 
unit 
has 
no 
operational 
information 
and 
public 
awareness 
programs 
focused 
explicitly 
on 
the 
concerns 
associated 
with 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
For 
the 
most 
part, 
the 
previous 
programs 
or 
those 
now 
underway 
cover 
topics 
associated 
with 
health 
in 
general 
(health 
care, 
disease 
prevention, 
etc.), 
as 
was 
the 
case 
for 
the 
training 
offered 
to 
community 
health 
personnel, 
neighborhood 
associations, 
etc. 
This 
is 
why 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
conduct 
public 
awareness 
programs 
aimed 
primarily 
at 
the 
people 
providing 
or 
receiving 
health 
care 
at 
home, 
persons 
using 
recycled 
objects 
or 
living 
near 
waste 
disposal 
sites, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
who 
gather 
trash. 
These 
programs 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
with 
support 
from 
NGOs 
and 
CBOs 
with 
ample 
experience 
in 
environmental 
and 
health 
issues. 
Objective 
5: 
Involving 
private 
operators 
in 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
At 
this 
level, 
the 
proposed 
PGDS 
should 
develop 
an 
approach 
toward 
enhancing 
the 
professionalism 
of 
the 
sector 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
manage 
revenues 
and 
profits. 
Such 
an 
option 
assumes 
that 
the 
plan 
takes 
account 
of 
the 
need 
to 
support 
private 
initiatives 
and 
develop 
the 
public/private/civil 
society 
partnership 
to 
ensure 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
sector. 
Within 
this 
framework, 
it 
would 
be 
desirable 
to 
determine 
autonomous 
financing 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
sanitary 
waste, 
develop 
targeted 
financial 
resources, 
and 
create 
incentives 
for 
public 
and 
private 
partners 
to 
engage 
in 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
sector 
while 
strengthening 
their 
technical 
and 
managerial 
capacities 
with 
a 
view 
to 
promoting 
the 
emergence 
of 
expertise 
and 
leadership 
in 
this 
field. 
Indeed, 
the 
selection 
of 
appropriate 
technologies 
calls 
for 
tested 
expertise 
and 
substantial 
financial 
resources. 
For 
this 
reason, 
solid 
waste 
managers 
will 
have 
to 
be 
encouraged 
to 
participate 
in 
technical 
meetings 
(seminars, 
conferences, 
etc.) 
which 
give 
them 
opportunities 
to 
exchange 
experiences 
with 
others. 
Accordingly, 
they 
could 
benefit 
from 
training 
packages 
oriented 
principally 
toward 
the 
following 
fields: 
(i) 
the 
selection 
of 
appropriate 
waste 
collection 
equipment; 
(ii) 
models 
for 
the 
efficient 
planning 
of 
collection 
routes/itineraries; 
(iii) 
special 
handling 
of 
biomedical 
waste; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
cost 
effectiveness 
of 
available 
technologies. 
Objective 
6: 
Supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Sanitary 
Waste 
Management 
Plan 
(PGDS). 
The 
strategies 
are 
as 
follows: 
(a) 
Validate 
the 
PGDS. 
This 
will 
entail, 
in 
each 
District, 
organizing 
seminars 
to 
launch, 
provide 
information 
on, 
and 
validate 
the 
PGDS, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
a 
national 
consensus 
encompassing 
all 
stakeholders; 
and 
establish 
the 
national 
structure 
for 
coordinating 
PGDS 
implementation; 
(b) 
Preparing 
operational 
activities. 
This 
will 
entail 
evaluating 
initial 
operations; 
and 
(c) 
Monitoring 
implementation 
and 
conducting 
evaluations 
of 
the 
PGDS. 
This 
will 
involve 
carrying 
out 
inspections 
and 
monthly 
monitoring 
at 
the 
District 
and 
national 
levels; 
conducting 
the 
mid-term 
evaluation 
(end 
of 
second 
year); 
and 
performing 
the 
final 
evaluation 
of 
the 
PGDS 
(end 
of 
project). 
Page  117
Interconnection 
of 
PGDS 
with 
national 
health 
policy 
Institutional 
anchoring. 
As 
an 
essential 
component 
of 
the 
Program 
for 
AIDS 
Control 
(PLS), 
on 
the 
institutional 
level 
the 
PGDS 
will 
have 
to 
be 
closely 
tied 
in 
with 
the 
national 
health 
strategy. 
Therefore, 
the 
management 
plan 
should 
have 
a 
complementary 
relationship 
with 
the 
overall 
policy 
on 
waste 
management, 
particularly 
as 
regards 
the 
national 
hygiene 
and 
sanitation 
plan 
which 
it 
is 
important 
to 
develop 
under 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
auspices. 
Accordingly, 
the 
coordination 
of 
PGDS 
activities 
should 
come 
under 
the 
PLS. 
Institutional 
responsibilities 
and 
jurisdictions. 
Improving 
the 
management 
of 
sanitary 
waste 
assumes 
that 
first 
there 
has 
been 
a 
clarification 
of 
the 
responsibilities 
and 
jurisdictions 
of 
each 
of 
the 
institutional 
stakeholders 
concerned. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
following 
distribution 
could 
be 
proposed: 
At 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
should 
be 
responsible 
for 
defining 
and 
applying 
the 
national 
plan 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management. 
The 
Prevention 
and 
Public 
Hygiene 
Directorate 
(DPHP), 
the 
Basic 
Health 
Care 
Directorate 
(DSSB), 
including 
its 
Education 
for 
Medical 
facility 
(SEPS), 
the 
Research, 
Planning, 
and 
International 
Cooperation 
Directorate 
(DEPCI), 
and 
the 
Health 
Personnel 
Training 
Center 
will 
be 
called 
upon 
to 
assume 
a 
key 
role 
in 
monitoring 
execution 
of 
the 
PGDS, 
especially 
as 
regards 
adherence 
with 
collection, 
storage, 
transportation, 
and 
elimination 
procedures, 
in 
keeping 
with 
rules 
and 
procedures 
to 
be 
established. 
Drafting 
of 
the 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
provisions 
relating 
to 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
should 
be 
entrusted 
to 
the 
DPHP, 
training 
activities 
to 
the 
CFPS, 
and 
education 
and 
awareness 
campaigns 
to 
the 
SEPS 
unit 
of 
the 
DSSB; 
* 
At 
the 
district 
level, 
the 
Sanitary 
Districts 
will 
bear 
the 
administrative 
responsibility 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
in 
their 
area 
of 
influence. 
They 
will 
establish 
operational 
technical 
units 
charged 
with 
monitoring 
the 
application 
of 
national 
policy 
within 
the 
health 
structures 
in 
their 
area; 
* 
The 
Director 
of 
each 
medical 
facility 
will 
be 
administratively 
accountable 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
in 
his 
or 
her 
institution. 
The 
Director 
will 
monitor 
application 
of 
the 
regulations 
and 
of 
best 
practice 
procedures, 
and 
will 
appoint 
the 
teams 
responsible 
for 
sanitary 
waste 
sorting, 
collection, 
storage, 
transport, 
and 
elimination; 
l 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Housing, 
Urbanism, 
Environment, 
and 
Territorial 
Development 
(MHUEAT) 
should 
monitor 
strict 
application 
of 
environmental 
regulations 
and 
procedures 
(pollution 
standards, 
procedures 
for 
the 
preparation 
and 
approval 
of 
environmental 
impact 
studies) 
in 
all 
sanitary 
waste 
management 
procedures, 
in 
particular 
when 
incinerators 
are 
installed; 
0 
the 
Municipalities 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
the 
sanitation 
of 
the 
areas 
within 
their 
territory, 
in 
particular 
with 
ensuring 
that 
their 
public 
containers 
(especially 
those 
placed 
in 
medical 
facilities) 
and 
the 
trash 
receptacles 
they 
manage 
are 
not 
used 
for 
untreated 
sanitary 
waste. 
They 
should 
also 
express 
their 
views 
on 
any 
project 
which 
might 
affect 
the 
health 
of 
local 
populations, 
particularly 
those 
relating 
to 
sanitary 
waste 
collection, 
transportation, 
and 
elimination 
within 
their 
territory.

’ 
Principles. 
To 
measure 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
PGDS 
in 
terms 
of 
reducing 
infections 
and 
contamination 
affecting 
the 
individuals 
primarily 
concerned, 
especially 
safety 
in 
health 
care 
environments, 
the 
recommended 
actions 
should 
be 
monitored 
and 
evaluated 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
coordination 
structure 
that 
involves 
all 
stakeholders 
as 
well 
as 
the 
PLS, 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
MHUEAT 
staff, 
medical

as 
well 
as 
the 
municipalities 
and 
NGOs 
active 
in 
the 
area 
of 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
The 
PLS 
(with 
DEPCI 
support) 
will 
coordinate 
the

devoted 
to

and 
the 
strengthening 
of

we 
deemed 
it

Annex 
13: 
SOCIAL 
ASSESSMENT 
DJIBOUTI: HIV/AIDS, Malaria, 
and 
Tuberculosis 
Control 
Project 
Social 
Annex 
As 
part 
of 
project 
preparation, 
a 
social 
assessment 
of 
people infected 
or 
affected 
by 
HIV 
was 
prepared 
by 
the 
MOH 
through 
a 
research 
team 
led 
by 
a 
Djiboutian 
consultant 
and 
advised 
by 
the 
IDA 
social  development  expert. 
This 
study 
was 
the 
first 
of 
its 
kmd 
in 
Djibouti 
and 
used 
qualitative 
research 
methods 
to 
gain 
a deeper 
understanding 
of 
the 
difficulties, 
coping 
strategies, 
and cultural 
factors 
that intervene 
in 
managing 
the 
disease. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project 
adequately 
considered 
the 
knowledge, 
attitudes, 
and 
practices 
of 
the 
wide 
community and 
of 
infected 
persons. 
The 
study: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Effectively 
demonstrated 
to 
the 
MOH 
that 
HIV 
is 
not 
only 
a 
public 
health 
but 
also 
a 
broad 
socio-economic 
issue; 
Contributed 
to 
initial 
steps 
of 
destigmatizing 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
disease; 
Provided 
a 
social 
and cultural 
understanding that 
has 
shaped 
the project’s 
design; 
Helped 
mobilize 
other donors (such 
as 
the 
World 
Food 
Program 
(WFP)) 
and 
medical 
centers 
in 
providing 
care 
and 
support 
to 
PLWHA 
and their families. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
research 
were 
presented 
during 
several 
workshops 
consisting 
of: 
representatives 
of 
the 
MOH 
(including 
high 
officials), 
donor 
community, 
teachers, 
and 
local 
NGOs. 
This 
dissemination 
of 
the 
study 
helped 
inform 
a 
wider 
public 
of 
the 
social 
and 
economic 
issues 
faced 
by 
the 
PLWHA 
and their 
families, 
and 
it 
enriched 
the 
final 
document. 
It 
also 
helped 
launch 
a 
discussion 
on 
actions 
that 
communities and institutions 
can 
undertake 
to 
alleviate 
the 
burden 
of 
the 
disease 
on 
PLWHA 
and 
their families. 
The 
public 
discussion 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
infection 
on 
sero-positive 
individuals 
and their families painted 
a 
human 
face 
and 
contributed 
to 
beginning 
the process 
of 
destigmatization. 
The 
draft report 
was 
reviewed and 
commented 
on 
by 
IDA. 
These 
recommendations 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
final 
document. 
Research 
Method 
Qualitative 
research 
was conducted 
in 
July-August 
2002 
through 
a 
team 
of 
9 
investigators 
led 
by 
a 
social 
scientist, 
The 
team 
included staff 
from 
the 
MOH 
working 
with 
the 
PLS 
and 
a 
PLWHA 
as 
a 
key 
resource 
person 
who 
encouraged respondents 
to 
come forward. 
The 
PLWHA 
played 
a 
key 
role 
given 
the 
highly 
sensitive 
nature 
of 
the 
disease. 
The 
participation 
of 
medical staff 
in 
this 
activity 
(and the 
training 
sessions 
that were 
held for 
them 
by 
the 
consultant) 
helped 
improve 
their 
understanding 
of 
the 
non-public health 
dimensions 
of 
the 
disease, 
will 
strengthen 
their 
capacity 
to 
provide 
improved 
care 
and 
support 
to 
PLWHA. 
The 
study 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
Djibouti-Ville 
as 
it 
is 
where the 
majority 
of 
the 
population, 
including 
seropositives, 
reside. 
Since the 
discussion 
of 
the 
disease 
is 
taboo, 
the team used 
a 
variety 
of 
techniques 
to 
identify 
PLWHA 
ranging 
from 
recommendations 
by 
doctors 
to 
snowball  sampling 
techniques 
in 
neighborhoods. 
Although 
they  were 
able 
to 
identify 
a 
total 
of 
513 
potential 
interviewees  and 
contacted 
200, 
only 
43 
agreed 
to 
be 
interviewed 
and 
12 
died 
before 
interviews 
could 
be 
completed. 
During 
the course 
of 
the 
research, 
the team 
was able to: 
(i) 
enlist 
the support 
of 
the 
WFP 
in 
providing 
nutritional 
assistance 
to 
interviewees; 
(ii) 
provide 
counseling 
services 
to both 
interviewees and 
those 
who 
refused 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
study; 
and 
(iii) 
enlist 
the 
help 
of 
health 
professionals 
for 
medical 
assistance, 
including 
hospitalization.

In 
addition 
to 
interviews 
with 
PLWHA, 
interviews 
were 
also 
conducted 
with 
those 
affected 
by 
the 
disease 
(widows, 
orphans, 
other 
relatives), 
medical 
professionals 
working 
with 
PLWHA, 
pharmacists 
and 
focus 
group 
discussions 
with 
two 
groups 
at 
risk 
(sex 
workers and 
port 
workers). 
Highlights 
of 
Some 
of 
the 
Major 
Findings 
Some 
culturalfactors. 
Identity 
in 
Djibouti 
is 
group-based 
and 
revolves around 
the clan. 
Any 
individual 
misbehavior 
is 
perceived 
as 
tamishing 
the 
image 
of 
the 
whole 
clan. 
Because 
of 
the 
sexually transmitted nature 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
cases 
in 
Djibouti, 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
sense 
that 
HIV 
shames 
the 
entire 
clan. 
On 
an 
individual 
level, 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
of 
divine 
punishment 
for 
illicit 
actions. 
Prevention 
campaigns 
in 
the 
past 
have 
emphasized 
that 
“AIDS=Death” 
and, 
therefore, 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
of 
helplessness. 
All 
of 
these factors 
contribute 
to 
the 
taboo 
surrounding 
AIDS, 
prevent 
people 
from 
seeking 
help, 
promote 
its 
spread, 
and prevent 
the 
families 
from 
taking 
adequate measures 
for 
managing 
its 
impacts. 
Communal 
solidarity 
is 
still 
the 
most 
important 
form 
of 
coping 
for 
families 
of 
sufferers 
and 
becomes especially 
draining 
as 
prolonged illness 
forces 
them 
to 
depend 
for 
even 
the 
most 
basic 
needs 
on 
their clan 
or 
extended 
family. 
Funeral and 
related 
expenses 
place 
a 
particular 
strain 
on 
immediate 
and 
extended 
family 
due 
to 
their 
high 
cost 
(ranging between 
FDJ30,OOO 
and 
FDJ300,OOO). 
Support 
from 
the 
extended 
family 
is 
not 
always 
a 
viable long-term 
coping 
strategy 
and 
is 
often 
reserved 
for 
punctual 
needs 
(such 
as 
school 
books 
for 
children). 
Neighbors 
are 
seen 
as 
the 
source 
of 
the 
most 
durable 
support, 
especially 
for 
routine 
matters 
and 
also 
for 
psychosocial 
support. 
Gender and 
AIDS 
The 
study 
illustrates 
how 
differentially 
the 
disease 
affects 
men 
and women. 
Women 
are 
more 
vulnerable 
in 
contracting 
the 
disease 
due 
to 
their 
lack 
of 
control 
over 
their 
sexuality  (forced 
marriage, 
unfaithful 
husbands, 
occupational 
hazards 
for 
CSW 
and 
domestic 
servants). 
In 
addition, 
women 
are 
economically 
more 
vulnerable 
when 
the 
male head 
of 
household or 
source 
of 
primary 
support 
contracts 
the 
disease. 
Costs 
associated 
with 
treating 
PLWHA, 
especially 
when 
the head 
of 
the 
household 
is 
male, 
drains 
the domestic budget; 
and 
taboos 
regarding the 
prevalence 
status 
prevent 
women 
from 
preparing 
themselves 
for 
the 
financial 
future 
of 
their families. 
Their weak 
social/legal 
status 
also 
puts 
them 
in 
a 
weaker 
position 
while 
negotiating their 
economic 
future 
(e.g., 
inheritance 
issues) 
with 
their 
in-laws. 
Institutional 
Responses 
and 
Key 
Needs 
of 
Affected 
Persons 
The 
most significant 
finding 
of 
the 
study 
is 
the 
poor 
institutional 
response 
to 
people 
who 
test 
positive: 
(i) 
tests  are 
frequently 
done 
without 
the  patient’s 
knowledge  and 
results 
are 
not 
communicated; 
(ii) 
family 
members 
and 
others 
are 
sometimes 
informed 
before 
the 
patients 
themselves; 
(iii) 
there 
is 
very 
limited 
respect 
for 
confidentiality 
of 
the 
results; 
and 
(iv) 
medical 
personnel 
often 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
announce the results 
to 
the patient 
or 
what 
advice 
to 
offer 
since  a 
positive result 
is 
perceived 
as 
a 
death 
sentence 
(true 
for 
both 
public 
and private health 
services). 
Consequently, 
people 
do 
not 
trust 
the 
medical 
establishment 
and 
are 
reluctant 
to 
seek 
treatment 
or 
advice. 
Those 
who 
can 
afford 
it 
prefer 
going 
abroad. 
ARVs 
are available, 
but 
costs 
are 
prohibitive 
(FDJ150,OOO-250,000 
per 
month, equivalent 
to 
the 
monthly 
wage 
of 
a 
high-level 
government 
official), although 
one 
pharmacy 
has 
begun 
importing 
generic 
ARVs 
at 
a 
lower 
cost. 
The 
PLWHA’s 
primary 
need, 
whether 
they 
are 
sick, 
at 
home, 
or 
at 
hospital, 
is 
nutritional. 
Patients, 
when 
hospitalized, 
depend 
on 
their  families 
to 
provide daily 
meals 
for 
them. 
The 
disease 
may 
cause 
the 
patient 
to 
be 
unoperative 
for 
long 
periods 
of 
time, 
unable 
to 
be 
economically 
active 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner, 
and require high-cost 
drugs, 
all 
of 
which 
contribute 
to 
the 
financial 
burden 
placed 
on 
families 
and the 
inability to provide 
patients 
with 
the 
requisite 
nutritional 
needs. 
In 
addition, the 
inability 
to 
provide nutritional 
support 
is 
all 
the 
more felt 
by 
the 
members 
of 
the 
family when 
the 
PLWHA 
is 
the head 
of 
the household. 
The 
second 
most 
felt 
need 
- 
108 
- 
Page  123
is 
economic. 
Medical 
treatment 
leads 
to 
a shortage 
of 
cash, 
requiring 
families 
to 
sacrifice other 
expenses, 
such 
as 
rent,  schooling, 
etc. 
And 
the 
third 
need 
is 
for 
proper 
medical treatment, 
which 
currently 
is 
inadequate 
and 
unsatisfactory. 
Some 
implications 
of 
the 
findings 
for 
the 
project 
The 
study 
contributed 
in 
several 
ways 
to 
the design 
of 
the 
project 
and 
to 
the 
activities that 
will 
be 
initiated 
under 
this 
project: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Designing 
the 
training 
manual 
for 
health 
professionals 
and 
others 
who 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
counseling 
PLWHA; 
it 
also 
revealed  the 
importance 
of 
providing 
counseling 
for 
immediate 
family 
and incorporating 
neighbors 
(through 
CBOs 
and 
other 
organizations), 
age 
groupings 
and 
other 
communal 
or 
social groups 
in 
providing 
a 
support 
network 
in 
a 
gender-sensitive 
manner. 
Providing 
prevention 
messages 
that also 
show 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to live 
with 
HIV/AIDS, 
especially 
in 
the 
community 
intervention 
component. 
Importance 
of 
providing 
nutritional 
assistance 
for 
the 
sick 
and their 
families. 
A 
pilot 
intervention 
providing 
nutrition 
to 
sero-positive  persons 
and  their  families 
will 
be 
launched 
in 
the 
coming 
weeks. 
Possibility 
of 
providing 
income-generating 
activities 
for 
families 
of 
PLWHA 
and 
helping 
families 
plan 
for 
the future, especially 
women-headed 
households. 
Need 
for 
providing 
affordable 
drugs 
in 
a 
medically 
sustainable 
way. 
Raise 
awareness 
and 
acceptance 
in 
the 
MOH 
that 
HIV/AIDS 
is 
a 
broad 
socioeconomic 
matter 
requiring 
attention 
on 
a 
wide front 
that 
goes 
beyond purely medical 
issues 
(key 
value 
of 
the 
study).
