setting up\n            and implementing a response against HIV/AIDS, sexually\n            transmitted infections (STIs), malaria, and tuberculosis\n            (TB), of which the latter two are important risk cofactors.\n            There are 4 components to the project: 1) The capacity\n            building and policy development will aim at strengthening\n            Djibouti's capacity to cope with the spread of\n            HIV/AIDS, and to control malaria and tuberculosis. 2) The\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) and more broadly the health\n            community have special responsibilities for the prevention\n            and management of HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria, and other\n            opportunistic infections - including malaria, and\n            tuberculosis. 3) As demonstrated in other countries, in\n            order for the control of HIV/AIDS to be effective, it is\n            necessary to have a multisectoral approach to better target\n            priority vulnerable groups. The preparation process of the\n            National Strategic Plan has demonstrated that the MOH could\n            not by itself deliver all the essential prevention, and\n            impact. 4) In order to enlist communities in controlling\n            HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and to provide them\n            with the means to mitigate the impact of these diseases, it\n            is necessary to provide resources at the local level."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
