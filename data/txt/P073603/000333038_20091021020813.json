"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and\n            Tuberculosis Control Project for Djibouti were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: getting the support at the highest political level\n            made a huge difference in implementation. The creation of\n            the Interministerial Committee, later transformed into the\n            CCMI (Comite de Coordination Multisectorielle et\n            Inter-partenariale), succeeded in mobilizing the\n            multi-sectoral and community-based activities and donor\n            support. Moreover, it was important to engage religious\n            leaders. Trained religious leaders and imams were often\n            called on to conduct advocacy and question and answer\n            sessions. The early delays in implementation were caused by\n            the focus on strengthening the management capacity and\n            qualified staffing of the newly established Executive\n            Secretariat (ES) and on the development of detailed\n            guidelines and procedures. However, later on, this\n            investment accelerated the implementation guided by the\n            protocols and procedures manuals. Although prevention of\n            HIV/AIDS, including Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT),\n            remains the most cost-effective weapon in the fight against\n            the epidemic compared to Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment,\n            insight and closer consideration of epidemiologic and\n            cultural aspects led to the conclusion that prevention\n            (particularly VCT services) would fail unless ARV treatment\n            was simultaneously offered. As a result, the project\n            introduced and scaled up ARV treatment until the GF (Global\n            Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria) took over. It\n            was later shown in service statistics that VCT utilization\n            increased, particularly among the young and educated, when\n            they were assured of access to affordable treatment."}, "docdt": "2009-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
