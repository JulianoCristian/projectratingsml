Project sustainability is\n            likely. World Bank performance was satisfactory overall.\n            Borrower performance, while uneven from the first to the\n            second half of implementation, can be judged as satisfactory\n            overall. The several lessons learned included the following:\n            In countries where there is little movement and reform\n            dialogue in the higher education sector, modest projects can\n            stimulate substantial institutional development and set the\n            stage for improved efficiency and more complex reforms.\n            Technical assistance is more likely to have substantial\n            impact on institutional development and greater skill\n            transfer when conducted in close collaboration with local\n            institutional staff. Modest investment in information\n            technology can contribute to substantial impact on\n            institutional development, particularly when there is little\n            or no existing network. Small competitive or incentive funds\n            within institutions of higher education can have substantial\n            impact on academic culture. Administrative and\n            ministry-level reforms (budgeting, finance, etc.) can be\n            more broadly accepted when technical assistance and\n            investments are made concurrently in more visible academic\n            areas (incentive funds for faculty, internet installations,\n            etc). Central and institutional cpaacity can be built\n            simultaneously for synergistic impact in the higher\n            education sector. Performance indicators should be defined\n            early and in consultation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
