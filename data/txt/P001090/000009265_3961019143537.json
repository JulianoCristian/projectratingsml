Education\n            Technical Assistance Project is to provide a framework for\n            the rationalization of higher education in Guinea. Its\n            long-term objective will be to establish a reconfigured,\n            streamlined system with greater institutional autonomy,\n            improved cost-effectiveness, and increased relevance for\n            economic development. The project will provide support for\n            policy reform and for capacity-building. It consists of\n            three major components: 1) institutional reorganization; 2)\n            development of an information and communication system; and\n            3) establishment of budgetary programming and monitoring capacities."}, "docdt": "1995-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
