Project for Afghanistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            systematic sector analysis in fragile and post-country\n            contexts, even with limited data available, contributes to\n            better project design. The 'securing Afghanistan's\n            future' report exemplifies the positive contributions\n            of a basic systematic sector analysis to project design and\n            quality at entry. Flexibility and fast response policies and\n            approaches need to be balanced with minimum standards for\n            program planning, decision making and management. Targeting\n            and differentiated strategies are needed in highly\n            heterogeneous post-conflict countries. Simple emergency\n            designs do not have to be homogenous and could include, for\n            example, targeted and differentiated interventions for rural\n            and urban communities, secure and unsecure areas, and\n            secular and Islamic messages. Aid channeled through\n            Government should contribute to identify practical ways to\n            continue to improve public financial management (PFM)\n            execution and solve bottlenecks for social services delivery."}, "docdt": "2009-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
