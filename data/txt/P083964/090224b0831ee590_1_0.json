Thirty\n            years of conflict and political unrest destroyed the Afghan\n            education system. Recognizing that education would play a\n            vital role in the reconstruction and development of\n            Afghanistan, International Development Association launched\n            a series of education programs aimed at providing access and\n            quality education to Afghan students at all levels. Since\n            2001, the projects have brought new life to general,\n            technical, and vocational education, and particularly\n            benefited girls. Enrollment in grades 1 to 12 increased from\n            3.9 million in 2004 to 6.2 million in 2008. Girls\u2019\n            enrollment skyrocketed from 839,000 to more than 2.2\n            million, and boys\u2019 from 2.6 million to 3.9 million, the\n            highest enrollment in the history of Afghanistan. The\n            project launched the Afghanistan Skills Development Program\n            to promote standard technical and vocational education by\n            establishing a national qualification framework. The first\n            education management information system was developed to\n            help the ministry in policy, monitoring, and evaluation. The\n            program covers the entire education sector from primary to\n            tertiary in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T04:45:05Z"}
