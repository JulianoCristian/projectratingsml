implementation of structural\n            reforms in the financial and enterprise sectors, and 2) the\n            initial phase of the energy sector restructuring program.\n            Specifically, the loan provides foreign exchange for balance\n            of payments support. It is conditioned on substantial\n            progress in implementing structural reforms in the financial\n            and enterprise sectors, and the implementation of the\n            initial phase of the restructuring of the energy sector. The\n            loan helps accelerate progress in the privatization and\n            liquidation of state-owned enterprises, the sustaining of\n            banking reforms including privatization of public sector\n            banks and upgrading of banking supervision capacity, the\n            maintenance of financial discipline, and the implementation\n            of the initial phase of the restructuring of the energy\n            sector. Progress in the reforms supported by the loan will\n            sustain the gains from macroeconomic stabilization and\n            deepen the transition to a market economy."}, "docdt": "1999-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
