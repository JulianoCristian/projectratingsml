           Administration Project for Afghanistan is to assist the\n            Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA)(and its successor)\n            in putting in place, on an emergency basis, capacity in key\n            public administration areas to facilitate better use of\n            public resources, including donor funds, for urgent\n            reconstruction and development efforts. In addition, a\n            secondary objective is to support some basic steps towards\n            laying the foundation for a transparent, well-functioning\n            public administration. The Grant will finance the employment\n            by AIA of qualified firms to work with AIA officials to\n            carry out, on an interim basis, government procurement,\n            financial management and audit functions on behalf of the\n            AIA; develop the administration's capacity; and assess\n            existing systems and procedures to recommend suitable policy\n            reforms. Services will also be provided to enhance aid\n            coordination, strengthen payroll management and budget\n            processes, and develop capacity in economic policy\n            formulation. In addition, resources are available to fund\n            studies and institution building within selected entities of\n            the AIA."}, "docdt": "2002-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
