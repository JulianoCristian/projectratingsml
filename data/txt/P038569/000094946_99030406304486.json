Adjustment Credit\n            Project seeks to: 1) establish a fiscally sustainable\n            pension scheme that will provide a stronger linkage between\n            contributions and benefits, while providing a minimum level\n            of guaranteed support to prevent poverty; 2) improve the\n            effectiveness of labor market interventions under conditions\n            of high unemployment; and 3) implement well-targeted and\n            fiscally sustainable programs to alleviate poverty. The\n            credit will be released in two tranches. If successfully\n            implemented, the program is expected to result in reductions\n            in the payroll contribution rate, alleviating the\n            significant burden on enterprises and on employment, and\n            opening the way for a transition to a partially funded\n            system. The primary risk of the project is that policy\n            reversals could undermine the medium term fiscal\n            sustainability of the pension system. Other risks include\n            lower than expected collections and weak institutional\n            capacity within the Social Fund. To mitigate this risk, the\n            Social Fund is undertaking an aggressive contributor\n            registration drive and has agreed on a comprehensive plan of\n            coordination with the Tax Inspectorate."}, "docdt": "1998-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
