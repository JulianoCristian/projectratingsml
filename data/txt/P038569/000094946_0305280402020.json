Social Sector Adjustment Operation\n            Project (SOSAC) for Kyrgyz Republic achieved its major\n            objectives fully; the Bank performance was rated as highly\n            satisfactory, however the borrower performance was only\n            satisfactory. Relevance of the project objectives was high,\n            adopting policies, regulations, and structural improvements\n            to modernized the Pension Fund and reduce its deficits was\n            key to help the Government improve its fiscal performance\n            and in establishing a system consistent with a market\n            economy. In the area of Social Assistance (SA), a study\n            performed under SOSAC aimed to assess the extent to which\n            the means testing formula for SA benefits was effective in\n            reaching its intended beneficiaries, and develop\n            recommendations on how to improve benefits reaching the\n            poor. Lessons learned a) difficulties of the SOSAC Technical\n            Assistance (TA) Program played a part in the decision to\n            establish a full TA investment operation to support\n            implementation of the Consolidated Structural Adjustment\n            Credit; b) performance of the implementing agency was\n            satisfactory, however the agency had many other\n            responsibilities, and limited capabilities, e.g., for\n            procurement and donor coordination, which somewhat reduced\n            its effectiveness. The SOSAC was not a politically popular\n            project in the Kyrgyz Republic."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
