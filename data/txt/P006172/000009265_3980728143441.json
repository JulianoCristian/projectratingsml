The overall outcome of\n            the project was rated moderately satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated\n            satisfactory. The main objectives of the project were to:\n            (a) Improve and expand water and sanitation services in the\n            major cities of Bolivia (La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba)\n            mainly by: (i) rehabilitating water production facilities\n            and increasing water distribution capacity in La Paz to\n            benefit a population of about 200,000 (13 percent of the\n            metropolitan population in 1995); (ii) constructing sewerage\n            systems in the municipality of El Alto, to benefit a\n            population of about 200,000 (13 percent of the metropolitan\n            population in 1995). (b) Improve the operational efficiency\n            and management systems of the water utilities responsible\n            for services in the above cities. (c) Introduce a framework\n            of sector policies and the institutional arrangements needed\n            to accelerate the development of the water supply and\n            sanitation sector countrywide. The main lessons learned from\n            the project are as follows. (a) It is preferable that the\n            preparation and evaluation of projects be based on final\n            engineering designs. Preparation based on feasibility\n            studies may lead to delays caused by the need to redesign\n            works and make subsequent adjustments in the scope of works,\n            which may cause delays in achieving the expected benefits.\n            (b) Privatization depends entirely on the political will to\n            carry out the process. It was successful in La Paz because\n            the Government and Mayor were committed to it, and it failed\n            in Cochabamba because of the objection of the local\n            authorities. (c) High turnover of task managers does not\n            foster sound supervision, does not support implementation\n            efforts, and should be avoided. (d) The project objectives\n            were too ambitious and the project design was too\n            complicated. It is preferable to design and implement\n            simpler projects."}, "docdt": "1998-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
