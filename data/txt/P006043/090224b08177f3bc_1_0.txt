                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the Project are to: (a) provide the rural areas of the Participating Provinces with reliable electric supply in a sustainable manner through the use of
                         renewable energy; (b) advance the reform of the Borrower#s energy sector in particular critical areas; (c) support the Borrower#s strategy to expand the participation of
                         the private sector in the provision of electricity in the rural areas of the Participating Provinces, as well as strengthen the capacity of Participating Provinces to regulate
                         such participation; and (d) support the creation of sustainable business operations for rural energy in Argentina.

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         Global GEF objectives are to: a) remove market barriers to application, implementation and dissemination of renewable energy sources; and b) reduce greenhouse gas
                         emissions by replacing small-diesel electricity generation an the use of candles, kerosene and gas cylinders and in lighting and other domestic uses with renewable
                         energy systems. The project's mid-term review confirmed the validity of the above objectives.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation continues to make good progress towards achieving its development objectives. While the project has encountered some operational difficulty in working
                         with the provincial governments and concessionaires as required, implementation is on track to achieving the Project's objectives and most of the funds have been committed in 14
                         participating provinces with 27 signed contracts. The funds originally planned for Catamarca and Formosa have been reallocated to other provinces as a result of the difficulties for
                         these provinces to comply with the participation requirements. All processes for Loan IBRD 4454 (PERMER original) have been finalized and the loan has been closed (with its full
                         US$ 30 million disbursed), while Loan IBRD 7617 (PERMER AF) is under implementation.

                         As of October 2012, US$49.8 million of the US$50 million additional financing loans have been committed, and the rest is expected to be committed by project closure. A total of US
                         $43.9 million has been disbursed, which represents a significant increase over the previous sixteen months (was $14.4 million in June 2011). All funds are expected to be disbursed
                         when the project closes in December 2012.

                         The number of households served by PERMER AF has increased significantly since the mission in November 2011, from 1,460 then to 7,744 in June 2012. The target of 18,227
                         households to be served by PERMER AF is expected to be largely achieved by project closing. Most of the current disbursements were made against the purchase and delivery of
                         the equipment and the bulk of the installation and subsequent certification of solar home systems is under way. As such, the PCU is closely monitoring the progress in installations
                         and making plans to ensure certification is done in a timely manner. A significant increase in the number of installed and certified systems is expected in the next few months.
