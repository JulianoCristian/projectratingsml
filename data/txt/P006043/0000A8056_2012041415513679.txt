                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The objectives of the Project are to: (a) provide the rural areas of the Participating Provinces with reliable electric supply in a sustainable manner through the use of
                         renewable energy; (b) advance the reform of the Borrower#s energy sector in particular critical areas; (c) support the Borrower#s strategy to expand the participation of
                         the private sector in the provision of electricity in the rural areas of the Participating Provinces, as well as strengthen the capacity of Participating Provinces to regulate
                         such participation; and (d) support the creation of sustainable business operations for rural energy in Argentina.

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         Global GEF objectives are to: a) remove market barriers to application, implementation and dissemination of renewable energy sources; and b) reduce greenhouse gas
                         emissions by replacing small-diesel electricity generation an the use of candles, kerosene and gas cylinders and in lighting and other domestic uses with renewable
                         energy systems. The project's mid-term review confirmed the validity of the above objectives.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation continues to make good progress towards achieving its development objectives. While the project has encountered some operational difficulty in working
                         with the provincial governments and concessionaires as required, implementation is on track to achieving the Project's objectives and most of the funds have been committed in 14
                         participating provinces with 25 signed contracts. The funds originally planned for Catamarca and Formosa have been reallocated to other provinces as a result of difficulties for these
                         provinces to comply with the participation requirements.

                         As of February 2012, US$44.9 million of the US$50 million additional financing loans have been committed, a total of $48.6 million is expected to be committed by May 2012, and the
                         rest is expected to be committed by August 2012. A total of US$31.9 million has been disbursed, which represents a significant increase over the last nine months (was $14.4 million
                         then). All funds are expected to be disbursed when the project closes.

                         The number of households served by PERMER AF is low (was 1460 as of November 2011) compared to the target of 18,227, but the target is expected to be largely achieved by
                         project closing. Most of the current disbursements were made against the delivery of the equipment and the bulk of the installation and subsequent certification of solar home
                         systems is under way. As such, the PCU is closely monitoring the progress in installations and making plans to ensure certification is done in a timely manner. It is expected to have a
                         significant increase in the number of installed and certified systems in the next few months.

                         Due to the delays in execution resulting from the 17 months it took for the project to become effective and the time required to amend existing or sign new subsidiary agreements
                         between the federal government and the provinces, a one-year extension of the project closing date from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 has been approved. Existing
                         contracts are -when needed- being amended to provide for the additional time needed to complete execution.
