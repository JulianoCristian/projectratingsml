                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         1. Provide rural off-grid energy services in a sustainable manner using Renewable Energy Systems (RES) where feasible. 2. Support the expansion of private
                         participation in the provision of electricity in rural areas and strengthen provincial governments' capacities to regulate that participation. 3. Advance the reform
                         of the energy sector in particular critical areas such as transmission, distribution, and marketing of electricity; policy on energy efficiency; strategy on RES
                         technology; and regional integration. 4. Promote commercial operation of Wind Home Systems (WHS). 5. Improve knowledge on the application of RES. 6.
                         Global GEF objectives: 6.1 Promote the adoption of RES by removing market barriers and reducing implementation costs; and 6.1 Reduce greenhouse gas
                         emissions. The project's mid-term review confirmed the validity of the above objectives.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
