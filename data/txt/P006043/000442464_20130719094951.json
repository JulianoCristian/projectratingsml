Some\n            lessons learned included: a large-scale renewable energy\n            system project is a medium- to long-term effort that\n            requires a design flexible enough to adapt to the changing\n            conditions that may arise. Projects designed in a rigid\n            manner and without much room for flexibility are likely to\n            face greater obstacles as external (e.g., country risk) or\n            internal conditions change, and experience considerable\n            delays and additional costs in their efforts to adjust.\n            Subsidies are a necessary component of rural electricity\n            projects, being necessary to establish a sound system of\n            rates and subsidies that minimizes economic distortions;\n            they are also funded by secure sources. The eligibility\n            criteria for populations and or regions to be provided with\n            rural electrification projects should be clearly established\n            at an early stage in keeping with the government's\n            policy orientation. Safeguard issues need to be addressed\n            thoroughly at an early stage and incorporated into the\n            project design in order to minimize negative and or\n            irreversible impacts. It is essential to disseminate among\n            interested parties experiences of best practices and the\n            benefits of renewable energy systems in order to develop\n            effectively a renewable energy system (RES) market and\n            achieve sustainable operation. Local resources, when\n            technically qualified, offer the advantage of a better\n            knowledge of the region and often have stronger incentives\n            to perform well while photovoltaic (PV) and wind-power\n            installations have a certain degree of technical complexity,\n            the main challenge at the operational level is to provide\n            effective maintenance and customer service in a market that\n            is widely dispersed and often times located in rugged\n            terrain. Innovative approaches tailored to each case, but\n            often relying on local resources are necessary to provide an\n            effective and low-cost service."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
