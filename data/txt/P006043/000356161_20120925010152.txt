7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
1. Provide rural off-grid energy services in a sustainable manner using Renewable Energy Systems (RES)
where feasible. 2. Support the expansion of private participation in the provision of electricity in rural areas
and strengthen provincial governments' capacities to regulate that participation. 3. Advance the reform of
the energy sector in particular critical areas such as transmission, distribution, and marketing of electricity;
policy on energy efficiency; strategy on RES technology; and regional integration. 4. Promote commercial
operation of Wind Home Systems (WHS). 5. Improve knowledge on the application of RES. 6. Global
GEF objectives: 6.1 Promote the adoption of RES by removing market barriers and reducing
implementation costs; and 6.1 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The project's mid-term review confirmed
the validity of the above objectives.
