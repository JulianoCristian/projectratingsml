MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on the Solomon Islands
Rural Services Project (Credit 1430-SOL)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the Solomon Islands - Rural Services Project
(Credit 1430-SOL) prepared by the Asian Development Bank, with an Evaluation Summary prepared
by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office.
The Bank, co-financiers Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the Government showed flexibility in modifying project design
to better adapt to local conditions.
Although in terms of physical inputs, the project was effectively implemented, the project's
intended impact on farmer behavior and production outcome remains doubtful. Delayed impact and
significant drop in international prices for the two most important project-related commodities (copra
and cocoa) are likely to lead to an economic internal rate of return substantially lower than
anticipated at appraisal. The project is thus rated as unsatisfactory. Sustainability of project activities
is unlikely, as it is contingent on Government's adequate provision of recurrent cost funding.
The PCR is informative. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SOLOMON ISLANDS
RURAL SERVICES PROJECT
(Cr. 1430-SOL)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rural Services
Project in the Solomon Islands, for which Credit 1430-SOL in the amount of SDR
4,930 million was signed on February 9, 1984. The Project was cofinanced by the
Asian Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD). The Credit Closing Date was December 31, 1990; the account was closed
on December 31, 1990 and the undisbursed balance of SDR 1,181,542.00 was
canceled.
Under an agreement between the International Development Association
(IDA) and the ADB (the Project's principal financier), ADB was responsible for
the overall project formulation and appraisal and for the subsequent supervision
of implementation. The PCR was prepared by staff of the ADB following a project
completion mission in April 1992, following the closing of the ADB Loan on
December 31, 1991. The PCR is accompanied by an evaluation summary prepared by
IDA staff.

EVALUATION SUY4ARY
Introduction
1.       The Project was appraised by ADB and financed jointly by ADB, IDA, and
IFAD. ADB as the lead agency was responsible for administration of the Project
but IDA participated in a number of supervision missions although not in the
final mission to prepare the PCR. IDA staff agree in general with the findings
and conclusions of the PCR.
Obiectives
2.       The overall objective of the Project was to assist rural people in their
efforts to increase agricultural production, income and standards of living.
Specifically, the Project sought to improve Government capability to provide
agricultural support services in the areas of research, training and extension
services, and foster the development of rural enterprises. To achieve these
objectives the Project provided for the establishment of Rural Development
Centers (RDCs), improvement of research and extension facilities, establishment
of a National Agricultural Training Institute, an Agricultural Information Unit
to disseminate information to farmers, and a Project Implementation Unit to
coordinate and implement the Project.
Implementation Experience
3.       While the physical targets of the Project were generally achieved, the
intended impact of the project activities on farmers has been delayed and remains
doubtful. Delays in implementation and lack of effective management and operation
compounded by changes in Government, national-provincial administration issues
and bureaucratic holdups point to over ambitious project scope and scheduling of
activities. Site selection and land acquisition problems caused considerable
delays in the construction of the RDCs. The geographic spread and relative
inaccessibility of the RDCs poses limitations on effective supervision and
support from the Center. Weak adaptive research support severely limits the
effectiveness of RDCs in providing training and demonstrations to farmers.
Planned research facilities were provided but the research program could not be
fully sustained after the departure of foreign scientists due to inadequate local
research expertise and experience to manage and implement an effective research
program. The Agricultural Information Unit, as an autonomous unit, made a
promising start but suffered from a lack of direction and inadequate funding
after being transferred to the Agricultural Division. The National Training
Institute (NATI) has continued providing training since its establishment and is



- iv -
being integrated into the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education. The
Borrower complied with most of the Loan/Credit covenants although there were
significant delays in complying with those related to financial matters including
submission of audited financial statements.
Results
4.       The planned physical targets were generally achieved,  although as
indicated above, with delays. Construction of buildings, roads, wharfs, and
procurement of equipment, and consultants were carried out according to agreed
procedures. The Project, however, has not been able to develop an operational
capacity to provide essential support services to farmers as intended. The ERR
has not been reestimated due to unavailability of appropriate data at this stage
but given the delays in implementation, management and budgetary problems, and
a decline in prices of the two main crops i.e. copra and cocoa, it is probable
that the ERR will be below that estimated at the time of appraisal.
Sustainabilitv
5.       Important contributions have been made by the Project in bringing about
improvements in infrastructure, and training facilities but their effectiveness
depends on the provision and availability of adequate numbers of experienced and
qualified staff to manage and operate these facilities, as well as budgetary and
administrative support from the national and provincial administrations. With a
serious shortage of experienced and qualified local staff, and funds, it is
doubtful if the Government alone can sustain and build on the initiatives taken
under the Project.
Findings and Lessons Learned.
6.       The Project was too ambitious in terms of scope, and implementation
scheduling. The importance of geography, accessibility, national-provincial
administration relationships, in addition to staff shortages and overall lack of
project management and implementation experience, was underestimated at
appraisal. Greater attention by project management and supervision missions to
adjustments in scope during implementation might have resulted in improved
sustainability and benefits. The main lessons are : (i) design, scope and
scheduling of activities should be geared to the implementing capacity and
capability of the country generally and the implementing agency specifically.
(ii) there should be a system of annual plan of operations and a midterm review
to enable adjustments to be made during implementation. (iii) lending agencies
should plan for more intensive supervision of projects in countries like the
Solomon Islands.

2.    Overview
The Project was jointly financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the
International Development Association (IDA) and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD). ADB, as the lead agency, was responsible for
its administration, but IDA and IFAD participated in a number of the supervision
missions.   At the time the Project was considered and approved, agriculture
played (and continues to play) a predominant role in the economy of the Solomon
Islands. It contributed about 70% of the GDP, accounted for 90% of the exports
and provided about 30% of paid employment. About 90% of the population lived in
rural areas and was engaged in subsistence agriculture. It was considered that
urgent attention was needed to improve the performance of the agricultural sector
and that this could be achieved through technological improvements and crop
diversification. Development of agriculture had hitherto been constrained by a
lack of research -- improved seeds, better cultural practices and new cash crops,
a weak extension services, and high costs of marketing and processing of produce
due to the dispersed locations of the production areas. The Bank supported the
policies of the Government improving the support services for agriculture but had
not, in the past, participated in project lending for agriculture. This was the
first such project in line with the Bank Group's strategy for the Solomon Islands
which emphasized cofinancing of select operations with ADB as the lead
cofinancing agency.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.   Objectives. Rationale and Scope
1.        The  Bank  approved  Loan No.  646(SF)  for  the  Agricultural
Development Project in the Solomon Islands on October 27, 1983.   The
Project was divided into two parts:  Part A-Rural Services Project for
$5.15 million equivalent; and B-Livestock Development Project for $2.60
million equivalent.   This Project Completion Report   covers Part A -
Rural Services Project.   Part B-Livestock Development Project was the
subject of a Project Completion Report dated June 1990 (PCR:SOL 17086).
In addition to the financing from the Solomon Islands Government, the
Rural Services Project (the Project) involved parallel co-financing from
three  external  sources:    the  Bank,  the  International  Development
Association (IDA), and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD). A technical assistance grant (TA Number 544 SOL) was
provided in conjunction with the loan to assist the Government establish
a project benefit monitoring and evaluation (PBME) program.
2.        There is no simple, brief description of the Project in any
document. Consequently, the Project is usually described in terms of its
expected aims. This ambiguity may have contributed to some communication
problems between Project personnel and other Government agencies during
implementation.   With the benefit of hindsight, the Project should be
described as the first stage of a multisite development project involving
the provision of basic physical infrastructure and support services
needed to initiate agricultural (cash and subsistence crop) development
in the more remote and less well-developed areas of the country and to
support the Government's policy of decentralizing development activities
and spreading the benefits of development more widely.
3.        The broad objectives of the Project were: (i) to provide the
rural people with an opportunity to use the available land resources
effectively and thereby increase productivity, income and standards of
living; and (ii) to develop and expand the Government capability to
provide agricultural support services and facilities over a wide area11.
The Appraisal Report indicates that the Project aims to:  (i) generate
and provide information about the diversification of food and cash crop
systems and increase production through a mix of services and inputs;
(ii) create centers of activity, which will help market, process, store
and transport produce, train local people in techniques of agricultural
production and assist them establish allied agro-industry activities; and
(iii)   provide   an   institutional   base   facilitating   smallholder
participation in local development.  Most of these objectives and aims
were not quantified, but the Project description (page 11 of Appraisal
Report) did specify a number of the outputs that the Project would
generate, which are outlined in para 5.
4.        The rationale for the Project was not explicitly stated in any
document, but can be inferred from the Appraisal Report. It was based
on the need: for new technology, for marketing infrastructure, to develop
government institutions to facilitate development, and to integrate the
different development support functions by providing them at one
development center.
1,   Appraisal Report SOL: Ap-7A page 11.

5.        Applying this rationale, the Project was designed with a broad
scope, but with the Rural Development Centers (RDC) as the core.  The
Project scope included establishing:
(i)    seven  RDCs,  one  in  each  province,  with  supporting
facilities for production, processing, marketing and
infrastructure   to  stimulate   increased   agricultural
production by the rural population;
(ii)    research and extension facilities and capabilities by (a)
improving and expanding the research facilities at the
Dodo Creek Research Station and Tenaru Field Experiment
Station and establishing four field experimental stations
(FES) to facilitate provincial research on staple and new
food crops and improved farming systems;   (b) improving
and expanding the extension services through the
development of farmer training centers, including housing
for field staff, consultancies, and staff training; and
(c)  establishing  a  National  Agricultural   Training
Institute (NATI) to provide training facilities and
courses to improve the capabilities of both extension
workers and farmers;
(iii)    an  Agricultural   Information   Unit   (AIU)   for   the
dissemination of agricultural information to farmers; and
(iv)    a Project Implementation Unit  (PIU) to coordinate and
implement the Project.
II. EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Proiect Components
6.        The Project as formulated in the Appraisal Report combined the
major recommendations arising from two feasibility studies carried out
with Bank technical assistance!'.  The resulting Project comprised four
main components: (i) the RDCs; (ii) research and extension; (iii) the
AIU; and   (iv) the PIU.   Successful implementation of each component
depended on the other components and thus, none of the components was
designed to be independent.   A technical assistance was provided in
conjunction with the loan for project benefit monitoring and evaluation
(PBME)11 (see para 34). A brief history of the Project is in Appendix 1.
7.        The  Project  was  generally  implemented  according  to  the
appraisal recommendations except that there was significant delay (18
months) in the starting date and the last of the Project works only
l/   TA No. 413-SOL for $ 150,000 for a study on research, extension and
support facilities was carried out by ISNAR (International Services
for National Agricultural Research) in 1982. TA No. 470-SOL for $
200,000 for a study of rural development centers was carried out by
Development Alternatives, Inc in 1983.
2/   TA No. 544-SOL dated 9 December 1983 for $ 90,000.

became operational in 1992, three years behind the original schedule.
The slippage in construction, coupled with the decision to close the
Project in December 1991, means that some of the RDCs did not receive the
one to three years of operational support that was originally envisaged.
As discussed later in the Report, the consequences were that the
Project's impact on rural development has been delayed. Except for the
lack of PBME, most of the changes in the Project were fully justifiable
because conditions had changed since appraisal and the original plan was
out-of-date. The major changes in Project activities other than timing
were:
*    the appropriate technology activities were scaled down and
operated at only one center instead of at three centers;
*    the NATI was resited at Fote, instead of at Dala, because the
long-term land tenure there was more secure;
*    the RDC and FES facilities in the Western Province were resited
at the request of the provincial government;
-    the Farmer Training Center at Barakoma was not relocated as
proposed because it would have duplicated the function of the
RDC;
*    the timber mills under the support facilities for the RDCs were
not established because of problems with logging rights and
they were regarded as appropriate activities for the private
sector;
*    only one instead of three motorized sailing boats under the
support facilities was constructed, but the vessel has not yet
been put into service because of structural problems;
*    the wharf at Marou Bay for the Hauratarata RDC under the
support facilities was not constructed because the proposed
design was inappropriate for the high seas;
*    the rubber-wheeled bulldozer under the support facilities was
not procured for road maintenance at Marou Bay because it was
considered inappropriate to use such equipment; and
*    a PMBE was not established apart from some potentially useful,
but incomplete baseline information;    monitoring of project
benefits was not carried out (see para 34).
8.        These changes in Project activities would have reduced the
overall Project cost, but, the SI dollar was progressively devalued from
US$0.83 at Appraisal to US$0.36 in 1991. The details of the effects of
devaluation on the Project costs are discussed in Section C.   The
evaluation of the implementation performance for each component is
summarized below.

(1) The Rural Development Centers (RDC)
9.        The Project provided for the establishment and equipping of
seven RDCs to act as growth centers in each province.   The RDCs were
expected to provide the facilities necessary for stimulating the
development of rural settlements. The facilities needed were mainly for
training and demonstrations for local farmers.  The seven sites served
a potential total population of about 19,000.
10.       If the RDC concept had succeeded in the manner anticipated at
appraisal it should have been evident in "area of influence" of the RDC
by an expansion in the services to market, process, store and transport
produce and the training of local people in improved methods of
agricultural production.   The Project does not appear to have been
successful in either providing the training or improving the marketing
infrastructure.    Another  effect  should have been  that  the  farming
families  would  have  diversified  their  food  and  cash  crop  system,
increased their production and made use of inputs and services not
previously used.   So far, the evidence is not available that this has
occurred as a result of the Project.
11.       The sites for the RDCs were selected in consultation with local
people and took into account the criteria specified in the Appraisal
Report. The most important determinant was whether land was available
for the Project.   As a result of the consultation process the local
population developed strong expectations about the Project and were not
generally aware they would be expected to pay for some of the Project
services in the future. Seven RDCs were established at Hakama (Central
Province), Marau Sound (Guadalcanal Province), Newi (Temoutu Province),
Liwe (Malaita Province), Hauratarata (Makira Province), Susubona (Isabel
Province) and Karekana (Western Province). All the sites except the one
in Western Province were those recommended in the Appraisal Report and
the latter site was changed at the request of the Province. The new site
complied with the other criteria set down at appraisal. The appraisal
seriously under estimated the time needed to obtain land for the Project
facilities.
12.       An alternative approach that may have yielded greater benefits
would have been to site the RDCs so that their marketing infrastructure
(area of influence) would have linked up with the existing marketing
infrastructure.    With hindsight it was over ambitious to attempt to
develop seven sites and it would have been preferable to have selected
only three sites for the first phase and then followed up with a larger
project when a successful method of operation had been established.
However, this approach may not have been politically acceptable because
it would mean that some provinces were favored over others.
13.       The World Bank's Review of the Agricultural Program in 1988
recommended a reduction in the scope and/or rephasing the Project, but
the Government opposed this and claimed it would have no difficulty
either completing the Project or operating it.  The Fifth Joint Review
Mission (Bank/IDA/IFAD) in 1988 supported the Government position of not
reducing the scope, although the Review did rephase the construction part
of the implementation schedule.   Unfortunately,  the Review did not



5
recognize that rephrasing only the construction schedule without
extending the overall Project closing date would result in the two-and-a-
half year period for maintenance support for RDCs being reduced.  The
details of RDC sites and activities are presented in Appendix 2.
(a) Production, Processing and Marketing Facilities
14.       The Project was to provide facilities to demonstrate improved
techniques of production and processing and to enable smallholders to
market,  store, dry, ferment, and ship their output.   It was also to
provide facilities for skills training in nonfarm occupations such as
small rural industries, engine repairs, woodwork, saw milling and boat
construction.    The  implementation  of  the  physical  facilities  was
successful. Nearly all of the facilities that were planned for each RDC
were installed as planned, but there were delays in most activities
because of land acquisition problems.   The design, the quality of the
construction and the maintenance appears to be generally good so far.
The benefit of including a consultancy for construction supervision was
evident. In addition to the buildings, at each RDC land was cleared and
garden plots, orchards and demonstration plots were established.   Such
works were substantially completed at all sites other than Newi and at
Karekana, where the old coconut stand were to have been redeveloped.
During implementation, there were four deviations from the facilities
proposed at appraisal, although none of these were major.  First, only
one sail boat was constructed instead of three. Second, the RDC and FES
at Rendova Harbor were relocated to Karekana and Ringgi at the request
of the Provincial Government. Third, the concept of using portable saw
mills during the land clearing phase of the RDCs as a means of generating
revenue and a supply of building materials was abandoned.  Fourth, the
number of appropriate technology centers was reduced from three to only
one at Marau Sound. With the possible exception of the relocation of the
Rendova Harbor facilities, each of these changes seem justified and were
sound, project management decisions.
15.       The provision of equipment to the RDCs was in accordance with
the Appraisal Report and each center received a standard allocation, but
the Project Director considered this approach inappropriate. Equipment
maintenance was reported to be satisfactory, except in the remote
locations.
16.       The performance of the Project in operating the RDCs has been
less satisfactory, although there is no objective study on which to
assess the impact of the RDC operations on the local areas or more
generally on the overall provincial and national economy.   The RDC
activities have included:   farmer training, provincial staff training,
demonstrations of recommended production systems, supply of improved
planting materials, supply of some livestock, and promotion and marketing
of crops such as chilies.   Efforts have also been made to develop a



6
Village Outreach Programll at each RDC based on the program developed by
NATI.
17.       The  marketing  facilities  that were  established under  the
Project comprise storage sheds with scales for copra and cocoa, office
facilities, basic furniture and wharves (except for Marau Bay where the
design proposed and the budget were inadequate given the high seas in the
bay). Three marketing centers were established at Afio, Malaita Province
(commenced operations in 1990), Marau Bay, Makira Province and Kaevanga,
Isabel Province (both started in early 1992). The Project staff of the
RDCs and NATI have made a commendable effort to boost the market
opportunities for selected crops. The marketing centers are operated by
private traders who receive a license to operate them for five years.
Given the experimental nature of these marketing centers and the
continuing concern whether the similar centers operated by Commodities
Export Marketing Authority (CEMA) are effective, efforts should be made
to monitor the performance of the centers before considering further
expansion. Furthermore, consideration should be given to examining the
scope for combining the marketing services with input supply functions.
While the role of the marketing centers was to serve as a catalyst for
development, it is doubtful that the markets can operate on a sustainable
basis without a highly subsidized marketing service.
(b) Transport Infrastructure
18.       The Project constructed a total of 52 kilometers (km) of rural
roads to link the three RDCs to the existing road networks. At Marau Bay
on the NW Peninsula (Makira), where farmers reported in 19881' that lack
of transport was their greatest problem, the Project financed a 26 km
road, which provided road access to the capital for the first time. The
Project also constructed 3.5 km road between Susubona and the RDC, and
1.3 km road between Hakama and the RDC. At Fote in Malaita Province the
Project was responsible for the construction of the access and internal
roads serving NATI. The Project also made available the services of the
Project Engineer to supervise the construction of a European Economic
Community (EEC)-funded road linking Haarumou to Maka in West Are Are.
19.       Under  the Project wharves were  constructed  at Afio/Rokera
(Malaita Province),  Susubona  (Santa  Isabel  Province)  and  at Hakama
(Central Province).  Wharves were also planned for Liwe and Marau Bay,
but they were not constructed because more substantial structures were
required than could be financed under the Project.
The transfer of technology to farmers  through demonstration of
tested techniques and practices.   Interested farmers are provided
with planting material and technical support to test these practices
on their own farms.

Planning - PBME Report.



7
(c) Training and Consultancy
20.       The Project include a farmer training program at the RDCs by
the staff.   The program was implemented at each RDC in line with an
overall  program  developed  by  the  PIU  in  conjunction  with  the
Extension/Community Specialist.   Prior to this consultancy,  there was
little training carried out. It is estimated that about 540 farmers have
been trained in the 30 courses conducted so far compared with the 2,280
farmers that were expected to be trained over the implementation period.
The shortfall was mainly due to the delay in construction of the RDCs.
In addition, funds for this activity were used to support the production
and distribution of improved seeds and planting materials.  While such
activities benefit the recipients (who receive free or highly subsidized
inputs), the process may discourage the development of private sector
supply. These activities can only be justified if the planting materials
are far.superior to the other material available to the farmers.   A
requirement that the farmers pay approximately the full costs of
production for the planting materials would ensure that the RDCs would
produce high quality materials.
21.       Part of the funds for training and consultancy were also used
to support field demonstrations.    The demonstrations varied from site
to  site.    The  effectiveness  of  the  demonstrations  has  not  been
objectively assessed because an impact survey has not been carried out.
None of the 10 man-month consultancy provision for village arts and
crafts and community organizations was used. This reflects the judgement
of the Project Director and the Project Adviser that such inputs were not
warranted.   This is consistent with the re-evaluation of some of the
design elements of the original feasibility study and may reflect a
difference of opinion as to the role of the RDCs between that originally
proposed and that followed by the consultants and PIU staff. Six months
of the consultancy were used to assist the staff of the RDC develop and
implement an operational program. Because by early 1991, when virtually
all of the infrastructure was in place, the RDC staff were still
concerned about construction and there was very little progress in terms
of development and provision of the services that the RDCs were intended
to provide.   This may reflect  the over emphasis by Project  staff,
consultants and Review Missions on the engineering/infrastructure aspects
of the Project.
(d) Application of Appropriate T_chqnology
22.       Only one Appropriate Technology Center was established  (in
1989) at Marau Sound instead of the three proposed. Although this Center
has conducted a number of courses, it is having difficulties identifying
a product and a market. The courses the Centers conducted were on the
maintenance of outboard motors and chain saws.   Discussions have been
held concerning the feasibility of using the centers to produce tools
that are needed for input supply programs such as that operated under the
EEC-funded Smallholder Development Project.

(2) Research and Extension
23.       All planned physical facilities for the research and extension
component have been completed.   The administration and daily operation
of the facilities have been handed over to Ministry of Agriculture and
Lands. The objectives of the research component were to strengthen the
Research Department's capacity to undertake adaptive research in the
different agro-climatic environments of the country. The FESs were seen
as an integral component of the network (including RDCs, NATI and the
Provincial Extension Services) and are intended to provide advisory
services to farmers to assist them to diversify and increase agricultural
produetion and productivity.  The results of the research program have
been generally disappointing, although there has been some progress, most
of the original research objectives at appraisal have not been met yet.
In many cases, the research programs that began with foreign expert input
were abandoned when the foreign expert left. In some cases, such as the
taro breeding program, the results or plant collections were lost and the
research had to be redone. Although the researchers from Dodo Creek did
conduct adaptive trials at the FES, during the Project, their visits are
less frequent now, possibly because of funding constraints. Provincial
staff have very limited access to researchers and conversely researchers
have very limited funds for off-station work.  This component may have
been more effective if the research funds had been provided to the RDCs
rather  than  to Dodo  Creek  or  the FESs.    There  appears  to be  an
unnecessary and unproductive duplication of efforts between the FES and
the RDCs. The adaptive research work should have been carried out at the
RDCs.  The collaboration would have benefite4--both the researchers and
the staff of the RDCs as well as the farmers. The research programs at
the Tenaru and Fote FESs appear to have deteriorated since the Project
was completed.
24.       The Project has had little success in expanding the capacity
of the country to provide adaptive research services to farmers. While
the recent Government reductions in recurrent research budget may have
further weakened the research capacity; the restoration of the budget
would not result in useful research findings within the next three years.
However, there appears to be scope for increasing returns from research
by redirecting the funds from the FES to the RDCs and concentrating on
local adaptive research.
(a)  Establishment of a National Agricultural Training
Institute (NATI)
25.       The  establishment  of NATI  at Fote  (Malaita  Province)  was
completed in 1988 and training has continued since then. The facilities
at the Institute are adequate for training groups of up to 24 students.
A total of 136 weeks of formal training has been conducted for 420
participants so far.   The courses have ranged from 2 to 14 weeks in



9
duration and have covered a wide range of subjects1'. The integration of
NATI into the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education is continuing.
NATI's Village Outreach Extension Program provides technical assistance
and support to over thirty farming families, four schools and to the
provincial base hospital. The program has recently been integrated with
that of the Malaita Provincial Extension Service and it is being
evaluated as a model for adoption by the RDCs in the other provinces.
(b) Relocation of Barakoma Farmer Training Center
26.       This activity was canceled because the RDC was transferred from
Rendova Harbor to Karekana.
(c) Provision of Facilities for Field Assistants
27.       The 30 houses for the provincial extension staff are occupied
and have been handed over to the provincial governments.  The impact of
providing housing and some transport for the extension staff has been
extremely beneficial.
(d) Training and Consultancy
28.       The consultancies under the research subcomponent included an
agricultural economist (36 months) and foodcrop agronomist (36 months),
but the other nine months was not used.   The consultancy under the
extension subcomponent was principal for NATI (48 months). The training
under the research subcomponent included: 10 months of overseas study
tours, conferences and interisland travel.
(3) Agricultural Information Unit (AIU)
29.       The AIU was established in 1988 under an IDA Credit.   The
operation and administration of the previous autonomous unit was
transferred to the Agriculture Divison (the Agricultural Information
Section) in early 1990. The Bank's loan provided financial support for
the AIU after the IDA credit closed. The Unit has been actively involved
in the production of pamphlets and radio programs for extension staff and
farmers.  The Agricultural Information Section (AIS) has continued its
twice a week radio programs and its monthly newsletter.  The AIS needs
financial support from the Government to continue to be effective.  It
should be noted the previous information unit was set up and operated
successfully for a number of years before it was forced to close because
recurrent funding was not available. The AIS was assessed as lacking a
sense of direction and underfunded by the consultant who reviewed its
1'   The  courses  on-campus  for  extension  staff  include:  extension
programming, small animal production, project planning, farmer
leader training, nutrition and agricultural chemical and sprayer
use. The off-campus courses include: hillside agriculture, inter-
cropping under coconuts and cocoa, and extension techniques.



10
performance in 1990. Since then, the head of the section has repeatedly
sought assistance (for computers and software) from the Bank and
bilateral aid agencies.   The PCR Mission believes that AIS warrants
further support and that the Government should consider providing
additional funding.
(4) Proiect Implementation Unit (PIU)
30.       The  Project  established  a PIU  because  the  implementation
capacity of the Executing Agency was weak.   Although the PIU also
encountered delays, especially during the start-up period, the delays
would have been worse if implementation had been entrusted to the
existing structure. The delay in the appointment of the Project Director
in March 1984, also delayed the setting up of PIU and the appointments
of the support staff and the consultants. The overall effect was a delay
in start-up by nearly one and a half years. Despite the start-up delays,
physical progress was rapid and the Project was completed as scheduled.
In retrospect, the major weakness in the PIU was the accounting section,
which delayed the submission of the audited financial statements.   The
PIU made a major effort to integrate the Project activities into the
overall agricultural program of MAL and the provinces, but this effort
may have started too late.   Despite the concerted efforts of Project
Management, the progress towards integration was slow. Under the loan,
a Community/Extension Specialist was appointed to help design the RDC
operation program and to assist in achieving the integration. A Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) technical assistance team also completed
a study aimed at developing a program for the future operation of the
Project facilities.
31.       The reasons for the delays in the integration of the Project
into the existing national and provincial systems of administration of
agricultural development are not entirely clear. Some provincial staff
apparently were concerned about the relationship of the Project to their
own operations and this uncertainty may have been perpetuated by the lack
of clear guidelines from the central government.   Finance was another
problem, although the provinces were directed to use the facilities at
the RDCs, in many cases they did not received funds for that purpose.
An indication of the lack of collaboration is that the development plan
for Malaita Province was developed two years after the start of the
Project.    Actual  integration  only  began  last  year.    The  Project
management reported that during annual meeting with provincial staff
efforts have been made to explain the concept of the Project; but it
would appear that major constraints to collaboration still remain.
(a) Training, Fellowships and Consultants
32.       The Project was  to provide  a total  of 85 man-months  for
overseas fellowships with 40 allocated to staff of the RDCs, 15 allocated
to research and extension staff and the remaining 30 to AIU. A total of
69 man-months were used for fellowships with the result that four MAL
staff received graduate or postgraduate qualifications. The Head of AIU
received a Bachelor of Business Communication from Queensland's Institute



11
of Technology, the Principal and the Deputy Principal of NATI received
Graduate Diplomas in Systems Agriculture from the University of Western
Sydney and a lecturer from NATI received a Postgraduate Diploma in
Agriculture  from PNG's University of Technology.    These  staff have
remained with their respective organizations, and hence the Project has
made a significant contribution to the improvement in the capacity of AIU
and NATI.
33.       The Project included 235 man-months of consultancy, but the
actual total was 252 man-months.   The increased included: a six month
extension for the Project Advisor; a 24 month extension for the Project
Engineer; and a six month additional assignment for a Community/Extension
Specialist.   These increases were partly offset by dropping the short-
term consultancies in community organization, skills training and
specific research disciplines.
(b) Monitoring and Evaluation
34.       Provision was made at the time of loan approval for a technical
assistance (TA No. 544-SOL) to establish Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaluation (PBME) system in the National Planning Office (NPO) of the
Prime Minister's Department.  The PBME system was to have covered both
the Rural Services Project (Part A of the loan) and the Livestock
Development Project (Part B of the loan), but was mainly focused on the
Livestock Project.  The consultants were appointed and prepared a PBME
system during the first stage of the consultancy.   When the Project
Director and consultants recognized in early 1985 that it would take some
time to set up the PBME unit as originally envisaged, they recommended
that a small PBME unit should be established within the PIU. The first
Joint Review Mission (JRM) rejected the proposal because it would
duplicate the PBME unit in NPO.  With hindsight, the small unit should
have been establish and an opportunity to build in monitoring and
evaluation in the management of the PIU was lost. The staff of the NPO
showed little interest in monitoring and evaluation and complained that
the approach recommended by the consultants was too complicated.  When
the Government was reorganized, the NPO was transferred to the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP), but no one was assigned
responsibility for PBME in the new office.   In 1987 the consultants
returned to carry out the second stage, which included the design of a
household survey to collect information for monitoring and evaluation at
the beneficiary level.   The Rural Statistics Unit of the Statistics
Office in the (then) Ministry of Finance designed and conducted a
Household Income Survey covering the areas of influence of the RDCs in
198811 because the Monitoring and Evaluation Section of MFEP did not have
the capacity to carry out the work. The Household Sample Survey carried
out by the rural Statistics Unit is the only remaining documented attempt
at PBME.   Unfortunately it was restricted to the areas expected to be
influenced by the RDCs and did not include a control area outside the
RDCs. While that survey could be part of the baseline for the Project,
there has been no follow up to the survey to measure the changes since
then.

Services Project. Report dated November 1989.



12
B.   Implementation Arrangements
35.       The Ministry of Home Affairs and National Development (MHAND)
was  designated  the overall  Executing Agency  for the Project  and a
National Coordinating Group (NCG) was to be set up at the central level
and chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MHAND. The main purpose of the
NCG was to develop policy and operational guidelines for the Rural
Services Project and the Livestock Project that comprised the two parts
of the loan. The Project was to be managed by a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) and a local Project Director with assistance from two long-
term consultants, a Project Advisor and a Project Engineer. Details on
the arrangements are in paras 66 to 69 of the Appraisal Report and in
Schedule 8 of the Loan Agreement. In February 1984 the Bank was advised
that the Executing Agency would be the Ministry of National Development
because  there  had  been  a  reorganization  in  the  Government.
Subsequently, in November 1984, the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands
(MAL) was designated Executing Agency.
36.       During the start-up period the Executing Agency experienced
difficulties because of its lack of previous exposure to the procedures
of the financiers, a lack of suitable staff, an inability to attract
staff for the Project Director's position, an inability to recruit
consultants on an individual basis and the difficulties in securing
access to land.  The conditions of effectiveness were appropriate, but
compliance delayed the Bank loan for three months, the IDA credit for six
months and the IFAD loan for 15 months.   To overcome these initial
delays, a consultant company instead of individuals should have been
hired; action should have been taken early to determine the interest in
Project Director position; and a more realistic assessment should have
been made of staff needs and availabilities.
37.       Except for the PBME,  there were no major revisions in the
Project during implementation and the changes that were made (para. 7)
were justifiable and appropriate.  The failure to establish the PBME Unit
(see para 34) is regarded as significant because it has drastically
reduced the ability of either the Government or the Bank to learn
valuable lessons from the implementation of the Project. Actually, the
Project may not have been revised enough because whenever Review Missions
raised the possibility of reducing the scope; the Government resisted the
suggestion.   Attempts during implementation to make minor changes in
Project activities were generally successful; but those directed at more
fundamental changes in direction (for example a greater emphasis on
adaptive research) were not followed-through.
38.       The Government's requests for extensions of the closing dates
for the Bank loan and the IDA credit were turned down because the Bank's
policies do not permit an extension of loan closing date to finance
recurrent costs following physical completion of the Project.



13
C.   Proiect Costs
39.       The total cost of the Project was estimated to be US$11.65
million at appraisal with the foreign exchange cost of US$5.93 million
(50.9 per cent). The three external financier agreed to finance 87 per
cent of the total Project cost. The Bank agreed to finance part of the
costs associated with the RDCs and the PIU that were estimated at US$6.31
million or 54.2 per cent of the total Project cost. The Bank also agreed
to finance 82 per cent these costs by providing a loan for US$5.15
million equivalent with the Government undertaking to provide the balance
of US$1.16 million equivalent.  The costs associated with research and
extension, field assistant's housing and the AIU totalled US$3.69 million
of which IDA financed US$3.50 million equivalent. IFAD agreed to finance
part of the costs of the Farmers' Training Centers and NATI. These costs
totalled US$1.65 million of which IFAD was to finance US$1.50 million.
40.       The comparison of actual costs with the appraisal estimates is
presented in Table 1 of Appendix 3.  The actual cost of US $ 10.68
million was 92 per cent of the appraisal estimate when all expenditures
were converted to US dollars at the exchange rate at the time of
expenditure. Over the implementation period (1983 - 1991) the US dollar
depreciated 37 per cent against the SDR and the SI dollar depreciated 57
per cent against the US dollar.   Because the Loan was denominated in
SDRs, the actual cost was substantially less than the US dollar cost
estimate. The financing plan is presented in Table 2 of Appendix 3. The
Government financed an estimated 15.4 per cent of the total expenditure,
a slight increase over 13 per cent estimated at appraisal.   Of the US
$9.03 million funded externally, the Bank provided 50.4 per cent; IDA,
28.9 per cent; and IFAD, 20.7 per cent.
D.   Proiect Schedule
41.       A comparison of the actual implementation schedule with the
appraisal estimates is presented as Appendix 4. The actual duration of
the project was as planned and the loan was closed as scheduled in
December 1991.   The delay in establishing the RDCs was on average 15
months, but the delay was four years for the RDC at Karekana. The causes
of the initial delays were discussed in para. 36. Subsequent delays were
caused by continuing difficulties with land acquisition, staff shortages,
consultant changes and lack of familiarity with procedures. The rate of
construction of the different Project works, once they commenced, was in
many cases faster than expected at appraisal. A consequence of the delay
in the establishment of the RDC facilities (and to a lesser extent the
other facilities) was that the Project did not provide support for the
initial two years of operation of the facilities.
42.       The original schedule for the Project was unrealistic given
that the Executing Agency had no experience with this type of project.
The decision of Government to concentrate on completing all the physical
works as quickly as possible rather than ensuring that the facilities
were operating before commencing work on the next facility was, in
retrospect, inappropriate.   It probably would have been better to have
scaled down the Project and concentrated on operating two or three RDCs
to assess their effectiveness.



14
E.   Engagement of consultants and Procurement of Goods and Services
43.       The experience of the Project in the engagement of consultants
was generally  satisfactory.   After initial unsuccessful  response to
recruit individual consultants, the invitation to international firms to
provide  consultants  proved  satisfactory.    All  the  consultants  were
recruited by the PIU in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the use of
Consultants. The evaluation of the proposals were submitted to Bank for
review and approval. The following consultants were engaged: (i) Project
Advisor; (ii) Civil Engineer; (iii) Agricultural Economist; (iv) Farming
System Agronomist; (v) Principal of NATI; (vi) Agricultural Information
Specialist and (vii) Extension/Community Specialist (appointed as an
individual).
44.       In general, PIU was in charge of making all purchases for all
Project components in close consultation with Bank and in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.  The PIU managed and supervised
the construction of NATI and RDC using contract labor while the
facilities at Dodo Creek and civil works at Tenaru were constructed using
the tendering procedure.
F.   Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
45.       The procedures and requirements  stipulated by the Bank for
procuring goods and services did not lead to any significant problem,
although it took some time for the Project staff to become familiar with
them. Some procurement delays and problems were encountered due to the
following reasons: (i) nonavailability of basic materials in the country
compounded by delays in the processing of the importation of such
materials; and (ii) constraints and problems in construction in rural
areas where the only means of transportation is infrequent interisland
boats or canoe. Despite these constraints the performance of civil work
contractors in the construction of buildings and roads, was good.  The
design of the facilities is good and the quality of the construction and
maintenance  so far appears  to be generally  good.    The benefit  of
including a consultancy for construction supervision was evident and
reflected in the success of the infrastructure program.
46.       The performance of Consultants was generally satisfactory with
some  excellent  achievements.    If  there  are  staff  constraints  and
inexperienced staff in the Executing Agency, the selection of a
consultant will, to a large part, determine the success of the component.
The success of the NATI component reflects its careful planning and the
competence and commitment of its staff whose careers have been carefully
and successfully developed by training and guidance from the Consultant
during Project Implementation. However, the Consultant engaged for the
AIU and the first Agricultural Economist were not well regarded by some
Go-;ernment officers and tended to work in isolation.
47.       The Consultants contracted for the preparation of the Project
were thorough, but over optimistic about the research and RDC aspects.
It would have been preferable in both cases for the Bank to have
developed less ambitious terms of reference and to have restricted the
size and scope of the technical assistance.



15
48.       The suppliers were generally satisfactory, although there were
some problems with the Solomon Islands Housing Authority and with the
boat yard commissioned to construct the MV Rusep.
G.   Conditions and Covenants
49.       The Borrower and the Executing Agency complied with most of the
covenants in the Loan Agreement (see Appendix 5 for details), although
there were significant delays in complying with those related to
financial matters including the preparation of audited statements. The
performance of the Executing Agency was generally good about reporting,
although the reports were often late.  The Borrower is now failing to
comply fully with the requirement to provide recurrent funds for the
Project. So far, the Government has only provided about one quarter of
the required funding. It is unlikely that the Borrower can comply with
this requirement given the other more pressing needs for recurrent funds.
Covenants such as these are the basis of the post-project sustainability
issue and cannot be ignored.   The Bank should continue to insist on
compliance by specifying continued funding as a condition for future Bank
lending (see para 71).
H.   Disbursements
50.       The  entire  IFAD  loan  was  disbursed,   US$1.87  million.
Disbursements against the Bank loan totalled US$4.63 million or about 72
per cent of the total loan. IDA credit disbursements totalled US$2.61
million or 74.6 per cent of the original credit. The Appraisal Report
did not include a disbursement schedule, but the Loan Agreement (Schedule
4, para 6) refers to a disbursement schedule to be mutually agreed upon.
The actual disbursements are shown in Appendix 6.
51.       The Appraisal Report did not indicate how disbursements would
be made or the percentages for the different categories. These details
were provided in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 4) but in a format that was
difficult to understand. Given the lack of experience of the Borrower
more attention should have been given to this matter.   However,  a
projected disbursement schedule was provided in the Project Supervision
Memorandum.
52.       The JRM in April 1989 found that funds that had been used from
the Project imprest account in 1987 to meet urgent measures for cyclone
rehabilitation had not been repaid. The outstanding sum of SI $ 129,700
was subsequently offset against withdrawal applications in 1991.
I.   Environmental Impact
53.       The beneficial impact that the Project was expected to have on
the environment has not occurred yet because the Project has not started
to have a significant impact on the farming practices of the people in
the Project area. The works that were completed under the Project were
carefully designed and well constructed and are unlikely to have caused



16
any significant  adverse  environmental  impact.   There has been some
clearing of forest for the roads and the RDCs, but in most cases the
areas had been cleared previously and used for agriculture.
J.   Proiect Benefits
54.       Data is not available on Project benefits at this stage and
hence it is inappropriate to attempt to re-estimate the Project's
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR).  Given the delays in reaching
the operational stage, and that the EIRR estimate at appraisal included
two activities that were not implemented,1'  it is probable that the
overall EIRR from the Project will be below the appraisal estimate. The
two main outputs expected to be generated as a result of Project
activities were copra and cocoa. A comparison of the price prospects for
those commodities at the time of appraisal and at present shows major
price decreases.   Copra was projected at appraisal to have a value in
1990 of $4.80/kg (US$ 1985) while its actual value was only 33 per cent
of a projection,  $1.58 (US$ 1985).   The latest price projections for
copra for 1995 are less than half of the appraisal projections for the
same period.   Similarly for cocoa, the actual 1990 price expressed in
constant 1985 dollars was only 63 per cent of the appraisal estimate and
the 1995 projection is only 57 per cent of the appraisal estimate. This
slide in commodity prices in real terms will adversely affect Project
returns.    The  details  on  prices,  projections,  average  prices  and
production for copra and cocoa are presented in Appendix 7.
55.       The Project has developed the physical infrastructure largely
as envisaged at appraisal and has therefore been successful in meeting
a large part of the original objectives.   The infrastructure is well
built and maintained and it could be used as a basis for on-going
assistance in the influence areas of the RDCs. The RDCs are being used
as training centers and those attending the courses are reported to
consider   the  training  useful   and  beneficial.          The   transport
infrastructure that was provided is highly valued and, although there are
no data, it probably resulted in transport cost savings, and incremental
agricultural output.   The private marketing centers are licensed and
providing a market outlet in areas that were previously without similar
outlets. Whether the markets have resulted in higher prices or increased
the volume than would have occurred in the absence of the Project is
unknown. Several of the RDCs have processing facilities for chilies and
production facilities for small animals and food crops and some of the
19,000 targeted beneficiaries living in the area of influence of the RDCs
have received free or subsidized inputs in the form of planting materials
and livestock.   The staff of the RDCs have been well-trained and are
capable of continuing the current program without foreign expert input
provided recurrent funding is available.
The EIRR included an estimate for the provincial farm at Rendova
Harbor but this site was not developed, and for the sawmills but
these were not implemented.



17
56.       The research facilities have been improved and the four FES
that were established provide a basis for a greater capacity to carry out
adaptive research than before the Project.   The housing and transport
facilities provided to extension staff have made it easier to attract and
retain staff in remote areas and increased the time they have available
to work with farmers. The training provided to extension staff at NATI
has been appropriate and useful to the extension staff and the country
now has a well-developed capacity to provide in-service training for
extension and other development staff.   As a result of the surveys
carried out in each province the researchers and extension workers have
good baseline information on agricultural practices and this should
assist in developing appropriate research and extension activities. The
country has staff trained in provision of agricultural information and
a rudimentary capacity to continue the extension service at present
levels. The staff of the PIU have received on-the-job training that will
enable them to implement future projects more rapidly and, although some
of the staff have become redundant, the Government has created a Project
Management Unit using the PIU staff.
57.       It is too early to assess what impact the Project has had on
the intended direct beneficiaries because surveys have not been carried
out and the Project only reached the operational stage in 1991.  The
Project should be operated for at least two years as originally planned
before a fair assessment can be made of its benefits. Some indication
of the potential benefits could be obtained through a survey designed to
follow-up a sample of past beneficiaries of training and demonstrations
and to identify the attitudes of potential beneficiaries to the outputs
of the Project.   Such a survey should be carried out as an interim
measure while awaiting two years or more before the actual impact can be
assessed.
58.       Although the Project has been largely successful in terms of
physical infrastructure, it has not achieved its objectives of developing
an operational capacity to provide agricultural support services and
facilities over a wide area. The evidence is the lack of Project-induced
development so far in the immediate area of influence of the RDCs, the
failure of the FES to continue to operate following the completion of the
Project, the decrease in the research effort after Project completion and
the Government's decisions about the priority of the continuing some of
the Project activities.
59.       It  is  also  clear  that  there  have  been  shortcomings  in
implementation. Foremost among these has been the failure to integrate
the Project activities at the local level with those of the provincial
agricultural  services.   The  efforts were  too  little  and too  late.
However, these were design shortcomings because one of the major
constraints to such integration was and still is funding and this was
treated in a cursory way at appraisal. The number of MAL staff assigned
to carry out Project-related development functions on a continuing basis
is less than envisaged at appraisal for some components, but satisfactory
in others.



18
K.   Performance of Borrower and Executing Agencv
60.       The Borrower started the Project with limited experience with
multilateral  banks or with Projects  of this  size  and  scope.    The
difficulties during start-up period reflected this lack of experience.
However, the Government appointed a highly competent Project Director who
managed the Project very well. His replacement was equally effective and
carried the Project through to completion without any major difficulties.
The relationships between the Project Directors and their staff and
consultants seem to have been well-managed and productive.   The PIU
generally performed well, although there were persistent problems with
the accounts and audit procedures and there was insufficient attention
to monitoring the progress of the Project other than the level of inputs
and outputs. As a result of the Project, MAL in general and the PMU in
particular, now have a greater capacity to implement development
Projects.
61.       During most of the Project implementation period, there had
been some tension and lack of cooperation within MAL partly because of
the different management style of some of the senior managers. Sometimes
this tension led to considerable delays and a failure to make important
decisions or to provide clear directives that adversely affected the
Project.
L.   Performance of the Bank
62.       The Borrower regarded the overall performance of the Bank as
satisfactory, but felt that there were some areas in which improvements
could have been made. In the original design, the Project Director felt
that there was a tendency to follow the same approach in each location
and  that  this was  inappropriate.    Also,  he believes  that  it was
inappropriate to establish the FESs as separate entities from the RDCs.
The Project Director also thought that the Bank should have limited the
scope of the Project more than it did.
63.       The Project rationale should have been subject to greater
scrutiny prior to appraisal because this would have enabled the staff to
discuss the options without having to justify previous position.
64.       The Project scope and schedule were too ambitious.  The Project
preparation was thorough, but the terms of reference for the feasibility
consultants already established the basis for an overly ambitious
Project. The Bank also overestimated the implementation capacity of the
Government and was slow to assist it to address this limitation.   The
estimates for civil works and procurement timing were generally good, but
the Bank underestimated the lead times required before these works could
be started.   The overall supervision  by the Bank was good, although
there should have been more frequent reviews earlier in the Project. It
would also have been preferable to review not only the physical details,
but also the operational performance of the Project.   There were some
cases of apparently inadequate follow-up of issues, in particular, the
failure to pursue a satisfactory arrangement for PBME.   The working
relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was generally
satisfactory.



19
65.       The Bank responded positively and appropriately to a number of
the issues that arose during implementation. For example, in the light
of the difficulties that the Executing Agency was having with
disbursements and preparation of financial statements, the Bank fielded
a Special Mission to train staff to carry out these functions.
III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Conclusions
66.       The Project was generally implemented in accordance with the
original concept, however, because of the delay in completing the
physical infrastructure, there was only a brief operational period before
the loan was closed.   The delays were the result of a combination of
circumstances stemming from the lack of experience of the Executing
Agency and the ambitious scope of the Project. In particular there were
difficulties finding suitable senior staff, appointing appropriate
consultants, acquiring land from customary owners and traveling-around
the Project area.  Bank staff tried to resolve these matters, but most
of the difficulties had to be solved by the Borrower. Apart from delays,
the other changes in the Project were minor and justified. Throughout
the Project and particularly recently, a shortage of local funding has
constrained Project operations.
67.       It is impossible at this time to predict with certainty that
the Project will achieve its operational objectives because it has only
just been completed.
B.   Recommendations
1.   Project Related
(i) Future Monitoring
68.       The achievement of Project objectives will depend largely on
the extent to which the Government is able to find the funds to meet
recurrent expenditures either from its own budget or from external aid
agencies.  The PCR Mission initiated discussions vith the EEC Delegate
about the use of Stabex Funds for this purpose during an interim period
until  other  sources become  available.    It is recommended  that  the
availability of recurrent funding should continue to be monitored by the
Bank.
69.       The failure to implement PBME means that information is not
available to make even a preliminary estimate of the impact of the
Project in the future. While it is recognized that it is premature to
attempt to quantify the impact now, the PCR Mission recommend that the



20
Executing Agency be encouraged to carry out follow-up studies of the
Project beneficiaries to obtain a better understanding of the probable
future benefits of the Project.   The Government and the Bank would
require such information to make well-informed decisions about future
support for the activities initiated under the Project and for a broader
review of agricultural development policy.
70.       If the Bank intends providing future Project or program support
to the cash crop sector in the Solomon Islands it will need to obtain
better information on the marketing infrastructure and level of effective
demand  for  projected  outputs  than  is  currently  available.    This
information needs to reflect the very large variations in the
marketability of output from different locations among and within the
provinces.  Any support for supply-orient projects or programs must be
conditional on clear demonstration of commercial viability. And, if the
Bank is to support the subsistence food crop sector it will need to
obtain better information on the serious decline in food crop yields; the
options for meeting deficits including providing better access to the
hinterland; and the likely capacity of the research and extension systems
to generate changes in production technology.
(ii) Covenants
71.       Because of the seriousness of the problem of partial compliance
to the provision of recurrent funds as discussed in para 49, it is
recommended that as part of a future agriculture sector loan project, the
Bank should examine the possibility of obtaining incremental recurrent
funds for operations at the provincial and central government levels from
multilateral and bilateral aid agencies.
(iii) Further Actions or Follow-up
72.       Follow-up  is required to ensure that the Project activities
are continued for several years to provide an opportunity to assess
whether the Project concept was appropriate.   If such support is not
provided, it will not be possible to make a definitive assessment of the
merits of the Projects approach.
(iv) Additional Assistance
73.       In the short term, the Government will require assistance to
carry out the qualitative assessment of future impact of the Project as
indicated by the attitudes of the beneficiaries of the Project.   Such
assistance should be combined with the preliminary investigations needed
to determine the feasibility and scope for program lending to the sector.
(v) Timing of PPAR Preparation
74.       The PPAR should be deferred for at least two and preferably
three years to provide a sufficient period with actual operations so that
a fair assessment of impact can be made.



21
2.   General
75.       Prior to Project preparation the Bank should have assisted the
Borrower to formulate a policy framework to provide the rationale for
scrutinizing all the agricultural projects.   In this way the terms of
reference for a project preparatory technical assistance would be based
on premises that the Bank could support.  Such a policy framework would,
among other things:  clearly identify the role of the public and private
sectors; analyze the trade-offs between the equity of geographical spread
and the efficiency of marketing; clarify the relative provincial
priorities for cash crops, food crops, livestock, forestry, and tourism;
and assess realistic rates of improvement in implementation capacity not
only at the central level, but also at the provincial level.
76.       The Bank should closely examine the regional experience in
supporting research and extension and identify the critical determinants
of success.
77.       Projects supporting commercialization should devote more effort
to assessing the marketing requirements and less to increasing the
supply.
78.       Projects that are pioneering new approaches should be appraised
more carefully, reviewed more thoroughly and established on smaller scale
than conventional Projects.   Similarly for such projects,  the Review
Missions should make assessments of effectiveness rather than just
concentrating on the efficiency aspects.

1981           Government request for technical assistance for a study
on research, extension and support facilities.
1982           Government   request   for   technical   assistance   for
establishment of rural development centers.
1982            International Services for National Agricultural Research
(ISNAR)  completed the feasibility study on research and-
extension.
1983           Development Alternatives Inc (DAI) completes feasibility
study on RDCs.
1983           Bank  completes  appraisal  less  than  six weeks  after
receiving the DAI Draft Final Report.
1983           Loan negotiated less than two months after return of the
Appraisal Mission.
1984
January   Inception Mission to project.
March     Bank Loan Effectiveness - Project Director appointed.
June      IDA Credit effective.  Ministry of Finance requests Bank
to operate separate loan accounts for Part A and B because
they were being managed by separate accounting units.
1985
January   First Joint Review Mission (JRM) comprised Bank and IDA
only since IFAD Loan still not effective. Housing costs
noted to be 50% above appraisal estimates. Selection of
consultant firm agreed.
Noted that PBME had not been established owing to staff
shortages but rejected the proposal from the PIU to set
up a small PBME within the PIU. The JRM reported concern
about the capacity of the PIU to manage the project and
recommended future projects should take into account the
institutional weakness and should have few components and
preferably a single financier.

April     IFAD Loan became effective.
May        Special Bank Disbursement Mission visited project.
June      Project Advisor commenced.   PBME consultant  submitted
Draft report and PIU advised that they would ask the
Agricultural Economist to review it on arrival in
November.
SPRO decision to defer the transfer of the project to its
administration owing to shortage of support staff at SPRO.
July      Information Specialist commenced
August    Project Engineer commenced
September Agronomist and NATI Principal both commenced.
Second JRM conducted (Bank/WB). Noted delay of one year
owing to: delays in NATI component; slow recruitment of
consultants; and slow land acquisition. Of the 46 staff
needed for the project, only 8 had been recruited.
Requested that the PIU employ a local counterpart to the
Project Engineer.   The Supervision Report flagged the
possibility that land acquisition problems might continue
for the RDCs because of conflicts between some provinces
and the Central Government over selection of sites. AIU
consultant advised the JRM that AIU component was under-
funded receiving less than half of what he believed was
needed.    The  JRM  reported  that  the  NCG  had  been
established and its related sub-committee had been meeting
regularly.
December  Agricultural economist commenced
World Bank Agricultural Sector Study completed and
includes recommendations to scale down the project.

selection and land acquisition.   Bank supports research
program generally but suggests need to provide practical
recommendations and to test varieties from elsewhere.
Also recommends more budget for trials in farmers' fields.
Request from MFEP for consultant to assist MFEP establish
PBME capability but no action taken.
NATI access road completed
1988
February Fourth JRM proposed reformulation with surplus funds to
go  to  transport  infrastructure  but   required   SIG
decision/request to take effect.  SIG fails to make any
request/decision.
Fote FES operational and all houses for extension staff
are completed.

June      NATI operational
Original Project Director resigned and replaced by ex
Under-Secretary of Agriculture and Lands
1989
January   Marau Sound RDC operational  including the Appropriate
Technology Center
April     Fifth JRM notes still no SIG decision on reformulation,
no audit reports for 1986 or 1987.   New Government in
power   stresses   greater   commerciality   and  reduced
government functions. Mission recommends to await the new
Government's   policy   review   before   deciding   on
reformulation.   PIU warned to watch over-expenditure on
NATI construction. Mission identifies the need to strike
a balance between the revenue generating functions of
RDCs/FES/NATI and their training and demonstration
functions.
May       Maka/Uhu road is completed.
June      IDA expresses concern that supervision missions are not
making sufficient efforts to review the impact of the
project and that the AIU needs help if it is to become
effective.

1990
January   Afio/Rokera RDC and Marketing Center operational.
AIU transferred into MAL Training Division and becomes a
Section
February  Ringgi Cove FES operational.
March     Sixth JRM reported that physical progress had caught up
with elapsed Loan Effectiveness period. JRM reviewed the
SIG "tentative plans" for reallocation of funds for seven
items and approved four items provided SIG gives
additional details. (Items were office accommodation at
Dodo Creek, storage facilities at a Tenaru FES, upgrade
of NW Peninsula road and improved water supplies for RDCs.
EA requested extension of the closing date for IDA credit
but JRM rejected saying that all components were complete
and operational.
NATI requested to control its expenditure, attempt to
generate revenue, seek other donors/users and to put in
place a system to evaluate its performance.
JRM reported that it expected the project would have all
RDCs operational before end 1990 which would be about one
year ahead of Appraisal schedule!
Goverrunent raised its concern about ability to meet
projected recurrent costs and suggested need for Program
Loan.

Mission concluded that there was now an infrastructure in
place but there was need to ensure its effective use and
suggested (again) that SIG might request assistance to
carry out a review by UNDP/FAO or FAO/WB Cooperative
Programme.
October   Marau Bay (Hauratarata) RDC operational
Seventh JRM reported that SIG raised its concern that no
benefits were apparent in form of increased production
or  business  activity.       Mission  stressed  need  to
"operationalise"   the  project   and  respond   to  the
Government's policy to favor commercial approaches,
concentrate on increased commodity production and to
complete the project activities as soon as possible and
not to increase the project scope. Decided on Action Plan
and agreed to recruit consultant to "operationalize" the
RDCs.
Agreed to form committee to include the directors of
extension, research, RSP and AIU.   Mission was advised
that FAO had been asked to establish a longer term plan
for use of the RSP facilities.
Mission recommended that SIG should carry out impact study
to assist the PCR using savings from the PBME TA.
1991
February  Susubona RDC operational
April     Project transferred to SPRO for administration
June      Karekana RDC operational.
August    Review  Mission  concluded  that  the  project  was  100X
physically completed, that there would be loan savings of
about SDR 1.16 million mainly as a result of exchange rate
movements and that there had only been limited progress
on the integration of project activities into those of
MAL.   The Mission noted that the facilities could not
function fully as demonstration or production facilities
and therefore undertook to request that the Bank considers
the SIG request to extend the Closing Date 12 months to
December 1992.
1992
Kaevanga and Marau Bay Marketing Centers operational.
April      Project Director submits PCR to Bank.
