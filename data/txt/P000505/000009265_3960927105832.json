Project\n            is a hybrid policy and investment program intended to\n            support within the transport sector the objectives of the\n            ongoing macro-economic adjustment program. The principal\n            objective of the project is to reduce both the cost and the\n            price of transport in Chad. To do this, the credit will\n            assist: (i) the rehabilitation of 1800 km of priority roads\n            drawn from the donor-supported Transport Sector Investment\n            Plan 1988 - 93; (ii) improvements in resource mobilization\n            and allocation in the transport sector in order to secure\n            adequate maintenance of the rehabilitated network; (iii) the\n            abolition of the existing monopoly and administered tariffs\n            in order to reduce the cost of trucking operations, pass\n            vehicle operating cost savings on to shippers and elicit a\n            supply response from the productive sectors of the economy;\n            (iv) promotion of increased competition and greater role of\n            the private sector in the road construction industry; and\n            (v) strengthening of the public administration of the\n            transport sector."}, "docdt": "1989-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
