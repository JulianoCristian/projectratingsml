  OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopment effectivenessthrough excellenceand independenceinevaluation.


About this Report
     The OperationsEvaluationDepartmentassesses the programsand activitiesof theWorld Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verifythat the Bank'swork is
producingthe expectedresults, and second, to helpdevelopimproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough
the disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of thiswork, OED annuallyassessesabout25 percentof
the Bank'slendingoperations.Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or countryevaluations;thosefor which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requestedassessments; and thosethat are likelyto generate
importantlessons. The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluation
studies.
     A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR)is basedon a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluationby the responsibleBank department)and fieldworkconducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
the borrowingcountryfor onsite discussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPAR therebyseeks to
validate and augmentthe informationprovidedin the ICR,as well as examine issuesof special interestto broader
OED studies.
     Each PPAR is subjectto a peer review processand OED managementapproval.Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amendedas necessary.The completedPPAR is then
sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
Boardof Executive Directors.After an assessment report has beensent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the OED Rating System
     The time-testedevaluationmethodsused by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibilityto adapt to lending instrument,projectdesign, or
sectoralapproach. OED evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definition and ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (more informationis availableon the OEDwebsite:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).

Preface

        This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on the IndiaRenewable
Resources Development Project (RRDP) for which a credit o fUS$115 million equivalent
(2449-IN) was approved on December 17,1992, and a GEF grant o fU S 2 6 million
equivalent (GETF 28633-IN) was approved onNovember 30, 1992. The project's
original closing date ofDecember 31, 1999, was extended twice, to December 31,2001.

        The RRDPi s one of the first major renewable energy projects financed by IDA
and GEF, andthe first o fits kindto be assessedby OED.RRDP focused on strengthening
a central financing agency under a government ministryinorder to commercialize a
range o ftechnologies -small hydro, wind, and solar -through the private sector.
Among major developing countries, India also has the oldest and strongest renewable
energy development program.

        This report isbased onthe ImplementationCompletionReport (Report No.
23489) prepared by the South Asia Region, issued on June 21,2002, the Memorandum
and Recommendationo f the President, loan documents, project files, and discussions
withBank staff. An Operations EvaluationDepartment (OED) missionvisited Indiain
March2003 to discuss the effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with the government,
project implementing agencies at the national and state levels, commercial banks, private
investors and business associations for renewable energy technologies, research
institutes, nongovernmentalorganizations, and other stakeholders. Their cooperation and
assistanceis gratefully acknowledged.

        Following standard OED practice, the draft assessment report was sent to the
Borrower for comments before it was finalized. The Borrower comments are attached
(Annex D).

Summary

        This i s the ProjectPerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) preparedby the Operations
EvaluationDepartmentonthe India Renewable ResourcesDevelopmentProject (RRDP). A
credit o fUS$115 millionequivalent (Credit 2449-IN) from the InternationalDevelopment
Association (IDA) was approvedin 1992and closed inDecember 2001after a two-year
extension. The project was cofinanced by the Global Environment Trust Fund(GETF28633-
IN)inthe amountofUS$26millionequivalent, andbythe SwissDevelopmentCorporation,
the Danish InternationalDevelopmentAgency, and the Government o fthe Netherlands.

        The objectives o fthe RRDPwere to (a) promote commercialization o frenewable
energy technologies by strengthening the capacity o fthe Indian Renewable Energy
Development Agency (IREDA) to promote and finance entrepreneurial investments in
alternate energy; (b) create marketingand financing mechanisms for the sale and delivery o f
alternative energy systems basedon cost-recovery principles; (c) help set up the institutional
framework for encouraging entry o fprivate sector investors insmall-scale power generation;
and (d) promote environmentally sound investments to prevent depletion o f India's limited
forest resources and reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels. The objectives o f
the Global Environment Facility (GEF) project were to demonstrate commercialization o f
and catalyze wind energy and solar photovoltaic (PV) investments by strengthening IREDA's
capacity to promote and finance private investments.

         Inevaluatingthisproject, anattempt was madeto assessproject outcomeswithinthe
context o f India's broader power sector reforms, on which the sustainability o frenewable
energy development and commercialization depends.

        Overall, the project's outcome was ratedsatisfactory. Its physical objectives were
achieved and, inthe case o f small hydro and wind farmpower, they were even exceeded. The
project succeededinpromoting the commercialization ofrenewable energy technologies
(RETs) through IREDA's financing for privatedevelopers, training, andpromotional activities.
Froma sector perspective, however, the project didnot fully succeed indeveloping marketing
and financing mechanisms based on cost recovery principles, or inreachingthe rural market,
as called for under the GEF financing and inthe Bank's current EnergyBusiness Renewal
Strategy, thus limitingthe project's benefits to the ruralpoor. None o fthe three RETs have yet
reachedfull commercial status, as they continue to depend on infusions of grants andor
subsidies, and fiscal and regulatory incentives at the state and national level, to be financially
viable to private developers.

        Institutional development impact o f the project i s rated modest. At the project level,

continues to have a highproportiono fnon-performing assets -- loans with zero or low
IREDAhasbeensuccessful inpromotingthe commercializationofrenewables, butit

repayment rates. Moreover, while IREDAcontinues to be cast inits traditional role o f soft
loan financing, some o f its lending terms and processes are infact not competitive. IREDA
needs to compete inorder to remainrelevant. From a sector viewpoint, institutional
development for renewables inIndia has been uneven, given the continuing regulatory
unpredictability in some states (which deters new investments andthreatens the financial
viability o f existing ones), and the lack o f a renewable energy policy, hence the mixed signals
to private investors from government and state regulatory agencies.

        The sustainability o f the process o f commercialization catalyzedby the project i s
rated likely on balance, although benefits over time maybe undermined by IREDA's

                                                 X



persistent non-performing assets; its limitedcapital availability and higher financial risks; the
continued dependence ofrenewable energy technologies on incentives, grants, and subsidies;
and broader state-level regulatory risks and uncertainties.

        Bank performance i s rated satisfactory. Pre-investment studies, technical assistance,
and adequate supervision at most stages o f the project contributedto satisfactory quality at
entry and successhl implementation o f RRDP's physical targets. Froma sector perspective,
however, the Bank underestimatedthe challenges o f creating marketingand financing
mechanisms suitable to serving rural markets. Moreover, having focused on project inputs
and outputs, the Bank missed an opportunity to leverage RRDP's resources to address sector
policy issues (particularly state-level regulations) that directly influence RRDP's own
outcomes. Finally, the Bank didnot press strongly enough for the establishment o f a strong
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity within IREDA, which i s especially critical for
renewables to compete.

        Borrower performance i s ratedsatisfactory overall. Butthe government showed
weakness in(i)  rationalizinglending rates and state-level regulatory frameworks; (ii)promoting
more widespread adoption o frenewable energy technologies inrural areas; and (iii)
coordinatingthe various agencies involvedwithrenewable energy development.

        The main lessons o fthis project are:

    9 Powersectorreformsandrenewableenergycommercializationshouldbepartofan
        integrated strategy.
    9 The Bankanditsclient countries shouldincorporateprovisionsto leveltheplaying
        field between conventional and renewable energy technologies while legalh-egulatory
        and other sector-level reforms are being designed and implemented.
    9 Monitoringandevaluation(M&E) systems shouldbedevelopedfor bothproject- and
        sector-level outcomes, which should distinguishbetween efficiency and equity
        indicators. This i s essential insetting subsidies, designing output-based aid, and
        mitigating investor risk inrenewables-based capacity expansion, since the sector
        indicators would provide clearer signals to investors whether transparency and
    >   predictability inthe regulatory framework for renewables are beingachieved.
        Grant support from GEF and other donors operate within a larger sector reform
        setting, and thus should also pursue sector outcome indicators. Otherwise, focusing
        only on project inputs, processes and outputs fosters a culture o f dependence on
        grants and subsidies, which ironically works against the full commercialization o f
        renewables and hinderstheir ability to compete inthe market when these financial
        incentives are reducedor withdrawn.
    9 Renewableenergydevelopmentandcommercialization involves muchlearning-by-

BACKGROUND

1.      Since its independence in 1947, India's electricity demand has grown on average
at a rapid 7 percent per year, thus doubling every 10years. Since 1980, electricity supply
has fallen short o f demand, resultinginsupply-demand gaps o fbetween 5 to 8 percent,
withpeak power shortages often at double or triple these rates. The durationandnumber
o fblackouts andbrownouts are frequently beyond acceptable limits. This has ledto
increases incaptive generation, which currently amounts to more than 13 percent o f total
generation capacity.'

2.      India's power sector has been ina persistent state o f financial andphysical crisis.
It is predominantly based on fossil fuels, with about three-fourths o fthe country's power
generation capacity sourced from vast indigenous coal reserves, and a minute but
growing share o frenewable energy from solar, wind, and small hydro resources. In
response to the macro-economic and fiscal crises o fthe Indianpower sector, and
following the shift inWorld Bankpolicy on energy sector lending set out inits 1993
policy,2 the Bank, from 1993, refrained from financing or guaranteeing "power sector
projects for states that were not undertaking full-scale restructuring, including
unbundling, commercialization, andprivatizationo fdistribution systems andrealtariff
reform with an independent regulatory me~hanism."~            This conditionencouraged manyo f
India's states, starting with Orissa and subsequently Andhra Pradesh, Haryana,
Kamataka, Rajasthan, andUttarPradesh, to pursue Bank-supported energy sector
reforms, which are now backsliding. Duringthis period, bilateral donor assistance for
renewable energy development expanded rapidly inparallel-but notjointly                  -    with the
broader power sector reform operations supported bythe World Bank, as well as the
AsianDevelopment Bank. Thus, while there was aBank policy andstrategy governing
its support for (or withdrawal from) the Indianpower sector, there is still no coherent
strategy for supporting renewable energy development, despite two large projects to date.

3.      India's renewable energy programwas launched inthe 1970sprimarilyas a
responseto the perceived rural energy crisis. Itwas initiatedas a target-oriented, supply-
driven approach andsought to develop niche applications, such as inrural areaswhere
grid-based electricity was not a~ailable.~    At that time (unliketoday), the technologies were
not mature andthere was little international experience inimplementation. Yet, renewables
were promoted as a cure-all for the country'^ energy problems, resultingindoing "too
muchtoo soon" andunrealistic expectations that ledto failures. Withthe economic
liberalizationinthe early 1990s, the renewable energy program shifted emphasis from
beingcentrallymanagedandsupply-drivento an approachbasedoncommercializing

proventechnologies. Today, renewable technology capacitf accounts for almost 3.5
percent o fthe overall generation capacity and 1percent inthe overall power generated.6

4.       The rationale for RenewableEnergy Resources Development Project (RRDP)
originated from thejoint UNDP/WorldBank EnergySector Management Assistance
Program (ESMAP) review of the government's program on non-conventional energy
sources in 1988, and the follow-up pre-investment studies in 1991 and 1992. The
UNDP/ESMAI? review concluded that grid-interfaced power generation from irrigation-
basedmini-hydro andwindfannsystems offer near-term opportunities for
commercialization, as well as solar P V systems for selected applications. Further,the
studies concludedthat wind energy, although not least-cost compared to conventional
coal-based grid alternatives, canbecome economically competitive when the
environmental cost o fthe fossil-based generation is considered. The studies noted that
PV lightingand selected applications are economically viable innon-electrified areas, but
consumer awareness o fthe benefits o fPV systems has to be developed through more
efficient marketing and financing schemes7

5.       Economic liberalization andthe success o fthe Ministry o fNon-conventional
Energy Sources ingettingstates to adopt supportive energy policies andincentives, set
the stage for the RRDP. Several southem states (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kamataka,
Kerala, andTamilNadu) opened up to private investments and announced policies for
licensing, pricing o fpower purchases, as well as alternative power sales arrangements for
renewable energy-based generation. Other states followed inactively promoting private
sector investments inrenewable energy.' To attract more investors, some states
supplemented the national incentives with generous state-specific incentive packages,
including deferral o f sales tax payments.

Renewable Energy Subsector Institutions

6.       The Ministry o fNon-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES) i s the principal agency
responsible for the development o frenewable energy resource^.^ M N E S formulates
policies andprograms and coordinates researchand development (R&D) activities inthe
sector. It administers a variety o fprograms, includingbiogas development, improved
chulas (stoves), solar thermal coolers, solar photovoltaics(PV), wind energy, andsmall
hydro, which are fimdedmainly through central and state grants, andsubsidies."

7.       In1987, theIndianRenewableEnergyDevelopmentAgencyLimited(IREDA)
was established as an affiliate o fMNES to promote emerging non-conventional energy

THEPROJECT

Project Objectives

8.       The project originally had five objectives, including a component for the Tamil
NaduPaper Limited (TNPL) to produce newsprint from bagasse. The TNPL loan closed
on December 31, 1995, and a separate ICR" and Evaluation Memorandum'* were issued
inMay 1996. This component was very successful inprovingthe economic viability of
bagasse-basednewsprint production. The OED mission visited TNPL inMarch 2003 and
verifiedthe continuing financial and economic sustainability o fthis industrial operation.
Consequently, takinginto account the well-prepared ICR13associated with the TNPL
component, this PPAR evaluates RRDP's remaining four components related specifically
to renewable energy, as set out below:

    e    Promote commercialization o frenewable resources technologies by strengthening
         IREDA's capacity to promote and finance entrepreneurial investments in
         alternative energy.
    e    Create marketingandfinancing mechanisms for the sale anddelivery o f
         alternative energy systems based on cost-recovery principles.
    e    Help set up an institutional framework for encouraging entry o fprivate sector
         investments insmall-scale power generation.
    e    Promote environmentally sound investments to prevent depletiono f India's limited
         forest resources and to reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels.

9.       The objectives ofthe grant cofinancing from the Global Environment Facility
(GEF)were to promote the commercialization o fwindenergy and solar PVsby
strengthening IREDA's capacity to promote and finance private investments inthe sector.
These were consistent with and subsumed under the Bank project. With respect to the
windfarmcomponent, the GEF grant was to help reduce the project's cost comparable to
that o f conventional alternatives and equivalent to displacing carbon dioxide emissions
valued at about US$30 per ton. GEF financing would also stimulate a commercial market
that would help bringdown the cost o f solar PV production and consequently reduce the
cost of displacing carbon dioxide emissions. Comparedto the Bank loan, the GEF project

specifically bytargetingthe household lightingmarket.14

10.     Project cofinancing also includedUS$4 millionequivalent from the Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC). Parallel cofinancingo fUS$50 million equivalent in
mixedcredits was also providedbythe Danishgovernment through the Danish
InternationalDevelopment Agency (DANIDA). The Dutchgovernment in 1996 provided
US$0.4 million, which was not part o fthe original project, to strengthenthe technical
assistanceprogram. Giventhe slow project disbursement, DANIDAin 1997 withdrew its
participation after disbursing US$3.94 millionwhen it decided to finance wind turbines
instead o fwind farms through its direct lending window; the SDC also reducedits
hndingto SFr 3.75 from SFr 6 millioninFY 1999-2000.

11.     The higheractual cost o f the small hydro component can be attributed to: (i) the
financing o fmore hydro capacity (Le., 153 MW comparedto the 100MW envisaged at
appraisal); (ii) costs ofcivil works, comparedto appraisal estimates, because o f
                 higher
unworkable low-cost solutions and underestimationo f civil works cost inthe ESMAP
pre-investment study; (iii)   additional works on canal liningupstream and downstream o f
the power plant; and (iv) higher-than-expected inflation. The lower actual cost for
windfams was due to cost reductions resulting from significantly lower local content
thanenvisaged at appraisal. ActualBank and GEF hndingplayeda secondary role to
domestic financing (5 1.8 percent o f total project cost), which includedcontributions from
IREDA,promoters andconsumers, andother loans. Bilateral financing had a larger share
at appraisal than what actually materialized.

ImplementationArrangements

12.      As outlined inthe Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)," various entities were to be
involved inproject implementation. IREDAwas responsible for the overall management
o fthe energy components. Itwas to be re-organized to ensure that tasks of appraising,
supervising, andmonitoring all the project's energy subprojects were effectively
managed. IREDA would lend to private companies, nongovernmentalorganizations,
cooperatives, and public sector companies that meet IREDA's minimumlending
requirements. State Electricity Boards and state generating companies inparticipating
stateswere expected to promote the project and assist developers insecuring all the
necessary state clearances for qualified investment proposals.

ImplementationRecord

 13.     The project was approved inApril 6, 1993, and was implemented for almost nine
years. The project's original closing date o fDecember 31, 1999, was extended twice, to
December 31,2001, when it closed.

  14.    Implementationanddisbursementswere slow due to three important
shortcomings inproject design andpreparation. First, there was poor prior understanding
andhence weak development o fthe renewables market. Access to solar PV financing
was slow, especially at project start-up, due inpart to the condition set inthe Staff
Appraisal Report which stipulates that solar PV proposals from the IDA Credit/GEF
grant wouldbeconsidered byIREDA onZy after the completion o fa market assessment
andpromotions campaign study. The study was completed only in 1994, more than a year
after project approval, when it should havebeenpart ofproject appraisal. Second,there
was a lack o f coordinationbetween MNES andIREDA.Subsidies for solar PV programs
at the national level (through MNES and IREDA)and state level have not been
harmonized. Early on, mixed signals were given to investors: IREDAwas the executing
agency for a 1994M N E S program to disseminate 1,000 solar PV water pumps that
offeredhighsubsidies andtechnical requirements that didnot conform with IREDA's
own norms under the IDNGEF-assisted solar PV component.16Also, private developers
wanted lower interest rates from IREDA inview o f concurrent government
announcements on interest rate rollbacks due to lower inflation rates. A reduction in

interest rate from 10.3 percent to 2.5 percent, coupledwith relaxation inprocurement
procedures, brought inonly 14applications for solar PV byNovember 1995.'' Third, the
slow development o f commercial suppliers for the solar PV component can be largely
attributed to the dominant role that the government played inPV procurement. Fourth,
further delays inthe implementation o fthe PV component occurred as the financial
intermediaries earlier accredited by IREDAwere unable to comply with the Reserve
Banko fIndia's newprudentialnorms for non-banking institutions.

15.     By 1999, the IDMGEF-financed solar PV component was clearly unsuccessful.
IREDAindicates (see Annex D)that this was the result o f(i) initialcosts o f
                                                                         high
renewable energy technologies, (ii)      procurement delays, (iii) market reaction, and
                                                                         slow
(iv) delays inthe creationo fsolar PV delivery systems. Ofthe original US$45 million
allocation (including the GEF grant), only about 30 percent was committed and 10
percent disbursed. Basedon project records, an imbalance occurred between the original
allocation and use o f funds among the small hydro, wind, and solar PV components,
following a Bank decision to transfer mature subprojects (proposed under the Second
RenewableEnergy Project) into RRDP, inorder to yield additional disbursements. There
was also an imbalance (relative to original targets) betweentechnical assistance (TA) and
market development for the solar PV component: only 10percent was disbursed under
the critical activity o fmarket development, whereas 75 percent was disbursed for TA, o f
which 45 percent was for mediapublicity alone. Muchmediapublicity was carried out
while market development (e.g., brokering and resolving issues among entrepreneurs,
private lenders, consumer groups, andregulators) lagged significantly.l8

16.      The foregoing design shortcomings also affectedproject components other than
solar PV. There were implementation delays inthe small hydro component when M N E S
announced its subsidy support prompting some developers to pull out of IREDA's
program, only to return later when the MNES subsidyprogram didnot materialize.

17.      In1997, windfann targets were scaleddownto 30.5 MWwhenDANIDA
withdrew its funding support for the project and decided to finance wind turbines through
direct lending, reportedly due to the less-than-competitive rates o f concessional
BanWGEF financing through IREDA, compared to alternativeresources available inthe
domestic market. Basedon the OED mission's interviews with commercial banks, this
issue persists today.

RATINGS

18.      The RRDP's sectoral objective o fhelpingcommercialize renewables should be
evaluated within the context o fthe larger reforms that were takingplace inthe Indian
power sector. Power reforms have important impacts on the development and
commercialization o frenewable energy technologies (RETS).Sector-level reforms can
result ingreater transparency as well as subsidy andtariffrationalization, which can

provide spaces andopportunities for RETSwithin which to better and more fairly
compete. The broader transformation o fpower sector structure and ownership ledbythe
World Bank inIndia-by emphasizing corporatization, commercialization, competition,
andprivate-sector initiatives -have to a certain extent offerednew opportunities and
potential for renewable energyservices to compete more fully for a market share.
Unbundlingthe energy sector -byallowingpricesto reflect costs, reducingifnot
eliminating cross-subsidies, andincreasingtransparency andinsights into cost structures
-hasunderscoredthecomparativeadvantageofdecentralizedandrenewableenergy
services inserving the electricity needs ofremote and dispersed communities and
  consumer^.'^ At the same time, the financial viability and sustainability o fRET
investments depend significantly on stable and predictable regulations at the state level,
which inturn are consistent with an explicit renewable energy development policy at the
national level (as inGermany, Denmark, andthe Netherlands) that creates and fosters
"market space" for renewables.

 19.      Since the RRDPis one o fthe first renewable energy projects financed bythe IDA
and GEF, this PAR takes into account the extent to which project implementationhas
been well integrated within the largerpower sector reform framework, on which
renewable energy commercializationdepends. Consequently, this PPAR evaluates
outcomes vis-a-vis the project's specific objectives as appraised and the renewable
energy-related indicators o f the Bank's 2001Energy Business Renewal Strategy (EBRS)
andthe 2002 Private Sector Development Strategy. This is inline with OED's
"Guidelines and Criteria for Project Evaluations" (July 1,2000), which requires that a
project's development impact be measured vis-a-vis the continuing relevance o f the
project's objectives at the time o f evaluation ("otherwise, there is a significant risk that
the Outcome ratingwould not reflect results on the ground, but rather only the
achievement of outdated objectives"). Three (out o f 4) main goals o f Bank's EBRS are
relevant for the RRDP: environmental mainstreaming, helping the poor directly, and
private sector development. As performance indicators, these EBRS goals respectively
call for renewable energy development, promoting community-managed systems,
creatingnondiscriminatoryregulatorymechanisms, and strengthening financial
institutions to provide long-term financing for rural energy business.

20.       The OED ratings below raise some key sector-level concerns that deter RET
 commercialization, particularly regulatory frameworks and good governance. Evidence
 for the ratings i s based on mission findings, portfolio and literature reviews, and
interviewsat headquarters and inthe field among a largenumber o f informants. The
PPAR also took into account the findings and lessons learned from OED's May 2003
 studyto evaluate the World Bank Group's performance inpromoting Private Sector
Development inthe Electric Power Sector.

Outcome

      OEDdefinition: Based on three sub-criteria of relevance, eficacy, and eficiency -to what
      extent were the RlWP's major relevant objectives achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,
      eficiently? Has the commercialization of renewable energy technologies beenpromoted,
      based on cost recovery principles, and withprivate sector participation?

21.      The project's outcome is rated satisfactory. The project achieved its physical
objectives, and inthe case o f small hydro power andwind farms components, exceeded
its targets. It should be clarified, however, that the project's direct physical achievements
are small compared to the total MW from renewables already installedinIndia, which in
tumis very small relativeto the country's renewables potential(see Table 3 below, based
on technical potential, as data on the potentialmarket is not available).20It is not feasible
to quantify the proportion o ftotal installed renewable energy capacity that has been
catalyzed (but not financed) bythe project.

22.      Basedon interviews and a literature review, there is widespread consensus that
IREDAandthe project didcontribute to the development andrapid growth o faprivate
sector wind, small hydro, and solar renewable energy lines o fbusiness inIndia. IREDA
enlarged the space for renewables inthe Indianenergy sector debate, and engaged many
State Electricity Boards inplanningwith renewables factored in.However, while the
RRDP didpromote renewables, there are stillmany risks because o fthe lack o fa Bank
andborrower strategy that integrates the commercialization o f renewables withinthe
design and implementation o fpower sector reforms. Moreover, there i s a continued
reliance on soft consumer credit as the key driver inupscaling renewables, without being
adequately supported byproduct diversification targeted toward demographically and
geographically well-defined markets.




20. According to standard usage, grosspotential refers to the total amount ofrenewable energy available
for extraction; and technicalpotential refers to the amount o fenergy that may be extracted from the
available resource, usingknown technologies. Statistics ongross versus technical potential for renewable
energy sources inIndia were very unclear. A 2001TERIReport suggests that the data ongross potential

      depend on the infusion o f grants, subsidies, and other government incentives (see
      "Efficiency" section below). Given this continuing granthbsidy dependence, this review
      modifies the ICR assessment that small hydro and wind generation are fully or nearly
      commercialized (see Table 3 above). While the project reduced business risks to
      marketability and competitiveness, many barriers to full-scale commercializationremain,
      such as persistent regulatory uncertainties andunclear policy framework insupport o f
      renewables. There are significantly varying regulatory regimes for renewables at the state
      level, and conflicting policy signals have been sent at the national level (during OED's
      PPAR mission, for example, MNES announced that provisions on specific targets for
      renewables as a percentage o f total generation capacity were deleted from the draft

Relevanceof Objectives

     OEDdefinition: Towhat extent are the objectives of theRRDP consistent with the county's
     current developmentpriorities and with current Bank county and sector assistance
     strategies (such as theEnergy BusinessRenewal Strategyl and corporate goals?

24.     The relevance of the project's objectives is rated substantial.RRDP's
objectives are consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) priorities
throughout the 1990s; they remain relevant to the present CAS, which calls for increased
private sector participation and improved environmentalprotection.22The project's
objectives are also inline with the GEF's OperationalProgram No. 5 on removing
marketbarriersto large-scale application andimplementationo fenergy efficiency
services, products, and technologies. The project's pushfor commercialization o f
renewables is also relevant to Goal 7 o f the MillenniumDevelopment Goals ("Ensure
Environmental Sustainability") andits accompanying Target 9 ("Integrate sustainable
development into country policies and reverse loss of environmental resources." RRDP's
objectives are also supportive o f India's Environmental Action Plan, promulgatedin
December 1993, which includes the promotion o f renewable energy as a key element.23
Thepriority conferredbythe government onrenewable energyprogram and energy
efficiency i s articulatedinits five-year development plans since the 1 9 8 0 ~Renewable    . ~ ~

(and ambitious) goal to ensure electrification o f 18,000 remote villages by2012, by
representing a minimumo f 10percent, or 10,000 MW, o f the total power generation
capacity.25

25.     The project, however, falls short o fmeeting the poverty reduction objective o fthe
Bank's 2001 Energy Business Renewal Strategy (EBRS). (As explained inparagraph 19,
an assessmento f current relevance is requiredby OED's project evaluation guidelines.)
The RRDPsupported two EBRS objectives, namely, environmental protection (by
promoting the commercialization o frenewables) andprivate sector development (by
strengthening REDA andproviding concessional financing to private developers for
renewables). But it has not facilitated energy access for the poor to the scale originally
envisaged, especially inthe case o f solar PVs inrural areas. As explained immediately


22. The call for private sector participation was first enunciated inthe Country Economic Memorandumo f
1993 as part o fthe country's move towards economic liberalization. Greater private sector participation is a
key component o f India's power sector reformas indicated ina series o f Country Assistance Strategies
(1996, 1998,2001). Emphasis on environmental protection was first enunciated inthe 1996 CAS.

below, IREDA's credit policy tended to favor well-established industrial and commercial
enterprises, andhad limited impact on the development o f smaller scale entrepreneurs
that could serve the rural poor.26

Efficacy

      OEDdefinition: Towhat extent were the objectives of theRRDP achieved, or are expected
      to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance?


26.      The project's physical objectives were achieved, but mainly for the small hydro
andwind farm components, for which employment and productivity impactshavebeen
high,as notedinthe ICR.RRDPsucceededinpromoting the commercializationo fthese
RETSthrough IREDA's financing for private developers, and training andpromotional
activities.

27.      The solar homes systems (SHS) component, which received 34 percent o f GEF's
support, was much less successful. IREDA's complex procedures andrequirements
(which were subsequently streamlined) discouraged small- to medium-size start-up
companies, which should have played a pivotal role inthe early introduction o f SHS, as
they have done historically inother c~untries.~'The Bank's policies on credit lines
                                                           28
exacerbated this IREDAbias for larger-scale companies, thus keeping smaller
entrepreneurs out o f the SHS market. Those policies insisted that there be no direct
working capital loans to public or private developers, preferring to provide concessional
financing    directly to the consumer instead.

28.      Moreover, a key project designweakness was that both IREDA and the Bank, due
to time pressures for project appraisal and completion, didnot make a credible effort to
design the project so that strongrural credit organizations could be tapped to manage
rural credit risk.Inaddition, the Bank didnot use its leverage to press for business
advisory services and the elimination o f import duties on PV modules. Consequently, the
large rural market was not tapped, rural sector SHS delivery mechanisms were not
developed, and rural energy access was not improved, as called for by the Bank's current
EnergyBusiness RenewalStrategy.''

29.      This weakness indeveloping the rural SHS market infrastructure i s exacerbated
bythe already strongbias against m a l energy markets resulting from the Indian

26. InAnnex D, IREDAstates that their credit policy didnot favor well-established industrial and
commercial enterprises, to the relative neglect o f meeting the needs o f smaller scale entrepreneurs that
could serve the rural poor. IREDA indicates that, as a public financial institution, it cannot approach rural
financing agencies due to the non-availability o f essential commercial banking institutions and
infrastructure, etc. Attempting to overcome this barrier, IREDA has sanctioned lines o fcredit to
commercial enterprises for distribution o f SHS through localirural agencies, including small scale
entrepreneurs.
27. See Miller andHope (2000) for    &IS paragraph and subsequent ones.
28. See the footnoted objectionbyIREDA above, inparagraph25.
29. However, inAnnex D, IREDAnotes that SPV systems financed by IREDA are installed inthe rural and
hilly areaswhere there is no grid or quality gridpower available. Inthese cases, rural credit organizations
were involved, although the rural market has yet to be tapped to the fullest extent.

government's protectionist policies dating from the early 1980s. Overall, the more than
two decades o f strong solar energy industry development inIndia, with BanMGEF
support inthe 1990s, has mainly benefited corporate and industrial markets with low
credit risks, to the relative neglect o fthe poor.

Efficiency

      OEDdefinition: Towhat extent has theRRDP achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return
      higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
      alternatives?


30.      FtRDP's economic and financial rates of return are rated modest. Based on
the ICR, the economic internal rates o freturn (EIRRs) for the three components are
above the opportunity cost o f capital (12 percent) and are comparable with those
estimated at appraisal, particularly for solar PV applications as a result o f large unit cost
reductions. However, EIRRs for some ofthe early windprojects were below the 12
percent rate due to lower-than-expected capacity utilization fact01-s.~'As the ICR
correctly indicates, the project should have given more attentionto maximizing energy
output (Le., the actual project economic benefits) rather than installed capacity. The
project's EIRRs and financial internal rates o freturn (FIRRs) at appraisal and completion
(by component) are presented inAnnex B.

31.      FIRRs for all the three components are also comparable to or sometimes even
higher thanappraisal estimates, butthey aremainly dueto generousincentives for either
producers andor end-user~.~'        This is most evident inthe wind energy component. The
generally highFIRRs for wind f m s canbe attributed to manyincentives, including a 100
percent depreciation benefit inyear one at the national level, and the deferral o f sales tax
payments insome states, such as Maharashtra. Some o fthe early windprojects inAndhra
Pradesh, Gujarat, andTamilNaduhadpoor economic andfinancial returns becausetheir
capacity utilizationhadbeen about halfthat expected at appraisal. Most o fthe later wind
farm projects achievedhighreturns due to improvedwindfarmperformance andto sales
andtax deferment offeredbysome states. Further,the averageFIRRonequity after tax on
windprojects is onthe highside dueto 10projects inMaharashtra which were exceedingly
profitable due to generous sales tax deferment incentive^.^^

Institutional DevelopmentImpact

      OEDdefinition: Towhat extent has the RRDP improved the ability of India and theproject
      areas to make more eficient, equitable, and sustainable use of their human,financial and
      natural resources-through better de$nition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and
     predictability of institutional arrangementsfor renewables? Has theproject strengthened
      IREDA's capacity topromote renewable energy commercialization?

30. The economic analysis was based on 13 small hydro sub-projects o f 33 projects representing a sample
of the best, worst, and average projects; and 27 wind-projects. The ICR didnot mention the number of
samples for the PV analysis.

32.      The project's institutionaldevelopmentimpactis ratedmodest.RRDP
strengthened IREDA and enabled it to mobilize greater private participation and attract
additional multilateral andbilateral support for commercializing renewables. RRDP's
TA was effective instrengthening IREDA's subproject sanction procedures and
international competitive biddingprocesses, which contributed to RRDP's successful
physical outcomes. Subproject approval to commissioning time went down significantly,
ranging from 15 to 30 months, compared to 40 to 65 months, previously. However,
RRDP's objective o f creatingmarketing and financing mechanisms based on cost
recovery principles was not fully achieved. IREDAcontinues to have non-performing
assets, i.e., payment defaults or delinquency. Networking with rural credit institutions
continue to beweak or absent and rural renewables markets continue to be untapped.
Most RRDP clients are commercial and industrial, and inurban areas, thus raising doubts
whether the project really improvedbroader energy access, especially bythe poor.

33.      Finally, as shown inFigure 1below, REDA has not evolved fast enoughto be an
effective "broker" inthe current highly competitive capital markets environment. It i s
still restrained to the traditional role o freceiving soft loandgrants and dispensing
subproject financing to applicants. lREDA has had little impact inbridgingentrepreneurs
with state-level regulatory anddevelopment agencies (the incentive is for IREDAto have
its own projects rather than act as a broker). Presently, however, there is a larger number
o f strong stakeholders, compared to when RRDPwas designed. Commercial banks have
emerged with a range o f lending instruments andmore competitive terms than REDA's
higher-cost financing terms. The sectoral context for commercializing renewables has
also become much more complex: state regulators' response to appeals from renewable
energy investor associations have become more unpredictable; many states have been
backsliding onpower sector reforms; the government has been sending conflicting
signals on itssupport for renewables; generous incentives are beingphased out or
withdrawn; andpublic demand for accountability has increased dramatically.

Sustainability
    I OED definition:     To what extent are RRLlP's net beneJitflows resilient to risks over time?


34.      The sustainabilityof RRDPis ratedlikely,but only marginally so. There are
highrisks, as commercializationofrenewables continues to bethreatened byregulatory
instability, and have many constraints, notably its continued dependence on incentives,
grants, and subsidies. IREDA itself continues to face important financial issues that
threaten the sustainability o fthe project's achievement^.^^

35.      Portfolio performance. IREDA's sustainability depends strongly on its ability to
make reasonable profit margins. While IREDA has seen considerable growth in
subproject approvals and disbursements, this growth has been accompanied by a
significant increase innon-performing assets (NPAs), for which loan servicing is
deficient or at default. As noted inthe ICR, IREDA'sNPA levels have tended to be
higher than some other comparable Indianinstitutions, though IREDA's NPA levels -
relative to other institutions - have improved somewhat over the last couple o f years.34
Nevertheless, as Annex C o fthis PPAR suggests, the absolute value o fNPAshas
increased significantly over the years. NPAs for renewables ingeneral -as a percentage
o ftotal loans outstanding -have         tended to decrease toward the end o fthe project, but
this trend is less clear ifdisaggregated by component.

33. See the Price Waterhouse Coopers Study (2000).
34. See comparative NPA data provided byIREDAinAnnex D.

                                                     15


36.     For the solar P V component, NPAshave decreasedover the past couple o fyears.35
The trendis less clear for the small hydro andwind power components: NPAs o floans
outstanding for these two increased over the durationo fthe project, peakingin 1999-2000
and2000-2001, respectively. Figures for 2001-2002 show that the NPAsfor both
components have decreased, although the small hydro NPAsonly dropped by one
percentage point. For 2002-2003, only aggregateNPA figures for renewables ingeneral
were available, but these actually indicate anoverall slight increase inNPAs. This further
tempersthe claim that NPAsfor renewableshave recently beendecreasing. Review o fthe
IREDA's loanportfolio andNPAs reveals a concentration o floans across statesh-egions
andsectors [see IREDA's additionalcomments inAnnex D].36Moreover, a Bank
supervision mission also indicateddeteriorating collectionperformance, especially for the
windportfolio, with 11percent o floanoutstanding.             37Ability to containNPAs,better
collection performance, and animproved capacity for screening andappraising project
proposals, will be critical determinants o fIREDA's growth inthe future.38

37.     Limited capital availability andhigher financial risks. Financial forecasts for
IREDAsuggest that fresh equity would haveto more thandouble from the level currently
available. This equity requirementwould go up further ifrecovery levels deteriorate
further. Butthe availability ofequity fromthe government andconcessional debt funding
is limited. IREDA also faces higher technological and financial risks comparedto more
diversified and commercially oriented financial institutions. IREDA's ability to manage
these risks will have implications for continued support from the government and
international financial institutions and its access to capital markets for raising debt and
equity inthe future.

38.      Based on the financial projections and analysis o f trends inrecovery andNPAs,
IREDA's future growth could be curtailed, unless it adopts a higher degree o f
commercial orientation inits operations, that would include changes inprocesses and
systems, especially on the financial analysis o fmany projects that are marginally viable
on a stand-alone basis.

39.      Regulatory risks and uncertaint~.~'        Adhoc andinconsistent policy andregulatory
revisions -such as bans on third-party sales, increasedwheeling charges, and
unfavorable changes inpower banking terms, and restrictions on captive generation in
some states -eroded and continues to undermine investor confidence. Indeed, neither
Andhra Pradesh, Kamataka, nor Tamil Nadu, three o fthe states that receivedthe most
project funding, allow third-party sales. Moreover, although Andhra Pradesh complies

36. Basedon March2000 data, 86 percent o f loanoutstanding o fthe wind sector NPAswere inTamil
Nadu, and 79 percent ofthe small hydro NPAs were inKamataka.
37. The Banksupervision mission aide-memoire ofApril 2001 indicates a low collection rate (73% for
2001,55% on aggregate).
38. IREDA states that it has taken various steps to address these issues. For a list o f these efforts, see
Annex D.
39. This section draws on interviews with staff from the Small Hydro Power Developers Association o f
Andhra Pradesh, as well as documentationprovidedbyIREDA "Brief Description o fPolicies Announced
byVarious States," during the OED mission inMarch2003. See also ICR, pp. 16-17.

with the MNES guidelines related to tariff escalation underthe PPAswith renewable
energy producers, in2002-2003 the Andra Pradesh EnergyRegulatory Commission
hiked the wheeling charges from the initial 2 percent o f electricity generated to 28.4
percent, adding also a further charge o fRs 0.50 per kWh as grid support charges. The
inflexible approach to power banking insome o fthese states, particularly inTamil Nadu
where banking is now banned andinAndhra Pradeshwhere it i s limitedto 8-12 months,
furtherthreatens the financial viability o fexistingrenewable energy investments as well
as discourages future investments inthe sector.

Bank Performance

      OED definition: To what extent did the services provided by the Bank ensure quality at
      entry and support implementation through appropriate supervision, including ensuring
      adequate transition arrangementsfor regular operation of theRRDP?

40.     Overall, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory, at least at the project
level. As explained inthe remainder o f this PPAR, the mainrisks to the project stem from
the lack o f an integratedrenewables andpower sector strategy.

41.     Quality at entry. Quality at entry was substantial, both interms o f sector work,
analytical and advisory assistance, andpreparatory studies financed by grants from the
GEF, the EnergySector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), andthe Japanese
Policy and HumanResources Development (PHRD) Fund. Three ESMAP-funded studies
on conventional energy systems, mini-hydro development, andwindfarmsprovided the
basis for the project formulation while studies funded byGEF and PHRDprovided the
basis for designingproject components. Project files at the design stage show ample
debate on whether to implement the project through the State Electricity Boards or
through local private entrepreneurs, and decisions infavor o fthe latter.

42.     Early duringimplementation, however, the project files also showed that some
pre-investment studies were deficient (e.g., small hydro prototypes ledto highcivil works
costs). The Bank also didnot pushfor networking with rural credit institutions and
developing rural energy markets, andwas not fully effective inbridgingearly enough the
interest rate differential betweenM N E S and IREDAprograms.

43.     Supervision. Bank supervisionwas satisfactory. The Bank showed flexibility in
allowing design changes and modification ofprocurement requirements to accommodate
needs o f small private developers. Still, while substantial improvements were made in
procurement simplification, the transaction costs andpaperwork requirements o fthe
RRDP's loan-instruments have proven to be prohibitive for smaller businesses and
entrepreneurs from rural areas.4o

44.     Monitoring andEvaluation (M&E) Systems. Overall, based on the indicators from
the belated M&Ecapacity that is only now being initiated at IREDA, the Bank focused
onproject inputsand outputs, anddidnot effectively use the leverage that the RRDP
could haveprovided to address sector-level policy issues that directly influence RRDP's

own outcomes. This i s a missed opportunity that i s discussed inmore detail inthe section
below on PPAR findings, lessons, andoutlook.

45.     Inconjunction with integratingrenewables with the overallpower sector strategy,
the Bank could have also pressed (and under the Second Renewable EnergyProject,
should press) for the development o f a strongM&Ecapability, both for sector-level and
project-level outcome and impact indicators. This need can be illustratedby questions on
the Bank's role and issues o fproject accountability (discussed inthe next two
paragraphs) that remain unclear. Moreover, these outcome and impact data are essential
for designing output-based aid schemes, setting gridversus off-grid subsidies, and
defining measures to mitigate the risks o f servingrural, off-grid markets.

46.     Given the large presence o fother renewable energy donors inIndia, it is important
to distinguishwhat i s attributable to the BankandGEF involvement, from what is not. For
any fbture involvement, this willhelp to buildonthe comparative advantage(s) o fthe Bank
-asonlyoneplayeramongmanyotherimportantones-andpromotebetterleveraging
of public-private partnerships. However, while tracking the RRDP's physical outputs was
adequate, monitoring o f sector-level achievements was less so, partly due to the lack o f a
strategy that clearly provides a roadmap for addressing the issuesthat constrain renewable
energy development, despite broad objectives that give renewables an important role.

47.     On accountability, althoughno direct evidence was provided, a significant
number o f informants volunteered the fiduciary management issue that some IDNGEF-
financed windpower investments were only "on paper," Le., given the GEF grant and
government incentives, the transactions were concludedmainly for the purposes o f
reducing taxes and benefiting from accelerated depreciation, but the facilities were never
built, or were builtbutnot reallyused or maintained. Potentialover-invoicing to create
margins for middlemen was also raised. While clearly outside the scope o f this PAR,
these "phantom installations" are an issue o f fiduciary accountability on the part o f the
borrower that merits further investigation. Preliminary answers would have been
available had the Bank insistedon an M&E system from the very start. REDA was asked
to conduct surveys o fpost-commissioning performance for the three components (small
hydro, wind, solar PV), but met some difficultybecause of (i)     lack o f data due to the
absence o f M&E systems, and (ii)     the inability or unwillingness o f developers to provide
required information.

48.     ImplementationCompletionReport (ICR). The quality o fthe ICRi s high, but it did
not discuss adequately the project's outcomes related to reaching rural households, which
was embedded inthe GEF's objectives, andmade only anecdotal references to helping the
poor. A major component o fthe GEF-funded TA was intendedto promote andincrease
awareness o f solar PV usebyrural consumers; andto support improvements inproduct
quality, marketing, andafter-sales service for products funded bythe GEFAREDA
revolving          Further,the GEFrevolvingcredit for solar PVimplicitlyfavoredrural
consumers, with its promotionalcampaign directed at rural consumers. But the ICR
discussion onthe solar PV component only focused on its physical accomplishments; there
was no mentionon whether (i)    ruralmarkets were served and(ii)    after-sales service centers

were infact established. The Bankdidnot provide adequate ex-post accounting on whether
the GEF hnds (allocated for wind, solar PV andTA) were used as planned.

Borrower Performance

       OED definition: To what extent did the borrower assume ownership and responsibility to
      ensure quality of preparation and implementation, and comply with covenants and
      agreements, toward the achievement of theRRDP's objectives and sustainability?

49.      Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. However, duringproject
implementation, project supervision records show that the government was weak in
supporting the rationalizationo flendingrates, and incoordinatingvarious agencies
involved with renewable energydevelopment. Particularly at the critical phase o fproject
start-up, the government, MNES, andIREDAwere not hlly effective intheir respective
roles; at times, they worked at cross-purposes, byproviding parallel financing (Le., more
advantageousM N E S terms compared to IREDA) and lacking coordination inregulatory
andfiscal incentives betweenthe central andstatelevels. For example, the impositiono fa
uniform sales tax onrenewables byvarious state governments effective January 1,2000
had serious implications onthe development o frenewables markets, especially for solar
PV, which are consideredto bethe most expensive among all the RETS.To date, there are
unresolvedpolicy and regulatory issues, including the realignment o f incentives at the
central andstate levels, which the government has not addressed. Some states (e.g., Andhra
Pradesh) have retroactivelyapplied adhoc policy andregulatoryrevisionsthat are
discouraging investors becauseo fincreased financial risks (see paragraph 39).

50.      Renewable energy development and commercialization -and energy access by
the rural poor -i s ultimately the government's responsibility, inline with its stated goal
of electrifying 18,000 villages by 2012 (the earlier goal o f 6 percent o f generation
capacity from renewables by 2002 has not beenmet). Based on a 2002 ESMAP study,
there i s little evidence that renewable energy plays a significant role inIndia's rural
energy situation. Rural people do not own or are largelyunaware o f various renewable
energy devices. While the government's renewable energy programhas made progress in
the area o f technology trials andpilot projects, it has had difficulty inpromoting a more
widespread adoption o ftechnologies inrural areas.42Pilot schemes to promote
renewables have created a subsidy-oriented mindset among rural consumers and
government programs have created unrealistic consumer expectations.

FINDINGS,      LESSONSLEARNED OUTLOOK
                                   AND

Major Findings

51.      The PPAR's mainfindingis that RRDP's potential gains are at risk o fbeing
underminedby the lack o f a coherent strategy that integrates the establishment o f an
enabling investment climate for renewables within the overall framework o fpower sector
reforms. The RRDPtended to focus on MW installed and didnot address policy issues on
which project sustainability depended. Still missing are consistent national and state-level
policies, and a clear roadmap specific to renewable energy commercialization. This is


42. ESMAP(2002).

                                               19


especially lacking for rural andremote energy markets where RETs-with their
comparative cost-advantage -could play a significant role inaddressing both equity and
environment concerns. Inthe absencethis strategy, mucho fthe potential and limitations
of renewables inachieving the government's ambitious electrification goals remains
unclear andhence risky, particularly for private investors.

52.     While the RRDP's grant component helped promote private investments, the
project was only minimally successfulin leveragingBank and GEF funds to address
fundamental regulatory and market barriers constraining renewables. Bank-
sponsored reforms addressedgrid electricity, and largely neglected off-grid power, where
renewables couldplay a strong role. Evenfor gridpower, the Bank and GEF cannot keep
"blinders" on power sector reforms, which directly influence the outcomes and
sustainability o f RRDP subprojects intendedto feed the network. Renewables andpower
reform project teams should not operate and conduct country-sector dialogues inisolation
fiom each other. Regulatory uncertainty, lack o ftransparency, as well as an uneven
playing field between conventional energy andRETs, continue to hinder the
commercialization o fRETs. Ad hoc andinconsistent policy and regulatory revisions -
such as bans on third-partysales, increased wheelingcharges, reductions inpower
banking, andrestrictions on captive generation insome states-undermined investor
               The Bank has not played an "honest broker" role to resolve these issues
(and neither has IREDA), and little effort i s being made to achieve harmonizationwith
other states where regulatory practices conducive to renewables and energy efficiency
have been initiated. These risks continue to discourage entry o fprivate developers inthe
renewables market andthreaten the financial viability o f existing small hydro andwind
energy investments. Informants to this evaluationhave been critical o fthe BanMGEF
focus on MW o frenewables installed, without simultaneously addressing critical
regulatory and policy issues that directly affect their replicability and sustainability.

53.      The main focus of the Bank's power sector reformwork in India has been to
pursue power sector efficiency, and have only recently addressed equity concerns.
The Bank's reform approach inIndia relied onprice andmarket signals, anddidnot
adequately address market andregulatory barriers to renewables and energy efficiency
investments. RRDPwould havebeen a key vehicle to pursue EBRS objectives -such as
facilitating access and creatingpro-poor energy enterprises -as well as greater financial
sustainability for RETs, but these have not been sufficiently realized. Only Rajasthan,
one o f the six states engaginginBank-supportedpolicy reforms, has explicitly addressed
renewable energy development within broader sector-level reforms. (Even there,
however, the poor's energy access has not been addressed effectively: a minimumtariff
o fRslSO/month for up to 5 hours daily o f electricity was mandated althoughmany
villages do not even use those manyunits; lifeline rates and competitive biddingfor the
off-grid market have not been tried; the rules for private provision to off-grid markets
remain unclear; and reforms and system planningtreats grid andoff-grid demand as if
these were two separate subsectors, relegating the off-grid to GEF and donor financing.)
Moreover, while recently the Bankhas been shifting its emphasis increasinglytoward




43. Some ofthis is notedalso by ICR, pp. 16-7.

                                                      20


reforming distribution systems? a prerequisite for expandingaccess, the main emphasis
is still on improving the efficiency o fexisting assets and utilities.

54.      Improvementsinruralenergy access was only minimallyachieved,
particularlyfor the solar PV componentfinancedby GEF. While the government and
many Indianstates (Andhra Pradesh, Kamataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu) have put in
placepolicies for attracting private development and operationo f certain types o f non-
conventional energy projects, these have mostly been limited to small hydro and
windfarm systems that are expected to help generate power for the main grids and
networks to address capacity shortages. Less attention has been given to ensuring an
enabling environment for rural and off-grid provisioning o f electricity services. To the
extent that social issues and equity concerns have beenraised bythis sector-level reform
process, they tend to be considered "through the lens o fbetter fiscal management."45

55.      This is most evident inRRDP's solar PV component, where equity concerns were
apparent based on the GEF project objective aimed to "stimulate penetrationinthe
household lightingmarket through prudent subsidizationo f P V alternative^."^^ Butthe
project didnot reachrural consumers andhouseholds due to the absence o f a concrete
"road map" and the lack o fnetworking with rural credit institutions. The loan instruments
o fRRDPwere geared toward the corporate sector and larger companies, rather than the
smaller businesses and"entrepreneurial poor." The transaction costs andpaperwork
requirements o f IREDA loans andprocedures were deemed as too high.47                  Given
IREDA's steep credit norms and security arrangementsto support PV set-up, it is
unlikely that the GEF's implicit objective o freachingthe poor will be sustainable, which
does not serve the EBRS goal o fhelpingthe poor

56.      Thereis a lackof strategiccoordinationwithin the WorldBankGroup
(WBG) and amongdonorswith respectto renewableenergy assistancefor India.
Many key informants -rangingfi-om concerned government officials to private
investors and consumers -do not see the coherence and complementarity o f RRDP and
the Second Renewable Energy Project with the WBG's own Global Village Energy
Program (GVEP), Photovoltaic Market Transformation Initiative (PVMTI), and Solar
Development Group Project, which are GEF-financed andmanaged bythe International
Finance Corporation (IFC). At least from the private stakeholders' perspective
(specifically the Small Hydro Power Developers' Association o f Andra Pradesh), how the
BankandIFCcoordinate sector policyandoperations withina reform framework in
India are not apparent: recent regulatoryunpredictability (see paragraph 39) is feeding

guidelines to the contrary - power purchase rates will be slashed (and other more
strong concerns among the private small hydro developers that - despite M N E S

48. See IREDA's objection footnoted inparagraph 25. Additionally, IREDAnotes that due to the rising
level o fNPAs and given that IREDAi s a profit making financial institutions, compliance with strict
security norms is essential due to the high risks inlendingto the sector.

disadvantageous charges imposed) when the Andra Pradesh Energy Regulatory
Commission and the IFC-financedAP Transco review the rates inMarch2004. Even
less clear are the linkages among the numerous renewables programs beingprovided and
contemplated by several multilateral andbilateral donors. This lack o f strategic
coherence, when added to JREDA's weaknesses, presents significant reputational risk
and aid inefficiency for all concemed, and could eventually discredit the progress has
beenmade byrenewables. Finally, worth noting are questions raisedby several high-
level informants regarding the WBG anddonor focus on electricity, when as far as
expanding rural energy access and poverty reduction are concemed, the delivery o f a
broadrange o f energy services maybe more relevant.

57.     LearningFromPast Experience with RenewablesProjects is Lacking. A key
question i s whether lessons were learned and applied between RRDP and its follow-up
project, the India-SecondRenewable Energy (RE2) Project, which consists o f small
hydro and energy efficiency components. This does not appear to be the case. RE2 was
conceptualized and appraised betweenJanuary to June 1997, midway through the
implementationo f RRDP, when its solar PV component was runninginto problems, and
the wind and small hydro components havejust started taking off (note that most o fthe
small hydro andwind generating capacitywere installedduringthe end-l990s, toward
RRDP's closing date). As inRRDP, RE2's physical targets may bemet, but the
promotion o f end-use efficiency and demand side management are lagging behind. RE2's
risks (rated as "high" by the March2003 Project Status Report) are similar to those that
should havebeen learned from RRDP. These sector-level risks include unpredictable
regulatory shifts, arbitrary changes inincentives, inability o f State Electricity Boards to
comply with Power Purchase Agreements, andthe lack o f an over-arching framework to
promote energy efficiency and integrated energy solutions, among others. (The same lack
o f learningcan be said o f the PVMTI, whose biggest drawback was the competition
between the immediate, 50% M N E S subsidy on solar home systems andPVMTI's credit
and leasing scheme. Butthis was already well knownunder RRDP: whenever M N E S
had capital subsidies, it was hard for RRDPto woo consumers to interest rate buy-downs.
Consumers wanted immediate subsidies, and are not usedto paying over time.)

Lessons Learned

58.     The main lessons from this evaluation are as follows:

     P Power sector reforms andrenewable energy commercializationshouldbepart o f
        an integrated strategy.
     P The Bankanditsclient countries shouldincorporateprovisionsto levelthe
        playing field between conventional andrenewable energy technologies while
        legallregulatory and other sector-level reforms are being designed and
        implemented. Relegating this to later fine-tuningposes serious risks to the
        commercialization o frenewable energy, as regulatory unpredictability andtariff
        uncertainties discourage local private investments.
     P Monitoring andevaluation systems shouldbedevelopedfor bothproject- and
        sector-level outcomes, which should distinguishbetween efficiency and equity
        indicators. This is essential insetting gridversus off-grid subsidies, designing
        output-based aid schemes, andpromoting investments as well as mitigating risks

                                                 22


        incapacityexpansionbasedonrenewables, since the sector indicatorswould send
        clearer signals to investors whether transparency and predictability inthe
        regulatory framework governing renewables are being achieved.
    b The GEF andother grant support operate inapower sector reformsetting, and
        thus should also be keyed to sector outcome indicators. Otherwise, focusing only
        on project inputs andprocesses (e.g., buyingdown the commercial interest rate)
        andoutput indicators (e.g., quantities o fsolar PVunits sold) fosters a culture o f
        dependence on grants and subsidies, which ironically works against the full
        commercialization o frenewables and hinders their ability to compete inthe
        market whenthese financial incentives are reduced or withdrawn.
    b Much"learning-by-doing" is involved innon-conventionalprojectssuchas
        renewable energy development and commercialization, which underlines once
        more the importance o fmonitoring and evaluation systems.

Outlook

59.     REDAneedsto gobeyondbeinga soft financing institutionto brokering the
development o fviable renewable energy andenergy efficiency projects amongmultiple
stakeholders, includingprivate investors (both local and foreign), bankinginstitutions, state
regulatory agencies andelectricity boards, renewable energy commercial associations,
research agencies, andconsumer groups. Today, REDA's role i s challenged even further
to grow into risk mitigation, which requires the identificationo fnew financial andadvisory
instruments. IREDAneeds to compete ifit is to remainrelevant.

60.     Inthe future, the government needsto focus oncreatingmarket conditions for
promoting renewables, including commercialpricing and private involvement in
distribution and retailing, creating innovative and effective incentives for banking and
micro-finance schemes, and assuring the quality o f RETs.~'Moreover, the government
should take steps to clarify, simplify, harmonize, and stabilize the regulatory framework
for renewables. This can be achieved not by tryingto match the subsidies of other
programs, but by treating renewables more like typical energy sources, such as grid
electrification and petroleumproducts.

61.     The Bank needs to develop an overall strategy that integrates its approaches for
reforming the power sector and fully commercializing renewables inIndia. Thisjoint
strategy should complement the emphasis to date on macro-fiscal balancingwith the
equity considerations pertinent to renewable energy development, e.g., by further
reforming state-level regulatory agencies, improving energy access for the poor,
employing "smart subsidies", andpilotingoutput-based aid schemes.

62.     The excellent ICRwas correct inits recommendations. The renewable energy
sector program should be consistent with and embedded into the plan for power sector
reform and restructuring (however, this -and future ICRs - should follow this
recommendationand analyze project achievements within a sector reform framework).
Supportive and predictable policies and regulatory frameworks are essential for market

49. According to IREDA, as stated inAnnex D, it has recently revised its financing guidelines to enable
promoters/developers to venture into RETS.

                                                  23


development. Tariffs and power sales should be fair to all parties for sustainable
development of the sector. Although a specialized institution such as IREDAwas
essential at the beginning as new technologies were commercialized, broader
participation by the financial sector is essential ifmarket growth is to expand, which
presents new special challenges for IREDA.With respect to solar PVs, similar to rural
electrification the world over, affordable financing accessible to rural consumers is
essential for selling PV products inrural areas. Delivering rural PV services needs a
partnershipbetween key actors: rural financing institutions, producthervice suppliers,
and preferably, organized consumer groups.5o




50. IREDA notes that it has launcheda Village Electrification Programmeto address some of these issues.

a) Economicbenefits includingglobal environmentalbenefits, in the case of wind and PV includethe GEF
grant, which is $155/kW (10% of initial capital cost at appraisal)for wind, and $4.2Nvp (19% of initial capital
cost at appraisal)for PV.
b) Wind farm average EIRR is weighted by annual energy output. Similarweighting is not done for small
hydro as one large successfulsub-project skews the results.Solar lightingbenefits includethe consumer
surplusfrom improved lighting. Benefitsfrom PV pumpingfor irrigation includes additional income gained
from irrigatedcrops. Wind and small hydro economic benefitsare taken as economic cost of avoided diesel
generation as this was the basis of the economic analysis inthe SAR.
c) At appraisal,only the community drinking water optionwas considered.The applicationfinanced was for
irrigation.




51. This Annex summarizes tables "Comparison o fActual and Appraised Economic Internal Rates o f
Return" and "Comparison o f Financial Rates o f Retumand Financial Net Present Value of Investments,"
onpages 7 and 8, respectively, as well as "Annex 3. Economic Costs andBenefits" o f the ICR. Intwo
instances, however, the data providedinthe ERR table onpage 7 were inconsistent with those provided in
Annex 3. Specifically, the table onpage 7 statedthat the EIRRfor WindFarms at completion (without
GEF) was 9%, whilst the corresponding figure inAnnex 3 was 11%.Similarly, the EIRRfor SPV Village
Power at completion (with GEF) was inthe table onpage 7 14% as opposed to the 19% stated inAnnex 3.
As Annex 3 provided more complete information, we decided to usethe figures providedthere.
