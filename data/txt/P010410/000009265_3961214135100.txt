PAPERMILL EXPANSION COMPONENT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Encouraged by government incentives and a rising demand for newsprint in India, the State
Govemment of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) established Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Limited (TNPL)
in the late 1970s to undertake a program of research into the production of newsprint from sugar cane
bagasse. The objective of the undertaking was to further pilot plant development and ultimately to
build a bagasse-based newsprint mill in this major sugar growing state. The development program was
successful, and TNPL decided to proceed with a full scale commercial operation. The Bank assisted
TNPL with a loan of US$100 million through the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), and
the first mill began operation in the mid-1980s. In the early 1990s, the Bank was approached again by
TNPL for assistance to double the production capacity of the first mill. The Bank agreed to include
TNPL's project in a broader Renewable Resources Development Project which was approved by the
Board in December, 1992, and in which US$75 million was aUlocated for TNPL. This represented the
first direct Bank loan to a state-owned public enterprise in India. The TNPL expansion project was
fully commissioned in December 1995.
Evaluation of Proiect Objectives
2.    The main objectives of this project are to expand bagasse-based newsprint production to more
commercial levels and to promote environmentally sound investments to prevent depletion of India's
limited forest resources. These objectives, as well as corollary ones, have been achieved:
(a) the expanded TNPL mill can now produce newsprint at a more economically
viable capacity level,
(b) some environmental and social problems caused by the first TNPL project have
been addressed,
(c) no additional forest resources will be utilized; the whole fibrous raw material is
coming from sugar cane bagasse;



iii
(d) significant energy savings have been achieved in the paper mill and the supporting
sugar mills;
(e) bagasse newsprint technology has been further improved;
(f) use of treated effluent for irrigation is well established; and
(g) the privatization of TNPL is underway.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The project was implemented close to the planned time and budget. TNPL agreed to the use
of model bidding documents agreed with the Bank from the onset of the project, and procurement
processing, including for contracts involving two-stage tendering, was generally well conducted. Loan
disbursement was timely and completed well before loan closing date.
4.    Although there were frequent changes in top management appointed by the State Government,
these did not hinder smootn project implementation as the appointees were highly competent and well
motivated professional managers. Some delays in procurement decisions were experienced due to
further review by GOTN. As whole, strong and sustained support from the Government for the
project and to making TNPL a commercial success was evident.
5.    Environmental hazards normally associated with chemical pulping processes were addressed
vith the installation of modem chemical recovery systems for recycling of pulping chemicals,
electrostatic precipitators to control the discharge of particulate matters, a high degree of recirculation
of process water and an efficient activated sludge effluent treatment system. However, some
components of TNPL's environmental management plan (EMP) are still to be completed, including
control of odor from organic sulphur compounds, noise attenuation at the wood chipper facility, and
further improvement of handling and safety facilities for hazardous materials. Stricter enforcement of
safety standards in the plant site is also required.
6.    Although expansion of the papemAill did not involve any new displacement of population, the
operation of the first mill had adversely affected 102 families in an adjacent village as a result of
seepage from the plant's effluent lagoon and settling of coal dust from the plant. Resettlement and
rehabilitation was therefore required. TNPL was able to complete the agreed Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) in a satisfactory manner and according to schedule. The implementation of the RAP
involved, on the part of TNPL, early and regular consultation with the project affected families
(PAFs), significant involvement in the community, provision of civic amenities as well as economic
opportunities through employment and training.
7.    TNPL, with the support of farmers residing in villages adjacent to the mill site, has
implemented a unique lift irrigation system to fully exploit the treated effluent discharges from the
plant. The scheme irrigates about 1400 acres of previously arid land allowing local farmers to now
harvest two or even three crops a year compared to only a single crop.



iv
8.    TNPL's operational and financial performance has remained creditable despite the threat of
low-priced competition from imported newsprint during much of the early 1990s. Profit progressively
increased from Rs 364 million in FY1990/1991 to Rs 563 million by FY1994/1995 . The period saw
the emergence of new paper and newsprint product lines including the launching of TNPL's exports.
The Company was able to sustain and increase its dividend payments for 5 consecutive years from 15%
in FY1990/1991 to 27% in FY1994/1995, paving the way to a successful launching of its maiden issue
of shares to the public in November 1995, thus reducing GOTN's shareholdings from 49% to 35%.
Project Sustainability
9.    The project enjoys most of the requirements for long-term sustainability arising from a firm
raw material base; growing domestic and intemational markets; world-class plant built on an excellent
site; and, above all, a dedicated and highly competent management and staff. Once outstanding
environmental and safety issues have been addressed, the environmental sustainability of the project
would be assured.
Performance by Bank and the Borrower
10.   The Bank's performance on this project was satisfactory. Changes in Bank staff assigned to
prepare and process the loan did not hinder efficient appraisal and supervision of the project. The
Borrower's performance at all stages has been exemplary.
Lessons Learned
11.   The key lesson learned is the obvious one that a project which has all the basic ingredients for a
successful industrial project and is well prepared by an experienced and committed client, has a good
chance of success.
12.   The use of innovative and pioneering technology in developing countries is a suitable basis for
Bank-financed projects provided the technology has been thoroughly researched. Bank support for
similar bagasse-based newsprint production in other countries with limited forest resources can help
reduce and manage technological risks and pave entry of the technology into the commercial
mainstream for private investments.
13.   Early agreement in use of model bidding documents, in this case by pre-appraisal stage,
significantly facilitated procurement processing and disbursements.
14.   In-house design by borrower of a RAP acceptable to the Bank resulted in a high degree of
management resolve to complete the RAP as per design and within the original schedule.
15.    To ensure their long-term sustainability, technology innovations and investments in state-of-
the-art industrial machinery and equipment should be accompanied by state-of-the-art environmental
and safety management systems.

RENEWABLE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN NO.3544-IN)
TAMIL NADU NEWSPRINT AND PAPERS LIMITED
PAPERMILL EXPANSION COMPONENT
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Introduction
1.    Faced with declining forest resources and increasing demand for paper, especially newsprint,
the Government of India (GOI) in the late 1970s launched a program of incentives to encourage the
use of alternative and renewable raw materials for the production of pulp and paper. The Government
of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) took up the challenge and in April 1979 incorporated the Tamil Nadu
Newsprint and Papers Limited (TNPL) to explore the possibility of producing newsprint from sugar
cane bagasse. This was an ambitious program given that success in similar attempts had eluded the
world's pulp and paper industry for several decades. TNPL, in cooperation with a large USA paper
machinery manufacturer with a strong research base, undertook an extensive program of investigation
of past attempts by the industry to use bagasse for newsprint production and undertook an imaginative
pilot plant operation which ultimately lead to a successful process. TNPL decided to proceed with a
full-scale commercial development and approached the Bank for financial assistance. In 1981, the Bank
approved a US$100 million loan to help finance the TNPL mill at Pugalur which proved to be
financially and economically successful, and for the most part proved the technical feasibility of
producing newsprint from bagasse. Although some technical shortcomings were observed in this
pioneering process, the experience gained through the first decade of operation of TNPL was
sufficiently successful to encourage TNPL to plan a second mill in which technical improvements
learned in the first operation would be advanced.
2.    The scope and objectives of TNPL's expansion program were compatible with a project being
investigated at the time by the Bank and GOI to encourage development through the utilization of
renewable resources. The Bank agreed to explore TNPL's project as part of a renewable resources
project which also included small-hydro, solar, and wind electrical generation. One of the first steps in
the Bank's involvement in TNPL's expansion was to convince the Company to take the financially and
technically more secure route of doubling the existing operation rather than building a green field plant.
TNPL agreed to this approach as well as to launching a public issue of its shares in order to attract
private sector participation.



2
Project Objectives
3.    The objectives outlined in the SAR of the Renewable Resources Project which specifically
relate to the TNPL component are:
* to expand bagasse-based newsprint production to more commercial levels;
* to promote environrnentally sound investments to prevent depletion of India's limited
forest resources; and
* to reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels.
4.    While the above are the three specific objectives noted in the SAR, there are several other
objectives which justified the Bank's involvement in the TNPL component, including:
* improvement of bagasse newsprint technology for use in other developing countries,
* to further the use of pulpmill effluent for irrigation;
* more efficient utilization of the Bank-financed first stage TNPL plant;
* correction of certain environmental and social shortcomings of the first project;
* reduction in the volume of newsprint imports and in GOI's control over the import,
pricing, and distribution of newsprint, and
* privatization of TNPL such that within one year after completion of the project at the
latest, GOTN's shareholdings would be reduced from 490/o to 26%.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    This project has been successful in achieving the first objective stated in the SAR, i.e., to
expand production of bagasse-based newsprint to more commercial levels. The expanded mill is now
capable of producing 100,000 tpy of good quality newsprint using 100% bagasse pulp, leaving the
original mill to concentrate on the production of 80,000 tpy of printing and writing paper. These levels
of production achieve economy of scale in this highly capital intensive industry. It must be pointed out
that at the time of preparation of this ICR, the expanded mill is still undergoing commissioning, and has
therefore not operated for sustained periods at design level. However, based on the experience of the
original mill, which operates consistently at greater than 100% of design level, no difficulties are
anticipated in bringing the new facilities quickly up to full capacity. Furthermore, the expanded mill,
with two paper machines and appropriate pulping and ancillary equipment, is now able to fully utilize
all installed equipment. Previously, the mill produced altemately newsprint or printing and writing
paper, and extensive sections of the mill were alternately superfluous and were not operated -- clearly a
waste of capital resources.
6.    The second objective listed in the SAR has been largely achieved, as the doubling of
production puts no additional demand on India's limited forest resources, the pulp for paper making
being produced 100% from bagasse using both chemical and mechanical pulping processes.
Resettlement of families adversely affected under the first plant operation was satisfactorily completed.
Most of the environmental hazards normally associated with chemical pulping processes have been



3
properly addressed, with the instaDation of modem chemical recovery systems for re-cycling of pulping
chemicals, electrostatic precipitators to control the discharge of particulate material to the atmosphere,
a high degree of re-circulation of process water, and an efficient activated sludge effluent treatment
system. A safety audit of the chlorine and caustic lye systems was conducted, and systems
modifications made based on the audit recommendations. A disaster management contingency plan
was developed and fire and chlorine mock drills conducted. Nevertheless, a number of environmental
issues remain outstanding relating to control of odor from organic sulphur compounds, noise
attenuation, enforcement of safety standards and general goodhousekeeping.
7.    The third objective stated in the SAR, to reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels,
is more directly relevant to the other components of the Renewable Resources Development Project
than it is to TNPL. However, the overall concept of TNPL is energy efficient and improves energy
consumption in a number of ways. First, sugar mills bum bagasse to produce steam for use in their
own manufacturing process, but as the energy potential from the volume of bagasse is higher than the
energy requirements, sugar mills are traditionally energy inefficient and burn bagasse to dispose of it,
generating steam without regard to efficient boiler operation, and generally paying little attention to
energy conservation in the sugar manufacturing process. However, there is a growing awareness of
the potential for energy improvement in the sugar industry with resulting financial benefits, and inspired
largely by the increased interest in bagasse for pulping, specifically the demands of TNPL, a number of
sugar mills have instituted energy saving measures to allow a reduction in the amount of bagasse used
for fuel, thus providing a surplus for sale to the paper industry. TNPL takes advantage of this surplus
and purchases part of its bagasse requirements from this source. However, the main supply of bagasse
for TNPL is provided by a program of fuel replacement in the sugar mills. TNPL has installed efficient
multi-fuel boilers at specific sugar mills within a suitable economic radius of its paper mill and provides
these sugar mills with a reliable supply of steam generated from coal, lignite, and the non-fibrous pith
portion of bagasse, in exchange for the sugar mills' entire production of de-pithed bagasse.
Furthermore, use of fossil fuels is minimized within the TNPL mill itself a major source of energy is
the steam produced in the chemical recovery boiler which uses as its primary fuel the non-fibrous
organic material removed from the bagasse during chemical pulping. Also, pith removed from bagasse
on-site is used as part of the fuel in the power boilers. Co-generation is practiced to the maximum
extent possible, with more than 73% of the mill's electrical requirements being produced on-site in
extraction turbines, thereby minimizing the demands on grid power generated from fossil fuel.
Furthermore, although it was not a direct component of the paper mill expansion project, TNPL has
installed a 15 MW windfarm which further reduces the Company's dependence on the grid.
8.    Various other objectives of the project, not specifically itemized in the SAR, have also for the
most part been achieved:
improving the technology for bagasse-based newsprint production is a continuing process
which will be greatly enhanced by the flexible process flow scheme provided in the
expanded mill which will allow commercial-scale experimentation to be carried out during
normal production runs. Already after only two months of commissioning the plant,
TNPL has demonstrated its ability to produce good quality newsprint from 100% bagasse
fiber (including up to 50% mechanical bagasse pulp) at speeds of greater than 725 m/min--
the first time this has been achieved anywhere in the world.



4
* as indicated earlier, the expanded plant can now make continuous use of all equipment
installed, as there is no need to alternate production between two products which use
different parts of the installed equipment.
* some unforeseen environmental and social problems which arose during the first project
have now been corrected.
* India is self sufficient in all major grades of paper except newsprint for which about half of
the country's consumption of some 500,000 tpy is imported. Thus the increased
production of newsprint by TNPL results in a significant reduction in foreign exchange
expenditures. Furthermore, the ongoing dialogue with the GOI during the course of the
TNPL project has led to a relaxation in GOI control over import canalization and
newsprint pricing. Today's newsprint price is market driven and influenced by free imports.
* TNTPL in November 1995 issued 20 million shares to the public and the Company is now
listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. This issue of shares to the public has now reduced
the GOTN's equity from 49 to 35%.
Implementation Record
9.    The project was to be implemented over a period of three years and four months, from
January 1992 to April 1995. The commissioning of the paper machine was delayed by about five
months and overall project conmissioning by eight months. The loan was fully disbursed in August
1995, well before the loan closing date.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors Subject to Government Control.
10.   Appoinitment of Corporate Officers. During the course of project design and implementation,
three different IAS Officers held the appointment of Managing Director of TNPL, and two of these
were also Chairman of the Company. All of these appointees have been highly competent and well
motivated professional managers, and in spite of these changes in top management, the implementation
of the project has proceeded smoothly.
11.   Procurement. Although ostensibly the sole responsibility for procurement was lodged with
TNPL, procurement decisions were subject to GOTN approval, at least for major packages. In
several instances there was extended delay in submitting procurement documents to the Bank for
clearance. This did not, however, unduly delay the planned implementation schedule. In general,
procurement processing went smoothly and in many cases, the period between bid opening and
actual contract award was kept within six months.



5
Factors Subject to Implementing Azencv Control
12.   Corporate Culture and Project Management. The middle management of the Company,
particularly those directly associated with project implementation, is made up of highly experienced and
competent professionals most of whom have been with TNPL since the beginning of the first project.
The existence of this core group, supported by a committed and enthusiastic, albeit changing, top
management, has been a major influence on the successfill design and implementation of this project.
Implementation has been mostly trouble-free, and the project has been completed essentially on
schedule and close to the original budget.
13.   Engagement of Engineering Consultants. A key factor in getting the project started in an
orderly and timely manner was the engagement by TNPL of a qualified consultancy firm for the
preparation of detailed engineering and costing, provision of procurement services including
preparation of tender documents, and supervision of plant construction and erection.
14.   EnvironmentalManagement. Under the project, capacity of the effluent treatment plant has
been augmented to treat additional effluent and to improve the treatment system as a whole in order to
meet the State Pollution Control Board standards for surface water discharge. Accordingly,
complaints from NGOs about TNPL's non-compliance with environmental regulations, specifically
having to do with the discharge of effluent to irrigation canals have been addressed. While most of the
elements of TNPL's environmental management plan (EMP) agreed to with the Bank during project
appraisal have been completed or are on-going, a number of mitigation measures have yet to be
effected. Odor control through the burning of sulphur compounds in the lime reburning kiln has not
yet begun. The lime kiln itself is still on order for delivery in July 1996. Noise reduction from the
wood chipper has not been addressed, although TNPL has expressed the opinion that this issue has
been over-emphasized by the Bank. Handling of hazardous materials needs to be further improved and
installation of chlorine safety equipment completed. In this connection, the disaster management plan
ably developed by TNPL should serve as foundation on which TNPL can build its environmental,
health and safety management and loss prevention program.
15.   Resettlement. Although expansion of the papermill did not involve any new displacement of
population, the operation of the first mill had adversely affected 102 families in an adjacent village as
result of seepage from the plant's effluent lagoon and settling of coal dust from the plant. Resettlement
and rehabilitation was therefore required. TNPL was able to complete the agreed Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) in a satisfactory manner and according.to the six-month schedule. The implementation of
the RAP involved, on the part of TNPL, early and regular consultation with the project affected
families (PAFs), significant involvement in the community and provision of employment opportunities,
scholarships, health services and civic amenities.
16.   Social Aspects. TNPL, with the support of farmers residing in villages adjacent to the mill site,
has implemented a unique lift irrigation system to fully exploit the treated effluent discharges from the
plant. The scheme irrigates about 1400 acres of previously arid land and potentially another 3,000 to
4,000 acres, allowing local farmers to now harvest two or even three crops a year compared to only a
single crop. The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is monitoring the effect of usage of effluent
waters for irrigation over a 5-year period (1993 to 1998). In addition, TNPL has chosen to provide



6
drinking water taps throughout the irrigation area as part of its community and public health service
efforts.
17.   Operational and Financial Performance. TNPL's performance has remained creditable from
time of project appraisal despite the threat of low-priced competition from imported newsprint during
much of the early 1990s. Profit progressively increased from Rs 364 million in 1991 to Rs 563 million
by 1995. The Company was able to sustain and increase its dividend payments for 5 consecutive years
paving the way to a successful launching of its maiden issue of shares to the public in November 1995.
In addition, TNPL has been rated as FAAA (F-Triple A Highest Safety) for its Fixed Deposit Scheme
by Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd. (CRISIL).
18.   Privatization. A loan covenant aimed at the privatization of TNPL states that the Company
will sell shares to the public on or before October 1994 to bring the GOTN shareholding to a minority
level, and within one year of achieving commnercial production, will have reduced the GOTN's share to
26%. Market entry was delayed by a year to allow TNPL to comply with the new rules for listing of
shares in the stock exchanges. Moreover, to improve the earnings per share ratio and help attract
investors to pay a premium of Rs 100 per share, TNPL restructured its capital by reducing its equity
base from Rs 982 million to Rs 500 million effective June 9, 1995. TNPL's shares are now quoted on
the Bombay and Madras Stock Exchanges. TNPL is concemed that selling another large block of
GOTN shares to reach the objectives of the loan covenant within the stated time period would have an
adverse impact on the share price and have sought Bank agreement to delay the process. The Bank
has agreed that TNPL need not unload more shares on or before December 31, 1996 if the market
prospects are poor, provided TNPL informs the Bank by December 31, 1996 regarding its alternative
plan for further divestment of GOTN's shares.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.   Since its inception in 1979, TNPL has been well managed by experienced senior IAS
executives and operated by highly experienced technical and business managers and staff. By the early
1990s TNPL has been hailed in the Indian business community as one of the most successful paper
producing company in India. The management has shown skill and imagination in making the first
project a financial and technical success, even in the face of several years of drastic decline in the
world's pulp and paper industry when supplies far exceeded demand and low priced imports,
particularly from the former Soviet Union and other eastem bloc countries, were in direct competition
with TNPL in the domestic market. Having survived this difficult period and now profitably operating
the first project at greater than design capacity, there is every reason to expect TNPL will continue to
be successful with the expansion project. This view is supported by the facts that TNPL has a sound
raw material base, an ever-increasing domestic and international market for newsprint, world-class
manufacturing facilities including modern environmental protection equipment, and above all, a
dedicated and skilled management and staff However, to further ensure the project's long-term
sustainability, completion of the outstanding components of the EMP is required.
20.   Having brought prosperity to the ruraVagricultural community in which it operates, and
equitably settled some social conflicts which developed during initial operation, TNPL now enjoys the



7
enthusiastic support of the community because of the many social and economic improvements it has
brought.
21.   Newsprint is a politically sensitive commodity in India and it has suffered in the past from price
controls and import regulation from the GOI. However such controls have now been lifted and
newsprint producers operate in a totally free market situation. The major world producers of
newsprint, such as the Canadian and US companies, are the only long-term threat to TNPL (and other
Indian producers) as they are very efficient low-cost producers which have free access to the Indian
market. While TNPL is large by Indian standards, and has proven its financial and economic feasibility,
it is still a relatively high-cost producer compared to the world leaders because of its relatively high
capital cost per ton of production and it needs to rely on a non-conventional and comparatively high-
priced raw material. On the other hand, TNPL's competitive position is supported by low distribution
cost to the domestic and selected export markets, and by low labor costs and efficient manufacturing
cost control.
22.   In summary, upon completion of remaining environmental mitigation measures, the project
financed by Loan 3544-TN is fully sustainable without fuirther Bank involvement, and the plant is
expected to have an economic life of at least 30 years.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
23.   Following the successful early operation of TNPL's first project financed by the Bank, TNPL
approached the Bank anew for financial assistance to expand. This request came during a period when
the Bank was moving away from industrial lending. However, as the first project had been somewhat
risky in its technical concept but was proving to be successful and of great potential benefit to the paper
industry in other developing countries, and spurred by the satisfactory performance of TNPL in the first
project, a follow-up lending operation seemed justified. Identification and preparation missions were
therefore launched and a successful dialogue ensued between the Bank and TNPL in which TNPL and
GOTN, agreed with the Bank's suggestion to drop plans for a major green field mill at a new site in
favor of an expansion of the original TNPL mill. At the Bank's request, TNPL revised its plans and
prepared detailed feasibility studies for the new concept. In the midstream of project preparation,
there was a change in Bank staff assigned to the project due to a departmental reorganization.
However, the transition went smoothly and the change did not delay the project preparation or
appraisal which speaks well of the competency and flexibility of both the Bank and TNPL staff. One
constant which helped this transition was the technical staff on both the Borrower and Bank sides who
were continuously involved in the first project and in the development of the expansion project.
24.   An excellent rapport developed between the Bank and TNPL during the course of project
preparation and execution, allowing issues to be resolved promptly including obtaining a pro-active
response from TNPL in preparing and expeditiously implementing a RAP. There were minor
disagreements on some procurement issues, several of which reached the stage of formal objections
from suppliers through Executive Directors to Bank management. These were all quickly and
thoroughly reviewed and resolved through the Regional and Central Procurement Advisors. On some
stages of the environmental program, Bank regional staff took stronger positions than the technical



8
project staff, but no serious conflicts arose and the Bank was able to present a consistent position to
TNPL.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
25.   The Borrower's performance throughout all stages of this project has been highly satisfactory.
The management and staff have shown a high degree of professionalism, dedication to the project,
flexibility to change, and a willingness to fulfill all of the Bank's requirements and requests. The project
implementation unit established by TNPL, in cooperation with their Indian consulting engineers,
demonstrated an unusually high degree of project implementation skills including the development of
basic engineering design concepts, preparation of engineering drawings, procurement documents,
evaluation of tenders, cost control, equipment inspections, scheduling and supervision of erection, and
commissioning of the plant for commercial operation. TNPL provided comprehensive and timely
progress reports from which it was possible for the Bank to know at any given time at which stage
each contract, both Bank-financed and non-Bank-financed, was in. TNPL's project team was strongly
committed to completing the project at the earliest possible time, as management sent out clear signals
that every delay meant lost revenue and profit to the company.
26.   Financial management of the project has been completely satisfactory, with the Bank loan being
fully disbursed within 3 quarters of the date estimated in the SAR, and well ahead of the original loan
closing date. Provision of local currency funding and foreign exchange requirements in excess of the
Bank loan amount was not a problem at any time.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
27.   The project has achieved all its major objectives except the sale of a majority of shares to the
public, which is expected to be executed within the first or second year of commercial operation of the
expanded plant. The overall outcome of the project is judged to be highly satisfactory. A reassessment
of the Economnic Rate of Return, given in Table 9, indicates the intemal econornic rate of return of
26.6% which is close to that estimated at time of appraisal of 28.7%
H. FUTURE OPERATION
28.   The expanded TNPL mill can be expected to reach its full capacity within two years. It should
be noted that an average pulp and paper mill in an industrialized country would normally require about
three years from commissioning to full capacity operation. TNPL is expected to better this average
because it is an expansion of a successfully operating similar plant and because it is managed and
operated by highly skilled and dedicated professionals who have demonstrated their ability in the first
project and who are committed to the success of the second project.
29.   In view of the continually increasing demand for newsprint and the availability of bagasse in
this major sugar-growing state of India, TNPL is already in the process of developing another
newsprint production facility. The existing plant site at Pugalur is probably not capable of supporting



9
more expansion because of the limitation of sugar production within an economic radius for delivery of
bagasse. TNPL is therefore looking at a green field operation in the South Arcot district of Tamil
Nadu. The mill could have great potential for developing further the concept of bagasse-based
newsprint production by incorporating a more integrated approach to development with renewable
resources by locating sugar and paper production facilities on the same site, possibly including a co-
generation power plant, or include additional by-products such as industrial alcohol. Such an
operation could prove to be a good demonstration plant worthy of IFC financing.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
30.   This project has been essentially trouble-free, and the main lesson learned is the obvious one
that a project well prepared by an experienced client which involves all the basic ingredients for a
successful industrial project, namely raw material supply, markets, good plant and technology, and
capable management and staff, will succeed.
31.   As was the case in the first TNPL project, the use of innovative and pioneering technology in
developing countries is a suitable basis for Bank-financed projects, provided the technology has been
thoroughly researched and especially if there is a technical fall-back position. In this case, if newsprint
production from bagasse would have failed, the fall-back is to make printing and writing paper, the
technology for which is well established, and which in fact is financially more attractive. Bank support
for similar bagasse-based newsprint production in other countries with limited forest resources can help
reduce and manage technological risks and pave entry of the technology into the commercial
mainstream for private investments.
32.   Early agreement on model tender documents, in this case by pre-appraisal, significantly
facilitated procurement processing, timely equipment delivery, and disbursements.
33.   The effort, comnmitment and goodwill invested by TNPL in preparing a resettlement and
rehabilitation action plan for the PAFs have resulted in its smooth and speedy implementation.
Although not specifically stated as objectives of this essentially industrial project, there has been a
substantial achievement of poverty reduction through the direct and indirect employment generated and
relocation of a village of some 600 individuals to a new community with better housing, electricity,
water, and sanitation, as well as through the provision of irrigation facilities and waters to neighboring
communities. The positive and long-term benefits derived from these project externalities make for
sustainable industrial development.
34.   To ensure their long-term sustainability, technology innovations and investments in
state-of-the-art industrial machinery and equipment should be accompanied by state-of-the-art
environmental and safety management systems. Agreement to a comprehensive EMP and
frequent reporting by borrower on its status, supplemented by regular follow-up visits by
Bank's environmental specialists, helped ingrained within the borrower's corporate culture the
importance of industrial safety and environmental management.

Dear Mr. Das:
India: Renewable Resources Development Project
TNPL Papermill Expansion Component (Ln3S44-IN)
Thank vou for the cooperation extended bv vou and vour staff to the Bank mission that
visitcd TNPL last month. I am confirming the mission's findings as presented in the attached aide
memoirc. \Ve are pleased to note that the Bank loan was fullv disbursed weil within the loan
closing date. the project fullv commissioned in December 1995 and that production of newspnnt
from 1 000/) bagasse pulp has been achieved. We trust that due attention would be given bv TNPL
to furthcr improving the plant's cnvironmental performance.
We also congratulate TNPL for its successful maiden issue of shares to the public. We
urge that the Companv continue to invite the private sector to participate in its current and future
operations to help sustain the commercial discipline fostered in TNPL. We recognize that further
dilution of shares held by the State Government of Tamil Nadu to 26 % of the total capital base
should bc timed based on market conditions favorable to TNPL. The Bank would nevertheless like
to be informed on or before December 1, 1996 as to TNPL's proposed plans for further public
issuc of shares to achieve the agreed level of disinvestment by the State.
Mav I rciterate our earlier invitation to you to visit the Bank to present TNPL's
technological and commercial achievements as well as the social benefits to the area's farming
commnunitv that have emerged from TNPL's operations.
Because of their interest in the project, we are furnishing a copy of this letter and aide
memoire to the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
Sincereiy,

[NDIA:RENEWABLE RESOURCES PROJECT
TNPL EXPANSION COMPONENT
Implementation Completion Report Mission
AIDE-MEMOrRE
I      A mission consisting of Messrs A Picardi and R. Chalk. consultants to the World Bank, separatelv
visited TNPL at corporate headquarters m Madras and the rmil site at Pugalar during the second half of February
1996. to finalize an Implementauon Completion Report (ICR) for this project. The Borrower's contribution to the
ICR %%as received. The mission would like to thank TNPL for its hospitalitv and cooperation during our visit
with the Companv. This Aide-Memoire records the main points discussed, and is subject to confirmation by
Bank management.
Project Performance
2.     The cxpandcd paper nuil is now opcrational. havmg been fuflv commissioned on 31 December 1995,
compared %%ith the original target date recorded in the SAR of 30 Apnl 1995. Reasons for tius relatively mmor
delav are given in the borrower's contribution to the ICR. Commercial production of paper from the new paper
mnachine was declared on 31 Januarv 1996.
3.     The nussion confirmed that the main technical objectives of the project, specifically the doubling of
capacity. and the production of newsprint from 100% bagasse pulp, have been achieved. A trial run lasting 18
hours was made in earlv Februarv m which newsprint was produced contmuously with 40% mechanical bagasse
pulp (MBP) and 60% chemical bagasse pulp (CBP). During the mission, under the observation of the Bank
consultant. thc paper machine ran continuously for 5 hours at a speed of 725 mn/rin with a MBP/CBP ratio of
40/60. then at 50/50, with no breaks or anv other untoward operational problem. (The tnal was terminated only
due to lack of power from the gnd which restncted the production of the MBP plant to 50% capacity). The
production of nexvsprit wvth this pulp furrush and at this speed. is a remarkable achievement which to the
knowledge of the Bank. has never been accomplished in the world.
4.     Certainly the abilitv of the machine to handle the bagasse furnish appears to be established, although it
should be noted that the machine guarantee states a 48 hour continuous run at 850 rn/min and the guarantee trials
are not scheduled until April, 1996. Also, it must be noted that while the qualitv of newsprint produced in these
trials is very good. the inherent characteristics of bagasse fiber result in certain quality challenges: brightness and
light scattermg are lower than top qualitv softwood newsprint, porosity is low which leads to low ink
consumption requirng adjustment in the pressroom, and the sheet exhibits a degree of two-sidedness unexpected
in a twin wire former. A brief test rcport is attached which compares the bagasse newspnnt made during the
mussion with top qualitv newspnnt from two Canadian producers.
5.     The mission would like to congratulate TNPL for its achievement in advancmg the science of paper
making. Without detracting from this tnbute. the mission pomnted out to TNPL that it must contmue to develop
the technology of bagasse newsprint production in order to improve on the qualitv shortcomings and to increase
even further thc use of mechanical bagasse pulp and paper machine running speed. TNPL assured the rmission
that thev are committed to continuing the development of the process. The Bank requested that although the
Projcct is completc. that the Bank be penodically informed of further developments. TNPL agreed that it would
send brief rcports to the Bank about everv sLx months.

Environmental Performance
While the rcview of thc environmental aspects of the project ndicatcd a generallv acceptable situation
(scv ,Anncx tor dctails). scvcral arcas remain in need of further attention as summarizcd below:
. Lcaking gate vaives at the lift irrigation svstem are causing about 30% of the effluent waters to be wasted.
*   Buming of TRS is awaiting installation of the lime kiln.
*  No progress has becn made on wood chipper noise.
v  No additional firc protection has bcen installed in the paper wvarehouse--this is a conscious decision
of TNPL based on their cost/benefit analvsis.
*  Hazardous matenal handling sull needs improvement.
* Chlorine safet, equipment is not fullv installed.
*  A problem is developing with solid waste disposal. This wvll be largely cleared up when the lime
kiln Is installed and lime mud will be re-cvcled on site instead of being stored on site prior to sale to
cement factones. 1"he other mnajor solid waste is the portion of pith from the bagasse which is
surpius to that consumed a:; fuel. TNPL is exploring with others the possibilitv of converting this
matcrial for agrncultural usc.
7      TTNPL itn its ICR report has expressed the opinion that some of the mmor environmental issues. such as
chipper noise. havc probablv been over-emphasized bv the Bank.
irrigation Scheme Dlevelopment
8      Thc mission noted the success of the TNPL-supported lift imgation system which allows use of treated
effluent by the local farmers. The transformation of previously idle land to a productive green area is very
imprcssive.  The trussion suggested that the entire scheme of lift irimgation. including the institutional
arrangements with farmers, financmg, and the agnrcultural results as confirmed by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural
Univcrsitv. should be formallv documented in a technical paper for presentation to some appropriate intenational
forum. perhaps through FAO. This imgation aspect of the project is equally interesting to the paper industr
world-wide as is the bagasse ncvsprint production.
Privatization oJ T7N'PL
9.     The loan covenant covenng the privatization of TNPL is being complied with. Through a public issue of
new shares, the Government's share of TNPL's ownership has now been reduced from 49% to 35%. TNPL
pointed out that to reduce this to 26% by the end of 1996, as required in the loan covenant, might be difficult
Without causing a severe drop in share price. TNPL requests the Bank to agree to delaying further dilution of the
Govemment share. The mission will bring this request to the attention of Bank management.
Future  Projeas
1 0.    TNPL rc-ported to the nmission that thev are in the early stages of a further expansion and have completed
a teasibliltv study of a new plant to be located in South Arcot district of Tamilnadu. TNPL will formallv request
participation of IBRD -n this expinsion. The mission pointed out that further World Bank participation in such a
project is unlkely, bcut will advise Bank management of TNPL's intention to make a request.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
The following is a brief ficld report of the site survev concemnng environmenta issues at TNPL. conducted
Februarv 16 and 17. 1996 by Mr/ A Picardi. The status of environmental issues brought out on previous site
visits is reviewed below. with some additional observauons. Photographic documentation was made of the new
structurcs on the plant site. areas of environmental and safetv interest, and the resettlement village.
1.     The activated sludee wastewater treatment svstem is now operational, and monrtoring indicates effluent
is now *wcll wvithin permitted linuts. A copy of recent sampling data is attached.
2.     The lift irneation svstem is fullv operational and the productivitv of farms in the irrgation area Is quitc
improved Thc gate valves at the pumphousc were observed to be leaking about 30%o of the effluent stream to
dischargc, and not the imgation system. This is a simple problem that should be repaired in a timel manner.
Although the plant effluent now meets irrigation standards. there have been complaints to the World Bank in the
past conceming this discharge.
3.     Potable water is also supplied to points in the irrigation area. The spigots for these points are stolen and
not rcplaced, in some places wvooden plugs have been isertca into the open pipe. TNPL pumps potable wNater
supplies to these pouits and to the resettlement village two hours m the mornung and evemni;g
4.     Bumme of TRS in the lime kiln for odor control has not yet begun: the lime kiln is on order, and TRS
incineration is part of the package for the kiln as ordered. The kln deliverv is to begin, Julv '96, with erectien
estimatcd to take 8 months. completion should be by February, 1997
Noise from the wvood chipper has not been addressed. and it ran all night everv rnght while the mission
was on site.
6.     No additional fire suppression svstem has been installed in the paper warehouse  There are hoses and a
fire water header around the periphery and down the center, and a heat detector on one wall. According to TNPL
the cost/benefit of a fire versus loss of paper stock from a maffinctioring automated (spnnkleri system favors the
current svstem: in addition they pomt out that the wiarehouse is manned during all three shifts.
7      Hazardous materials handline is still in need of improvement. Contaiment dikes around the caustic
process area are not yet complete. the emergencv showers and esvewash stations are still located within the dikes,
wherc spillage is likely to occur Thle mission observed a caustic loading operation from truck to process tanki m
which the operator had bare feet and legs, and wore no protective equipment to guard agairst chcmical burns.
The drains placcd for pump seal water removal crcate a breach in the contauiment arca. a spill overtopping these
pump scal wvater rcmoval drain opemngs. located 3 inches off the ground would draLri directlv out of the
containrnent area.
X      The acid and caustic loading and storage areas at the DM plant are In need of renovation for safety and
spll control The acid and caustic tanks are diked: but the dikes are breached by open drains to the neutrali7aticn
pit. The dike breaches should be closed and valves fitted for controlled rainwater release. The truck loading area

should havc a spill contaunment apron. and check valves should bc fitted in the tank loading lines to prevent
backflow. A fibcrglass overhcad acid pipeline is supported bv a section of pipe here. the support is not attached at
top or bottom. this poscs a scnous potential of spill. Tlic caustic tank overflow vent empues into the acid tank
contamment arca. and should be placed to overflow into the caustic containment area. The acid tank overflow
vents arc not equippcd with vapor traps and pose an injurv threat during loading operations. There is no
protectivc clothing kcpt in this arca for loading operations or spill control. A spill cleanup pump with hose should
be kept in the area. Housekeeping is poor in this area and there is debns within the acid and caustic containment
dikes.
9.      The plant is under full operation: but the chlorine safetv. leak detection and spill control equipment
installation is not vet complete. The neutralization column has not been installed. The rupture disks, with release
to the milk of lime tank have not been installed. The leak stemming gear was reportedlv inside a box in the
chlorine handling arca: but no one had the kev. There currentlv is one leak detector and alarm placed incorrectlv
4 feet off the ground in the chlorine handling area. In addition there currently are two sets of SCUBA gear in the
chlorine handling area. plus backups in the safety office. The chlorine emergency equipment includes respirators,
but no protectivc clothing. A windsock has been placed here. but is not visible from the area surrounding the
chlorine handling area. Thlie potable water chlorine dosing station is reported to have SCUBA. but no leak
stemrmng gcar or protective clothing.
10.    Disposal of solid waste is quicklv becomingz a problem. There are hundreds of tons of bagasse pith,
bagasse pith sludge from anaerobic trcatment, lime and activated treatment sludge stockpiled in the plant area.
As yet no senous efforts have been made to develop and implement an environmentally acceptable disposal
method. with the exception of the lime waste. Lime waste is taken off site for recycling.
II.    Housckccping is poor throughout the plant, posing manv hazards to those on foot, especially at night.
There are manv incompletelv covered trenches. open trenches. and a great deal of construction debris throughout
the facilitv.
12.    Contractors arc often barefoot, and safety helmets are not worn. Only one welding gas bottle was
observed to be equipped with a proper doliv out of over a dozen observed throughout the plant.

TAMIL NADU NEWSPRINT AND PAPERS LIMITED
BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Introduction
TAMIL NADU NEWSPRINT AND PAPERS LTD (TNPL) embarked upon an expansion
project to augment its production capacity to 180,000 tonnes of Newsprint/Paper annually from the current
level of 90,000 tonnes. As in the original plant, the expansion too is conceived to utilize bagasse as the
principal raw material, but this time, 100% bagasse pulp is intended to be used for production of
Newsprint.
Project Scope
The project is aimed at doubling of the mill capacity to 180,000 tonnes annually. Of this, 100,000
tonnes will be Newsprint and the remaining un-coated Printing and Writing papers. While the existing
Paper Machine (PM 1) will be dedicated to production of Printing and Writing papers, the proposed Paper
Machine (PM 2) will be used for making Newsprint. The furnish mix for production of Newsprint consists
of 60% chemical bagasse pulp and 40% mechanical bagasse pulp.      e
The expansion project also featured revamping of the existing mechanical bagasse pulp line to meet
the pulp requirements of PM 2.
The other key features of the Project are:
* Bagasse handling system of capacity 3000,000 typ.
C Chemical bagasse pulping street of 240 od tpd capacity.
* Chemical Recovery plant to handle the additional Black liquor.
*   Augmentation of utilities to support the expanded capacitv.
Project Cost and Financing Pattern
The project cost as appraised during the Bank's mission held in July 1992 was Rs.5,250 million
(Eq. US$ 172 million @ IUS$ = Rs.30.50). The loan drawal pattern as envisaged in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) vis-a-vis the actual drawal is as follows:
Period               Estimated in SAR      Actual (In Million US$)
Jan 93 - Jun 93              18.0                 13.13
Jul 93 - Dec 93             20.0                   4.15
Jan 94 - Jun 94             20.0                   4.99
Jul 94 - Dec 94              12.0                 43.90
Jan 95 - Jun 95              5.0                   5.69
Jul 95 - Dec 95      --   ** 3.14
** The drawal was completed on August 18, 1995.

The country-wise procurement of Plant and Machinery utilizing the Bank loan is as follows:
Countrv             In Million US$        %
Germany              41.12                55

Total                75.00                100
The project cost estimated in the SAR was Rs.5250 million. As of 31st December 1995, the
project cost stands revised to Rs.6113 million. The increase in the Project cost was mainly due to rupee
depreciation against USD and increase in debt burden on account of basket of currencies.
Capital Restructure and Revision in Financing Pattem
At the time of availing the loan of USD 75 million from World Bank, the share capital of the
Company was Rs.981.80 million (98.18 million shares of Rs. 10/- each). Subsequent to this, and with the
approval obtained from the Members of the Company in the General Meeting, Creditors including IBRD,
the Company has reduced its share capital to Rs.500 million (consisting of 50 million shares of Rs. 10/-
each).
The company issued 20 million shares of Rs. 10/- each at the premium of Rs. I 00/- per share to the
public during November, 1995.

Proiect Implementation
T*NPL appointed SPB Projects and Consultancv Limited. Madras (SPB-PC) as Engineering
consultants for the Project. The Zero date was reckoned from November 17, 1991. Subsequently, due to
delay in finalization of procurcrment procedures, the Zero date was shifted to February 1, 1992. With
implementation period as 40 months from Zero date.
As per the schedule, the Paper Machine manufacturing was to commence on October 01, 1992 and
delivery was to complete by end August 1994. However, the Paper machine was actually ordered on
March 03, 1993 resulting in a delay of 5 months. There was delay in ordering of Paper Machine due to
High priced offers received against the bid and TNPL, at one stage even considered for rebid with revised
specifications to avoid cost over run of the project.
The Basic Engineering to fix the capacities of major items of Plant and Machinery was initially
taken up and completed on time to proceed with the procurement activities of major ICB packages that are
long delivery items.
In the mean time, the upgradations carried out on the PM I resulted in improved productivity of the
machine house. As a result, the entire Basic Engineering for the upstream plants and utilities was reviewed
mid-way through and the capacities of these facilities reworked. There was thus overall delay in
completion of the Basic Engineering activity and ordering of plant and machinery.
Notwithstanding the initial delays, efforts were put in for scheduling trials of Paper machine with
Purchased pulp by end April 1995. In view of floods in L&T works, the delivery of components was
delayed by three months. Moreover, the incidence of plague had resulted in a delay of two months from all
the suppliers located in Western India. TNPL ordered special alloy steel pipe from Japan. Due to
earthquake in Japan. the shipment got delayed by about four months, which had direct bearing on
completion of the Project.
In view of the above, the Paper machine trials could be started during first week of September
1995 (i.e.) 30 months from the date of placement of order for Paper Machine.

Project Commissioning
Paper machine trials commenced with "stock on wire" on 4th September and first roll of paper was
reeled at 23.18 hrs on the same day. The machine commissioning was smooth. The downstream systems
like Winder, Reel wrapping and Reel handling were also commissioned.
The Multifuel boiler, which was commissioned in March 1995, suffered damages on tubes and
coils due to mild explosion suspected to have taken place in the fumace. The suppliers of the Boiler,
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), investigated and set right the problems. The Boiler is now re-
commissioned.
In the Mechanical Bagasse pulp mill, all the new equipment procured for revamping the system
were commissioned in March, 1995, which constituted 50% of the Line capacity. The balance capacity,
which was to be realized by shifting of existing equipment to the new building, was commissioned in
August, 1995.
TIhe augmented Effluent treatment plant was commissioned in November, 1995 and is now fully
operational. The treated effluent is conforming to the norms for surface water (River) discharge.
The 10.5 MW Turbo Generator set was commissioned during December, 1995 and synchronized
with the TNEB grid. There was considerable delay in completion of the supply of Generator and certain
components, which stretched the commissioning activities upto December, 1995.
There was also minor delay in the Recovery boiler erection and oil firing was done during
December 1995. The liquor firing commenced from January 4, 1996.
The bagasse handling system and the Chemical Bagasse pulping line were commissioned in
December 1995.
Raw Material tie-up
TNPL is entering into tie-up for release of bagasse, with Kallakurichi Sugar Mills Unit 11 (KSM),
a new unit and Perambalur Sugar Mills (PSM), an existing mill. Accordingly, the boilers have been
ordered and supply is in progress.
There was delay in start-up of implementation activities of KSM which has resulted in hold-up of
erection of Boiler by TNPL. KSM have since commenced the civil works and boiler erection is being
planned to synchronise with the commissioning of the sugar mill.
The site clearance for erecting the boiler at PSM was delayed due to some operational problems at
their end. Tendering activities are in progress and work would be taken up shortly. To meet the bagasse
requirement of the expanded capacity, all the existing tie-up sugar mills are being activated in addition to
mobilizing maximum available low cost surplus bagasse in the open market.

Key Technical Features
Paper Machine # 2
Bagasse as raw material for paper making is characterized by heterogeneity, high fines content,
poor drainability, low wet web strength etc. Based on the operational expertise gained in running the Paper
Machine
(PM) # 1 using predominantly Bagasse pulp in the furnish mix, the configuration of PM #2 was chosen to
include several improved design features as follows:
*   Efficient wire cleaning system with wash rolls in the wire circuit, to reduce cloggin gog wires.
*   Compact tn-nip press to achieve after press dryness of 40% to improve the wet web strength.
*   Closed draw between Press and Dryer section to reduce incidence of Press breaks.
*   Single tier configuration for the first two groups of the Dryer section to avoid sheet flutter
especiallv when using mechanical bagasse pulp.
Pulp Mill
Mechanical Bagasse Pulp mill
The pulp mix envisaged for production of Newsprint after Expansion consists of 60% chemical
bagasse pulp and 40% mechanical bagasse pulp. A thorough review of the opcrations of the existing
mechanical bagasse pulp line was undertaken and it was observed that in its current status, the MBP line
will not be in a position to meet the pulp requirements of the Paper Machine #2. In view of this MBP line
was revamped and located in a new building with the following key features:
*   Provision of one dedicated reclaim and fibre preparation plant to process bright bagasse for
MBP line.
*   Shifting of present TMP and CMP refiners and introduction of steaming tubes to facilitate
addition of chemical in the feed to pressurized refiners.
* Installation of additional CMP refiner wvith an improved chemical mixer refiner
*   Installation of new screening and cleaning plant of augmented capacity and better
performance.
*   Incorporation of high consistency bleaching to optimize the peroxide consumption.
Chemical Bagasse Pulp mill
The operational experience of the existing 3 stage Brown stock washing system shows that the
chemical losses off the final stage washer are high side. The new street has been chosen to include a fourth
stage brown stock washing to bring the chemical losses under control. Also, a pressure knotter has been
installed ahead of the Brown stock washing system to remove uncooked fibre bundles and other debris to
improve cleanliness of the final pulp.

Chemical Recovery Plant
Black Liquor Evaporation plant
The existing black liquor evaporation plant is of LTV type with raising film technology. The
operational experience with Bagasse black liquor shows severe scaling in the first and second effects,
resulting in frequent stoppages for cleaning the tubes thereby bringing down the rated throughput
substantially.
In view of the above, Falling Film (FF) evaporators have been chosen under the Expansion project
to minimize the scaling tendency. The availability of the plant is expected to be more as compared to the
LTV evaporators. The FF evaporators have been designed and operated with seven effects and the steam
economy of the system is around 6.35 as against 4.7 achieved in the LTV evaporators. Since the FF
evaporators are operated without forced circulation effect which requires high capacity circulation pump
(220 kW), the power consumption is also lower.
Recausticizing
The Expansion project envisaged installation of Lime mud rebuming kiln to recycle the Lime
sludge generated in the Recausticizing process. Since the Bagasse black liquor is charactenzed by high
silica, the operation of lime kiln will be affected due to ring formation inside the kiln. In view of this, the
augmentation of the recausticizing plant has been carried out with a two stage slaking process by which the
silica present in the green liquor is precipitated by binding it to the small quantity of lime added in the first
stage slaking stage and purged out.
Lime Mud Reburning System
In the existing operations, about 100 tonnes (dry) of lime sludge containing mostly Calcium
Carbonate is generated in the Chemical Recovery process. It is presently disposed of as raw material to the
nearby cement plant operating on wet process. With cement mills switching over to dry process for energy
conservation. the consumption of lime sludge by these plants will reduce in the longer run. On the other
hand, disposal of lime sludge as land fill will create environmental problems.
Lime Mud Rebuming kiln is being installed to recycle the generated sludge from the system to
produce of lime of high purity.
EfJfluent treatment Plant
The existing effluent treatment plant has been upgraded to handle additional effluent generated. In
the upgraded treatment plant 'Activated sludge process' is adopted for effective removal of BOD instead of
simple aeration system in operation at present. Under this system, one more primary clarifier is added in
the main stream to remove the suspended solids. The settling tanks in the bagasse stream are replaced with
mechanical clarifier. The scheme also features installation of 32 nos. aerators (75 hp each) in the aeration
basin to achieve extended aeration, followed by two secondary clarifiers. The quality of treated effluent
has shown improvement with BOD and COD levels, conforming well within the limits prescribed for
surface water (River) discharge.

General
Mill wide Distributed Control System
The new strcets of Pulp Mill. Recovery plant and Power house have been equipped with the state-
of-the-art Distributed Control System for supervisory control of the process besides improving the
efficiencv of the operations. The process upsets are also minimized.
Buildings
The new Chemical Bagasse Pulp and Mechanical Bagasse Pulp mill buildings are provided with
pre-cast slab roof in lieu of conventional AC sheet roofing, to reduce the maintenance on account of
corrosion of structures experienced.
The Finishing house/Ware house has also been provided with similar roof to over come the
problems of leakages wlich may damage the reels stored under the conventional AC sheet roofing.
Electricals
The new plant has be a provided with AC Variable Frequency drives, wherever speed control is
required as opposed to the conventional Dyno drive units. This will result in better control, conservation of
energy and less maintenance.
Proiect Objectives Achieved
The capacitv of the Plant is doubled and expanded Plant will allow the continuous operation of all
the sections of the Mill thereby climinating the imbalances experienced due to single machine operation to
manufacture Newsprint/Printing and Writing paper.
The upgradation of mechanical bagasse pulp line and installation of PM # 2 with improved design
features. allowed the mill to increase the proportion of bagasse pulp in the fumish mix for Newsprint. The
PM # 2 was trial run with 100% bagasse pulp for production of Newsprint and the results were
encouraging. Continuous run with target furnish will be established soon.
India is a net importer of Newsprint. With growing demand for this product and limited supply
available within the countrv, the project would contribute to substantial savings of foreign exchange
towards import of newsprint.
By utilizing bagassc on a large scale, the most significant contribution by the project is
conservation forest land from commercial exploitation to the extent of about 12,000 ha. per annum.
The benefits to the community are:
The project generated employment opportunities to the local community. Through phased
recruitment. direct employment to about 500 people is provided. About 1500 people are
benefited through indirect employment.

*   The project generates additional trcated effluent to the extent of about 30,000 m3/day. This
water is used for irrigating additional 240 ha. of barren lands abutting the mill boundarv.
Cash crops like sugarcane. groundnut. gingelly, maize, etc. are grown in the fields.
*   Rehabilitation of residents of Kurukkupalavam village had been undertaken to provide houses.
drinking water, infrastructural facilities like roads, lighting, school. temple, etc. The Project
has been completed to the satisfaction of the PAF's (Project Affected Families).
Lessons Leamed
Out of 25 packages procured under ICB, 8 packages were tendered out following two stage bidding
procedure. The two stage tendering procedure was useful only for the complex package like Paper
Machine. In case of other packages like Brown stock washing, Continuous digester, Pulp thickeners etc.,
the procedure delaved the order finalization-
Since no pre-engineering was done at the time of project take-off, the estimates for Civil works,
Buildings, Piping and other mill wide items undenvent substantial increase which led to the increase in the
Project cost.
The delay in detailed engineering, which was dependent on flow of information from the selected
vendors resulted in delayed procurement of millwide items like pipes, fittings, valves, cables etc. This has
caused pressure on the supplier and the Project tearn in making available the required material in time to
meet the erection schedule.
Some delav occurred in finalization of packages like SS Pipes, Insulation etc, as the lowest bidder
submitted unworkable rates. Alternate sources had to be identified and procured since the party failed to
take up the work. Under priced bids should be disqualified.
Developing countries like India when drawing such debts have to face two types of devaluation
viz.weakening of Indian Rupee against US$ and weakening of US$ against other currencies. Though TNPL
received the loan in terms of US$, increase in debt burden was experienced due to weakening of dollar
against major currencies like DM, Yen in the currency basket. On account of this, Lime Kiln package had
to be taken out of the World Bank shopping list. In view of this, the Bank should consider provision of
hedging to protect the interest of the borrower.
Conclusions
The Project is bcnefited by the high level of professionalism of the Bank staff which helped in
formulatior of sound project concept, systematic planning and implementation of the Project. On the part
of Bank. the disbursement and various clearances were received on time which went a long way in
successful implementation of the Project.
The Bank is particularlv insisting on management of certain minor environmental issues like
Chipper noise, Incineration of TRS emissions etc, wvhich are not widely practiced. In our opinion, such
minor issues need not be insisted upon the Borrower.
The trial run of target. furnish using 100% bagasse pulp for production of Newsprint on PM # 2,
has further boosted the level of coonfidenice in the technology pioneered by the Mill. When viewed against

the background of several unsuccessful attempts for commercial production of Newsprmt from bagasse,
worldwide, this achieverrient by the Mill was possible through sustained efforts of TNPL and the back-up
support given bv the Bank. TNPL is now in a position to transfer this technology to the third world
countries who are intc-ested in setting up similar Projects.
TNPL is planning to set up another bagasse based Paper Plant in Tamil Nadu for which the
feasibility study has bee.i taken up. The Bank's patronage for this Project is solicited.
As per the covenants, the share holding of Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) has to be brought
down to 26% within one year from the date of commencement of commercial production. TNPL
commenced commercial production on January 31, 1996. Consequentlv, the share holding of GOTN
should be brought down 26% before January 31, 1997. In as much as the GOTN holding has already been
brought down from 49% to 35% at one stroke any further dilution within next one year will increase the
supply / floating stock of TNPL shares in market. This will adversely affect the share prices and may
cause problems in the future when the Company approaches the capital market to raise resources for new
projects. The Bank is requested not to insist on further dilution of GOTN share holding in the Company, at
this stage.
