The project achieved all of its major\n            objectives, institutional development has been partially\n            achieved, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            the Bank was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            highly satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, a well-prepared project by an\n            experienced client will succeed if it contains all the basic\n            ingredients for a successful industrial project. Second, the\n            use of innovative and pioneering technology in developing\n            countries is a suitable basis for Bank financed projects\n            provided that the technology has been thoroughly researched.\n            Third, early agreement on model tender documents, in this\n            case by pre-appraisal stage, significantly facilitated\n            procurement processing, timely equipment delivery, and\n            disbursements. Fourth, the effort, commitment, and goodwill\n            invested by TNPL in preparing a resettlement and\n            rehabilitation action plan for the PAFs resulted in its\n            smooth and speedy implementation. Finally, to ensure their\n            long-term sustainability, technology innovations and\n            investments in state-of-the-art industrial machinery and\n            equipment should be accompanied by state-of-the-art\n            environmental and safety management systems."}, "docdt": "1996-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
