Till\n            then, the renewable energy program was run by governmental\n            agencies using government procurements and subsidies to\n            support local industry. The private sector's role was\n            limited to supplying equipment, and design and installation\n            services. The RRD project's basic objective was to help\n            the renewable energy industry make a transition from a\n            supply-driven approach to a market-based, demand-driven one\n            in which the consumer would have a choice of product and\n            effective after-sales service. The project goal was to\n            support private sector implementation of 85 MW of wind\n            farms, 100 MW of small hydro and 2.5 MW equivalents of\n            Photovoltaic (PV) systems."}, "docdt": "2000-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
