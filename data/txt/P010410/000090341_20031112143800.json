The project\n            achieved its physical objectives, and in the case of small\n            hydro power and wind farms components, exceeded its targets.\n            The project's institutional development impact is rated\n            modest. Renewable Resources Development Project (RRDP)\n            strengthened Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency\n            (IREDA) and enabled it to mobilize greater private\n            participation and attract additional multilateral and\n            bilateral support for commercializing renewables. The\n            sustainability of RRDP is rated likely, but only marginally\n            so. There are high risks, as commercialization of renewables\n            continues to be threatened by regulatory instability, and\n            have many constraints, notably its continued dependence on\n            incentives, grants, and subsidies. IREDA itself continues to\n            face important financial issues that threaten the\n            sustainability of the project's achievement. Overall,\n            the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory, at least\n            at the project level. As explained in the remainder of this\n            PPAR, the main risks to the project stem from the lack of an\n            integrated renewables and power sector strategy. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory. However, during project\n            implementation, project supervision records show that the\n            government was weak in supporting the rationalization of\n            lending rates, and in coordinating various agencies involved\n            with renewable energy development. The main lessons from\n            this evaluation are as follows: Power sector reforms and\n            renewable energy commercialization should be part of an\n            integrated strategy. The Bank and its client countries\n            should incorporate provisions to level the playing field\n            between conventional and renewable energy technologies while\n            legal/regulatory and other sector-level reforms are being\n            designed and implemented. Monitoring and evaluation systems\n            should be developed for both project and sector-level\n            outcomes, which should distinguish between efficiency and\n            equity indicators. GEF and other grant support operate in a\n            power sector reform setting, and thus should also be keyed\n            to sector outcome indicators. Much\n            \"learning-by-doing\" is involved in\n            non-conventional projects such as renewable energy\n            development and commercialization, which underlines once\n            more the importance o f monitoring and evaluation systems."}, "docdt": "2003-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
