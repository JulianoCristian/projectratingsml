As one of the first renewable energy\n            projects financed by the Bank, the project provides\n            invaluable experience and knowledge on development of\n            market-based approaches to promoting renewable energy\n            through public-private sector partnership. Renewable energy\n            market development takes time. Longer lead time is needed to\n            develop these innovative projects and pace of market\n            development must consider alternative business opportunities\n            available to investors. Development outcomes and impacts\n            should be systematically monitored. Specialized financial\n            institutions was essential in beginning the\n            commercialization of new technologies, but if market growth\n            is to expand, broader participation by the financial sector\n            is essential. Affordable financing accessible to rural\n            consumers are essential for selling Photovoltaics (PV)\n            products in rural areas. Delivering rural PV services needs\n            a partnership between rural financing institutions,\n            product/service suppliers, and preferably organized consumer\n            groups. Assessment of land acquisition as well as payment of\n            compensation should be completed prior to commencement of\n            civil works. Procurement rules and contract value limits\n            need to reflect the goal of the project and the strategy for\n            achieving it."}, "docdt": "2002-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
