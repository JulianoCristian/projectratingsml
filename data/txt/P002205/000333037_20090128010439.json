The Rwanda Second\n            Education Project was conceived, prepared and appraised in\n            the context of the Government's sector objectives as\n            contained in its education reform that was introduced in\n            1979. The main objective of the project was to assist the\n            government in meeting acute shortages of qualified personnel\n            through expansion of secondary schools for training in\n            commerce, nursing and primary teaching. More specifically,\n            the project aimed at: (a) improving training standards in\n            the areas of commerce, nursing and teacher education; (b)\n            implementing reforms to render curricula more relevant to\n            the country's needs; (c) supporting the development of\n            basic education through primary teacher training; (d)\n            increasing educational opportunities for girls; (e)\n            improving the quality and increasing the number of entrants\n            to higher education; and (f) developing local pedagogical\n            and administrative expertise. Despite implementation delays,\n            the Rwanda Second Education Project was a success in that it\n            did effectively contribute to the provision of skilled man\n            power in critical areas, commerce and nursing. However,\n            project support for secondary level training institutions\n            avoided urgently needed reconsideration of the structure and\n            reform of education and training at this level. The Bank\n            Group now plans to undertake a major investment o help the\n            Government to reform the secondary level education and training."}, "docdt": "1991-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
