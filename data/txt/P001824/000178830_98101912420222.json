separate components to provide financial and technical\n            assistance: (i) to the industrial sector for development of\n            small- and medium-scale enterprises promising substantially\n            lower investment costs per job than currently; (ii) to the\n            artisan sector for rehabilitating and expanding the\n            production of knotted carpets by decentralizing production\n            and improving training of weavers; and (iii) to the\n            agricultural sector for development of 30 new irrigated\n            schemes under village cooperatives, including an adequate\n            credit scheme. The project also provides consulting services\n            to study the feasibility of establishing a gypsum plaster\n            brick industry to replace expensive imported cement with\n            locally made bricks, and of creating a new industrial zone\n            in the capital city of Nouakchott."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
