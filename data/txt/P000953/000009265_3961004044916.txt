MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIRE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE ERXECUIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBIC OF GHANA
FOR A NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposea development credit to the Republic of Gl;na for SDR 55.2 million, the equivalent
of US$80.0 miUion, on standard IlDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a
National Electrification Project. Out of the Credit equivalent of US$41.22 million would be
relent to the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) for 20 years including S years of grace,
and equivalent of US$37.98 million would be relent to the Volta River Authority (VRA) for
20 years including 5 years of grace, at the prevailing IBRD interest rate. VRA and ECO will
bear the foreign exchange risk. The project is expected to be funded by Caisse Central de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE), and possibly other cofinanciers including Nordic
Development Fund, DANIDA, and the Netherlands Government.
2.           Bakgrmd: Ghana's total public power generation capacity is 1,122 MW of
which 95 percent is from hydroelectric stations owned by the VRA. The principal source of
supply, the Akosombo plant, was erected in the early 1960s and is undergoing a major
overhaul under the VRA Sixth Power Project (Credit 2109-GH). VRA seils electricity to the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG), the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), and the
mining companies, exports to neighboring countries, and distributes power in Northern
Ghana. About 78 percent of VRA's sales revenues are in foreign currency. Under the
ongoing Northern Grid Extension Project (Credit 1759-H), VRA's system has been extended
to cover urban centers in Northern Ghana. ECG distributes the purchased power within an
interconnected grid in the rest of the country. Together VRA ad ECG systems provide
access to electricitv for about 24 percent of the population. VRA is a relatively well-run
public utilitv, with few institutional and finacial problems. On the other hand, ECG which
serves a large mumber of domestic consumers and has had insufficient access to foreign
exchange in the past, is the focus of a major distribution system rehabilitation effort under the
ongoing ECG Fifth Power Project (Credit 2061-OR). ECG's financial position is weak ann it
has not been able to comply with agreed rate of return covenart ECG's commercial
operations (i.e., metering, billing, collections) needs substial improvement. A major factor
conributing to ECG's weak financial status has been tue lack of adequate and timely tariff
adjustments. Although tariffs were increased by an average of 40 percent in January 1992,
the average tariff in 1992 was only about 45 percent of the long run margnal cost (LRMC),
and only about 30 percent of LRMC for residental customers. In recent years, the
Government has put a great emphasis on a comprehensive electrification program, referred to
as the National Electrification Scheme (NES), to provide electricity to smaller urban centers
and rural areas. This is in line with the Government's policy of expanding dem zation at
the Distict Capitals level and promodng development of the areas outside large urban centers.
3.                          : jTu Objectves Ihe project would enable the VRAIECG to prmide
eletricity from the national power grid to small urban centers and rural areas through a
systematic eletification program, and would assist in the strengthening and rationalization of
the sector instittions, particularly the ECG. The project also improves the existing ECG
distribution network.



-2 -
4.           Poject Descpini: Under the ECG Fifth Power Project, IDA financed a
National Electrification Planning Study (NEPS) which developed a long term planning (30
year) framework for electrificatiok of the country. The electrification component of the
project (about 73 percent of project cost) comprises a portion of time slice (1993 to 1997) of
the investment program defined under the NEPS and covers the 29 sub-projects proposed by
the Government, which include connections to the national power grid of all the district
capitals that are not supplied from the grid. It would extend the hydro based sub-transmission
and distribution network to about 434 communities with a total population of one million,
located throughout all 10 regions of the country. The physical scope would include
construction of about 2,100 km of medium and low voltage power lines and the associated
distribution transformers, breakers, and other related electical equipment as well as poles. In
addition, the project would assist ECG (20% of project cost) in reinforcing its existing
distribution network by financing the works needed to expand substations and build or replace
links between substations. The project would also include a major institutional strengthening
and reform component to improve the operational efficiency of ECG through private sector
involvement in the ECO's commercial operations.
5.           Proiect Financing: The project cost including contingencies is estimated at
US$166.2 million of which US$122.5 million (74%) is in foreign currency. IDA would
fnance US$80.0 million which amounts to 48 percent of the project cost. About US$50.5
million is expected to be provided by VRA and ECG from their intMaly generated funds,
and by the Government from an especially established National Electrification Fund. About
US$54.8 million in cofinancing is required from other donors. In addition, VRA and ECG
would finance the interest during constucion which amounts to about US$19.1 million,
bringing the total financing required for the project to US$185.3 million. The Government
expects other co-financiers to fund the project. The NES is already being supported by
bilateral donors including Japan, Finland, and Tpdia. A breakdown of costs and financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and status of
Bank group operations in Ghana are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is
atthed. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11256-GH, dated February 4, 1993 is being
distributed separately.
6.           Poect lXementation: The project will be carried out with ECO and VRA
as executing agencies responsible for the components that fall within their respectve service
areas. The organi       arrangements required for project implemention have been
finalized during the Appraisal Mission. ECG and VRA have agreed to hire engineering
consultants to assist with implementation of the project. The implementation period for the
project is esdmated to be five years. The role of MOE would be at the policy making level
and with no responsibility for project execution.
7.           LensT from   us o          leme: Ihe main lesson from previous
IDA involvement in ECG projects in the past is that, in addition to focusing on improving the
physical infrastcture (i.e., the sub-transmission and distution system) and technical
capability of ECG's staff, it is time to put more emphasis on improving the operational
efficiency of ECG. In mid-1980s ECG's system was In a state of disrepair. lTrough IDA-
financed projects in recen years, ECG's system has substantially improved, but efficiency of
its operations, particularly in the area of customer services and revenue management, is in
need of substntil improvement. IDA's assistance henceforth should put the necessary



-3 -
emphasis on institutional strengthening of ECG. It is expected that efficiency of ECG's
commercial operations would increase substantially through the performance-based
management contract envisaged under the project. In addit on, due to lack of adequate and
timely tariff adjustments, ECG's finances has been weakened and it has not been able to
comply with finanWial covenants under Credit 2061-GH. Hence, adequate upfront tariff
increase and assurance for future tariff adjustments through a tariff formula are envisaged
under the proposed project. As noted above, VRA is a relatively well run utility with few
siancial and insutional problems. Although VRA offers a relatively attractive
compensation package it has difficulty attracting qualified staff for high professional positions
and IDA would continue to provide assistance and advice in this area.
8.           Project $stainability: Institutional reform; particularly in the commercial
operations of ECG and adequate and timely tariff increases are the two key factors that will
be addressed under the project to enhance sustamability of the project. As a condition of
Board presentation, an adequate upfront tariff Increase has been implemented as of January 1,
1993. As for future taiff adjustment, it is the Government's intention that the tariff
approximate long-run marginal cost (LRMC) by 1996 and remain at LRMC thereafter. To
ensure adequate financial viability of the utilities, the lower limit of the tariff will be
determined by a rate of retum requirement (para. 10 below) agreed under the project.
9.           Rationale for IDA  In     : The Bank Group has been closely associated
with Gha's power sector for almost 30 years. Since Ghana embarked on its economic
recovery program in mid-1980s, IDA's objective has been to help improve and expand the
power infrastructure needed for the country's economic development and assist the
Government in developing a financialy viable and well-managed sector, whose institutions
enjoy a high degree of auonomy and are capable of delivering a reliable and economic supply
of electricity. In recent years, under several completed and ongoing projects financed by IDA,
the Government has embarked on rehabilitating and improving Ghana's power generation and
distribution faciitie and it is very keen on IDA's further assistance in developing the sector
to ead the benefas of the improvements in the country's power supply and distnbuon
infrastructre to niore of the population. IDA's continued involvement in the sector through
the proposed project is justified in order to assist the authorities to develop a sound national
electrification program, act as catalyst to facilitate co-financing, and encourage the
institutional improvements needed to implement the electrification progam  Therefore, the
ptoject is fully consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy for Gbana, which
emphasizes the achievement of sustainable and accelerated growth, including an adequate
Infrastructure support and placing more emphasis on effective management of public sector
resources and institutions.
10.          Agre Actions: (a) Specific financial conditionalities have been agreed as
follows: (i) ECG and VRA to earn at least 8 percent per annum rate of return on currently
valued average net fixed assets in operation beginning in 1994; (it) ECG and VRA future debt
service is adequately covered (i.e., 1.5 times) by future net revenues; (iii) Annual review of
ECG and VRA Investment Programs with I)DA; (iv) Except for the agreed investment
progrm, ECG would not incur any capital expenditure above the equivalent of US$2 million
annually without prior consultation with IDA,; (v) Monthly settlement between ECO, VRA
and the Government of future obligations to the cross-debt clearing system; and, (vi)
Reduction in ECG accoumts receivables. (b) Agreement was reached that an adequate tariff
increse to ensure fancial viability of the udlities wiM be a condition of Board presentation



-4-
and, tariffs were increased by about 65 percent for VRA bulk su,pply and more than 38
percent for ECG customers as of January 1, 1993. (c) Following a recently completed tariff
study, and as part of the Energy Sector Review, IDA has reviewed with the Government the
need for a more appropriate method for achieving greater automaticity in tariff adjustment to
better reflect the economic cost of supply, and a formula procedure to set and adjust tariffs
has been zgreed under the project. (d) The Government agreed with the assessment that
ECO's commercial operations needs substantial improvement and hzs indicated its willingness
to strengthen ECG's commercial operations through private sector participation. It was
agreed to strengthening ECG's commercial operations thugh a performance-based
management contract to be financed bilaterally by the Government of France through CCCE.
Agreement was reached on the main elements of the performance contract and the nature of
the performance indicators to be used, and an expert to assist ECG with the preparation of the
management contract haW been hired under the project's PPF. (e) There will be a mid-term
review of the project in about two years after effectiveness of the credit. (t) It was agreed
that IDA will be provided with quarterly staus reports detafling funding requirements to
Implement the project, and a scheme wil be established to finace inal house wiring for
new customers to be served under the project Conditions gf Credit effectiveness are as
follows: (D) signing of a satisfactory performance-based management contract for the
commercial operations of ECG; (ii) reconciliation and settlement of al obligations due to the
Cross-Debt Clearing House System (50% of obligations through third-quarter of 1992 have
been cleared as a condition of Board presentation); (iii) fulfillment of conditions of
effectiveness of cofiancing from CCCE for the management contract; (iv) and the signing of
Subs4liary Loan Agreement between the Government and the utilities.
11.          Environenta act: The project is under environmenal category B and is
not expected to have any significant adverse environmental effects. Much of the sub-
transmission system will foUow the existng road ways and lines will be supported on single
poles. ITerefore, interference with the existing land use will be minimal. While line
maintenance wil require routine clearing of undergrowth, incremental efects are expected to
be minimal.
12.          prog  Metive Cateor: The project will assist the county's
antipoverty strat by bringing electricity to the lower income rural areas of the country.
13.          Prject Benefits: The main component of the proposed project would provide
the relatively inexpensive hydro-generaed electricity from the national grid to small urban
centers and rura areas in different regions of the country, which would assist the Goverment
to bring more of the benefits of the recent economic g;owth to the regions and, in line with
the policy of expanding d         at the district level, accelerate the socio-economic
development of areas outside of the major urban centers. The flrst phase of the NES focuses
on electrification of District Capitals throughout the country which requre inclusion of sub-
projects of vaying economic rate of ret. The project Is designed to conxute to balanced
regional development and equity in the ountry and to improve the standard of living of the
rural population in general. Based on the quantifiable benefits, the Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) for the electrification component as a whole is estimated at an acceptable rate
of about 12 percent. A significant, though unquantifiable, benefit of the project is that e
project serves as a vehicle and a catlyst to assist the Government and the utSiles to
formulate and implement much needed instuional and tariff reforms. The project will also
improve the reliability of ECGs existing distribution network which is being strained by rapid



-5 -
growth in demand fo. electricity, and the EIRR for this component of the project is estimated
at 36 perct.
14.          ftWPt Riss The mairt risk of the project is that it may overburden ECO's
commercial operations (meterig, billing, colleMions, etc.) which is already experiencing
difficulties and fiUrther contribute to ECO's weak finacial position. MIis is being addressed
dtrough proposed instiutional reforms. Also, adequate and timely tariff increase is a potential
risk which is being addressed through an upfront tariff increa3e and estblishment of a tariff
formula.
15.          Recommend      : I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

GHANA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
While Ghana's overall disbursement performance continues to compare favorably with other countries
in the Region, disbursements on Investment lending have been declining since FY89. An increased focus on
implementation, complemented with actions to address generic as well as project issues, resulted in a reversal
of the trend in FY91. Key actions taken to improve performance included a Country Implementation Review
in May 1991, which led to a breakthrough in the simplification of procurement procedures and the approval
process, and follow-on sector implementation reviews. The Resident Mission's supervision capacity was
strengthened, and its portfolio monitoring activities increased. Intensive supervision and mid-term reviews
were used to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank policy. Anticipated political changes,
along with uncertainty over possible shifts in personnel, led to a slow-down in actions to address
implementations problems, as reflected in lower disbursements in FY92. Nonetheless, continuing efforts to
improve performance, including another CIR planned for 1993 , are expected to bring activities back on track
after the settling-in period of the new government. The status of projects which are particularly slow-
disbursing is discussed below.
CQcoa Rehabilitation (FY88). To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, project administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between implementing
agencies have been established, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress. However,
difficulties with procurement procedures and cost increases in the roads component have caused continued
delays in implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, various components of the project
have been redesigned and action taken to re-allocate credit funds.
Mining Sector Rehabilitation (FY88). The SGMC rehabilitation component has been lagging
substandally, owing to slow decision making on joint venturing and rehabilitation of the mines. A
cofinanciers' meeting was held in October 1992. Tbis downsizing of SGMC represents significant progress
which will now allow the appropriate preparation of plans to close the remaining mines. In November 1992,
an agreement was reached on the divestiture of SGMC's two major mines.
Foresty Resources Management (FY89).  Implementation problems included weak project
management, shortage of professional staff, and government uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the
technical assistance program. Actions have been taken to enhance staff training, seek approval for an increase
in incentive packages, and restructure the technical assistance program. Project management has now
improved, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken to reallocate proceeds.
Rura1 inanl  (FY89). Although disbursements improved in FY92, drawdown on the credit line is
still slower than expected owing to problems of high interest rates, high credit risk perception by both lenders
and borrowers, and significant delays by the project implementation unit. Following the mid-erm review
in June 1992, several actions including simplification of subloan processing procedures and onlending
arrangements have now been taken to accelerate disbursements.
Water Sector Rehabilitlin (FY90). There has been significant progress in resolving ffnancial issues
(tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address institutional problems.
Ihe key issue of shortage of qualified senior management staff, however, remains unresolved; it will be taken
up with the new Government after the settling-in period. After long delays, physical implementation of the
project is now on track and disbursements are expected to pick up at the end of the engineering design stage
in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.
