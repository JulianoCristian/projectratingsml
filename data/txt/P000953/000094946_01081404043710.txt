3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1   The project objectives as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were to: (a) enable the
Government to provide electricity from the national grid to small urban centers, district capitals and rural
areas through a systematic electrification program; (b) improve service reliability in the Electricity
Company of Ghana's (ECG) existing network; and (c) improve ECG's operational efficiency by assisting it



to reform and strengthen its commercial operations.
Assessment of Objectives:
3.1.2 The development objectives were clear and realistic. They were also important for the power
sector development of Ghana and responsive to the circumstances and development priorities of the country
and the Country Assistance Strategy. Following the rehabilitation and improvement of Ghana's generation
and distribution facilities, the National Electrification Project (NEP) was devised to develop a sound
national electrification program and to extend the social and developmental benefits of power supply to
more of the population.
3.2 Revised Objective:
N/A
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  The Project included the following components:
3.3.2 National Electrification Component (Cost- US$124.0 million): This component comprised: (a)
construction of about 2,200 km (1,000 km for VRA and 1200 km for ECG) of medium-voltage (33kV and
1 kV) and low voltage (400 kV) lines, and installation of distribution transformers, circuit breakers, auto
reclosers and other related electrical equipment; (b) construction of about 119,000 household connections
(Service Drops); (c) construction of service centers required to operate and maintain the power system at
the district level; (d) the supply of vehicles, tools, and specialized equipment for construction supervision,
operation and maintenance of the distribution network in the new areas; and (e) consultants services for
distribution engineering design, bid preparation and evaluation, and construction management (including
stock management and construction supervision) and design and implementation of a pilot program for
productive uses of electricity. These construction works and the accompanying consultants services were
intended to connect about 434 communities located in all 10 regions of the country to the main grid,
including connection of about 119,000 consumers.
3.3.3  Distribution Reinforcement Component (Cost - US$31.6 million: This component implemented
a time slice of approximately three years of distribution works needed to expand sub-stations, build or
replace major links between sub-stations, and to continue the loss reduction program.
3.3.4 Management Contract (Cost- US$5.0 million): This component was designed to meet the
objective of improving ECG's operational efficiency by assisting it to reform and strengthen its commercial
operations. As such, a performance-based management contract was to be entered between ECG and a
utility/consulting firm under which the contractor assisted ECG to strengthen its commercial services,
particularly line loss reduction and collection of revenues. Also, a Consumer Services Directorate was
created to provide a central point for management of all customer services.
3.3.5 Training and Studies (Cost-US$5.6 million): Training and studies were to be provided to
support the utilities in the following areas: (a) staff development programs with special attention to the
training requirements of staff to be responsible for the operation of the new systems; (b) a study to design,
develop, and implement a pilot demonstration program for promoting productive uses of electricity; and (c)
a study of the scheme of services of power sector utilities.
Assessment of Original Components:
-2 -



3.3.6 Overall. All the project components were designed to fully align with the objectives of the project
and were within the technical, financial and management implementation capacity of the executing
agencies. The design of the components also incorporated the lessons leamed from previous operations in
the sector and from Bank-financed projects in other countries.
3.3.7  The National Electrification Component. Since the late 1980's a major development goal of the
Ghanaian govemment was to provide electricity to most of the population, by extending the interconnected
transmission grid to small towns and rural areas under a National Electrification Scheme (NES). In order
to establish a sound framework for development of the NES, including appropriate policies and standards,
and to identify priority programs for extension of the grid, a National Electrification Planning Study
(NEPS) had been carried out with IDA financing under the Fifth Power Project (Cr. 2061-GH). The
national electrification component was designed on the basis of the results of the NEPS and was considered
as the first phase of the NES. The component targeted the connection to the interconnected system of all
the district capitals that were not supplied from the grid, and other identified communities. The component
was therefore designed to fully align with the Government's developmental goal of increasing the
population's access to electricity so as to achieve balanced economic growth.
3.3.8  The design of the component envisaged that the project was to be implemented by the Volta River
Authority (VRA) and ECG. In addition to generating and selling electricity to ECG and bulk consumers,
VRA also distributes power in northem Ghana while ECG is a distributor in the southem part of the
country. Institutionally both utilities were well placed to implement the project, having acquired expertise
and experience in designing and implementing similar projects, and in managing consultants over a long
period of time. At the time ECG was also trying to upgrade the skill-mix of its staff through better
recruitment, training and human resource policies--hence the project reinforced the ongoing process of
institutional strengthening in the utility. VRA had a finance department staffed with competent
professionals and its financial performance was sound at the time of project preparation. While ECG's
financial performance was less satisfactory, it had just completed documenting its accounting policies,
system and procedures in an Accounting Manual in 1993, as part of the process of strengthening financial
management.
3.3.9  The Distribution Reinforcement Component. Rehabilitation of the distribution system had been
identified as a major priority for improving service reliability; and funding had been provided under the
Fifth Power Project. However, because of larger than expected growth in demand, a distribution system
reinforcement component was included in this project. The component included expansion of substations
and building or replacing major links between substations. The component was implemented by the same
project organization structure established for the execution of the Fifth Power Project which had worked
satisfactorily under the supervision of ECG's Director of Engineering. The implementation arrangements
included continuation of consultants' supervision support from the same consultants that were assisting
ECG with implementation of the Fifth Power Project. In addition, also with support under the Fifth Power
Project, ECG had improved its stores and materials management systems which were to be used for
handling materials procured for this component. Thus, institutionally, administratively and technically,
ECG had the requisite capacity to implement the project efficiently and to sustain the operations.
3.3.10 The Management Contract Component At the time of project preparation it was recognized
that one of the principal issues facing the power sector was the need to strengthen ECG's conmmercial
operations (i.e. metering, billing and revenue collections). In line with the Government's policy then of
commercializing the operations of ECG, it was decided to strengthen ECG's operations in these areas
through the involvement of the private sector. The management contract component was designed to
- 3 -



implement this commercialization approach through: (i) creation of a new Consumer Services Directorate,
to concentrate all the commercial and technical activities required to provide efficient services to all types
of consumers, and (ii) contracting of a qualified utility and/or a utility consulting firn to manage ECG's
new Consumer Services Directorate under a performance-based management contract for a period of three
years. The design of the component was consistent with the commercialization policy and the specific
project objectives of improving commercial operations. However, the project design, by giving the
managernent contractor limited control over aspects of the company's operations, denied him the ability to
affect important variables influencing the achievement of the contractual targets. In addition, given the
difficult, of establishing the baseline level of system losses, an alternative could have been to base payments
to the contractor on the amount of energy paid for.
3.3.11 The Training and Studies Component. The areas for training and studies were identified in light
of the needs for ECG to improve organizational capacity, and the activities were directly aimed at
improving ECG's operational efficiency by assisting ECG to reform and strengthen its commercial
operations. The component was therefore complementary to the management contract component and
reinforced ECG's capacity to implement the national electrification and distribution systems reinforcement
components.
3.4 Revised Components:
N/A
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1  Overall, the project's Quality at Entry was satisfactory. The project objectives were consistent
with both Governuent's developmental strategy for the sector and with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy. The Govenmuent was committed to accelerated growth and poverty reduction and to the policy
program needed to achieve it. Major elements of the developmental strategy included reform of public
enterprises sector and investment in infrastructure to remove constraints to growth. The policy strategy for
the energy sector had been articulated in a GoG document entitled " Energy and Ghana's Socio-Economic
Development " and in the Energy Sector Review prepared by the Bank in 1992. These documents
identified the following energy sector priorities: (i) reduce the cost of energy supplies to the economy
through rehabilitation and proper maintenance of installations in the petroleum and electricity sub-sectors;
(ii) reduce dependence on petroleum imports through promotion of more efficient energy use; (iii) improve
forestry management to provide an adequate long-term supply of fuelwood; and (iv) strengthen sector
institutions through a program of public enterprise reform focusing on commercialization. The project
design addressed priorities (i) and (iv) through the national electrification and distribution reinforcement
components; and the management contract and the training and studies components respectively. Thus, in
terms of addressing the Government's developmental and sector strategies, the quality at entry was
satisfactory.
3.5.2 The project was designed based on the investment program defined under an IDA-financed
National Electrification Planning Study (NEPS) and past experiences in Ghana and other countries. The
quality of the project design was satisfactory. One of the critical assumptions for the project was a
sufficient level of demand to match the incremental electricity supply. Also, the project had identified
inadequate and untimely tariff increases as one of the risks associated with the project implementation.
Unfortunately, inadequate and untimely tariff increases were one of the reasons for the delay in project
implementation. However, the assumptions about relevant external factors were adequate and reasonable.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1  The outcome of the physical components was satisfactory while that of the institutional
components was marginally satisfactory. Overall the outcome of the project is considered satisfactory.
The ratings for the individual objectives are assessed as follows:
Objective 1: Enable the Government to provide electricityfrom the national grid to small urban
centers and rural areas, district capitals and rural areas through a systematic electrifi cation
program--Satisfactory.
Objective 2: Improve service reliability in the existing ECG's network--Satisfactory.
Objective 3: Improve ECG's operational efficiency by assisting ECG to reform and strengthen its
commercial operations-marginally satisfactory.
4.1.2 The physical outcome of the electrification program was satisfactory because the project was
successful in providing electricity to small urban centers, district capitals and rural areas. The success was
achieved despite the unanticipated shortage of construction materials which emerged during implementation
of the program. The project also improved the service reliability in the existing ECG's network through
rehabilitating the power system. The economic analysis for major components of the project showed a
positive net present value when discounted at 10%. However, the improvement for ECG's operational
efficiency was marginal because the performance targets for the management contract were not met and the
moderate improvements in customer service started to reverse after the departure of the management
contractor.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1  National Electrification Component. With the completion of the project, all the District capitals
in the country have been connected to the grid. The number of towns connected and the number of new
service connections developed under the project are summarized in the following table.
Planned                       Achieved
Number of communities electrified          434                            432
Number of customers connected             119,000                        89,382
4.2.2 The Project electrified more than 99% of the commnunities that were planned. However, the
achievement in the number of customers that were connected was moderate, especially in the Northem
region. This is due to the ethnic conflict which affected areas covering 20 towns out of 48 towns electrified
in the region. The conflict resulted in relocation of people from the area, damage to houses, and disruption
of economic activities. However, at the time of project completion, people were resettled and economic
activities resumed. Thus, the number of connected customers and the consumption of electricity are
increasing.
4.2.3  The district offices and service centers were constructed in the areas covered under the project in
the ECG operational area. While none was constructed in the VRA operational area, rented facilities were
- 5 -



used for customer support. Vehicles and motorcycles that were required by VRA for the centers could not
be obtained due to the delay in the commencement of the procurement process. Spare parts and
communication equipment were provided for the maintenance and operation of the new networks.
4.2.4 The innovative technology of using the shieldwires of the 161 kV transmission lines to carry power
was applied to serve 14 communities in the Brong Ahafo and Northem regions. The use of the shieldwires
enabled reductions in investment cost of about 50 percent compared to conventional technology. Therefore,
in the design of a rural energy strategy which is contemplated as part of the ongoing sector reform program,
issues of technology and standards will be addressed, taking into account the experience gained from this
operation.
4.2.5 Distribution Reinforcement Component. The work carried out under the component comprised
network rehabilitation, network reinforcement and extension of LV networks and a small number of new
lines supplied to some villages in order to improve reliability of ECG's network. Substation links,
substation expansion and rehabilitation works involving 12 33/1 lkV substations of total capacity of 175
MVA (including associated equipment) were carried out in Accra, Tema, Kumasi, Takoradi, and other
towns. A 161/34.5kV, 13.3 MVA sub-station with seven radial sub-transmission lines was constructed at
Yendi in the Northem Region. The sub-station is equipped for a possible extension to central Togo. Some
of the distribution construction work carried out under the component was executed using local installation
contractors.
4.2.6 Management Contract. In order to achieve the improvement in the ECG's operational efficiency
and strengthen its commercial operations, a performance-based management contract was executed. At the
end of the contract the management contractor's evaluation report recorded the following achievements:
- Commercial loss reduced by 3%;
- Debtor/sales ratio decreased from 198 days to 109 days;
- An organizational structure for decentralized and efficient customer service was established. It is
capable of serving an additional 200,000 - customers out of the ECG's customer base of about
700,000; and
- Accurate bills can be produced before the next month's meter reading is undertaken.
4.2.7  Despite the contractors' reported progress, the overall outcome of this assignment was marginally
satisfactory because: (i) system losses were at 21 percent at the end of the contract period instead of the
target level of 18 percent; (ii) the contract had been designed to be self-financing, but it was assessed that
the productivity gains had been less than the cost of the commercial loan used to finance the contract; (iii)
the infrastructure set up in the Consumer Services Department (including the human expertise, management
procedures and incentives) has not been effective to maintain or improve commercial performance in the
period after the management contract. With respect to system losses, the baseline percentage had been
assessed at 21 percent, but during implementation several problems with metering were encountered which
suggested that the actual initial losses may have been higher at about 24 percent--hence the consultant's
estimate of a 3 percent reduction during the implementation period.
4.2.8  Other aspects of the institutional components were more successful. These were the pilot program
for pre-payment metering and the training and studies. The pilot program to introduce a pre-payment
metering system in the VRA/NED operational area was successfully executed in the four regional capitals
of Sunyani, Tamale, Wa, and Bologatanga. Staff training in finance, audit system planning and utility
management was partly completed. Some of ECG's senior management visited foreign utilities to become
familiar with divestiture and utility management programs. Other ECG engineering staff were attached to
- 6 -



the international consultant who updated the electrification plan and ECG's technical specifications for
distribution works. Although the design and implementation of a pilot program to promote productive uses
of electricity was not implemented, it is being undertaken as an integral part of the implementation of the
EC funded rural electrification for the Western Region, which commenced in June, 2000.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.3.1 At appraisal, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated for major sub-projects for
VRA's and ECG's investment programs. Since the project encountered the unexpected shortage of
construction materials and other factors, the implementation of the investment program was delayed
substantially. Thus, the EIRRs were calculated based on the revised time-slice. In spite of the delay in
project implementation, the actual EIRRs are higher than the appraisal estimates due to substantially lower
costs and larger electricity consumption than originally anticipated.
The table compares the EIRRs at appraisal and completion for major sub-projects:
Region                   EIRR at appraisal             EIRR at completion
Northern Region                     5.5 %                          8.3 %
Brong Ahafo Region                  12.6 %                         16.7 %
Easter Region                       127%                          29.7%
Western Region         1            13.5 %                         19.7 %
4.4 Financial rate of return:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1  The project promoted substantial institutional development through all the four main components.
However, as already noted above, the institutional development under the management contract component
was less than expected, especially as the marginal improvements in key commercial performance indicators
started to reverse after the departure of the contractor. The transfer of knowledge and expertise from the
consultants for the national electrification and distribution reinforcement components had more beneficial
impact on capacity building, especially in ECG's engineering function. In addition, some of the contracts
under the Distribution Reinforcement Component were implemented using local contractors in all the
regions, thus promoting the development of local capacity in distribution network construction. This
capacity will enable the local contractors to contribute to the future development of the network.
4.5.2 In the financial arena, performance has been disappointing. At appraisal, financial performance
targets had been set requiring VRA and ECG to achieve: (i) rates of return on revalued assets of at least
8% annually; and (ii) debt service coverage ratios of at least 1.5 times. In addition, ECG was expected to
reduce and mnaintain its accounts receivable at no higher than 45 days sales revenue. Although several
tariff increases were implemented during the project period, the increases were delayed and inadequate to
compensate for the adverse impacts caused by devaluation and inflation. For a while the formulation and
implementation of a financial recovery plan (FRP) in 1998 held the promise for the sector's return to
financial viability. However, while the financial restructuring component of the recovery plan was partially
implemented, the tariff component was not pursued after the initial increases in 1998, despite a depreciation
of the Cedi amounting of about 300 percent in 1999 and 2000. The Public Utilities Regulatory

Commission (PURC) which had been established in 1997 and considered key to achieving cost-reflective
tariffs was reluctant to adjust tariffs in the two years preceding the Presidential and Parliamentary elections
at the end of 2000. Recently the PURC approved an average tariff increase of about 100 percent to take
effect from May 1, 2001. It is expected that the PURC will soon finalize proposals for subsequent tariff
increases to bring the average tariff to cost recovery levels.
4.5.3  Although the Project itself cannot be credited, GoG took various actions for overall sector reform
during the project imnplementation period. Based on the President's document "Ghana -Vision 2020 (The
First Step: 1996-2000)", GoG launched an economic development policy aimed at stabilizing the
macro-economic environment and building a foundation for private sector led economic growth. GoG also
announced the "Statement of Power Sector Development Policy" and initiated a power sector reformn
program. The implementation of the program including the divestiture of ECG and the unbundling of VRA
has been delayed primarily because of the slow progress in adjusting tariffs to cost recovery levels and the
muted commitment of the previous administration. The new administration had indicated its conmmitment
to the privatization program, but intensive Bank support is required to facilitate the Government decisions
and implementation of related sector reform issues, particularly tariff regulation, rules for market entry,
and structural changes.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1  The shortage of wood poles and other construction materials for distribution expansion work
during the project implementation, which had a great impact on the delay of the project, was outside the
control of government and the implementing agency. In fact, one of the reasons for the extension of the
Credit was the shortage of wood poles for the project. The ethnic conflict in the Northem region
significantly affected the project implementation. It first disrupted survey work in some towns and sections
of the sub-transmission lines, which delayed the design work for the project. Due to the ethnic conflict,
most people in the conflict area were not able to bear the cost of wiring their houses which was a
pre-condition for the installation of services. However, the economic activities in the area resumed at the
time of project completion and demand is increasing rapidly. There were no other significant factors
affecting project implementation.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.1.2 The main factor subject to GoG control which significantly impacted the project was the
adjustment of tariffs. The Government was slow in increasing tariffs in response to the devaluation of the
local currency and the resulting inflation. The Govermment's attempt to increase tariffs in early 1997 was
met with public demonstrations. The increases were rescinded. Legislation to set up autonomous
regulatory bodies was fast-tracked and the PURC and Energy Commission were established by the end of
that year. The average tariff was increased by more than 200 percent in 1998. However, as noted above,
the PURC did not approve new increases until April 2001, despite substantial devaluation and inflation in
the intervening two years. As a result the financial position of the utilities had vastly deteriorated by early
2001. The weak financial position of the utilities caused substantial project implementation delays. The
expiration date of the Credit was also extended by 18 months in order to compensate for the lost time due
to the delay.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
- 8 -



5.3.1  As noted earlier, ECG's management of commercial aspects was consider a major sector issue at
the project appraisal stage--hence the inclusion of the management contract component in the project
design. Nevertheless, the limited success of this contract meant that ECG continued to experience
managerial weakness in customer services, especially the difficulties in bill collection and the high level of
system losses. To date these and inadequate attention to financial management issues continue to be the
main concerns regarding the management of ECG.
5.3.2 Although the project included support to strengthen ECG's technical and project management
capacity, as the volume of the work load grew, capacity constraints in project contract management caused
delays in some of the contracts leading to the need for an eighteen month extension.
5.3.3 While VRA implemented the bulk of works within the original project period, there were lapses in
the procurement for vehicles, motorcycles and other materials necessary for project implementation, so that
in the end these could not be completed within the extended credit closing date.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
6.1.1 The overall project sustainability is rated as uncertain. Throughout project implementation, the
economic viability of the rural electrification program was proven without giving negative environmental
impacts and by applying a conventional technical approach. Significant transfer of knowledge took place
under the Project and this should effectively support both implementation of future capacity expansion
projects and the maintenance and operation of the system. In addition, the GoG is committed to the
development of the rural electrification as a means of facilitating rural development and poverty reduction.
However, while these factors are important, the prospect for project sustainability also depend critically on
the sector's long-term financial viability, which in turn depends on the successful implementation of sector
reforms in the areas of tariff regulation, privatization of distribution as noted earlier (para.4.5.2). In
addition, it is worth noting that the financial problem for the sector will increase as the rural electrification
program expands to areas with less customer density and demand, thus imposing higher costs relative to
-9-



revenues for the system. Relevant financing and tariff regulation policies will therefore need to be put in
place to cope with these challenges. In addition, use of low-cost design standards to improve the economic
and financial viability of rural schemes will need to be adopted more extensively based on the lessons
leamed under this project as well as experiences from other countries. Hence, intensive external support is
critically needed to help the Government in addressing these issues. Because of these concems, the long
term sustainability of benefits obtained from the Project is, at this stage, assessed "uncertain".
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1 The power systems developed under the project were transferred to the operations' directorates.
The transition period from the construction and operation is already completed. Since ECG and VRA have
established procedures and manuals for operation and maintenance of the distribution network, ECG and
VRA have no difficulties in regular operations. In terms of expanding supply above the average access rate
of about 35 percent (up from about 24 percent at the start of the NEP), a revised rural energy strategy
needs to be developed to lay the basis for a modified approach which takes account of the regulatory and
financing issues related to rural energy as well as the potential for low-cost design standards for faster
expansion of the rural electrification program (para 6.1.1).
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
7.1.1 Identification of the project concept and the design of the project component were satisfactory.
During project preparation and appraisal, the detailed technical, economic, environmental and other issues
were properly addressed and analyzed. The project preparation incorporated lessons of past similar
projects in Ghana and other countries, especially with respect to rural electrification through grid
expansion. The overall development objectives agreed upon during the appraisal were appropriate even
though sector reform issues, with the exception of the comnmercialization of ECG, were not addressed in
this project The sector reform were to be more comprehensively dealt with under the Thermal Power
Project (Cr. 2682-GH) whose preparation was already in progress.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1 With respect to the project supervision, the project is rated satisfactory. The project was
supervised regularly by 13 missions. Issues were identified and recommendations were provided in a
timely manner, especially for compliance with covenants. A comprehensive mid-term review was
undertaken in April 1998, during which detailed proposals were developed for a financial recovery plan
that was later adopted by the GoG during that year. Based on the FRP, the legal agreements of the Credit
were amended to postpone the requirement for an 8% rate of return on assets to year 2000 and replace it
with lower interim targets in 1998 and 1999. Implementation of the FRP was closely monitored, and
although not fully implemented, the plan did help to provide some financial relief to VRA and ECG. The
closing date was extended until March, 2000, which allowed ECG and VRA to complete most of the
planned activities. However, whereas the Government did not consistently implement a tariff policy
necessary for achieving and maintaining the sector's financial viability, the Bank followed an overoptimistic
approach. This limited the possibilities for exercising the Bank's enormous leverage, deriving from its
overall program and relationship with the Government.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
7.3.1  Overall Bank performance is assessed as Satisfactory. It is recognized that the project had to be
extended due to the delay in implementation and the deterioration of financial positions of the implementing
agencies. The Bank maintained an intensive dialogue with the GoG, and its agencies on financial issues as
well as on the commercialization activities in ECG. The resulting moderate (in real terms) tariff
adjustments and the financial restructuring under the FRP helped to ensure that the implementing agencies
had adequate resources to maintain their commitment to the Project.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1  During the preparation phase the Borrower performance is considered Satisfactory. The result of
the National Electrification Planning Study (NEPS) effectively reflected in the project design. Detailed
project engineering was incorporated as one of the components of the Project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1  The GoG implementation performance is rated Unsatisfactory. This is because of its failure to
ensure cost recovery tariffs during most of the project implementation period. It was responsible for
non-implementation of some aspects of the financial restructuring measures agreed under the FRP.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
ECG:
7.6.1  Satisfactory. It is noted that significant improvement in reliability and efficiency in the
distribution system was achieved. The physical components were completed later than projected at
appraisal mainly due to the unavailability of woodpoles and the poor financial position of the utilities. The
achievements under the mnanagement contract were limited. The overall system loss is high at about 27%
and the accounts receivable is about 120 days. The failure to achieve the rate of return and debt service
coverage ratios was due to the Government's tariff policy.
7.6.2  One of the sub-components in the Training and Studies Component was design and implementation
of a pilot program for productive uses of electricity. Even though a study was carried out, the pilot
program was not implemented. The study has, however, provided basic information to an EU-funded
project in the western region.
VRA:
7.6.3  Satisfactory. With the exception of the lapses on the procurement of vehicles and motor cycles
which in the end could not be completed within the extended credit period, VRA's implementation of its
physical components was satisfactory. However, like ECG, VRA was unable to achieve its financial
covenants during most of the project period. VRA's financial problems were outside of its control, as they
arose from the GoG's non-adjustment of power tariffs and from the ECG's difficulties in effecting complete
and timely payments for its power purchases from VRA. Therefore, VRA's overall performance is
considered satisfactory.
- 11 -



7.7 Overall Borrower performnance:
7.7.1   Unsatisfactory. The overall Borrower's performance is rated unsatisfactory because of the
Government's unsatisfactory perfornance in tariff regulation and implementation of the financial
restructuring measures agreed under the RFP.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1.1  The major lessons learned from the implementation of this project are in regard to: (i) financial
viability; (ii) the use of contract management as an instrument for public sector reform; (iii) the design of
procurement arrangements; and (iv) development of domestic contractor capacity.
8.1.2   Although being implemented in parallel with the ongoing Thermal Power Project which had a
component that addressed a power sector reforrn, the Project itself was not expected to be a vehicle for
power sector reforms. However, an important lesson is that such large utility expansion programs require
financial viability to sustain operations and maintenance once the investment has been completed. The
reforms under the Thermal Power Credit were to improve the prospects for the sector's financial viability.
The reforns assumed that independent tariff regulation would be key to ensuring cost recovery tariffs
which are also a must for the sector to attract private sector investment. However, Ghana and initial
experience from other countries suggests that independent regulation takes a much longer time to take root
and that a tariff regime that allows for automatic adjustments of those tariff components (e.g. fuel) affected
by factors outside the control of the utilities, helps to alleviate the overall problem. The PURC has
included this principle in its tariff setting guidelines, although it has yet to allow the utilities to implement
automatic adjustments.
S. 1.3 The performance targets specified in the management contract were not achieved for a number of
reasons specified in para. 4.27. The lesson from this experience is that the design of management
contracts needs to pay special attention to the following aspects: (i) that the contractor is given autonomy to
make key decisions and implement his proposed measures for improving performance; (ii) the payments to
the contractor should be linked to specific measurable outcomes consistent with the contract objectives; (iii)
baseline performance indicators should be verified unambiguously to facilitate evaluation of performance
amd performance-based payments to contractors; and (iv) in line with item (ii) the contract should
preferably be self-financing. In addition, the management contract should be seen as part of a transition to
a longer term efficient management arrangement for the utility, such as privatization. In the case of ECG,
the contractor's limited authority and the absence of a longer term strategy for maintaining the moderate
benefits secured by the contractor are significant factors in the modest outcome of this project component.
8.1.4  Ghana has achieved a substantial rate of access to electricity (about 35%) relative to the average
for Sub-Saharan Afiica (about 10%), almost exclusively through conventional grid connection. Rapid
expansion is now constrained by high costs compared to potential revenues as distant areas from the grid,
with low population densities and lower incomes, are targeted. A new rural energy strategy needs to be
developed which provides an enabling policy framework and low-cost design standards for the
sub-transmission and distribution works. On the policy framework, the key issues are cost reflective tariffs
(non-uniforrmi); subsidization scheme for investment costs (but not operational costs); light regulation for
rural and small schemes in a competitive market structure to allow for independent grids. External support
in formulating a revised rural energy strategy would help the Government to incorporate the lessons of
intemational experience in the strategy design.
- 12-



8.1.5   Coordination and consultation with local communities is important for successful implementation
of projects and achievement of the project's objectives. The involvement of local contractors, especially in
rural electrification projects, would also assist in addressing potential problems associated with local
communities.
