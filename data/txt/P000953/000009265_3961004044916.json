The project is\n            comprised of three main components:  (a) a portion of a time\n            slice of the investment program defined under an\n            IDA-financed National Electrification Planning Study, which\n            will include connection to the national power grid of all of\n            the district capitals that are not supplied from the grid;\n            (b) re-inforcement of the ECG's existing distribution\n            network by expanding substations, and building or replacing\n            major links between substations; and (c) institutional\n            strengthening of ECG through regrouping of all its\n            commercial activities under one directorate and hiring an\n            outside firm under a performance-based management contract\n            to run this new directorate."}, "docdt": "1993-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
