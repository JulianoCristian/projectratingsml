designed to extend existing facilities so as to enable about\n            70% of the demand for local telephone service to be met; it\n            will extend the long distance network to areas presently\n            without service, provide long distance dialing and open up\n            exchange service at 21 new locations; it also provides for\n            subscribers radio facilities at 100 isolated locations\n            (mainly community centers), will expand telex facilities to\n            meet demand for most of the country and provide a small\n            satellite earth station to improve and expand international\n            telecommunication facilities. Provision has been made for\n            technical assistance in project implementation and training.\n            The project faces no special risks beyond those commonly\n            associated with telecommunications projects."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
