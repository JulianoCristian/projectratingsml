APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Country Considerations
1.01      Nepal, extending from the Terai Plains in the south through
the Siwalik Hills and the Mahabharat Mountains to the peaks of the
Himalayas, is subject to both topographical and climatic extremes which
pose major problems in the development of an integrated economy. These
geographic features not only have hampered the development of road and
rail facilities but have also created problems in providing safe all-
weather airstrips; hence many areas are isolated and lack dependable
transportation.
1.02      More than 90% of the population of 13 million depend on
agriculture for employment, much of it at a subsistence level. There
has been limited development of agricultural production for export,
mainly jute, rice and lumber from the eastern and central Terai. There
has also been development of some industry in Kathmandu, Hetaura and
Biratnagar and tourism in Kathmandu and Pokhara. Tourism, in turn, is
facilitating development of secondary industries including food supplies
to the hotels and the production of artifacts.
1.03      One of the objectives of government is to create an integrated
economy out of the numerous "mini" economies which, due to the topography,
have historically had very little interconnection. Associated with this
is the problem of how to provide employment for people migrating to the
more fertile valleys and to the Terai. There is also need to provide
infrastructure for industry and tourism. The lack of adequate surface
and air communication underscores the need for a reliable telecommunications
network if efficient government administration and essential social
services are to be provided and public and private sector economic
development facilitated.
The Assdciation's Role
1.04      Until the early 1960's, telecommunication facilities in Nepal
consisted of a telegraph line to India supplemented by an HF radio station
and a 300-line manual telephone exchange in the Kathmandu area. Under a
US AID project, completed in 1964, a 1000-line automatic exchange was
installed at Kathmandu and low power HF radio links for telegraph service
were provided between Kathmandu and 57 other locations. These facilities
were still completely inadequate for effective administration and economic



development of the country and, in December 1967, the Nepalese Govern-
ment requested IDA assistance in developing the telecommunications sector.
Following the appointment of an ITU adviser in May 1968 and with the
cooperation of Bank staff, a suitable project was developed. This project -
financed jointly under Credit 166-NEP for US$1.7 million - signed on
November 10, 1969 - and an Indian AID grant was designed to be undertaken
during the period July 1968-July 1973.  There were initial delays in
obtaining expert assistance and in procurement. These were followed
by civil engineering problems so that completion was delayed by some
two years (some isolated components were further delayed).
1.05      A second Credit - 397-NEP - for US$5.5 million, signed on June 20,
1973, was designed to finance the foreign exchange cost of a second project
consisting of new works in the development program for the period July 1973-
July 1979. There has again been some initial delay in obtaining expert
assistance for preparation of specifications accompanied by lack of
continuity in management so that although the project is now proceeding
satisfactorily, completion is expected to be about 12 months behind schedule.
Due to higher costs than projected, mainly resulting from the need to provide
equipment with higher traffic capacity in Kathmandu, the number of new
exchange lines to be provided under the project had to be reduced by about
18% to maintain the cost of the project within the original estimates.
As at March 31, 1978, about US$800,000 had been disbursed.
Additional commitments of abouit US$4.0 million are likely to be entered
into before Dec. 1978.1/ In order to avoid similar delays in the future
bidding and other procurement procedures were discussed durlng
negotiations.
1.06      The Government of Nepal has now requested IDA financing for new
works in its third telecommunications development program to be carried
out over the period from July 1979 to December 1983. The estimated cost of
the project is US$25.6 million equivalent including US$210,000 equivalent
in respect of customs duties, with a foreign exchange cost of US$17.5
million. US$14.5 million of the foreign exchange cost will be financed
by the proposed credit and the balance of US$3.0 million is expected to
*be provided from bilateral sources. The IDA Credit will be onlent by
the Nepalese Government to NTC on terms agreed on with IDA. NTC
would generate the funds to meet the local cost of US$8.1 million from
its own sources.
1.07      While the second project is running substantially behind
schedule, it is important in view of the backlog in providing essential
services that the start of the third project should not be clelayed.
NTC have the capacity, with assistance proposed from contractors, to
complete the ongoing work and start the new project on schedule. By
(loing so, there are likely to be some scale economies through association
of similar project components. With the resolution of the previous
management problems, it is expected that the third project will be
completed on schedule.
1/ US$2.0 million are expected to be committed by June 1978, and another
USS2.0 million by December 1978.



-3-
1.08      The Association has contributed substantially not only through
providing funds for development of essential communications but also in
creation of a satisfactory sector organization. As a result of the
recommendations of the mission which appraised the first IDA )roject,
the Nepal Telecommunications Board (NTB) was created in October 1969
as a semi-autonomous agency with its organization based on the recommenda-
tions of consultants financed under the Credit. More recently, on
June 15, 1975, the government passed legislation converting NTB into
a government-owned and statutory corporation, Nepal Telecommunications
Corporation (NTC) which has increased operational and financial autonomy.
The British Ministry for Overseas Development has provided considerable
technical assistance in NTBs and NTCs initial operations. During the
early stages, four expatriate experts were made available; with the
development of local management capability only one now remains in
Nepal. Consultants were also made available for preparation of
specifications for the second project.
1.09      The performance audit report on the first project distributed to the
Executive Directors on January 3, 1978, comments on the delays in execution due
initially to difficulties in obtaining expert assistance and the sub-
sequent problems of carrying out civil engineering works due to the
difficult climate and topographical conditions. These resulted in
revenue losses of about US$0.2 million. Although there was a cost over-
run of about 26%, this was substantially due to local inflation during
the extended period of execution. In the absence of initial demand
data, forecasting of requirements was substantially carried out by IDA
based on international comparisons, actual demand has exceeded these
forecasts by about 30% but the audit concludes that greater accuracy
could not reasonably have been expected under prevailing conditions and
there are no indications that greater accuracy would have led to different
solutions, lower costs or better quality of service. The audit
instances as points of particular interest, the establishment of an
institutional framework for the sector with proper tools for effective
management. It also mentions that large likely impact on the country's
economy of development of communications in a country previously having
negligible facilities - further IDA lending will help to provide at
reasonable cost an upgraded national telecommunications network serving
an increased number of centers and improving access to the outside world.
IDA's participation is considered to be an essential factor in bringing
NTC to maturity and providing a satisfactory financial basis for further
development. NTC continues to need IDA's advice and assistance in the
technical, economic and financial aspects of its operations.
Access to Service
1.10      International statistics on telephones are contained in Annex 1.01.
Nepal currently has less than 13,000 telephones which gives it one of the
lowest telephone densities in the world; 0.10 telephones per 100 people.
A comparison with the main world regions shows:

Telephones per 100
North America               67.9
Central America             4.4

Bangladesh                  .09
Nepal                       .10
Existing Facilities
1.11      Local exchange facilities (four automatic and nine manual) and
long clistance serviice are now only available at Kathmandu, Patan, Biratnagar,
Pokhara, Birgunj and eight smaller towns. The number of main subscriber
lines at these centers is 8,800 with a waiting list of 9,000. The quality
of the local and long distance telephone service in Nepal is reasonably
satisfactory. An additional nine towns are being provided with exchange and
long dlistance service under the second IDA project (four by HF radio), and
as a result by 1979, 18 of the country's 75 administrative districts will
have access to the long distance telephone network. HF radio links operating
on a part-time basis provide a basic telegraph service to 79 other towns and
villages but due to the vagaries of HF communications and the distortion in
voice transmission, they are not reliable and are subject to corruption of
text. Teleprinter links exist in three of the 75 government district head-
quarters towns.
1.12      International telephone, telex and telegraph facilities operate to
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Tokyo via land line or HF radio.
The quality and reliability of these services is in many instances poor and
they have only limited capacity for expansion.  For the first five months of
1977, only 53% of the international calls booked in Kathmandu were success-
fully completed. Limited telex facilities are only available within the
Kathmandu Valley.
Note: The statistics used in paragraph 1.10 are based on "The World's
Telephones," an AT&T publication, and relate to total numbers of
telephones including extensions in addition to main subscribers'
lines.



- 5 -
1.13      Basic data on the network and the additional work being
undertaken under the second project are shown in Annex 1.02. The existing
telephone exchanges and long distance network together with the work being
undertaken under the ongoing project are also shown in Map 10246 Rl. The
existing HF radio network and single wire telegraph lines are shown in
Map 10245R.
Telephone Service Usage
1.14      In order to acquire a telephone, potential subscribers must:
(a) register on an official waiting list or
(b) rent an office or residence in which a telephone
is presently located.
When new telephone lines become available, priority allocation is given to
government offices, senior government officials, banks, government affiliated
corporations, medical doctors and the press. When priority allocations are
satisfied, any remaining lines are allocated to registered waiters on a
first come-first servedlasis with no distinction made between business or
residential applicants.- While, due to the present priority system and
the fact that many trading and operating corporations are government owned,
between 35% and 40% of total telephones are government lines, it is
expected that as service is extended and can be more freely provided,
the proportion of non-government to government lines will increase con-
siderably. For those unable to acquire a telephone there are twenty
public coin boxes or coin box subscriber telephones in the Kathmandu
area and one long distance public call office in each of the other twelve
towns with manual or automatic exchange service.
1.15    Reasonable estimates of the number of government lines have
been made but comprehensive data are not available on the character-
istics of other telephone users or for what purposes their telephones
are used. With such a small network and limited telephone access however
it is likely that a high proportion of non-government subscriptions and
traffic reflect business usage. A survey of telephone book listings for
two locations, Rajbiraj and Pokhara, show that 76 percent of the 91 listed
manual lines in Rajbiraj are clearly government or business, as are 61
percent of the 267 listed lines on the Pokhara manual exchange. These,
of course, are minimum estimates of government and business listings since
in both locations smaller businesses tend to list lines in the owner's
name and therefore cannot be readily identified from the telephone book.
1/ In 1976, 309 new lines were allocated in the Kathmandu-Patan area. Of
these and due to government priority, 184 were allocated to the government
sector and only 125 to business-residential subscribers.



-6-
Sector Constraints
1.16      The primary constraint in the sector is a shortage of inter-
mrediate and lowe,r level skilled technical manpower.  While the  technical
competence of the staff employed by NTC, down to and including the
assistant engineers, is acceptable, the situation in relation to technicians
and workmen needs improvement.  In 1971 application was made for UNDP
assistance in setting up a joint NTC/Civil Aviation Telecommunications
Training School. This project ran into difficulties when the Nepalese
Government decided in 1974 that all training should come under the control
of the national university. Neither the UNDP, NTC northe International
Civil Aviation Organization were happy with this arrangement as they wanted
the operating entities to have responsibility for technical training. To
resolve the difficulty, IDA proposed that instruction in theory and con-
cepts be undertaken through the university, supplemented by in-service
vocational training at the NTC School. This solution was accepted but
subsequently, in 1976, ran into difficulty due to shortage of UNDP funds.
A new project agreement has since been signed and the Project Manager and
three experts are now operating in Nepal. Recruitment of two further
experts had to be suspended however when the building constructed for
the two training schools was allocated for other purposes by the university.
Since further delays in improving and extending technical training could
be a major constraint to additional development of the sector, this matter
has been urgently pursued by NTC's General Manager with the support of the
IDA mission. During negotiations it was confirmed that a hotel
building (Hotel Shree), which the appraisal mission had inspected and
found suitable, is being purchased by NTC for use as a training
school.
SectoDr Objectives
1.17      The telecommunications development strategy in Nepal during the
initial stages of development has been to:
(a) establish communications in and between the towns
with the largest population and demand for services;
(b) establish an institutional framework for sector
developnment; and
(c) gradually develop a financial basis for future expansion.
1.18      Current strategy for development in the sector reflects the
above objectives along with an emphasis on expanding service to more remote
areas and with the phasing of such sector expansion related to national
development needs. The 1979-1983 program is designed to provide tele-
phone exchange facilities to 21 additional regional centers dispersed
across the country, including for the first time the far western region,



-7-
and to provide subscribers radio telephone facilities to almost 100
additional isolated locations. STD will be introduced in 19 automatic
exchange areas and telex facilities will be expanded in Kathmandu and
extended to all other main centers. Finally, the satellite ground station
will for the first time, provide reliable international telecommunication
links with most areas of the outside world.
1.19      To assist in making decisions on the proper rate of future tele-
communications expansion and on the extent to which telephone revenues
might be used to finance other government programs, government has
decided that, with IDA assistance, a small economic study of the sector
will be carried out.
1.20      Changes in selected parameters reflecting expected changes in
telephone service are as follows:

II. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The proposed beneficiary, NTC, is a government owned autonomous
corporation responsible for the provision and operation of all public tele-
communication services in the Kingdom of Nepal. Originally established as
a government department in 1959, the entity became semi-autonomous - as a
government board - in October 1969 and was converted into a government
statutory corporation in June 1975 (para. 1.08). NTC is designed to be
substantially autonomous in its operations with policy direction provided
by its Board of Directors. The legislation creating NTC is very broad
and needs supplementing by operating rules and regulations. Issue of
these rules and regulations has been delayed but the financial and
personnel sections have now been made available for IDA's review and
found acceptable. Other sections should continue to be made available as
agreed during the negotiations for the second Credit. Although further
development of methods and procedures is necessary (see paras. 2.05-2.08),
a satisfactory framework for sector organization has been established.
2.02      The Board of Directors of NTC is appointed by government and
consists of five members under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of
Communications who provides the main channel for commeunications of govern-
ment policy.
2.03      NTC's internal organization (Annex 2.01) is based on three
headquarters departments dealing with engineering, business/personnel
and accounting matters; a legal adviser, a small internal audit section
and the training school also report directly to the General Manager.
The main headquarters is responsible for directing NTCs operations,
coordinating the activities of the regions and producing consolidated
accounts for NTC as a whole. It also deals with planning development
programs and project execution for major projects. Day-to-day operations
are decentralized on a territorial basis with Regional Headquarters at
Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Birgunj. With the projected expansion of the
network, a fourth Regional Headquarters will be set up at Pokhara. The
regions are organized on the basis of having their own accounting
business/administration and engineering sections covering day-to-day
operations in the region. The accounting and auditing section in the
region will be strengthened in connection with the introduction of the
complete commercial accounting system in FY 1979 (para. 2.05). Regions
are themselves divided into telephone offices. The organization which
is based on the recommendation of consultants employed under the first
IDA Credit is considered satisfactory and can be expanded to mieet fore-
seeable growth of the network.
2.04      NTC's present manager and senior staff are satisfactory.
However, as indicated in para. 1.16, the vocational training of lower



- 16 -
grade staff is important to execution of the project, operation of
additional faciLities and improving productivity. It is important that
the training school project should not be constrained or further delayed
(para. 1.16). I[n stressing this need, achievements in improving productivity
to date should not be overlooked. Since 1969 with an increase in the size
of the telephone network from 1,700 to 8,800 lines (or 420%) together with
the provision of long distance and telex facilities, staff has only increased
from 1,200 to 1,400, an increase of 17%. Nonetheless, further improvements
in productivity are possible and desirable as even after allowing for the
staff employed on telegraph work (mainly the HF radio stations) the present
staff level of 110 per 1,000 lines is still very high.  Improvements can be
expected with additional training and also as the network continues to
expand due to scale economies so that it is expected that the staff level
will fall to 68 per 1,000 lines by 1984. During negotiations it was agreed
that the covenant to the existing agreement under Credit 397-NEP requiring
improved productivity should be repeated in the Project Agreement and
suitable targets were established.
Accounting
2.05      As required by the Association under the first Credit (166-NEP)
the then NTB retained consultants Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company to
review their organization and outline the basis for a new commercial
accounting system. This system was partly implemented for the accounting
of revenues but other items were still accounted for on a cash basis as
required for all state entities. The accounts were suitably adjusted at
the end of each accounting period to produce commercial financial state-
ments. The delay in the implementation of the system was mainly due to
lack of qualified staff.
2.06      NTC has now decided to introduce the complete commercial
accounting system in order to permit a more efficient control of
capital expenditures, inventories and accounts receivable. To achieve this,
NTC, in August 1977, contracted the local consulting firm, Kuber and Company,
which also acted as NTC's external auditors up to 1977. Kuber and Company
will, in collaboration with NTC's financial staff, complete design of and
fully introduce the new commercial accounting system, assist in the necessary
training of staff and supervise the working of the system up to one year
after the implementation. NTC employed a qualified accountant in 1976 and plan
to reinforce the accounting staff in 1978/79 to make sure the system works.
2.07      The preparatory work is going according to plan and routines
and accounts are currently being adapted in order to have the system fully
implemented in FY79. Governmental authorization through the Auditor General
may be needed however, to adjust inventories, receivables and fixed assets
in rase this would prove necessary.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) NTC wi:Ll fully introduce the new commercial accounting
system in FY79;



-  17 -
(b)  necessary adjustments of inventories, receivables
and fixed assets will be made; and
(c)  the financial statements for FY 1979 will be based
on the new accounting system including adjustments
mentioned under (b) above.
Billing and Collection
2.08      Bills are prepared manually in the local offices and the subscribers
are expected to pay them monthly after a one month grace period. Rentals
are billed in arrears instead of advance, which is the normal practice.
Accounts receivable in July 1977 equalled about three months' billing.
This is satisfactory considering that rentals are billed in arrears
and that receivables include a presently undefined amount of old and
uncollectable bills. This will be adjusted in connection with the
introduction of the new accounting system as from 1979, which should
reduce accounts receivable to about two months' billing.
Auditing
2.09      The external audit, as from the financial statements for FY77,
is carried out by the local auditors, Sharma and Company, under the terms
of the official Audit Act for state entities. Submission of the audit
reports, which are first reviewed by the Auditor General's Department,
has not been possible within the time of five months required under existing
covenants. No auditor's opinion on the commercial financial results,
whether qualified or not, has been included in the report. Except for the
delays in submission, these audit arrangements have been satisfactory to IDA.
2.10      The importance of timely submission of a commercial audit
report with an auditor's opinion on the commercial financial results
(especially from FY79 when the commercial accounting system will be
fully implemented) was discussed with the Auditor General ani the external
auditors. As the government audit will still be required, it was proposed
that a commercial audit should be prepared in parallel with the government
audit and sent directly to NTC who would supply the Association with a
copy. The Auditor General saw no objection to this proposal.
2.11      The internal audit department is a small group working directly
under the General Manager and consists mostly of clerks. To achieve a
more effective internal audit, NTC asked Kuber and Co., to prepare a
plan for reorganizatiun. This plan was prepared in August 1977 and will
be implemented in connection with the new commercial accounting system.
The main feature is that one audit officer will be stationed in each of
the five major regional offices reporting to the Chief Auditor in Kathmandu.
This will make the audit more effective. The reorganization plan was
reviewed and found satisfactory.



- 18 -
2.12      During negotiations assurances were obtained that, as from
FY79, a commercial audit with an auditor's opinion on the financial
resu'lts for the period, will be sent to the Association within six
months of the end of the fiscal year.
Tariffs
2.:L3     The principal present tariffs are set out in Annex 2.02, which
also gives details of the increases in local telephone and telex tariffs
to be implemented as from July 16, 1978. While international and long
distance tariffs were increased in 1975-76, local tariffs have basically
remained at the same level as in 1973. Present tariffs are lower than
in most comparable countries. In order to provide funds
for the local costs of the development program, a proposal to increase
the local telephone tariffs and telex charges was submitted by NTC to
Government,which approved it in March 1978. The new tariffs will enter
into effect as of July 16, 1978, and are expected to produce an overall
revenue increase of 30% in FY79. Implementation of the new tariffs and
connection fees as of July 16, 1978, is a condition for effectiveness of
the proposed Credit.
Insurance
2.14      The Government and NTC have, in view of the high cost of
insurance and the dispersion of NTC's assets, only considered it appropriate
to fully insure NTC's vehicle fleet. NTC's major buildings are insured
against fire risks. This is in line with the policy adopted by many
telecommunications administrations and is considered acceptable.

III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
3.01      Given the embryonic nature of telecommunications in Nepal,
the lack of penetration into many regions of the country, the extensive
waiting lists in those areas with some access to service and the poor
quaLlity of HF arid international links, it is difficult to accurately fore-
cast the future demand for telecommunication services. Historic demand
and traffic levels reflect in many cases a supply constraint rather than
the: demand which exists. The figures will therefore tend to under-
estimate the rapidity with which the demand for telephone service will
grcow as new areas gain access, the quality of service improves and sub-
scriber trunk dialing is introduced.
3.02      Nevertheless, given the constraints on supply, demand for
telephone service has grown at a rate of 20 percent per annum since 1969.
Guided by experience in other developing countries, it is considered
unlikely, even with the tariff increases which are expected to go into
effect in July 1978, that demand will grow at less than 15 percent per
year. The following NTC demand forecasts are therefore considered to
be conservative and present little danger of overprovision of
facilities.

Annex 3.01 shows historical and projected growth of demand and subscribers.
3.03      Long distance forecasts are based primarily on experience in
similar countries; traffic is expected to increase at 23% per annum over
the project period with an additional one time increase of 60% when STD
is provided. International traffic is expected to grow at a level similar
to Long distance but until such time as the satellite station is commissioned,
international traffic will also be artificially restricted. Telex demand has
been suppressed by the capacity of the Kathmandu exchange and the absence of
faci'lities outside Kathmandu.  The present telex waiting list of 32 is
almost equal to the 34 working subscribers. Demand in similar countries
is increasing at between 25 percent and 40 percent per annum. The lower
figure has been used in NTC projections, giving a total demand of 150 in
1981. when the new telex exchange is brought into service.

IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Project Concept and Composition
4.01      The project has been developed by NTC based on the market
assumptions made in Chapter III and a realization by government of the
sociological and economic benefits resulting from the first project and
the urgent need for further major expansion into areas so far not pro-
vided with satisfactory communication facilities.
4.02      The proposed project which is to be executed in FYs 79-83
provides for the following:
(a) An increase in telephone exchange and network capacity
to provide for 20,600 additional subscriber lines
including provision of 21 new exchanges (10 automatic
and 11 manual), and conversion of 6 existing manual
exchianges to automatic working (the recovered manual
exclhanges will be utilized elsewhere).
(b)  Extension of microwave and UHF/VHF radio systems and
land lines to serve a further 14 centers.
(c) Provision of subscriber radio facilities to 100
iso:Lated locations (mainly community centers).
(d)  Introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD)
at :L9 automatic exchanges.
(e)  Provision of automatic telex exchange facilities for
the country as a whole serving up to 400 subscribers.
(f) Provision of a small satellite earth station to
improve and expand international telephone facilities
and increase NTC's share of international revenues.
IProject Objectives
4.03      The project is designed to meet about 70% of total
quantifiable demand in existing areas and provide telephone exchange
facilities in 21 additional areas of administrative/economic/sociological
i'mportance.
4.04      Subscribers radio telephone facilities are to be provided to
about 100 other locations. STD will be provided at all automatic exchanges.



- 25 -
Telex facilities will be available to all centers connected to the
backbone long distance system to meet the needs of the industry, business
and to,-rism. A satellite ground station will improve and expand inter-
national telecommunication facilities. NTC are separately negotiating
with India to improve facilities on the Indian route by replacing the
land line by higher quality and capacity, microwave and coaxial cable
facilities. Such facilities already substantially exist within Nepal.
4.05      Parallel with the physical expansion of the telecommuni-
cations network, NTC will, with Bank advice and assistance, further
develop its institutional framework, management and technical expertise
and develop a satisfactory financial basis for its future expansion
operations. (Paras. 2.05-2.12).
Program Content and Costs
4.06      NTC's five-year (1979-83) telecommunications program estimated
to cost US$33.4 million equivalent consists of:
(a) completion of the ongoing project under 397-NEP
with estimated expenditures in FYs 1979 and 1980
of US$5.4 million equivalent;
(b) the proposed project costing US$25.6 million
equivalent;
(c) advance expenditures for buildings and down pay-
ments on equipment of US$2.4 million equivalent in
FY 1983 for the next development project.
Expected annual expenditures for the program and project are shown in
Annex 4.01.
Project Cost
4.07      The estimated cost of the individual project items is given in
Annex 4.02 and summarized in the following table:

- 27-
4.08      Project cost estimates are based on 1977 bid prices
or, in the case of the earth station, recent prices elsewhere. These
prices have been updated to take into account expected increases up
to June 1978 when NTC hope to initiate procurement. The c.timates
were reviewed with NTC during negotiations and were considered reasonable.
4.09      No provision has been made for physical contingencies in
that the project is essentially a time slice and the works are about the
maximum that NTC is able to undertake. Local price contingencies are
based on recent experience of changes in labor and building costs and
amount to a total of about 15% for the whole project period; some
buildings are already under construction. The foreign exchange price
contingencies are based on an annual increase in equipment cost of
7.0% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% from 1980 to 1983 as applied to the
date of the contracts which it is expected will, in the main, be on a
fixed price basis. As most orders will be placed during the early part
of the project cycle, the composite rate for the imported items works
out to a total of 11.8%.
Items for IDA Financing
4.10      The proposed IDA Credit would finance 83% of the foreign
exchange cost with the balance financed bilaterally. (Great Britain
have expressed interest in financing part of the project.) The
availability of suitable financing is a condition of effectiveness
for the Credit. Local cost will be wholly financed by NTC. Items
for bilateral financing have been selected on the basis of:
(a) Avoiding divided orders and loss of standardization
which can be a serious problem in a small country
with limited resources.
(b) Following ICB procedures where maximum financial
and technical advantage is likely to be obtained.
The items proposed for IDA and other financing, are as follows:

exchanges at all centers where these can be adequately maintained. These
will provide high quality 24-hour service with full privacy and also,
despite their higher initial cost per unit, offer cost advantages in
accommodation savings, operating costs and more effective use of the
long distance facilities. They are thus the least cost solution; however,
where maintenance presents problems and/or it is necessary to filter
traffic due to limited long distance facilities, manual exchanges will
be utilized. These are the correct technological solutions in such
circumstances.
5.02      Local network facilities are based on use of plastic cable
with pressurized main cables and filled distribution cables. Pro-
visioning periods are for five and twelve years respectively. Flexibility
is provided by means of distribution cabinets. These are considered
to be the optimum technological solutions at this stage of development
of the network.
5.03      Use of VHF subscribers radio telephones is the least cost method
of providing satisfactory service to isolated locations. Multi-channel
facilities are proposed for centers where a number of communities are to
be served and individual links in other cases. These are also the optimum
arrangements. The proposed provision of 100 of these subscribers' stations
will not only provide needed or improved facilities but will bring about
major savings in operating costs for locations already served by HF radio
sets which are reaching the end of their useful life.
5.04      In considering the expansion of long distance facilities, use
of microwave and UHF facilities has been related to expected growth in
demand over the life of the equipment and, on this basis, is the least
cost solution in each case. Introduction of STD facilities will result
in the provision of a rapid, reliable, secure and private long distance
service at least cost. Use of central automatic message accounting is
also the correct technological solution, taking into account revenue
and operating cost advantages.
5.05      Although the majority of Nepal's international traffic is
still with India, the development of tourism and expansion of trade
with other countries has resulted in major increases of traffic to
other parts of Asia, Europe and America. NTC has met demand in the
past through the provision of HF radio links, with two main routes at
present operating to Tokyo and Hong Kong. Traffic is expected to continue
to expand at about 23 percent per annum and demand forecasts indicate
circuit requirements to countries other than India of from 12 to 15
by 1980 and exceeding 40 by 1985.

Provision of a small satellite ground station is not only the
least cost solution for meeting these requirements but will offer signi-
ficantly more reliable and better quality service than would the expansion
of HF radio facilities.  The investment is likely to be very profitable
anc. it is estimated that in the first full year of operation, the net
profit after meeting all expenses will be in the region of US$250,000.
5.06      It is proposed to meet the demand for telex/gentex facilities
through the provision of a 400-line time division electronic exchange
at Kathmandu providing both internal and international services on a
subscriber dialed basis.  Subscribers outside of Kathmandu would be
connected to this exchange using VF telegraph channels or S+DX equipment.
These recently developed telex exchanges are competitive in price, are
space saving and offer better facilities and traffic capacity with lower
maintenance costs than older types of exchange. Teleprinters would be
of the semi-electronic type which offers maintenance cost advantages.
These are the correct technological and least cost solutions.
Project Implementation
5.07      Due to the need not to further delay provision of essential services
and for steady and continuous expansion inherent in telecommunications
development, the project will overlap the ongoing and a possible future pro-
ject. Building work should be undertaken and NTC should, due to the neces-
sary lead times, be in a position to place orders from mid 1978. However,
installation has been scheduled to take place over the period July 1979 to
July 1983 with full completion bv December 1983 (Annexes 5.n1 and 5.n2).
5.0S      All procurement under the proposed Credit would be through inter-
national competitive bidding other than 3,800 lines of exchange equipment
for expansion of existing exchanges and 500 channels of multiplex equipment
for expansion of facilities on existing routes. These should, on grounds
of standardization and economy be procured from the original suppliers
alr,sady selected after ICB. Total cost is estimated at US$1.2 million.
5.019     Technical assistance will be required within NTC's organization
for the detailed engineering of the earth station, automatic tele-
phone exchanges, telex exchange and STD equipment and for preparation of
specifications and evaluation of bids. Satisfactory arrangements for
obtaining technical assistance have been made a condition of effectiveness
for the Credit. NTC is taking action to obtain a suitable telecommuni-
cations switching expert and, subject to financing arrangements, will in
due course appoint a consultant for the earth station. The earth station
wil:L be installed by the suppliers. Assistance will also be required
froma the contractors for the installation of the microwave and UHF systems,
the automatic exchanges and in the training of staff for these
installations. IWith the installation and training assistance to be pro-
vided under equipment contracts, NTC should be able to carry out the project
and subsequently operate the network.

5.10      The targets for installation of new exchanges, additional
capacity and connection of subscribers are given in Annex 5.03. Micro-
wave and UHF system expansion will be phased to parallel local network
expansion. The earth station and new telex exchange are expected to
be brou6dkt into service in 1981 and provision of STD facilities from
1981 through 1983. Map 13525 shows the projected extensions to the
network.
Disbursements
5.11      The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed against 100% of
foreign expenditures for imported equipment, materials (including
installation) and training. Estimated disbursements from the proposed
Credit are shown in Annex 5.04. The closing date of the Credit would
be July 1984.
Performance Indicators
5.12      Performance indicators which should be established for the
project are set out in Annex 5.05 and will be used during supervision
to measure performance.

VI. FINANCES
Past Financial Performance and Present Position
6.01      Since 1974, NTC's financial performance has improved considerably
as reflected in the rate of return and operating ratio. At the end of
1977, NTC had a solid cash position and a satisfactory debt/equity ratio
for further expansion.
6.02      NTC's income statements for FYs74/77 are presented in Annex 6.01.
A summary is given below:
(NRs Millions)
Actual           Provisional
Years ending in July:      1974   1975   1976        1977

Rate of return (%)           1       2      8          8
Although NTC's financial performance has improved progressively under the
first project, it did not, due to the delayed expansion and upgrading
of the long distance service, meet the established rate of return targets
in FY75. In FY76, however, long distance revenues increased about 65%.
International tariffs were also adjusted upwards due to the devaluation
of the Nepalese Rupee. As a consequence, NTC's rate of return increased
to 8%, which compares favorably with the 5% as required for the 1975-79
period under the covenant to Credit 397-NEP.
6.03    NTC's balance sheets for FYs74/77 are presented in Annex 6.02.
A summary of provisional values for 1977 is presented below:
(NRs Millions)
Total fixed assets                                72.9
Current assets                         37.0
Less:  Current liabilities             (7.9)      29.1
Total Assets                                 102.0
Equity                                            70.1
Long-term debt                                    25.3
Other liabilities                                  6.6
Total Liabilities                             102.0
Debt/equity ratio                                27/73
Current ratio                                      4.7



- 40 -
The fixed assets are not revalued and the rate of return is based on the
historic cost value of net fixed assets in operation.  Nepalese inflation
before 1973 was very low. Influenced by worldwide price increases,
however, the accumulated local inflation in 1973-78 was about 40%. During
the same period the Nepalese Rupee was devalued against the U. S. dollar
by about 13%.  Yet, the value of fixed assets as stated in NTC's FY77
balance sheet reflects actual replacement values of the same assets
reasonably well. During the initial stages of development NTC's small
scale purchases, use of expatriate labor and lack of roads led to high
unit costs as c:ompared with current replacement costs for the same
equipment. No revaluation of existing assets is therefore currently
netcessary. During negotiations, NTC agreed to review the replacement
cost of its plant and equipment annually. In case of changes in
foreign prices and/or local inflation of more than 10% NTC will supply
values of its fixed assets in operation revalued, as from FY77 in
accordance with methods agreed with the Association.
6.04      At the end of FY77, provisional values indicate a debt/equity
ratio of 27/73, a current ratio of 4.7 and a debt service coverage of 3.5.
These ratios are satisfactory and would permit further borrowing for
the new development program.
6.05      Accounts receivable were NRs 5.4 million at the end of FY77.
This amount includes about NRs 0.3 million in outstanding bills to foreign
telecommunications entities for the NTC share of international calls and
a presently undefined amount of old and uncollectable bills. This will
be adjusted as of FY79 in connection with the introduction of the new
accounting system (see para. 2.08).

NTC's internal cash generation, net of debt service, plus subscribers'
deposits and pension fund, are expected to cover 32% of total capital
outlays for the 1978-83 period. Of the remainder, 54% would be financed
by the Association (397-NEP 13% and the proposed credit 41%), 9% is
expected from bilateral contributions and 5% from other sources. NTC is
expected to generate all necessary funds for its local capital expenditures.
6.07      The relending terms applied by government for the earlier
credits are 20 years, including a five-year grace period, with an average
interest rate of 7%.   Relending terms for the new credit were confirmed
during negotiations, to be the same, but with an interest rate of 9%.

Projected improvement in financial results for FY79 is mainLy caused by
the planned increase in local telephone and telex tariffs. Cn FY81 and
subsequent years, the introduction of automatic long distance dialing, the
completion of the earth satellite station and the telex exclhange are
expected to lead to substantially increased international and long distance
revenues with satisfactory financial results.
6.09      Projected revaluation of NTC's fixed assets are 6.6% in 1978,
6.2% in 1979 and 5.7% per annum thereafter, based on the expected average
increases in replacement cost of telecommunications plant and equipment.
Details are given in the comments to the projected balance sheet,
Annex 6.02. During negotiations NTC agreed to supply with the financial
statements as of FY79, gross value of its fixed assets and accumulated
depreciation, revalued in accordance with methods agreed between the
borrowers and the Association (para. 6.03).
6.10      Partly due to the delays in the second project (Credit 397-NEP),
NTC is expected to have a rate of return on revalued assets of 8% in
1980, which is short of the 10% as required for 1980 in the current cove-
nant. The covenant is expected to be met, however, aA of 1981. The
current covenant has been changed to reflect this situation. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from NTC that tariffs will be
maintained at a level to assure a minimum rate of return on average fixed
assets in operation of 8% in FYs79 and 80 and 10% thereafter.
6.11      At the end of FY83, NTC is expected to have an operating ratio
of 59%, a rate of return of 10%, a debt/equity ratio of 52/48, a current
ratio of 1.4 and a debt service coverage of 2.5. These ratios are con-
sidered satisfactory and leave a margin for financing of further expansion.
6.12      The fiscal impact, as detailed in Annex 6.04, will be favorable
for the Government, especially after 1984.
6.13      During negotiations it was agreed that the debt service and
the capital expenditure limitations covenants established under
Credit 397-NE:P would be repeated under the new loan and assurances were
obtained from NTC that:
(a)  no debt will be incurred without prior Association
approval, unless the preceding 12 months internal cash
generation would cover maximum future debt service at
1.5 times; and
(b) no additional works outside of the agreed program
involving a capital expenditure exceeding NRs 12.0 million
(US$1.0 million) will be undertaken during the project
per:iod without the prior agreement of the Association.

ANNEX 6.01

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Forecasts
Income Statement
1.        Local telephone revenues include installation charges, monthly
rental and metered traffic. The projections are based on the present
tariffs for 1978 and the new, 30% higher, tariffs as from 1979 onwards,
applied to the expected average number of subscribers during each year.
2.        Long distance revenues are expected to increase with the expan-
sion of facilities on an average 23% per year up to 1980. In 1981, the
introduction of automatic long distance dialing is expected to produce an
additional one-time increase of about 60%.
3.        International Revenues.  Due to the lack of adequate interna-
tion facilities up to 1980, revenues are expected to increase by about 10%
per year by 1978-80. In FY81 the completion of the earth satellite station
is expected to lead to a doubling of the traffic volume billed and a 50%
increase in NTC's part of the total revenue. As from 1982 international
revenues are expected to increase 25% per year.
4.        Telegraph revenues are expected to remain constant at the 1977
level during the period.
5.        Telex revenues are mainly international and are expected to
increase in proportion to the average number of subscribers up to 1980.
In 1981 the completion of the earth satellite station is expected to
increase NTC's part of the total revenue about 50% and the completion of
the 400-line telex exchange will permit connection of new subscribers. As
from 1982 the revenues are expected to increase about 25% per year.
6.        Miscellaneous revenues consist mainly of leased circuits and
are expected to increase NRs 100,000 per year.
7.        Wages, allowances and pensions are based on expected yearly
staff increases plus a 5% wage increase.
8.        Maintenance costs have been calculated as 1.5% of average gross
fixed assets in operation.
9.        Depreciation has been calculated at an average annual rate of
5.2% over gross fixed assets in operation. Depreciation on revaluations
are shown separately to facilitate comparisons with NTC's conventional
income statement.
10.       Miscellaneous expenses are mainly labor related and have been
calculated as one third of total wages.
11.       Interest has been calculated at an average rate of 7% for existing
credits and 9% for the proposed credit. No income from interest and no
capitalization of interest has been projected.
12.       Other non-operating items consist mainly of currency adjustments
on IDA-credits: 1976 an exchange loss of NRs 2.4 million and 1978 an
exchange gain of NRs 1.5 million.

Fixed assets are based on 1NCvs constructi DL pr.gram.  The
revaluation adjustments are based on the following assumptions:
(a) The 1977 book value of fixed assets reflect the current
replacement value reasonably well (see para. 6.03).
(b) Projected price increases, 1978-83:
Equipment      Civil Works
1978               7%              8%
1979               6.5%            7.5%
1980-1983          6.0%            7%
(c)  All equipment is imported.  Of this, 15% is equipment
which, clue to improvements in technology, is estimated
not to be subject to price increases.
(d)  Of total fixed assets, 70% is equipment and 30% civil works.
With these assumptions the average yearly revaluation adjustment will be:
1978               6.6%
1979               6.2%
1980-1983          5.7%
2.        Plant under construction is assumed to equal the year's capital
outlays that will say that each individual work is assumed to be put in
operation on an average one and a half years after the capital outlay was
made.
3.        Accounts receivable are expected to equal about two months of
billing as from FY79, when the new accounting and billing system is put
in operation.
4.        Inventories have been calculated as 3% of gross fixed assets in
operation.
5.        Other current assets advances, transitory items, etc., are
expected to increase 10% per year.
6.        Equity.  A bilateral (ODM) contribution of NRs 36.0 million for
financing of the telex exchange and the earth satellite station is
expecl'ed during the project period.  Other increases consist of retained
earnings and revaluation adjustments.
7.        Long-term debt up to 1978 consists exclusively of existing and
proposed IDA credits. In 1983 NRs 20 million from undefined sources have
been itncluded to finance expected foreign exchange costs of pre-investments
for the 1984-88 investment program.

8.        Current liabilities (excluding current position of long-term
debt) are expected to increase about 15% per year. Furtbgrmore, FYs8O-82
include current bills for civil works equal to about 3 months billing.
9.        The Pension Fund is expected to increase about 7% of total wages
per annum.
10.       Subscribers' deposits are based on expected number of connected
telephone and telex subscribers per year. For 1978 existing tariffs have
been applied and as from 1979 the new increased tariffs.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION
.0i      lThe economic analysis relates primarily to NTC's 1979-83
investment program of which the proposed project is an integral part.
Facilitating Economic Development
7.02      The 1978-1983 telecommunications investment program is a least
cost solution (paras. 5.01-5.06) specifically designed to support ov2rla--
ment's current economic development program. The telecommunications program
will: (a) improve the efficiency of government's regional development efforts
and essential social services;-(b-) assist government -in mobilizing domestic
resources, both for telecommunications investment and investment in
other sectors; (c) directly and indirectly facilitate the generation of
increased amounts of scarce foreign exchange, and (d) provide cost-saving
support for high priority directly pro&uctive investment.
7.03      Official government objectives include balanced regional develop-
ment and equality and popular participation in development. In Nepal, with
numerous remote areas and poor transport facilities, access to communi-
cations is a basic prerequisite for the achievement of balanced development
and, given existing topographical and transport constraints, some form of
telecommunications is in most instances the least cost means for maintain-
ing even rudimentary nation-wide communication.
7.04      The existing ongoing and proposed long distance network expansion
will provide a high quality telecommunications network serving most of the
main centers in the country; Nepal has an additional need to provide
satisfactory service to isolated locations,mainly community centers and
government headquarters, a number of which are presently served by the
unreliable and poor quality point-to-point HF telegraph network. The
development of a VHF subscribers network will enable high quality and
reliable service to be extended to some 100 points which lie within about
30 miles (depending on topography) of exchanges or microwave radio stations
forming part of the main network. As a result, significant portions of
the country will for the first time have access to quick and reliable
communication with the major government and administrative centers.
7.05      Indirectly the telecommunications investment program should impact
most noticeably on the tourist industry which in the short term is Nepal's
best potential foreign exchange earner and which has been growing at between
20 and 30 percent per year. Currently airlines, hotels and travel services
are significantly constrained in their operations by inadecuate and un-
reliable international communication and as a result suffer frequent
room and aircraft seat occupancy problems. The planned telecommunications
investment program should in improving international communications
significantly improve the revenue-generating efficiency of Nepal's
communications-dependent tourist industry. Foreign exchange expenditures



- 51 -
on the project will be offset by fairly major foreign exchange savings
in other sectors. These will include savings in purchase of transport
vehicles, aircraft and fuel due to the more efficient use of facilities
made possible by telecommunications. More effective use of local
expertise with a reduced need for outside assistance will be possible
through the substitution of telephone communications for face-to-face
communication. Savings in foreign exchange through provision of the
earth station are significant and are dealt with in para. 7.09. Finally,
efficient agricultural production for export or domestic use will benefit
from improved telecommunications in coordinating transport, arranging
sales for fertilizer supplies and facilitating deliveries.
7.06      Expanded telex facilities are considered essential to transactions
where a written record is required and are extremely profitable in operation.
Although the major part of demand will continue to be at Kathmandu, there
are already known requirements for industry and tourism at Biratnagar,
Hetaura, Birgunj, Pokhara and Bhairawa. Fortunately, with recent
technological developments it is practicable on a least cost basis to
provide both countrywide and international service from one exchange
located in Kathmandu.
7.07      Finally, Nepal's public sector has difficulty generating
sufficient revenue for government development programs. The ratio of
government revenue to GDP is a low six percent. As a result, government
savings are declining and the need to mobilize domestic resources is
acute. In view of this, telecommunications represents a viable means
by which domestic revenue can be mobilized for use in other sectors.
With the July 1978 tariff increase, NTC will by 1984 be generating
approximately US$2 million per year in excess of its own needs which
could be made available to government. With the additional tariff increase
suggested for 1984, approximately US$4 million could be generated for
general governmental use.
7.08      Using telephone tariffs partly as a source of taxation is con-
sidered acceptable on administrative, social equity and economic efficiency
grounds. On administrative grounds such a tax is easy to collect and
difficult to avoid. On efficiency grounds, given the current and projected
existence of a significant quantity of unsatisfied demand for telephone
services, charging prices higher than the marginal physical (and average)
cost of supply should have favorable implications, since it will tend to
ration telephones to those government and business-related uses which have
the greatest priority and the highest rates of return. On social equity
grounds, the tariff will tend to serve partly as a form of progressive
taxation. With Nepal's limited national telecommunications system, a
large proportion of non-government telephone and telex users will be business
or higher income subscribers. Thus excess telecommunication revenues contributed
primarily by higher income users and used for general governmental development
purposes, should have favorable income distribution implications.



- 52 -
7.09      The telecommunications investment program will also directly
or indirectly facilitate the generation of significant quantities of
foreign exchange. Directly, the satellite ground station, in addition
to opening up reliable and high quality international communications
on all routes will save the country scarce foreign exchange since NTC's
share of international revenues will increase. In 1984, after completion
of the project, foreign exchange savings will amount to about US$200,000
and should continue to grow in excess of 20% per year thereafter.
Return on Investment
7.10      The internal rate of return attributable to the project is
5%.  This low rate of return simply indicates that existing telecom-
munications tariffs are too low and that subscribers are not being
given an adequate opportunity to express the value of telecommunications
to them. Under the assumption that consumers will willingly pay the
increased tariffs which NTC expects to charge after July 1978 and a
further increase in 1984 to compensate for expected inflation, the rate
of return is 18% (Annex 7.01). Sensitivity analysis shows that under
the most unfavorable combination of main parameters (increase of 10%
each in capital and operating costs and 10% decrease in revenue), the
rate of return would not be less than 13%.
7.11      This rate of return is, however, an understatement of total
program benefits since it does not include consumer surplus, a complete
estimate of the value of national and international travel and call time
which will be saved through a reduction in the proportion of unsuccessful
call attempts and many of the benefits incurred by receivers of calls,
by existing subscribers when new subscribers join the system and by those
who benefit indirectly through the better administration of tourism,
regional development, health, transport, energy and agricultural programs,
and increased urban and regional business and government efficiency.
7.12      Benefits are also underestimated because while the costs included
in calculating the internal rate of return are those for extending and
upgrading the network and providing new facilities now, the full benefits
are not included because the available capacity of various components of
equipment will only be fully utilized when additional investment is made
in the future. Thus, the costs incurred during the 1979-83 period will
generate additional untabulated benefits during the period following
1984.

Return on Investment
1.        Benefit Period.  The benefit period of the program extends
from 1979 to 2000, when on average the equipment provided under the
program is expected to have substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital Expenditures  for ongoing works included in the
previous program and preinvestments for next program (1984-88) are
excluded. All price contingencies have been excluded from the
capital expenditures for the 1979-83 program.
3.        Operating costs and revenues have been deflated with 8.5%
per annum in 1978-83 to make them comparable with the capital ex-
penditures at FY1978 price levels. As from 1985, operating costs
and revenues related to the programs are assumed to remain constant
in real terms. Incremental revenues assigned to the program are
based on the increased tariffs as from July 1978 and expected additional
telephone and telex subscribers and traffic brought about by the program.
In 1981 the completion of the earth satellite station and the telex
exchange is expected to cause a steep increase in international revenues.
In addition to the planned tariff increase in July 1978, tariffs
are expected to be raised 50% in FY1984 to compensate for estimated
inflation during 1979-83. Subscribers deposits have been treated
as revenues when collected. Incremental operational expenditures exclude
depreciation and interest and are based on additional assets and traffic
generated under the program.
4.        No rest values of fixed assets or repayment of subscribers
deposits at the end of the benefit period have been taken in account
as the discounted real value of these would be minimal in FY1978.
5.        Net Benefits.  A summary of the program's cost and benefit
streams at FY1978 price levels is as follows:

The internal rate of return for the net benefit stream above is 18%.
6.        Sensitivity Analysis.  A sensitivity analysis was performed
with the following results:
Rate of Return
10% increase in capital expenditures                 16%
10% increase in operating costs                      17%
10% decrease in revenues                             15%
Combination. of all factors above                    13%
