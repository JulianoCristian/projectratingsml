1. Project Context, Development Objectives [or Global Environment Objectives] and
Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

During the project preparation and appraisal periods, the Bank’s dialogue with the Government
of Brazil (GOB) on transport was dominated by three main concerns: (i) country or
macroeconomic issues that related to overall fiscal discipline and the quality of public sector
management as it affected infrastructure decisions, and consequently logistic costs and
competitiveness; (ii) transport sector issues that centered on the continuation of Bank supported
reforms to adapt sector organization with an aim at fostering decentralization and increasing
participation of the private sector in the financing and management of the sector; and, (iii) road
subsector issues with particular emphasis on reversing the rapid deterioration of the national road
infrastructure suffering from years of low investments that was resulting in high logistic costs,
reduced competitiveness and impaired growth.

Countrywide macro issues. By the early 2000’s, the economy of Brazil was progressively
recovering from a series of economic and financial crisis including double-digit inflation till the
instauration of the “Plano Real” in 1994 and the propagation of the Asian crisis to the rest of the
emerging world at the end of the 1990’s. Such recovery, traduced in a slow economic growth
compared to other countries, required stringent fiscal constraints which, combined with rigidities
in budget management caused by earmarking and protection of particular expenditures, resulted
in substantial under-spending on discretionary outlays, particularly in infrastructure. By Project
preparation in 2005, the Government’s overall strategy to gradually resolve infrastructure
bottlenecks was to: (i) accelerate structural fiscal reforms to reduce spending rigidities and
increase the share of investments in public expenditures4; (ii) prudently resume investment in
infrastructure via the design and implementation of a Pilot Investment Project (Projeto Piloto de
Investimento, PPI 5, endorsed by the IMF) aimed at directing resources not subject to budget
freeze toward high-priority investments (one of the components of the PPI was the rehabilitation
of part of the Federal Road network under the Federal Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Program (PREMEF)6 supported under this subject project); (iii) improve systems to assess and
manage public investments so as to strengthen the quality and efficiency of budget expenditures;

4
  The program was supported by a series of Bank financed adjustment loans: the First Programatic Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (P070640) and 2nd Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (P066259) with the total
value of US$808.08 in 2002.
5
  The PPI aimed at, within a still tight fiscal framework, earmarking extra resources beyond budgetary allocation
(thus not subject to budget freeze) (up to 0.5% of GDP over the 2005-2007 period) to support a selected few key
infrastructure investment programs, recognizing that: (i) demand for infrastructure investment was far greater than
availability of funding, and as such, a prioritization was required based on the programs’ expected economic returns;
and (ii) a number of infrastructure investment programs were not optimally designed, or were to be executed by
entities with low capacity, which could have put program implementation performance at risk. The planning and
execution of programs under the PPI was coordinated and monitored by an inter-ministerial working group in charge
of, inter alia, identifying implementation issues beyond the competence of the sector ministry/agency, and propose a
Government-level solution to resolve the issues (e.g. lack of staffing issues needs to be dealt with jointly by the
sector ministry, the Planning and Finance Ministries, as well as the National Congress).
6
  The Federal Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program, with an estimated cost of US$2.9 billion over a period
of eight years (2005-2012) was to rehabilitate about 30,000 km of road sections. The Project was to support the first
phase of the Program.

                                                         1
and (iv) foster both decentralization for infrastructures of local interest and increased
participation of the private sector, through the strengthening of the legal and regulatory
environment for private investment.7 Key to this strategy was the recognition that many sector
issues transcended sector agencies and there was a need for inter-ministerial decisions to ensure
the efficiency and quality of the investments. This in turn generated increased demand
(particularly from the Ministry of Finance) for (i) transparency in road administration
performance; (ii) greater efficiency in all operations; (iii) more cooperation and coordination
across the transport sector; and (iv) more data and more efficient data management.

Transport sector institutional/organizational issues. In 2001 and 2002, the federal
Government undertook, with Bank inputs, a re-organization of the federal transport
administration by: (i) substituting the National Road Department (DNER) by a federal land
transport department (DNIT); (ii) creating regulatory agencies in the transport sector, one in
charge of land transport (ANTT) and the other one in charge water transport (Water Transport
Regulatory Agency - ANTAQ); (iii) abolishing the Transport Planning Agency (GEIPOT); and,
(iv) reorganizing the Ministry of Transport, to consolidate planning and management capacity in
the sector with a view to reduce high logistic costs and gradually change the national transport
matrix characterized by a modal split over-dependent on the road sector. This reform followed
the 1993-1995 reform to transfer part of the Federal road network considered of local interest
(about 20,000 km) as well as the management of highway sections with sufficient traffic,
expected to be contracted out to the private sector (about 10,000 km)8.

While the main drivers of this reorganization were undoubtedly legitimate to increase efficiency
in the management of the sector at the time the reorganization was undertaken, fostering both a
more integrated and multimodal vision of the sector and an optimization of the overall
management of the sector where the best fitted institution would be in charge of the management
of a particular infrastructure, combined with private financing to leverage public investment, the
outcome of the reform did not fully reach the expectation and a number of issues remained to be
addressed. These were related inter alia, to: (i) limited success of multimodal integration and
reduced planning capacity with the disappearance of some technical skills together with the
GEIPOT; (ii) limited success of the transfer of federal roads of local interest to state
jurisdictions, due to a disagreement on the modalities of the transfer9; (iii) slower than expected
concession program and sparse development of the PPP program, notably as a result of a less
than optimal regulatory framework10; and, (iv) insufficient strengthening of the managerial and
technical capacities in many of the sector institutions, where capacities that had been depleted
during the previous decades have still not been restored, procedures are yet to be rationalized and
management systems continue to be scattered and unreliable.


7
   These efforts were supported by the Federal Highway Decentralization and Rehabilitation Project (P006532) and
the First Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth (P080827), as well as the ongoing companion
technical assistance loan (P080827).
8
  Brazilian regulation distinguishes concession, self financed from tolls (1993 law on concession), from PPP (2004
law on PPP) where the public can in principle participate to the funding of the operation.
9
  The management of 14,500 km of federal roads has remained in a limbo between 2002 and 2008 as a result of this
disagreement, and ended with an additional cost for the national economy estimated at R$6 billion between 1999
and 2017.

Road subsector issues. The condition of the federal road network had deteriorated by the early
2000s to the point that more than 50% of the roads were not in good condition and if no
substantial program of rehabilitation was undertaken, a substantial part of the federal road asset
network would be lost. Several factors contributed to this situation: (i) First, the levels of
resources available for road maintenance and rehabilitation had sharply declined and payments to
contractors had become erratic (resulting in “stop and go” in contract execution) since the
beginning of the 1990s as a result of the rigorous fiscal adjustment policy that was essentially
carried through reductions in capital expenditures rather than current expenditures; (ii) Second,
the sector administration had been unable to adjust the road sector policy to the decrease in
available resources, and as a result it tended to spend resources over too many contracts, with the
consequence that most ended being under-funded; and, (iii) third, the federal road
administration’s capacity for planning and execution of road interventions on the network
deteriorated substantially. By the mid-2000s, the macroeconomic linkages of the deteriorating
road infrastructure (the prevalent transport mode in the country) with the logistics costs became
so evident that the PREMEF was finally fully included as a key component of the Program of
Acceleration of Growth (Programa de Aceleracao do Crescimento, PAC)11, a large program
building on the success of the PPI for the development of infrastructures launched in 2007 by the
Federal Government.

Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at appraisal, discussed by the Bank’s Board of
Directors on December 9, 2003, consisted of the following three pillars: equity, sustainability,
and competitiveness. The CAS emphasized the necessity for the Bank to consider economic
growth as an equal priority with social equity and fiscal balance. The CAS noted that without
faster and sustained growth it would be increasingly difficult to support these two other
important objectives. The Bank’s assistance to the transport sector development was considered
as one of the key drivers to increased competitiveness in domestic and external markets, thus
enabling a higher rate of economic growth, while improving the effectiveness of social service
delivery.

At the time of the Project preparation, the Bank had had a long-standing, continuous and fruitful
relationship with Brazil in the transport sector. This partnership had notably led to major reforms
such as the initiation of the road concessions program (1993), the privatization of the railway
sector (1995), the introduction of performance based contracts (CREMA) program (2000), the
already mentioned institutional organization reform (2002). Hence, the Bank was recognized as
a credible actor able to help the Federal Government in its overall objective to improve sector
efficiency and foster economic growth. The Bank contribution was expected to be twofold: it
not only provided a sustained increase in expenditures as well as a more predictable and smooth
flow of funds under the PREMEF through a large loan but more importantly the Government
requested the Bank to provide continuous hands-on support to their efforts to improve quality of
expenditures in the road sector and foster the sector attractiveness to the private sector. In fact,
the Government specifically asked the Bank to use the supervision of the project as a vehicle to

  Planned investments under PAC totaled R$504 billion in 2007-2010, including transport, energy water, and urban
infrastructure. PAC was managed by the PAC Management Committee (Comitê Gestor do PAC (CGPAC))
consisting of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and the Chief of Staff.

strengthen Bank support to the sector, allowing an expanded team of Bank staff to work together
with Government representatives on, among others, the following topics: improved planning and
M&E of public expenditures programs, enhanced quality of public spending in the transport
sector, treatment of contingent liabilities, private financing of infrastructure, design and
evaluation of public-private partnerships and consolidation of regulatory capacity. Such
strengthened support was completed by a specific AAA in 2007-2009 on “How to improve the
quality of expenditures in the Road Sector” which led to the preparation of 5 papers and notes, 3
of which were published as World Bank Transport Papers12.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to: “stimulate higher economic growth by
increasing effectiveness in the use of the federal road infrastructure. The objective is to be
achieved through (a) support to the first Phase of the Federal Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Program, and (b) a comprehensive program of institutional strengthening
activities to improve efficiency and sustainability of road transport investment programs”.

The project was expected to contribute, through reduction of road transport costs, to increased
competitiveness in domestic and external markets, thus enabling a higher rate of economic
growth. In addition, improved transportation would have important social benefits, by facilitating
access to social services and reducing travel times. Finally, the project was expected to
contribute to enhanced sustainability of transport investment programs, by supporting the federal
transport infrastructure agency in improving the effectiveness of its environmental and social
impact mitigation policies.

The Key Performance Indicators to be monitored during implementation were:
    Average land transport rates on selected main transport corridors in Brazil;
    Proportion of road user distance traveled on good condition highway; and
    Proportion of paved network length effectively maintained by private contractors with
      output-based contracts.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The above development objective and key indicators remained unchanged during the project
execution period.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the project were road users of the federal road network through
reduction of transport costs. Ultimately, those benefits were expected to stimulate economic
activities and spread the benefits of the project to the population at large in Brazil. In addition,
improvement of efficiency of road infrastructure management would save public expenditures,
which led to benefits to taxpayers, i.e. the whole population of Brazil. Immediate beneficiaries of

the project included: (i) the National Department for Transport Infrastructure (DNIT); (ii) the
National Land Transport Regulatory Agency (ANTT); the (iii) Ministry of Transport; and, (iv)
the Ministry of Finance.

1.5    Original Components

Component 1: Support to the Federal Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program.
This component was to support the Government in improving the efficiency of the Federal Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program aiming at improving the condition of the federal paved
road network so as to reduce road transport costs and facilitate ever-growing passenger
movements. The project was to support the first phase of the Program over the 2006-2009
period, with an estimated cost of about US$1.4 billion, which would allow rehabilitation of over
16,000 km of the federal road network. The component was to ensure that: (i) an adequate level
of resources would be allocated to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the federal road
maintenance and rehabilitation program to improve the road network condition to economically-
optimized levels, taking into account fiscal constraints; and, (ii) the quality of public
expenditures in the road sector would be improved through: (a) an expansion of the use of
output-based contracts; (b) streamlining DNIT's procedures to manage contracts, including
revision of design, procurement, contract award and supervision, as well as payments; and, (c)
strengthen DNIT's contract supervision capacity.

Component 2: Institutional strengthening in the transport sector. This component would
finance technical assistance activities as follows:

Ministry of Finance Component: supporting the National Treasury Secretariat in: (i) designing
and implementing a system to evaluate and monitor public investment programs, including, inter
alia, those included under the Pilot Investment Project; (ii) designing and implementing a system
to evaluate and monitor the fiscal impact of public investment programs, including concessions
and public-private partnerships; (iii) undertaking studies to identify opportunities to improve
efficiency of spending; and (iv) conducting training of federal agencies' staff to disseminate
studies' recommendations.

Ministry of Transport Component: supporting the Ministry in: (i) elaborating and implementing
the Borrower's strategy to proceed with transfer of federal road sections of local interest to the
Borrower's states; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry's department in charge of
evaluating proposals for concessions and public-private partnerships, through the elaboration and
implementation of a strengthening plan, and the undertaking of the necessary technical and
financial studies for a first set of pilot public-private partnerships; and, (iii) providing training to
staff in the following areas: structuring of public-private partnerships, transport economy,
strategic planning and improvements to quality of public spending.

National Department for Transport Infrastructure (DNIT) Component: supporting the
strengthening of DNIT's capacity to: (i) improve the social and environmental assessment and
mitigation measures in the transport sector; (ii) enhance procurement and financial management;
(iii) modernize information management; (iv) strengthen human resources management; and, (v)
build technical capacity on road infrastructure management.


                                                   5
National Land Transport Regulatory Agency Component: supporting the Agency in: (i) further
strengthening its regulatory framework; (ii) completing and consolidating its information and
management systems, with the additional strengthening of systems to manage human resources,
international road transport, and supervision of road concessions; (iii) structuring the Agency's
regional offices; (iv) establishing performance indicators to measure the Agency's efficiency; (v)
preparing and executing in-depth training programs for new staff, and of refreshment training
programs for existing staff; and, (vi) undertaking preparatory studies aimed at increasing private
sector involvement in the management of the paved federal road network, by identifying
opportunities for, and structuring concession with and without public subsidies.

1.6    Revised Components

There were two project restructurings involving revisions of the components, mainly to ensure
that the Project could support specific initiatives from the Beneficiaries to contribute to the
Project’s objectives.

The first restructuring took place on March 23, 2010, including into the technical assistance
component to the Ministry of Transport the provision of training and the carrying-out of studies
in, inter alia, the following areas: public-private partnership, transport economics, strategic
planning, improvement of the quality of public spending and waterways.

The second restructuring approved on June 27, 2011 consisted in turning bridge maintenance
and/or rehabilitation works and/or widening bridge decks eligible to Bank financing. In addition,
further reformulation in the definition of the technical assistance component allowed to: (i)
include other types of transport modes beyond the road modality when analyzing private sector
participation; and, (ii) undertake studies that aimed at enhancing strategies and planning in
various transport modes, including studies such as: (a) the National Master Plan for Inland
Waterways: (b) Sao Paulo Rail Ring Road: and, (c) the calibration of the HDM (Highway
Development Management) software to the specific conditions in Brazil. Meanwhile, part of the
proceeds of the loan for the technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance was cancelled to
refocus and consolidate Bank support to the transport sector.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

Extensions of the closing date: A first extension of one year was granted in March 2010 because
of delays in Project implementation, notably resulting from the 19 months initial delays in
turning the Project effective and the inclusion of the new eligible works mentioned above. The
original closing date of June 30, 2010 was extended to June 30, 2011. The second closing date
extension of 11 months to May 31, 2012 was granted in June 2011, and was requested to: (i)
allow for further progress of institutional development component; and, (ii) reallocate loan
proceeds between categories of works (see below). Finally, a third extension of one year was
granted on May 31 2012 to allow for a more substantial finalization of the institutional
development component, which had been subject to delays. The closing date was extended to
May 30, 2013.



                                                6
Reallocation of Funds: The second restructuring also included: (i) reallocation of funds between
categories; and, (ii) cancelation of US$60 million of unused funds in the Works Category,
Goods, non consultants’ services, consultants’ services and training Category, and Unallocated
Category. This cancellation followed the decision of the government to take advantage of the
formidable improvement in the country’s external accounts to prepay outstanding debt and
cancel non-committed funds in ongoing projects so as to increase headroom for additional
subnational lending. In the case of this project, the cancellation affected only traditional contracts
but not the performance-based contracts.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Project quality at entry was satisfactory

The project was fully in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). As mentioned in
1.1, the CAS of December 2003 emphasized the need for the Bank to consider economic growth
as an equal priority with social equity and fiscal balance. Reducing road transport costs through
increased investments and improved sector governance was key to increasing competitiveness in
domestic and external markets, thus enabling a higher rate of economic growth. The CAS also
identified the sector-wide approach (SWAp) as an adequate method to be pursued in Brazil, on
the grounds that it enables linking financing to results and would increase the systemic benefits
of Bank support, through added commitment, impact and flexibility. The SWAp approach to
investment lending was considered particularly suited for sectors where the organization and
operation was well understood by the Bank, and when implementation progress can be based on
concrete outputs, which was the case of Brazil’s road sector.

Lesson learned from other projects were incorporated in a highly innovative way. These
lessons included: (i) traditional sector investment projects did not allow a development impact at
the level of the Brazilian Government programs in the sector (“ring-fenced” approach), given the
sheer size of the programs and the need to focus attention on specific transactions, rather than
program outputs; (ii) traditional sector investment projects, focusing on supporting activities of
sector ministries, were not reaching key stakeholders whose decisions have strong impact on
sector investment project execution performance such as, e.g. decisions on levels of budgets and
staffing, which are typically taken by central ministries; (iii) traditional investment projects were
not achieving the objective of ensuring adequate budgetary allocations and payment discipline to
contractors, largely because: (a) the implementing agencies’ budgets and payment cash flows
had to be set at low levels for public finance reasons; and (b) at the federal level, budget ceilings
were determined independently of the source of financing, including that from external sources;
and, (iv) traditional investment projects were not providing adequate incentives to the Ministries
of Finance and Planning to be fully involved in sector project design and execution, a clear
drawback when the Borrower operates with fully-funded budget and high levels of earmarked
funds.

Project design was highly innovative as well as pragmatic to foster a rapid and efficient


                                                  7
implementation of the PREMEF:
   i. the approach was a wide support to the national road rehabilitation program (not a
      selection of pre-identified roads), all works being a priori eligible, provided it met a
      number of selection criteria (such as economic rate of return, management following
      specific advanced fiduciary rules agreed upon with the Client as detailed in v. and vi.
      below, etc.);
  ii. the focus was on rehabilitation and maintenance performance-based contracts (CREMA),
      an innovative road contract management approach introduced by the Bank in Brazil in
      the early 2000’s, via a differentiated pari passu on those works (100%) compared to
      traditional admeasurement contracts (between 70 and 85%, depending on the
      achievement of specific indicators – see v. below). Performance-based (CREMA)
      contracts have proved to be better performing than traditional admeasurement contracts
      by a factor 30%13;
 iii. the project benefited from a substantial Project allocation (US$500 million in 4 years,
      including US$480 million on works) in comparison to the average size of Bank’s loans in
      the early 2000’s. This amount was also large compared to usual levels of disbursement of
      the Federal rehabilitation program early 2000, at about US$250 million yearly;
 iv.  the project focused on mainstreaming works cycle management within the Government
      Program including on the design, procurement, execution and supervision of works.
      Incentives to improve under those specific aspects were given to the Government through
      the design of specific and precursor Disbursement Link Indicators increasing the level of
      disbursement under the loan depending on the achievement of particular indicators linked
      to those aspects (see v. below);
  v. a linkage between disbursement rates and the road agency performance was designed for
      a set of selected indicators to serve the objective of the Project: 11 indicators covering the
      main challenging areas for improving effectiveness in the road sector as identified during
      preparation (in, e.g. human resources, planning and finance, procurement, contract
      management, as detailed in the PAD). Some of those indicators were part of the Project
      monitoring framework. Depending on the achievement of those indicators, the
      disbursement rate for traditional admeasurement rehabilitation contracts would grow
      from 70 to 85% of expenditures. This technique identified as Disbursement Link
      Indicators (DLI) during preparation and execution, was one of Bank’s first tries to link
      disbursement with performance on the execution of specific sector policies in Investment
      Project Financing (IPF);
 vi.  based on a thorough procurement assessment at preparation, in line with Bank actual
      practices in the context of the new lending instrument PforR, eligibility criteria for works
      to be financed under the project were tailored to Brazil’s mature economy. As a result: (i)
      the ICB threshold was raised on an exceptional basis at that time to US$ 20.0 million
      from US$10 million; and, (ii) national procurement for smaller works was accepted for
      the first time in Brazil (no need to use Bank templates for NCB), all contracts tendered
      following national procurement rules turning potentially eligible to Bank financing as
      long as a small number of specific pre-identified clauses of the national procurement
      rules were not applied to the cases (e.g. rejection for too low bids).

While there is no clear definition nor consensual view of the notion of Sector Wide Approach
(SWAp) in the Bank, a concept developed in the mid-2000’s 14 to address specific needs of the
Bank’s most advanced clients, the Project was identified as one of the Banks’ first SWAps
during both preparation and execution. As such, the Project, prepared between 2003 and 2005,
was, together with other contemporaneous SWAps, a precursor for a number of other SWAps
both in Brazil and other countries and beyond, the Bank’s new lending instrument, the Program
for Results (PforR).

A rich institutional strengthening dialogue. The Project also envisaged supporting a rich
institutional dialogue with the beneficiaries, fully aligned with the Project objective. The level of
allocation to this component was high given the Project expected timeline and experiences in
executing institutional strengthening activities at the Federal level at Appraisal, . However, such
large allocation was notably the result of the Project’s negotiations where the Ministry of
Finance specifically requested US$14 million to support the design of a M&E system for the
Government’s infrastructure programs. The M&E, still in use today, was designed with technical
support from the Bank but was not financed by the loan due to a technicality at disbursement
stage.

A range of risks related to the implementation of the PREMEF was identified during
project preparation and appropriate mitigation measures were considered. In particular the
possible lack of capacity of DNIT to manage the project was mitigated by the decision to retain
during the first two years of project execution a project management consulting firm to assist
DNIT in the management, implementation and supervision of the First Phase of the Program, and
to provide support to DNIT in administrative, technical and financial matters related to the
carrying out of the PREMEF, including support to at least 10 DNIT regional offices through the
setup of five regional offices.

The above achievements would substantiate a highly satisfactory rating. However, the
rating is set as just satisfactory because:

 i.     The PDO aimed at stimulating higher economic growth by increasing effectiveness in the
        use of the federal road infrastructure may have been defined in an overambitious fashion
        given: (i) the Project size compared to the country’s overall investments in
        infrastructures; and, (ii) the degree to which the Bank can influence transport policies at
        the national level (including the various levels of jurisdiction) and foster reform. Truth is
        also that the overreaching goal of such Project was effectively to contribute to the above
        objective and that the second part of the PDO (“The objective is to be achieved through:
        (i) support to the first Phase of the Federal Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
        Program; and, (ii) a comprehensive program of institutional strengthening activities to
        improve efficiency and sustainability of road transport investment programs”) allowed
        refocusing the PDO on more achievable targets. Moreover, such redaction embedding

14
  The OECD/DAC (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance
Committee) defines SWAp as “a way of engaging in development cooperation based on the principles of
coordinated support for a locally owned program of development” . OPCS was clarifying in January 2006 in a power
point presentation on Sector-wide Approach Overview that “SWAp is not an instrument for grant aid or lending
neither implies particular financing modalities”.

                                                       9
       Project ultimate objective in the PDO was relatively common at the time the Project was
       prepared. However, actual practice in Project preparation would probably bound PDO
       redaction to more directly achievable and less ambitious targets.
ii.    As regards the fiduciary assessments at preparation, the Project involved a very thorough
       evaluation of the national procurement rules and practices, in line with what would be
       done nowadays under a PforR. Under a PforR perspective, a thorough assessment also on
       the social and environmental management would probably be done instead of the
       traditional assessment undertaken at preparation. However, it is also true that: (i) the
       Project, which involved the rehabilitation of existing road, was not expected to trigger
       major social or environmental issues; and, (ii) it also followed good practices for
       traditional IPF.
iii.   The rather uneven past performance of Brazil’s transport administration vis-à-vis
       absorption of technical assistance for institutional development and the still unsettled
       technical and professional capabilities of its recently reformed institutions should have
       prompted a more thorough assessment of risks.
iv.    Finally, the Project was subject to an exceptional delay of 19 months between Board
       approval and effectiveness at the Senate. This delay, which negatively impacted the
       capacity of the Project to be executed within the expected timeline and was one of the
       main reasons evoked by the Government to request extensions of the closing date, could
       have been envisioned as a risk with a potential mitigation consisting in increasing the
       time of execution to a more traditional 5 years.

Government’s commitment to the project during the preparation period was high.

2.2    Implementation

General. The project was approved by the Board on June 6, 2006 but national elections and the
transition between the outgoing and the new administrations that took office on January 1, 2007
caused delays in the approval of the project by Brazil's Senate. Because of political negotiations
in the Senate unrelated to the project, effectiveness finally took place on December 13, 2007,
nineteen months after Board approval as above mentioned. Once this episode passed, Project
implementation took place very much in line with the conceptual premises of the above
innovative approaches (recognized during preparation and execution as a SWAp approach). That
is, funds to support the PREMEF were disbursed with ease (with e.g. the first two disbursement
of US$96 million within 6 months after the declaration of effectiveness) while the Bank team
concentrated its efforts in maintaining a rich dialogue with the Government on key sector issues
even prior to loan effectiveness. As such, the project was instrumental in shaping the
successfully implemented PREMEF in its different stages and variations and it became a
valuable and adaptable vehicle to support the GOB in its requests to address pressing transport
sector issues. In fact, early in the project implementation period the Brazilian economy had a
fairly robust turn around which reduced the need for external financing. Nevertheless, the
attractiveness of the project to the GOB because of its other than financial contributions
remained unchanged, even when the implementation of some of the technical assistances was
disappointing. What follows is a summary of the main implementation aspects/issues.




                                               10
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Component. The project supported the first phase of
the PREMEF, with an estimated cost of US$1.4 billion, which was expected to rehabilitate about
16,000 km of the paved federal network over the 2006-2009 period. Despite delays in
effectiveness good progress was achieved from the start under the project's physical component
because substantial activities that took place in 2007 were eligible for retroactive financing. A
major breakthrough in terms of the GOB policy was the decision to consider output and
performance-based contracts as the main management modality of the federal main road network
starting in 2008, around effectiveness. At that time, the Ministry of Transport, fostered by the
President’s Office (Casa Civil), launched an ambitious road rehabilitation and maintenance
program based exclusively on CREMA contracts (the PRO-CREMA program). The objective of
this program was to ensure that all federal paved roads under the direct responsibility of the
federal road administration (around 35,000 km) would be covered by CREMA contracts by
2010. While the objective of the program was certainly ambitious, well beyond the original
objective of the project, it was at the time the only road investment program at the federal level
(and probably in Brazil) which already had, a well-defined and formalized structure, with
detailed definition of the technical solutions and processes to be followed during engineering
design preparation, civil works bidding and supervision. The definition of the PRO-CREMA
program structure and substance were led, on the technical level, by the Bank’s team, as part of
the enhanced supervision effort for the project.

The program was structured in two phases. During the first phase the network would be
subjected to a light form of CREMA (called initially Creminha, then PIR IV, and later CREMA
1a etapa). The contract’s main characteristic included a functional recuperation of the pavements
in the first year of the contract and routine maintenance during the entire two years of the
contract. Payments were based on globalized prices for the recuperation phase and performance
(monitored on the basis of a simplified set of indicators) for the maintenance. Contract
extensions averaged 130 km to 160 km and unit costs of recuperation were less than half the
CREMA’s rehabilitation unit costs

Characterized by simplified preparation and easier (and less costly) execution, it was designed in
a relatively pragmatic fashion as a temporary and urgent response to prevent the network
conditions from further deterioration in the budgetary constraint context at the federal level. The
CREMA 1a etapa was seen as a good instrument to address, at least temporarily the road’s more
crucial problems (generally resulting in traffic safety issues) on a substantial part of the federal
network, and prepare for the execution of a second phase (CREMA 2a etapa) a more sustainable
structural rehabilitations of the road in the form of fully fledged five-year CREMA contracts.
In 2008 project works were programmed and prepared at a rhythm unseen in the past in Brazil.
Subsequently, a remarkable level of activity of the PREMEF took place in 2009 and 2010, with
the rehabilitation of 23,000 km of roads. The impact of this rather exceptional level of execution
is seen clearly in the graph in Annex 3, which shows the evolution of the network condition.
Roads in good condition increased from 16% of the network in 2005 to 74% in 2011. This
outstanding performance was to a great extent possible thanks to a very effective process
centralized in DNIT following the principles agreed upon during Project preparation with: (i)
field surveys carried out with the support of a limited number of consultants; and, (ii) projects
developed by the DNIT with the help of few consultants applying a catalogue with limited
technical solutions.

                                                11
By contrast, the Program’s second phase (execution of the CREMA second stage) did not follow
those program management principles agreed upon at Project preparation and was stalled for
about 4 years with very limited rate of execution15. On the basis of those contrasted results, the
Government recently decided to apply a similar treatment for both phases of the Program.
The reasons for DNIT’s inability to ensure a seamless interface between both phases ha ve its
roots in some of the DNIT institutional weaknesses which are discussed in more detail in
paragraphs below. The most immediate cause of the problem was the decision to contract out to
consultants the preparation of the design of the works for the 2nd phase resulting in: (i) delays
both at the bidding stage (which required to handle an inordinate number of bids with limited
staffing) and at the execution stage with many consultants, with competence sometimes
questionable, reluctant to prepare projects according to the recommendations and norms of the
DNIT’s; (ii) lack of quality with many cases of disregard for DNIT’s norms and/or DNIT’s
requests for project revisions; and, (iii) a high cost (R$15,000 to 20,000/km) for designs that
more than often took time to be prepared and rapidly became outdated by the time they were
ready to be implemented.

Efficiency gains on the management of the Federal road network rehabilitation and maintenance
from the adoption, on a large scale, of performance-based (CREMA) approach, as fostered by
the Project, was thus substantially leveraged by the program management instruments and
mechanisms designed under the Project, which notably included centrally prepared rehabilitation
designs based on standardized and systematic approaches. This allowed DNIT to prepare
projects and bid works at a rhythm unseen in the past (25,000 km of CREMA contracted against
an historical management capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 km yearly), without incremental human
resources and costs. Given the recent adoption of those instruments for the second phase of the
CREMA program upon continuous dialogue between the Bank and the Government, such
efficiency gains are expected to be sustainable.

Institutional Development Component. Implementation of this component was uneven, with
wide variations in the accomplishments of the different executing agencies. The Ministry of
Finance’ Coordination for Evaluation of Public Investments (COAPI) and ANTT carried out the
institutional development activities substantially along the lines of the original project design.
Execution of the component by the Ministry of Transport as well as the DNIT was much more
limited, featured by important delays in the initiation of the activities:

       (a) Ministry of Finance Component: Implementation of this component started during the
           extended period between project appraisal and loan effectiveness. Because of its timing,
           expenditures under this component were not eligible for retroactive financing and were
           financed with the government’s own resources. The Ministry successfully developed and
           implemented a highly comprehensive management information system to evaluate and
           monitor public investment programs. The system allows evaluations that take into
           account different types of risks (i.e. regulatory, environmental, economic, financial,
           managerial, construction related, and macroeconomic/fiscal). The system substantially
           improved the Ministry’s capacity to evaluate the economic justification, the financial

     Only 604km were contracted under the CREMA second phase between 2009 and 2011.

                                                      12
       performance, and the future budgetary impact of each contract as well as contract
       implementation.

   (b) Ministry of Transport and DNIT’ Components: Achievements under this subcomponent
       were limited mostly due to delays in initiating the procurement processes. Those delays
       were caused by overburdened instruction of the dossiers by the Ministry’s office of
       attorneys. Moreover, an important reshuffling of the key top management of several
       transport institutions in the Federal Government occurred early August 2011, mandated
       by the Presidency, following allegations of corruption relayed in the press. This notably
       included the Minister of Transport and several of its close advisers as well as the Road
       Director and the managerial staff of DNIT. To a great extent, these developments further
       fostered a situation of intense controls and risk aversion that further thwarted the
       contracting of several technical assistance activities under the project. At the end, the
       loan basically financed at the request of the Ministry of Transport a National Inland
       Waterway Master Plan and the initial steps of a study for the calibration of the HDM
       software for Brazil’s conditions for DNIT.

   (c) National Land Transport Regulatory Agency (ANTT) Component: ANTT was highly
       effective in benefitting for the project support. 12 technical assistances and studies
       supporting the Agency contributing to a better understanding of the sector, including on
       key topic such as governance, M&E, studies to better understand the logistics sector,
       feasibility studies on major railroad (e.g. Sao Paulo Ferroanel), technical assistance to
       improve environmental management etc. Detailed activities are found in Annex 2.

In addition to the above activities, the team supported several initiatives for knowledge creation
and dissemination during the period including workshops, seminars and training related to
environmental management, logistics, quality of transport expenditures, project evaluation,
concessions, HDM applications, PPP, and performance based contracts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The key indicators to measure the project achievements were very precise, easily measurable and
highly related to the improved physical and financial performance of the road sector. The project
also had indicators related to the percentage disbursements for input-based contracts, which
would gradually increase from 70% to 85% as targets related to efficient contract management
were achieved (Annex 2). Many of these targets overlapped with the intermediate key
indicators. The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of the project was shared by the
different implementation agencies. DNIT, as implementation agency of 95% of the project was
responsible for the collection, analysis of data, and reporting on most indicators. ANTT, the
National Treasury Secretariat (STN) and the Ministry of Transport were each be responsible for
the successful and timely achievement of the intermediate outcomes under their responsibility.
All implementation agencies had the necessary capacity. The data needed for evaluation was
regularly collected or readily available within the implementation agencies. The only data that




                                               13
comes from an outside party is the data on freight rates16. The M&E framework was substantially
implemented as planned.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Procurement

The SWAp format was highly effective in fostering efficiency in the management of
procurement. Besides the miss-procurement case discussed below, procurement or procurement
related issues have seldom been identified as an issue in aide memoires or ISRs, despite a close
supervision. Also helping to the quasi problem-free procurement experience, was Bank’s
management decision to authorize for this project on a pilot basis, the increase in the ICB
threshold for procurement of civil works from US$ 10 million to US$ 20 million and steps
towards the acceptance of National Procurement Rules. 17

The Bank identified a miss-procurement in late 2010, in the context of a large ICB for works
worth US$320 million following Bank procurement rules. At the end of this ICB process,
initiated in 2008 when the loan disbursement reached US$96 million, the Borrower entered in
negotiation with the 18 lowest bidders (out of 23 bidders) which had submitted bids above the
budget estimate, to lower their proposal to the DNIT budget estimate. This initiative was
undertaken without previous consultation of the Bank in a context of strong pressure from the
National Audit Court (Tribunal das Contas da Uniao, TCU) not to contract any works above
budget estimates. As negotiation on prices is not authorized under Bank procurement rules, the
Bank had to declare miss-procurement in accordance with OP/BP11 in March 2011. However,
the Bank decided not to cancel the portion of the loan related to the miss-procured contracts and
instead, reallocated the proceeds of the loan to other eligible works, given the above context of
pressure and oversight from the TCU, as well as TCU’s auditors widespread erroneous
understanding that negotiations were possible under Bank procurement rules. As a result though,
Project implementation was downgraded to moderately satisfactory.

2.4.2 Financial Management

The Financial Specialist stationed in Brasilia carried out formal FM supervision periodically.
Accounting and FM performance were consistently rated as satisfactory as internal control
procedures at the subproject and project levels were found to be adequate. Unqualified audit
reports were prepared by the Federal Secretariat of Internal Control: Internal Audit Department.

2.4.3 Safeguards

As it dealt with road rehabilitation, the project, by nature, did not triggered environmentally
sensitive issues. As the Bank’s close regard for safeguards issues became more prominent an

16
   The freight rates were collected by the Department of Economy, Administration and Sociology of the University
of Sao Paulo (SIFRECA - Information System on Freight Rates) on a monthly basis for more than 50 products and
about 5,500 routes in Brazil.
17
   Based on the thorough assessment of the road sector capacity in procurement in Brazil, the Federal Government
has been identified by Bank procurement family as one of the rare potential candidate to pilot Bank Procurement
UCS (Use of Country System).

                                                       14
audit was prompted at the request of the Bank’s social specialist to monitor the adequacy of the
government’s compliance with the internal normative regarding indigenous lands. The audit,
which concluded that there had not been any known negative impact of road works on
Indigenous People, aimed at contributing to improve the Federal Government policy and
practices in undertaking rehabilitation works in such areas. No particular issue was identified
under the other safeguards of the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In the context of the reaffirmed willingness of the key actors of the transport sector to benefit
from continued Banks institutional and technical support in the future, initial discussions on a
possible new operation are being held with the Minister of Transport. While the transport sector
of the Federal Government wishes to continue and expand the partnership with the Bank, of less
relevance however is now the need for financing of large Federal infrastructure programs, given
Brazil’s financial standing. The proposed new operation would encompass most of the transport
subsectors and, while focusing on innovation and knowledge creation, it would aim at fostering
improved efficiency, safety and sustainability of the transport sector in Brazil. This new
operation is still under preparation the time of the closing of the present ICR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

The objective of increasing the effectiveness in the use of the federal road infrastructure was and
continues to be highly relevant in a country that is over-dependent on the road network for the
transport of goods and passengers and is still facing the challenge of attending high levels of
traffic growth while preserving existing assets with the right balance of: (i) public /private
participation; and, (ii) federal and state responsibilities. The objective was to be achieved
through: (i) support to the first Phase of the Federal Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Program; and, (ii) a comprehensive program of institutional strengthening activities to improve
efficiency and sustainability of road transport investment programs. The GOB has expressed its
satisfaction with achievements under PREMEF and its sustained relevance, as proven by the
continued expansion of the program and the commitment of the former and present
administrations to improving the quality of the CREMA system and its implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Satisfactory, the objective was fully achieved
With the caveat provided in above paragraph 2.1 on the ambition of the Project overreaching
Development Objective (“Stimulate higher economic growth”), to which the Project’s effective
contribution is difficult to determine, the project successfully contributed to increasing
effectiveness of in the use of the Federal Road Infrastructure, notably through GOB’s full
adoption at the national level of the CREMA system. This has resulted not only in surpassing the
original targets of contributing to reducing transport rates, improving road conditions and
increasing the participation of private contractors but also in substantial benefits related to: (i)
linking budget allocations with multi-year expenditure requirements established under the

                                                15
contacts; (ii) increasing cost-efficiency as compared to ad-measurement type contracts; (iii)
minimizing delays in project implementation; (iv) eliminating cost overruns; (v) reducing the
risk of unsatisfactory quality in the rehabilitation and subsequent maintenance works; (vi) cutting
down government’s supervision costs; and, (vii) fostering innovation in the programming and
execution of works.

The GOB decision in 2008 to fully switch to output and performance-based contracts also
contributed to achieve most of the intermediate targets related to the improvement of contract
management, which were mostly associated to reducing inefficiencies linked to input-based
contracts. Reaching staffing targets for ANTT and DNIT proved to be more difficult. Although
both agencies engaged in recruiting and training, the excess demand for professionals in a
context of rapid economic growth generated a high rate of turnover with an end result that both
continue to be understaffed.

On the other hand, the contribution of the institutional development component to the
effectiveness in the use of the federal roads was more marginal. Its main achievement was to
bring forward the participation of the central agencies (in this case the Ministry of Finance) in its
role of overseer of the quantity and quality of public expenditures. The development of
information systems that reduce the asymmetry of information for the Ministry of Finance when
facing sector demands is one of the main improvements in sector governance achieved under the
project.

With respect to the transport sector proper, the institutional development component and the
related intermediate indicators focused on the issues that for more than a decade have been at the
center of the country strategy and were the subject of continuous Bank support.18 As already
discussed, ANTT was the main beneficiary from the Project’s technical assistance, being able to
wisely manage a large array of activities contributing to the Project’s objectives . That was not as
much the case of the Ministry of Transport and DNIT which respectively used a relatively
limited amount of the loan allocation. Conversely, both administrations benefited from the Bank
continuous dialogue in supporting the institutions capacities through a number of knowledge
creation and sharing events organized including workshops, seminars, training and South- South
cooperation.

Allegations of corruption led to the reshuffling of key top management of institutions of the
transport sector mandated by the Presidency in August 2011, including the Minister of Transport
and several of his close advisers as well as the Road Director and managerial staff of the DNIT.
Upon information provided by the Client, none of the Bank financed works was however
involved in the alleged corruption schemes. The new management teams have progressively
taken over and confirmed their keen interest in continuing benefiting from Bank support.

3.3 Efficiency

An ex-post economic analysis was conducted following the same methodology as at Appraisal.
Costs and benefit were computed over 20 year period from 2005 to 2024 with HDM-4, based on
data (works, traffic etc.) effectively observed on the federal paved road network of 35,000km
managed by DNIT19, including: (i) types of road works applied; (ii) observed unit costs for road
works; and, (iii) observed growth rate of traffic volumes. The model was then calibrated based
on observed IRIs in 2011.

Overall, the ex-post economic evaluation shows satisfactory results. The resulting Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) are 63.9% and US$3,318 million at
a 12% discount rate at 2005 prices respectively (full details are presented in Annex 3). While the
ex-post EIRR is higher than the appraisal estimate of 50.0%, the NPV decreased from US$4,127
at Appraisal. Overall, ex-post evaluation confirms that the investments under the PREMEF have
been economically sound.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Based on the above, the overall outcome rating is considered as satisfactory.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The risk to development outcome is considered low: through persistent efforts and consistent
programs, the GOB has managed to substantially recover the road network condition for the past
6/7 years; continuous and amplified increased recourse to the private sector in the management
of the sector bringing better road conditions and efficient management both through
concessions/PPP and CREMA; this outcome is unlikely to change in the short run given: (i) the
duration of ongoing contracts; (ii) the success of both approaches; and, (iii) the existing
regulation and programs. Moreover, both the regulatory context and management practices of
those contracts are progressively improving; progress has continued, albeit slower than ideal for
some institutions, on the institutional side towards improved management; after years of
underinvestment, the capacity of the sector is progressively building up.

The main risk is linked to the country’s overall financial standing which, should it deteriorate,
could lead to decisions to tamper the 6/7 years past efforts in improving the road network
conditions, by allocating insufficient funds to the sector, a situation which was common before
2007.

 Road sections which were supposed to be transferred to the states in 2005 were also excluded from the evaluation.
However, most of these sections are still under DNIT management as mentioned above.

                                                        17
Most of the design issues deserve highly satisfactory ratings. These include: (i) the incorporation
of lessons learned and the selection and successful introduction of the SWAp approach in spite
of the difficult in-house legal and procurement hurdles the Bank’s team had to overcome in
launching a pioneer operation; (ii) the clear and mostly well-defined development objective
approach and the definition of the project objective and intermediate monitoring indicators; (iii)
the institutional arrangements incorporating all the relevant players in ensuring sound public
sector management; and, (iv) adequate project design related to technical and economic aspects,
realism of the implementation plan, and financial management attention. However two aspects of
project design were only moderately satisfactory: (a) the risks of Ministry of Transport (MT) and
DNIT lacking the capacity and/or ownership for the implementation of the institutional
development component were under-estimated; and, (b) there was an uneven treatment of
safeguards, particularly when compared and contrasted with the in-depth and over-detailed
attention to procurement matters. Thus, the ICR rating is less than highly satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The ICR rating is based not only on the standard overseeing of the civil works and technical
assistance components of the project but on the “enhanced supervision” requested by the
government. The former (i.e the project supervision) was carried out adequately through: (i)
regular missions (42 missions in 8 years) with monitored, agreed actions; (ii) strong relationship
with MT, DNIT and ANTT throughout including appropriate advice and solutions to the
Borrower, and consistent effort to remain abreast of implementation conditions; and, (iii)
commitment to maximizing the project’s disbursement and achieving the development objective.
The latter (i.e. the Borrower’s request for enhanced supervision) was in itself recognition of the
valuable contribution of the Bank in shaping and supporting the evolving government strategy
for the transport sector through multiple operations in the last few decades. In their “enhanced”
capacity the supervision team provided to the Brazilian government “state of the art”
international expertise on the issues that were considered high priorities. They provided rapid
response to GOB’s requests for advice on matters such as the alternative technologies for the
development of a rapid train system. The lack of a more pro-active Bank stand to address the
disappointing performance of the institutional development component (e.g. reflecting the issue
by downgrading the project ratings) accounts for the less than highly satisfactory rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is based on two distinct factors. The first one brings in the excellent Bank
performance in designing and implementing an innovative project with minimal problems
(considering that the less than expected achievements of the technical assistance component and
the misprocurement were caused by circumstances outside of the Bank’s control) and in
providing an “enhanced” supervision that the Brazilian authorities interviewed for this report
consistently considered as highly valued. The second is based on the fact that informally this
project is just one link in a series of operations in which the Bank team acquired the credibility
and the confidence of the government to actively participate in key strategic policy advice. The
remarkable performance of bringing 25,000 km of the road network to good conditions in only 4

                                                18
years with the “light” CREMA approach was only because of the close GOB-Bank partnership
successfully developed by the Bank team. This partnership allowed the Bank’s project team to
produce spin-offs in the form of case studies that, based on the Brazilian experience with
CREMA and with the government efforts to improve the quality of project evaluation are a
valuable source for other countries embarking on the same road maintenance approach.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

This rating reflects the following: (i) Government’s initial participation in a project that
acknowledged the macroeconomic linkages of the transport sector and the need to strengthen the
capacity of the central ministries to carry out their functions as overseers of the quality of public
investments; (ii) government’s endorsement of the implementation of CREMA contracts on
more than 30,000 km of the federal road network which allowed for the remarkable rapid
improvement of roads condition; (iii) continuous adequate budgetary support for the PREMEF;
and, (iv) relaxations of previous constraints for hiring professional for the proper staffing of
transport sector agencies. However, once the economy started to experience a high rate of growth
and resources stopped being an issue, the interest to continue the agreed coordination between
the Ministries of Finance, Transport and the President Office waned. Nonetheless, the original
problems that prompted the coordination efforts are by no means resolved and a continued
interest of the central institutions in transport sector efficiency might have produced a more
successful implementation of the much- needed technical assistance to MT and DNIT.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

        (i) Ministry of Finance
        Rating: Satisfactory
The Ministry of Finance carried out the technical assistance component of the project in a
satisfactory manner. The less than highly satisfactory rating is based on the fact that, as already
discussed, the initial active participation and coordination of the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Transport, for which Ministry of Finance was a key actor, progressively vanished.

         (ii) ANTT
         Rating: Highly Satisfactory
As discussed in Section 2.2 above, ANTT was the agency that most profited from the technical
assistance under the project. ANTT management took a holistic approach to provide the agency
not only with the necessary modern information and management system and strong regional
representation but a shared vision of the agency’s purpose through effective communications
skills to share expected goals and outcomes. Unlike MT and DNIT, ANTT did not experience
problems with the procurement of consultants following Bank procurement rules, a fact that
might be attributed to the firm commitment of ANTT management to the objectives of the
project.

       (iii) MT
       Rating: Satisfactory

                                                 19
This rating reflects the fact that the MT demonstrated periods of committed effort punctuated by
changes and fluctuations in leadership which negatively impacted Project implementation
progress. On one side, the activities financed by the Project for the Ministry were rather limited,
a large structuring study for the sector, the Country Waterway Masterplan. On the other side, the
dialogue between the Bank and the Ministry of Transport has been continuous and has laid the
basis of further studies (e.g. preparation of terms of reference for the Strategic Environmental
Assessment) and led to the organization of a number of events including: South-South
cooperation (notably a delegation visiting Vietnam and China and several foreign delegations
visiting Brazil), the organization of seminars and workshops attended by a number of
professionals of the sector, on themes including Logistics, PPP, Governance etc.

         (iv) DNIT
         Rating: Satisfactory
This rating is based on balancing: (i) DNIT’s highly successful implementation of a demanding
road rehabilitation and maintenance program of national scope, the first of its kind in Brazil in
terms of size and technical approach, with excellent results and meeting all the key targets; and
(ii) the establishment of adequate project monitoring and data management on one side, with less
than expected results on: (a) efforts to launch the technical assistance component which only
recently experienced some progress in contracting consultants for HDM calibration; (b) the
disappointing performance of DNIT in securing a seamless interface between the two phases of
the CREMA contracts; and, (c) the mismanagement of a large procurement process which led the
Bank to have to declare one large misprocurement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

This rating balances the Borrower’s efforts – reflected in successful outcomes for critically
important activities representing well over 90% of total project cost – against the fading interest
of the Ministry of Finance to continue to actively participate on the transport governance issues
that were the original driving force of the project. The less than satisfactory institutional
strengthening accomplishments of the sector agencies that were foresaw in the PAD is an
indication that changes in MT and DNIT will require the political will that will probably not
come from within.

6.     Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

(a)     The Project was a precursor of other SWAps in Brazil and of the Bank’s new lending
Instrument, the PforR. As detailed in section 2.1, the Project design was based on a set of
innovative approaches and instruments, notably as regards its focus (wide support to a Client’s
investment program in road rehabilitation), financial management (linking the disbursement rate
to achievement of sector policy indicators) and procurement (opening acceptance, even partial, to
national procurement rules). Those innovations were recognized during preparation and
execution to be in line with the-then emerging Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) of the Bank. Such
approach, while it was never sanctioned by a full fledge Bank policy, was widely used in the
Bank from the mid-2000’s for lending operations, notably in Brazil. In turn, SWAps in Brazil
greatly benefited from the innovations embedded in the Project. Beyond, the experience gained


                                                20
from the Project as well as other contemporary SWAps in Brazil and elsewhere, also contributed
to the internal dialogue within the Bank aimed at adapting Bank’s instruments to specific
emerging needs amongst Bank’s clients for more flexibility and responsiveness in Bank’s
operations, which, eventually led to the design of the Bank’s new lending instrument, the PforR.

(b)     A sense of “crisis” provide a strong incentive for adopting challenging new paradigms
but once the crisis subsides, clients may rapidly lose interests in advancing such agenda. The
dismal state of the federal road system and its evident negative effect on competitiveness
prompted the initial emphasis of the highest levels of government and central ministries on the
efficiency and cost effectiveness of the PREMEF. This successfully led to an expansion of the
use of performance-based contracts (CREMA) which, in 2008, started to be the main contractual
modality for road rehabilitation and maintenance at the Federal level. It also triggered initial
steps in modernizing the Federal road management structure (human resources, IT, etc.).
However, with the release of budget constraints on the road sector since 2007/2008 (this allowed
a quadruplication of budget allocation to the sector), the effort to improving expenditure
efficiency has turned to be not as sustained as it could have been (e.g. it took more than 4 years
for DNIT to finally adopt the Bank’s recommendation on CREMA program management, see
below) and the pace of the reform has been slower than ideal. While Bank’s clients may not be
as open to sector policy and institutional reforms as they should when money is pouring-in,
advancing such reforms in periods when there is no “crisis”, as challenging as it may be, is
precisely critical. In the Project, progress was observed in some areas (though not to the extent
and pace it would have ideally been), thanks to a very close and continuous dialogue with the
Federal Government. Disbursement linked indicators to specific policy reforms, as tried in the
Project and later used in PfoR, may, in specific cases, be a very good incentive to advance
reform and modernization agenda in such critical periods.

(c) The adoption of the CREMA concept is the right first step towards an improved road asset
management in Brazil but a contractual instrument should not be considered as a silver bullet
to resolve a whole host of contract management issues. While it is widely recognized that the
CREMA program contributed to improve the efficiency of expenditures in the road sector20 and,
ultimately, the quality of the federal road network, only part of the benefits of the approach has
been captured by the Federal Government, notably due to a failure from the executing agencies
to timely implement the program’s accompanying management measures planned with the
Project. In particular, as a result of internal dissensions between two departments of DNIT and,
probably, lobbying from national consulting companies, the second stage of the CREMA
program, aimed at contracting longer term (5 years) and more sustainable CREMA, was mostly
unsuccessful due to the decision to tender each CREMA design instead of centralizing their
execution in DNIT like for the first stage. This resulted in important delays, high costs and low
quality projects and, as a final result, only about 700 km of works have been contracted in more
than 4 years, to be compared to more than 30,000 km contracted in less 2 years for the first stage
of the program. This situation finally improved lately, with the recent adoption of the same
management structure for the second stage as for the first one. However, important delays of
more than 4 years and general discontent on the slowness of the procedures were close to put at
risk the CREMA approach for the management of the sector. Similarly, the institutional

  See World Bank Transport Paper 31 on the evaluation of Brazil experience in Performance Based contracts in the
road sector, April 2010

                                                       21
organization of the sector has thus far impeded the development of longer term CREMA (5+
years), fostered by the Bank, as distinct regulation would apply for longer than 5 years contracts
resulting in a shift of responsible agency (ANTT, instead of DNIT). As a result, both agencies
have neutralized each other and no pilot for an extended CREMA contract could be tested under
the Project. More generally, the sector could have more substantially adapted its management
organization and structure so as to more fully capture the benefits from the approach fostered by
the Project.

(d)     While the indicators of the Project Result Framework need to be selected with great
caution to ensure that they will appropriately contribute to measure Project success,
innovative approaches may sometimes result in unexpected positive outcome. The Project
identified the reduction of freight rate on determined roads as a way to measure Project success.
The selection of this indicator was in line with the Project ambitious ultimate objective. With the
hindsight, given the Project characteristics essentially focusing on road infrastructure, this
indicator revealed however not the best choice, as changes in freight rates may amply depend
from parameters far beyond the reach of the Project such as: freight market conditions, labor
conditions, evolution of costs of fuel, cost of purchase of vehicle, banks loans conditions, fiscal
conditions etc. All those parameters, which may influence final freight rate much more
substantially than the road conditions, are extremely difficult to identify and void to allow full
assessment over time and measure impact. Conversely, the selection of this indicator gave an
opportunity for the team to open a new dialogue with the counterparts in the transport sector on
the logistics, which is as of now, key in the upcoming partnership between the Bank and the
Government in the transport sector.

(e)    To remain credible with sophisticated partners, the Bank may need to deploy efforts
beyond the extra-mile, which may translate into extra resources allocation. The recognized
quality of Bank dialogue with the Federal Government has come at the cost of a strong
involvement of the transport team (more than 5 supervision missions per year, increased
supervision budget norms) combined with additional ad-hoc support, including two successive
AAA. While budget allocation for Project preparation and supervision has not substantially
changed for the past 10 years, maintaining a quality dialogue with the Federal authorities on the
transport sector has been possible notably thanks to extra resource provided to technical team in
the Bank, in average about doubling usual norms.

Annex 3.         Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

This annex summarizes the ex-post economic analysis of the Project. The objective of the
analysis is to assess the economic costs and benefits of the Brazilian Federal Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (PREMEF) implemented by DNIT, a part of
which was funded by the Project, using the methodology adopted for the ex-ante
evaluation conducted at Appraisal. The evaluation followed an HDM-4 network analysis
on the paved federal road network managed by DNIT in 2005, which was 35,369 km.
The major project benefits are savings in road user costs including vehicle operating costs
and travel time costs, and reduction in maintenance and rehabilitation costs. To develop
the ex-post analysis model, several modifications from the ex-ante model were made
taking into account based on: (i) the type of works effectively executed, which were
significantly different from the ones assumed at Appraisal; and, (ii) observed traffic
growth and unit costs for works. The results show that Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) are respectively 63.9% and US$3,318 million at a
12% discount rate at a 2005 price.

Methodology

The ex-post economic evaluation follows the methodology of the ex-ante evaluation
undertaken as part of the Project preparation in 2005-2006 with HDM-4. HDM-4 is
designed to make comparative cost estimates and economic evaluations of different
construction and maintenance options, either for a single road section or for an entire
network. The model simulates road infrastructure life cycle conditions and costs and
provides economic decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance
alternatives. Costs considered for the analysis include construction and maintenance
costs, vehicle operating costs and travel time costs, to which accidents costs may be
added.

The ex-ante evaluation was made on the entire paved federal road network of 35,369 km
under DNIT management in 200521. A network analysis was used classifying roads
sections according to initial road conditions in 2005 such as surface type, structural
condition (deflection), traffic volume and roughness (IRI). This resulted in a total of 92
“cells” representing the network, to which different solutions of works were applied to

initial conditions was used in the ex-post evaluation. Vehicle operating costs were also
derived from the 2005 study. (See Table 2)

      Data Applied

      The ex-post evaluation was based on the data/information resulting from: (i) observed
      traffic growth between 2005 and 2012; (ii) observed unit costs of works during the
      period; and, (iii) observed type of works (solutions) applied to each cell:

      Traffic Growth: 3.89% average traffic growth of year based on observed traffic evolution
      on available data for 12,000 km.

      Unit Cost of Works: Unit costs of each work type were retrieved from the DNIT database
      called SICRO. In addition, a sample of actual road work contracts has been surveyed.
      The sample analysis established a ratio of 1.67 between costs on the pavement works on
      vehicle lanes and the total value of the contract22. Accordingly, this factor was applied to
      the unit costs from the database of DNIT so that the unit costs represent the real contract
      values. The unit costs used for the model are shown in Table 3.

Types of Works: The work history on each road section between 2005 and 2010 was
surveyed based on more than 700 contracts. It was found that out of 35,369 km, about
15,000 km received works under other budget than PREMEF, such as reconstruction and
widening, for which the detailed information on works and costs were not available. In
addition, road conditions data in 2011 was missing on additional 3,000 km. As a result,
the analysis was based on available relevant data covering 17,000 km of the federal
paved network, a representative sample with about 50% of the total network. For a matter
of comparison with the ex-ante evaluation, the above data were expanded, to cover the
initial total length of the network for the analysis, meaning the 35,369 km.

The above survey revealed that one contract often included 5-10 types of solutions. As a
result, more than 2 solutions have often been applied to each "cell" (i.e. sections with the
same road conditions in 2005), though only one solution was identified per cell in the ex-
ante evaluation. Similar solutions were grouped and the number of cells for the analysis
was expanded from 92 to 206 to take into account the case that very different types of
works were applied to the same original cell. Also the surveys showed that in most cases
lighter solutions were applied than ones defined in the original solution catalogue at
Appraisal.

Scenarios

The following 2 scenarios over the evaluation period of 20 years were used:
       v.     base case scenario, called “Base Alternative”, with works limited to
              routine maintenance up to 2013, and later, reconstruction triggered when
              IRI reached 5.5;
       vi.    "real case" scenario “Works”, where for each cell, the actual works carried
              out were triggered. To reduce the number of possible combinations, all
              works were triggered in 2008, which was the year of the maximum
              expenditures of the SWAp and the Federal Program (PREMEF).

Calibration

The preliminary HDM-4 model was calibrated so that the evolution of the network
condition, expressed in terms of IRI, would correspond to the real condition measured
with the surveys in 2011. Network conditions substantially improved over the period,


                                              31
from about 25% in good condition in 2005 to over 80% in 2012 as demonstrated in the
graph below.




The calibration led to some changes in type or year of interventions for specific cells
where the IRI estimated by the model significantly differed from the one measured. This
resulted in a predicted average roughness in 2011 over the whole network of 2.61
compared to 2.82 measured.

The total value of the works simulated by HDM was checked with the total budget spent
by DNIT on the corresponding works contracts. While the total works costs over the
analysis period 2005-2011 were estimated at US$ 3.2 billion at the 2005 value including
all routine maintenance, periodic restoration and conservation works, the total budget
disbursement during this period recorded by DNIT was US$3.4 billion at the 2005
value23.

Results

The analysis compared, year by year, costs and benefits under the real case scenario and
the base case scenario. Table 4 presents the main economic results in present values over
the whole analysis period. The resulting Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and

23
  No calibration on unit cost was conducted because these two values of expenditures cannot be compared
directly due to the following facts: (i) some of the road sections in the network had received not only
maintenance works but also heavier works financed by other than PREMEF, such as duplication or
reconstruction, and (ii) the original network of the ex-ante evaluation of 35,569km excluded the sections of
around 14,000km which were planned to be transferred to the state at the time of Appraisal but are still
managed by DNIT in August 2013.

Net Present Value (NPV) are 63.9% and US$3,318 million at a 12% discount rate at
2005 prices respectively. The limited increase in road agency costs over the whole
analysis period results in important gains for the users. The benefit-cost ratio is 8.05, i.e.
every increase of US$1 in expenditures by the road agency induces reduction in road user
costs of US$8.

    Increase in Road Agency Costs                                                  467.8

Overall, the ex-post economic evaluation is coherent, while slightly different (due to the
use of different solutions) with the ex-ante evaluation. The ex-post EIRR is higher than
the appraisal estimate of 50.0%, and the NPV lower than US$4,127 million estimate at
Appraisal. Overall, ex-post evaluation confirms that the investments under the PREMEF
have been economically sound.

It should be highlighted that the project significantly reduced not only the road user costs
but also the future road agency costs after the Project. Under the simulations, while
without the Project, the estimated road agency costs for the period of 2012-2025 is
US$5.3 billion, they decrease to US$ 2.9 billion for the same period with the Project. As
a result, the Project contributed to the leveling of the budget required for keeping roads in
a good condition over the 20 year period, which ensured financial sustainability of the
public expenditures.

Decentralization through Concessions to State Governments and Private Sector
One of the main objectives of the Project was to help the federal government in
promoting decentralization of federal roads to state governments and concession to
private sector in order to alleviate the burden on the federal government and tackle the
logistic bottle necks. The extension of decentralized and conceded federal roads reached
12,553km in 2012, but it has not progressed as expected mainly due to administrative and
political reasons involving federal and state governments.

Performance Based Contracts (CREMA)
Since the pilot CREMA in 2001 started, the Bank’s missions and technical assistances
have significantly contributed to the success of the CREMA program. During the past 10
years, the CREMA program has improved road conditions in the federal roads network.
One of the factors of this success is that supervisor companies of CREMA works were
hired for survey and design works, which has significantly shortened the time for design
preparation. Another factor that accelerated the process is simplification of surveys, for
example, considering only standard parameter values for lane width, deflections etc., and
the execution of the road survey by more experienced staff.

One of the main characteristics of CREMA: payment for rehabilitation works measured
by extensions executed, brought the following benefits: (i) simplification of the
performance measurement processes, enabling the supervisor to focus more on the
verification of the services being executed; (ii) more transparency on the evaluation of
the quantities of executed service, making the physical and financial progresses
simultaneously and reducing the risk of manipulation of results; (iii) less disturbance to
road users, as contractors are obliged to execute the works in a planned manner in order
to progressively conclude segments in the stipulated deadlines and receive accordingly
the payments; and, (iv) avoidance of partial works, which are prejudicial to pavement
quality, for example, leaving the lower layers exposed to traffic and rain during pavement
rehabilitation.

Some observed downsides are the following: (i) there were some cases that performance
measurement was based on conventional unit prices, instead of extension executed,
which resulted in a risk for the mischaracterization of the CREMA concept; and, (ii) due
to the short contract period of CREMA, such as 2-years, some firms associated the
durability of the solution to the duration of the contract, applying cheaper solutions that
were not necessarily optimal from the long-term viewpoint, such as 10-15 years.

The experience of the program demonstrated that it is necessary to clarify and quantify
the required level of service, in order to avoid discrepancies throughout the contracts.
One of the main problems that affected the development of the CREMA program is a
difficulty of understanding of the CREMA concept by the controlling organization, such
as the TCU – Federal Court of Auditors which did not accept that the input rates of the
secondary compositions that form the whole solution are used only to calculate the
reference values for the bidding process. Therefore, the variation of these input rates


                                            38
actually do not have to be considered to calculate the payment, as the basis of payment is
the serviced lane extension.

Also, it was apparently difficult for supervisors and contractors to assimilate the basic
concepts of the program, as they misunderstood the program criteria in some cases,
causing design errors that needed to be corrected.

Accordingly, it is clearly necessary to create a specific law for the CREMA so as to avoid
any further issues with relevant stakeholders due to misunderstandings on the concept of
CREMA.

Bidding Processes
Standard bidding documents were customized for the Performance-Based Contracts,
which significantly reduced the time required between the surveys and the design, and
between the award of contract and the beginning of works. Other factors that reduced the
administrative burden were the adoption of electronic auctions (“pregão eletrônico”) and
the Differentiated Regime of Contracts (“Regime Diferenciado de Contratações”).

New Bank Technical Assistance Project
DNIT should leverage the experience acquired in the project to continue refining the
CREMA under the new possible technical assistance project financed by the Bank,
through the analysis on new contract models and different road works/services
performances, such as: (i) performance-based contracts with a longer contract period; (ii)
simplified and accelerated design process for structural solutions; (iii) larger scale of
CREMA contracts, for example, covering a certain region instead of road sections; and,
(iv) optimized contract management to further reduce the number of contracts and
enhance administrative performance, etc.

HDM
The solutions proposed by the HDM simulation at appraisal were not totally adopted by
the government. While HDM seeks the technical and economic efficiency of the entire
network, the government tended to prioritize investments on major logistics corridors.
