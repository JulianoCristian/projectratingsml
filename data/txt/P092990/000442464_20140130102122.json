Brazil were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was low, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory. The\n            project design was based on a set of innovative approaches\n            and instruments, notably as regards its focus (wide support\n            to a client's investment program in road\n            rehabilitation), financial management (linking the\n            disbursement rate to achievement of sector policy\n            indicators), and procurement (opening acceptance, even\n            partial, to national procurement rules). A sense of\n            \"crisis\" provide a strong incentive for adopting\n            challenging new paradigms but once the crisis subsides,\n            clients may rapidly lose interests in advancing such agenda.\n            The adoption of the Output Performance Based Road\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract (CREMA) concept is\n            the right first step towards an improved road asset\n            management in Brazil but a contractual instrument should not\n            be considered as a silver bullet to resolve a whole host of\n            contract management issues. While the indicators of the\n            project result framework need to be selected with great\n            caution to ensure that they will appropriately contribute to\n            measure project success, innovative approaches may sometimes\n            result in unexpected positive outcome. To remain credible\n            with sophisticated partners, the Bank may need to deploy\n            efforts beyond the extra-mile, which may translate into\n            extra resources allocation."}, "docdt": "2013-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
