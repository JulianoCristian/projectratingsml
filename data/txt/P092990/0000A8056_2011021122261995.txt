                         The Project's ultimate development objective is to stimulate higher economic growth by increasing effectiveness in the use of the federal road infrastructure.
                         The objective is to be achieved through (a) support to the first phase of the Federal Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program, and (b) a comprehensive
                         program of institutional strengthening activities to improve efficiency and sustainability of road transport investment programs.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
