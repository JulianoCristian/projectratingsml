                            LOAN NUMBER 7383-BR

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.    This restructuring paper for Brazil, BR-ROAD TRANSPORT PROJECT, Loan
No 7383-BR, P092990, proposes to extend the Project’s Closing Date by 12 months from
May 31, 2012 until May 30, 2013.

2.      The Road Transport Project is an investment loan structured as a SWAp in
support of the National Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program (PREMEF). It
was approved on June 6, 2006 for a total lending of US$501.25 million and was declared
effective on December 14, 2007. The Project provides support to the Federal Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program, and finances technical assistance activities to
four beneficiaries. Part of the loan amount was canceled in June 2011 (US$60 million)
upon request from the Borrower in the context of the Federal Government’s new policy
to focus on knowledge services and minimize foreign borrowing for investments that
could be readily financed by the government.

3.       Project implementation is satisfactory with 95% of the loan disbursed (US$419
million) in four and a half years of implementation since it was declared effective. An
initial and exceptional delay of 17 months in turning the loan effective has been
substantially recovered under the civil works component over the past four years thanks
to the Borrower’s commitment to the Project and the flexible approach made possible
through the SWAp instrument. However, delays were faced in the procurement of the
large studies under the Project’s Technical Assistance (TA) component, which are
considered strategic for the transport sector in terms of support to policymaking and
institutional strengthening. Such delays were due to lengthy procurement processes for
the related studies. Most of those contracts are either at initial or mid stage of
implementation. The proposed 12-month extension of the Closing Date from the current
Closing Date of May 30, 2012 to May 30, 2013 would be the third Project Closing Date
extension, for a cumulative total extension of 35 months. This third extension would
enable to more fully achieve the Project’s development objective by ensuring a continued
support for the institutional strengthening component of the Project.

4.       The extension of the Closing Date to May 30, 2013, would enable the
achievement of 100 percent of the project’s physical targets. The extended timeframe
would also allow completing the key ongoing strategic technical assistance activities,
which are in various stages of execution. The most relevant of such studies, which are
critical to support improved policymaking and decisions on key sector issues, include: (a)
the National Master Plan for Inland Waterways, (b) the Sao Paulo Rail Ring Road, (c) the
calibration of the HDM (Highway Development Management) software to the specific
conditions in Brazil, and (d) logistics studies aimed at better understanding the freight
transport market and supporting improved competitiveness, which is a key development

                                            5
objective for Brazil and in the 2012-2015 CPS. The proposed extension would also
enable the Borrower to more substantially achieve the Project objective to stimulate
higher economic growth by reducing road transport improving road transport planning
and management and contributing to reduce road transport bottlenecks by rebalancing the
transport matrix. Moreover, the extension would maintain the ongoing strategic policy
dialogue between the Bank and the Federal Government, which is critical in
accompanying the Government’s efforts for institutional strengthening and sector and
governance reforms, at a point in time in which comprehensive multiyear investments
programs and policy reforms are being launched to substantially address the country’s
main transport infrastructure gap.

5.       The Borrower (Federal Government) has confirmed that it is fully committed to
the Project's objectives and, more broadly, to the partnership with the Bank in the
transport sector. The Borrower should be able to more substantially achieve the Project
objective within the proposed extended timeframe, notably through the implementation
of activities considered strategic under the Technical Assistance component (see enclosed
letter from the Borrower and COFIEX1).

6.     The current Project Development Objective and result indicators continue to be
achievable and will be enhanced with the extension of the Closing Ddate.

7. There are no outstanding audit reports.
