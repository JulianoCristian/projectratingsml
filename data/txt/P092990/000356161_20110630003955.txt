                                                           P092990

                                           RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
The Brazil Road Transport Project is an investment loan structured as a SWAp in support
to the National Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program (PREMEF). It was
approved on June 6, 2006 for a total lending of US$501.25 million and was declared
effective on December 14, 2007. The Project provides support to the Federal Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program, and finances technical assistance activities to
four beneficiaries.

The proposed changes consist of (i) two minor alterations to clarify the type of
interventions under the Investment component and widen the scope of one subcomponent
of the Technical Assistance component, (ii) a reallocation and a partial cancellation of the
loan proceeds, and (iii) an 11-month extension of the Closing date of the loan (a 2nd
extension, for a cumulative total extension of 23 months) to May 31, 2012 from the
current closing date June 30, 2011.


PROJECT STATUS
Project implementation is satisfactory with close to 90% of the loan committed and 75%
disbursed (US$377 million) in three and a half years of implementation since it was
declared effective. The Borrower (Federal Government) has confirmed that it is fully
committed to the Project’s objectives and, more broadly, to the partnership with the Bank
in the transport sector. The Borrower should be able to more substantially conclude the
Project within the proposed extended timeframe (see enclosed letter from the Borrower
and COFIEX1).

The initial and exceptional delay of 17 months in turning the Project effective has been
substantially recovered over the past three years thanks to the Borrower’s commitment to
the Project and the flexible approach made possible through the SWAp instrument.

    COFIEX is the External Financing Commission of the Federal Ministry of Planning, Budgets and Management.

                                                                5
However, additional delays in Project implementation were encountered over the past 10
months as a large ICB procurement process comprised of 18 contracts and a total of
US$252 million of eligible expenditures was not concluded successfully. This slowed
down the pace of implementation and disbursement. In parallel, a temporary slowdown
took place in the pace of the implementation of the Project’s technical assistance
activities.

If the closing date is extended by 11 months to May 31, 2012, it is expected that 100% of
the physical targets will be met while 50 to 60% of the technical assistance component
will be completed, including TA considered key to more substantially achieve Project
objective. Without such an extension, the Project objective would not be achieved to the
same degree with about 85% of the physical targets achieved and 25% of the key
technical assistance activities implemented. In particular, strategic studies aimed at
improving road transport planning and management and contributing to reduce road
transport bottlenecks by rebalancing the transport matrix are on the verge of
implementation. Should the Project not be extended, these activities, considered key to
the Project objective, will not be completed in the context of the Project.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Minor changes under the Project components
Under the first component (Part A: Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance component),
the proposed change that is sought consists of a clarification that bridges, as one element
of the road infrastructure, are also eligible to receive maintenance and/or rehabilitation
works and/or widening bridge decks to calibrate them to the widths of the access roads,
under the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program (PREMEF). The reason for
such clarification is that part of the remaining proceeds from the loan could be dedicated
to financing eligible works (as per the loan’s eligibility criteria) under a recent sub-
program of the PREMEF structured with Bank support, aiming specifically at
undertaking rehabilitation and calibration of bridges of the Federal road network.

Under the second component (Part B: Technical Assistance component), the second
change that is sought consists of expanding the scope of one subcomponent
corresponding to the National Land Transport Regulatory Agency, to (a) include other
types of transport modes beyond the road modality when analyzing private sector
participation, and (b) undertake studies that aim to enhance strategies and planning in
various transport modes. Such proposed changes are expected to allow an enhanced
support to the Project Development Objective and are in line with the knowledge focus of
the restructured Project.

The changes are in line with the original description of the Project and will aid in
reaching the outcomes envisioned for this loan.

Reallocation and partial cancelation of the proceeds of the Loan
The proposed reallocation and partial cancelation is based on the Borrower’s evaluation
of the expected disbursements up to the extended closing date and in light of the Federal

                                            6
Government’s recent policy to focus on knowledge services and minimize foreign
borrowing for investments that could be readily financed by the government. The
Borrower proposes to (i) reallocate between categories of works, and (ii) cancel unused
funds in the Works Category, Goods, non consultants’ services, consultants’ services and
training Category, and Unallocated Category, as outlined below.

This proposed reallocation and partial cancelation takes stock of the main results already
achieved by the Project and is in line with the new strategy currently discussed between
the Bank and the Federal Government for the next CPS period, which envisions a support
more focused on strategic development services and high value knowledge sharing and
creation, rather than large investments.

Under the investment component, Bank support to the Program through the Project has
already substantially achieved its goal, with the adoption on a large scale of contracts
managed by results (known as “CREMA” in Brazil) under the national road rehabilitation
program (30,000 km of the network are already managed through CREMA contracts).

                                             7
Additionally, the Federal authorities, which currently strive to limit foreign investments
in US dollars, have also       removed budgetary constraints to the sector2 with the
adoption of the PAC (Programa de Aceleracao do Crecimento), a plan that relies on
large public investments in infrastructures. They have also given priority to a more
balanced investment share between construction and maintenance. Bank contribution –
after disbursement of US$377 million-- now stands at 15% of the total investment in the
Program over the past 3 years. Finally, Bank support to investment will continue to be
relevant for a limited number of ongoing CREMA contracts as well as for new innovative
approaches such as those currently discussed with the Road Agency (the DNIT) for the
rehabilitation and calibration of existing bridges.

Under the TA component, the Federal Government requests both a refocus and a
consolidation of Bank support to the transport sector, through (i) canceling part of the
proceeds of the loan to the TA to the Ministry of Finance and (ii) a reallocation of the
balance of such proceeds to one of the other beneficiaries, the National Transport
Regulation Agency (ANTT), to further advance on the knowledge agenda on specific
segments of the transport sector (mostly related to logistics). Such a proposal is expected
to allow for the substantial execution of a number of national strategic studies in the field
of transport, including studies such as (a) the National Master Plan for Inland Waterways,
(b) Sao Paulo Rail Ring Road, and (c) the calibration of the HDM (Highway
Development Management) software to the specific conditions in Brazil (possibly
expanded to other tropical countries).

As a result, the proposed changes would consist of:
   - Combined reallocation of US$38,094,827.08 from the category 1B (traditional
       input based rehabilitation and maintenance contracts), to the category 1A (output
       and performance based “CREMA” contracts), and canceling of part of the
       resulting remaining proceeds of category 1A for an amount of US$10,455,951.66,
       considering that the Government will self finance part of the works;
   - Canceling US$11.5 million in the TA allocated to the Ministry of Finance (there
       will also be a reallocation of US$3.5 million within the TA component from the
       Ministry of Finance to the ANTT to support ongoing strategic activities).
   - Canceling the Unallocated Funds, US$ 37.996.875.

Extension of the closing date
A first extension of one year was granted in March 2010 (the original closing date was
June 30, 2010). The proposed change consists of granting a second closing date extension
of 11 months to May 31, 2012 (from the current closing date of June 30, 2011), which
would amount to a cumulative extension of the closing date of 23 months.

The second extension is requested as a combined result of initial delays in turning the
Project effective and the recent procurement-related delay, which led to reduce
substantially the universe of eligible contracts and the rate of disbursement in the past 10
months and which was also associated with a delay in the launch of a set of strategic
technical assistance activities that were in the process of preparation.

    The road sector had been hampered by tough budget constraints since the mid-2000’s
                                                     8
With the new extension, the Project would benefit from an extended timeframe to
considerably progress on the 26 ongoing strategic technical assistance activities in
various stages of procurement and execution, and would enable a significant completion
of the additional investment activities.

In the context of the above changes, the Project Development Objective and result
indicators continue to be achievable as most of the financing has been disbursed in
accordance with the original operational design, implementation is considered
satisfactory, and the Bank has accepted a plan focused on intensive knowledge transfer
and financial/technical support.

There are also no outstanding audit reports.
