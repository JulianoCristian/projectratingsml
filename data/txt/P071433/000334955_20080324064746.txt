I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of project preparation, the most reliable available data suggested that Burkina Faso
had the second highest HIV/AIDS infection rate in West African sub-region (after Côte d'Ivoire) and
was in the generalized phase of the epidemic. HIV prevalence was estimated at 7.2% in the general
population and between 3.8% and 8.4% in pregnant women. Other limited data on infection rates from
studies, surveys and sentinel sites indicated:
             disproportionate geographical distribution (linked to heavy internal and external migratory
             flows) and large gender disparities in HIV with HIV prevalence rates among young women
             15-24 more than twice as high as among their male counterparts;
             rapid increases among pregnant women, from less than 2 % in the mid 1980s to over 7 % a
             decade later, with some rates as high as 9-10 %;
             very high rates among vulnerable groups: commercial sex workers: 15-60 %; Sexually
             Transmitted Infection (STI) clinic patients: 16-42 %; TB patients: 34 %; and
             infection rates among infants born to HIV+ mothers as high as 20-25 % at the Banfora
             Regional Hospital Center in the Comoé Province.

2.      The cumulative number of reported AIDS cases had reached about 17,000 in 2000, and this
number was believed to represent only a fraction of the actual cases because of serious underreporting
and the general stigma associated with the disease. Finally, the rapid rise in HIV infection rates was
paralleled by a worsening TB epidemic with approximately 16,000 new cases each year and an
estimated annual new TB case rate (140 per 100,000) similar to that of Kenya and Uganda.

3.      Though clearly in imminent danger, Burkina Faso also had several advantages in organizing its
response at the time:
             Quickly recognizing the gravity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic since the emergence of the first
             AIDS cases in 1986, the Government had: (i) prepared with UNAIDS assistance a diagnosis
             of the situation (Epidémie du VIH/SIDA au Burkina Faso: Diagnostics et réponses
             opérationnelles); (ii) drafted a strategic plan (Cadre stratégique de lutte contre le VIHISIDA
             et les IST 2001-05); (iii) adopted norms for treatment of STIs and for blood transfusion
             among others; and (iv) taken measures to establish the National AIDS Council (Secrétariat
             Permanent-Conseil National de lutte contre le SIDA, SP-CNLS).
             Through previous experiences with several Bank-funded projects (Health and Nutrition, and
             Population and HIV/AIDS), the Government had: (i) tested a number of potential strategies;
             and (ii) established an effective implementing unit at central level and mechanisms for
             providing decentralized funding.
             According to the 1999 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), knowledge of HIV was
             virtually universal in the population (96 % of men and 87 % of women stated that they either
             knew of or had heard about the disease), though action lagged far behind (19.3% of men and
             3.4% of women indicated that they had begun to use condoms for protection against
             infection).

4.      With demonstrated Government commitment, an agreed-upon national strategy and coordinating
structure, existing modalities to ensure rapid project implementation, and a population demanding a
more active role in the fight against HIV/AIDS,1 Burkina offered positive conditions for accessing the

Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region, which had been approved by the Board on
July 6, 2001.

5.      In addition to meeting the eligibility criteria established for the MAPs, the project supported
other strategic orientations in the country, including:
             the Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP) (2000) which focused inter alia on: (i)
             increasing access of the poor to basic social services, including health; and (ii) strengthening
             the ability of the health system to cope with HIV/AIDS, given the disease's prominence in
             the country's epidemiological profile; and
             the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (2000, updated in 2003 and 2005) which identified
             the following strategies for supporting the government: (i) mainstreaming HIV/AIDS
             activities into all areas of IDA assistance; (ii) continuing policy dialogue with authorities to
             ensure that HIPC funds are targeted for critical HIV/AIDS activities; (iii) ensuring that funds
             from the on-going Population and AIDS Control Project are effectively used for priority
             interventions; and (iv) preparing the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project on a fast track.

No instrument other than a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) was considered at the time.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.      As indicated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the overall Project Development
Objective (PDO) is to assist the Borrower to implement its HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan for 2001-05, in
order to slow the spread, and mitigate the impact, of the HIV/AIDS epidemic through a multi-sectoral
approach by: (i) the expansion nationwide to youth, women of childbearing age and other vulnerable
groups2 of access to HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment; and (ii) the strengthening of the capacity
of public, private and community institutions to design, carry out and monitor Subprojects and Work
Programs. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) presents the specific objectives somewhat
differently to:
        (i) Scale up, expand and improve preventive activities in an effort to lower the risks of
        transmission.
        (ii) Strengthen capacity to provide care, treatment and support to those infected or affected by
        the epidemic.
        (iii) Mitigate the socio-economic impact on affected households and communities.

7.      The PAD identified outcome and output indicators linked to prevention and to care and miti-
gation; the following outcome indicators to measure project performance were agreed on in the DCA:
        (i)      Decrease from 1998/99 to 2004/05 the percentage of non-married individuals who report
                 having 2 or 3 partners: Females-from 4% to 2%; Males-from 13% to 10%.
        (ii)     Increase from 1998/99 to 2004/05 the percentage of men who report having used
                 condoms during the past 12 months from 13% to 17%.
        (iii)    Increase of 20 percent in condom utilization rates among priority groups.
        (iv)     Decrease of 20 percent in proportion of PLWHA reporting discrimination and
                 stigmatization.

8.      PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome indicators3 are presented in the Data Sheet; additional



2In addition to youths and women of childbearing age, the other vulnerable groups included in the results framework
were PLWHA, orphans and vulnerable children, widows and other poor women, sex workers, truckers, migrants, and
miners. See Annex 1 of the PAD.
3There were no intermediate outcome indicators in the PAD or DCA, only outcome and output indicators.

                                                          2

indicators in the results framework of the PAD are discussed below and presented in Annex 10.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.      Though substantial changes were introduced in the DCA in February 2003 to add a sub-
component (to place 850 persons under ARV treatment, including an operational research program for
400 persons) the PDO were not revised. In June 2005, the DCA was amended to incorporate a
supplemental grant financing (SDR 3.4 million or US$ 5 million equivalent) and included both minor
and major changes in the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
        (i)     Decrease from 1998/99 to 2004/05 the percentage of non-married individuals who report
                having 2 or more sexual partners: Females: from 4% to 2%; Males: from 13% to 10%.
        (ii)    Eliminated.
        (iii)   Increase (by 20%) condom utilization rates at previous high-risk sexual contact for:
                females (15-45), males (15-45), females (15-24), males (15-24), female sex workers,
                truckers, and miners.
        (iv)    Eliminated.

10.     As indicated in the Supplemental Grant Document, "the revised performance indicators (were
intended to) reflect the addition of new project activities (particularly Anti-retroviral therapy treatment
and prevention of mother to child transmission) and modifications of a few output indicators to be
consistent with the national HIV/AIDS monitoring system."

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The PAD devotes considerable attention (see Figure 6, PAD) to identifying priority target
groups (considered the core transmitters of HIV), such as commercial sex workers and their clients,
uniformed services, and highly mobile workers for scarce public resources but concludes that the
generalized nature of the epidemic requires that other sexually active groups, such as women, youths,
civil servants, private sector employees be addressed as well.

12.     Thus, though a "primary target group" is not explicitly identified in the PAD, a wide range of
potential beneficiaries are indicated in the discussions of the components; these include:
            line ministry staff and their families to promote preventive activities and to support those
            infected and affected by the disease (Component 1);
            Ministry of Health to finance identified program gaps and to expand care and treatment for
            those infected by the disease (Component 1);
            national and provincial authorities to strengthen planning and coordinating activities
            (Components 1 and 2);
            local communities to empower them to better cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its
            effects (e.g., PLWHA, orphans and vulnerable children, etc.) (Component 2); and
            targeted vulnerable groups (e.g., youth, women of reproductive age, commercial sex
            workers, prisoners, truck drivers, migrant workers) to curb the spread of the pandemic
            (Component 3).

13.     The Supplemental Grant Document broadly identifies the "beneficiaries" as the "population of
rural and urban areas," and mentions the same groups as in the PAD (including a few others such as
PLWHA receiving ARV treatment and pregnant women), and more specifically indicates quantified
objectives for reaching these beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components

14.     Component 1. Line Ministry Work Programs (US$ 10.60 million equivalent) continued IDA
financing from the Population and AIDS Control Project to support the multi-sectoral response by
helping:
              13 line ministries4 to prepare and implement annual work plans involving policy
              development, preventive interventions, psycho-social counseling, and capacity building;
              the Ministry of Health to develop HIV treatment and care activities (including ARV by
              focusing initially on formulating guidelines and strengthening health services); and
              the Permanent Secretariat of the national HIV/AIDS/STI committee (SP/CNLS) to
              strengthen oversight and policy formulation capabilities by: (i) planning, programming and
              coordinating national activities; (ii) organizing technical assistance and training; (iii)
              facilitating decentralization of program activities; and (iv) monitoring progress and
              facilitating exchange of best practices.

15.     Component 2. Provincial Activities and Community Sub-Projects (US$ 5.10 million
equivalent) built on Burkina's decentralization process, including IDA-funded experiences with
management of health district plans (Health and Nutrition Project) and with community organization of
HIV/AIDS activities (Community-Based Rural Development Project) to:
              support provincial authorities (in 13 of 45 provinces) to plan and coordinate HIV/AIDS
              activities; screen, approve and monitor community sub-projects; and build capacities of
              communities and associations to carry out sub-projects; and
              finance local community sub-projects focusing on: (a) awareness, advocacy, peer education
              and condom promotion; (b) home-based care and support for those infected and affected by
              the disease; (c) care of orphans; and (d) income-generating activities.

16.     Component 3. Targeted Interventions (US$ 4.20 million equivalent) built on international
experience with contracting for services and on the results of the Norwegian grant accompanying the
IDA-funded Population and AIDS Control Project to recruit NGOs with specialized expertise and
abilities both to carry out targeted interventions aimed at those groups critical to curbing the spread of
the disease (e.g., youth, women of reproductive age, commercial sex workers, prisoners, truck drivers,
migrant workers) and to serve as umbrella organizations for assisting smaller organizations which may
not necessarily have the capacity to prepare projects for submission receive.

17.     Component 4. Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 3.60 million equivalent) was
intended to finance:
              a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the national program; and
              a Project Management Unit to work closely with the SP-CNLS on technical issues and to be
              responsible for the administrative and financial management aspects of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

18.     At the time of project design, antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) was not eligible for IDA support,
but this policy was changed shortly after project effectiveness. At Government's request, intensive work
began almost immediately to revise Component 1 to allow for care and treatment activities, including
ARVs. By November 20025, (i) a three-pronged approach (involving both urban and rural service
delivery models and a prospective two-year clinical trial through the Centre Muraz) had been agreed on;



4The list of the original thirteen ministries and the subsequent eight additional ministries may be found in Annex 2.
5See especially Annexes 7 and 8 of the Aide-Mémoire of November 2002.

                                                             4

and (ii) OPCPR had confirmed that national drug procurement and distribution agency (CAMEG) had
the capacity to import ARV drugs in conformity with IDA procedures. Arrangements were finalized in
January 2003 in discussions with IDA and WHO, and IDA agreed in February 2003 to the Government's
request to amend the Credit to add a subcomponent to Component 1 to place 850 persons under ARV
treatment, including an operational research program for 400 persons.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.      Amendment of the DCA. In February 2003, an amendment was proposed with three objectives:
(i) facilitate the introduction of a comprehensive care and treatment sub-component, including the
financing of anti-retroviral drugs; (ii) simplify procedures to allow authorities to respond more rapidly to
the epidemic; and (iii) extend the closing date by one year (from December 2005 to December 2006) to
avoid interruption of treatment and allow for a smooth transition to a new IDA operation under the MAP
framework. Since there were no changes in overall project objectives, the amendment was approved by
the Regional Vice President.

20.      It should be noted that the measures agreed on prior to amending the DCA contributed to the
Government's readiness to rapidly expand treatment with resources from: (i) the Global Fund (beginning
in 2003); (ii) the IDA-funded Treatment Acceleration Program (from 2005); and (iii) a number of other
agencies (eg., Esther, Médecins Sans Frontière, Tan Aliz, etc.).

21.      Supplemental grant. A supplemental grant (P088879) was approved on May 3, 2005 in the
amount of SDR 3.4 million (US$5.0 million equivalent) and became effective on November 29, 2005.
Though partly the result of rapid disbursement by the project, the supplemental was justified under OP
13.20 based on: (i) fall in the US dollar, which resulted in a loss of US$2.6 million relative to prevailing
exchange rates during implementation; (ii) the Bank's decision to retroactively classify the project as
"category B" and to require implementation of a proposed $1.8 million medical waste management
action plan not foreseen during project design; and (iii) conflict in Côte d'Ivoire, together with rising
international oil prices, which increased the cost of transport and materials in Burkina by more than
20%.

22.      Other DCA amendments. In addition to February 2003 amendment, a reallocation of the project
proceeds was granted in November 2004. After approval of the supplemental grant, a reallocation and a
two-month extension of the closing date was granted in December 2006 to February 28, 2007 and
subsequently extended to June 30, 2007. A final request for reallocating project funds was agreed on in
June 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23.      Following an IDA portfolio review identifying pertinent HIV/AIDS actions (June 2000), project
preparation was carried out from September 2000 to July 2001 and involved: two preparation missions
(September and December 2000), a Quality Enhancement Review (January 2001), an appraisal mission
(April 2001), project negotiations (May 2001), and Board approval (July 2001).

24.      Project preparation was informed by the Bank's strategic approach to HIV/AIDS (Box 3 in the
PAD) and benefited from: (i) background analysis and existing documentation available in Burkina; and
(ii) prior experience from Burkina's two previous IDA-financed projects (Health and Nutrition and
Population and AIDS Control Projects) (Boxes 2 and 4 in the PAD). In addition, a number of
preparation studies were financed by the Population and AIDS Control Project and by a PHRD grant.

                                                      5

25.      Background analysis in the PAD included: (i) an overview of the HIV/AIDS situation in
Burkina (and elsewhere in Africa) and a more detailed epidemiological annex containing additional
information on STIs, TB, and blood transfusion; (ii) estimates of the potential economic costs of the
epidemic (though the annex addressing the economic justification for the project refers only to the
overall MAP justification); and (iii) a summary of the Government's evolving strategic response to
HIV/AIDS and discussion of the main issues of effective targeting and scaling up of multi-sectoral
approaches.

26.      Project preparation benefited from prior implementation experience: (i) the Health and Nutrition
Project's innovation allowing a disbursement category to fund annual work programs, which became the
basis for financing line ministries and decentralized authorities (Component 1); and (ii) the Population
and AIDS Control Project's piloting (in 2000-01) of a community driven scheme, which subsequently
provided a model to be scaled up under the new project (Component 2). In addition, the PHRD grant
funded studies which addressed targeting (geographical and socio-cultural) and vulnerable populations
(laborers and orphans) and which served as a basis for the targeted interventions (Component 3).6
Finally, the PHRD grant also financed preparation of the project implementation manual (which was
one of the conditions for effectiveness).

27.      Preparation included dialogue and consensus (with the Government and other partners) on the
basic principles of the proposed project (an integrated multi-sectoral approach, capacity building at all
levels, and decentralized resources with both flexible procedures and appropriate controls) and on
institutional arrangements leading to the strengthening of the SP-CNLS.

28.      Finally, the PAD included some specific annexes in response to the QER and the Decision
Meeting requests for more details about:
              the mechanics for how the project would operate (Annex 15 of the PAD) and the principles
              and procedures for how the funds would flow (Annex 6 of the PAD);
              a detailed first year program emphasizing the steps needed for this project to reach what the
              QER characterized as "a state of true readiness" (Annex 12 of the PAD);
              the subcontracting arrangements (including criteria for judging proposals) for channeling
              support to line ministries, provincial and community actions, and targeted interventions
              through NGOs (Annexes 2d and 13 of the PAD); and
              monitoring and evaluation in general and specific studies addressing key issues (e.g.,
              orphans, migrant workers, etc.) in particular (Annex 11 of the PAD).

29.      In sum, the preparation: (i) carried out appropriate background analysis based on the Bank's
strategic directives and comparative advantages; (ii) efficiently incorporated lessons from previous
projects and prepared detailed annexes indicating modalities for implementing the proposed project; (iii)
effectively promoted the institutional arrangements best suited for the implementation of the project;
and (iv) involved the different partners. Thus, while the project was based on the standard MAP design,
it was significantly further advanced than similar MAPs in other countries at the time of approval.7



6This may have been the first MAP to include a specific component (Component 3) for reaching high risk groups and
core transmitters as recommended in Martha Ainsworth and A. Mead Over, Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities in a
Global Epidemic (Oxford 1997). For a recent description of the methodology, findings, and conclusions used in this
exercise, see Maria Khan, et al., "HIV-Related Sexual Behavior in Urban, Rural and Border Areas of Burkina Faso,"
AIDS Behavior, 10 (September 2006), 607-617.
7In hindsight, the non inclusion of impact measures or of any likelihood of attribution to the project seems to have been
a prudent design decision which anticipated later Bank thinking (e.g., with respect to HIV prevalence targets).

                                                           6

30.       In three areas, however, the overall high quality of the preparation (and its relatively seamless
continuation of the previous project) turned out to be deficient:
              the assessment of risks and adequacy of the risk mitigation measures seem oddly discordant
              (e.g., with respect to communities), incomplete (e.g., the components to outputs analysis),
              and misjudged (e.g., absorptive capacity of line ministries, local authorities and communities,
              the acceptance VCT, the availability of drugs);
              neither the PHRD studies nor the extensive efforts to operationalize monitoring and
              evaluation in the PAD (and its importance for a project based on "learning by doing") were
              effectively integrated into project implementation; and
              the difficulties of formalizing arrangements for national AIDS coordination and for project
              implementation at central level (predicted at the QER) were greater than anticipated by the
              preparation team.

31.       Two other issues not treated during preparation later involved substantial additional work during
project implementation: (i) the introduction of ARVs (mentioned in the PAD but addressed in greater
detail in the minutes of negotiation); and (ii) medical waste management (recognized subsequently to
have been incorrectly omitted based on the original project classification).

32.       Finally, minutes of the negotiations identify two issues not resolved during preparation and only
addressed (sometimes with difficulty) during implementation:
              decentralized and flexible procedures as presaged by the disagreement over whether to
              domicile the special account in the Central Bank or in a commercial bank; and
              institutional arrangements as indicated by the maintenance of the National AIDS Secretariat
              (SP-CNLS) within the Presidency, the existing Project Management Unit (Unité de Gestion
              Financière or UGF) within the Ministry of Finance, and the commitment to merge UGF
              within the SP-CNLS by January 2004 at the latest.

2.2 Implementation

33.       The original credit was approved by the Board on July 6, 2001 for an amount of SDR 17.3
million (US$ 22.0 million equivalent) and became effective on March 4, 2002, with delays due mostly
to the difficulties of recruiting personnel for the SP-CNLS.

34.       Though based on demonstrated approaches from previous projects and using the experienced
personnel from the PMU of the Population and AIDS Control Project (through retroactive financing),
initial implementation of the project began slowly and exhibited problems, some of which (as noted in
the ISRs8) persisted throughout the implementation period, as summarized by component below:
              Component 1/Line ministries: a lack of standardization in presenting and measuring the
              results of the annual work programs, delays in approval, and variable efficacy and efficiency
              among ministries particularly with regard to the cellules relais at decentralized levels;
              Component 1/Ministry of Health: modest interest, a separate (and parallel) planning process
              for both the central CMLS-Health and the districts (with submission and approval coming
              sometimes as late as October), and slow disbursement despite repeated urging to move
              quickly on care and treatment, which was followed by improved disbursement after the
              introduction of the district funding mechanism (Programme d'appui au développement
              sanitaire, PADS);



8Because of a glitch in migrating information in the ISRs, the same issues and actions appear in all fifteen ISRs; as a
result, the identification of issues was done retrospectively by the ICR team.

                                                              7

             Component 1/SP-CNLS: concerns expressed in the early years of the project about weak
             capacity and inadequate program coordination;
             Component 2/Provincial and Community activities: ambitious capacity building in the 13
             provinces followed by rapid scaling up and disbursement of project funds;
             Component 3/Targeted interventions: persistent delays in organizing the tender, evaluating
             the offers, and awarding the contracts;
             Component 4/Monitoring and evaluation: constant consultant missions (including five
             missions from the Global Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET)) with very limited
             results and no discernible use of data for management.
             Component 4/Project coordination: generally satisfactory with some occasional weaknesses
             noted in financial management and procurement.

35.     The project moved essentially at two speeds, with the line ministries, the provincial/community
sub-projects, and the project coordination sub-components quickly scaling up and disbursing rapidly
while the other sub-components advanced much more slowly. The ISR ratings did not make this
distinction; summary ratings for PDO and IP were almost uniformly "satisfactory" throughout with: (i) a
minor recalibration upon the introduction of the new ratings system in 2004; and (ii) a single divergence
between the PDO and IP in 2005. A more accurate rating should probably have downgraded the PDO
more substantially from 2004 on and maintained the IP at MS (which is where it finished).9

36.     A major theme emerges from the various documents describing project implementation. Within
nine months of effectiveness, the project was considered a "relatively well disbursing MAP operation"
and within eighteen months, disbursements (particularly for Ministry plans including care and support,
introduction of ARVs, and community subprojects) were such that the Task Team was signaling the
need for a supplemental or a follow-on project. Contributing to the increasing pace of disbursement was
the suggestion from high level Bank management that resource availability should not be considered an issue
and that unplanned but justified activities (e.g., the pilot project in Samnatenga ) should be initiated rapidly.
                                                                                        10

From November 2003 on, insufficient resources became a preoccupation for project management and
the Task Team.

37.     With increasing disbursements and a non-functional management information system, the Task
Team expressed concern (backed up by an analysis of expenditures indicating an abnormally high
proportion of expenditures on travel and per diems) about the linkage between disbursements and results.

38.     While the mid-term review, scheduled for June 2004, should have provided the occasion to
examine these concerns, the ISRs for the period indicate that institutional tensions were noted between
PA-PMLS (the Bank's project) and SP-CNLS (the overall Government program). SP-CNLS strongly
recommended that a project review not be done separately from the mid-term review of the national
strategy, but PA-PMLS proceeded with a number of evaluation studies, which were deemed to be of
dubious quality by the Task Team (and are not cited among the project's documents). The Task Team
meanwhile carried out a project MTR in June 2004 with a number of specialists and participated in the
strategy MTR in November 2004.




9The other ratings were also satisfactory (with the exception of issues related to counterpart funds and a qualified audit).
Monitoring and evaluation was downgraded from S to U in June 2004, rose back to S in June 2006, and finished
(appropriately) at MU in June 2007.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.      Annex 11 of the PAD premised the design of the proposed monitoring and evaluation system on the
need to monitor progress in implementing both the project (based on the establishment of a management
information system) and the program (the national response based on a series of national surveys such as DHS
and other BSS, periodic studies following on the PHRD studies, and routine Ministry of Health reporting). In
its proposed approach, the Bank contributed resources from GAMET and worked in collaboration with
UNAIDS and the Measure/Evaluation Project (among others) to establish the M&E system.

40.      In practice, there were problems with both the selection of indicators and the means used to measure
their achievement. With respect to the selection of indicators, considerable effort was made with project staff
during the ICR mission to trace indicators and results at the beginning, mid-point, and end of the project. As
summarized below, the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators followed four scenarios:
         (i)       those consistently used throughout the project and measured at the beginning and the end;
         (ii)      those measured (or measurable) at the beginning and the end, but which were eliminated at the
                   time of the Supplemental Grant in 2005 ;           11

         (iii)     those introduced in the Supplemental Grant but usually without baseline data; and
         (iv)      those included in the original DCA but without baseline data and either eliminated in the
                   Supplemental Grant or not really monitored in any systematic manner.

41.      The four scenarios for monitoring the outcome and intermediate outcome indicators are presented in
the table below with the corresponding indicators (See Annex 10 of ICR for cross-reference):

42.      With respect to the development of means to measure achievement, despite considerable additional
resources mobilized by the Task Team (from GAMET12 and other sources) to assist the PMU and the SP-



11The QAG assessment concluded that the Task Team should, at the mid-term review, agree with the Government on a
smaller and simpler set of indicators for measuring project progress, but there is no indication that this was done.
12GAMET's support for the development of M&E capabilities deserves more study to determine why the component
was not satisfactorily implemented; the ICR team cannot say whether the proposals were too complex, lacked adequate
incentives, fell victim to evolving institutional arrangements, etc.

                                                                9

CNLS, the management information system for the national strategic framework, which incorporates the
project indicators, was never fully operational and only a few of the proposed surveys and studies were
actually implemented:
             the DHS was repeated in 2003, seems to have had some comparability problems with the 1999
             DHS (and was only sporadically referred to in the Aide-mémoires and ISRs), and was replaced by
             the 2007 CWIS as the source of data for comparison purposes. The project contributed US$100,000 to
             the cost of the CWIS, which required doubling the number of enumerators because many questions
             were gender sensitive;
             the Behavioral Surveillance Survey (BSS) was intended to be carried out every two years but was
             not repeated nor were the initial beneficiary assessment (2001) or the mapping exercise (2001) for
             which a methodology (in Tenkodogo) was developed during project preparation.

43.     Additional studies of orphans and migrant workers were conducted in 2005 at the start of the targeted
interventions but were considered as limited baseline exercises rather than follow-up studies on the PHRD
work.

44.     However, with strong support from the Task Team, DECRG carried out a remarkable number of
operational research studies, including: (i) a survey of health facilities delivering ARV treatment (2006); (ii)
the addition of questions related to treatment to the 2007 CWIS; (iii) a survey of HIV/AIDS patients and their
households (ongoing); (iv) an analysis of the HIV/AIDS data in the Burkina Faso DHS 2003; and (v) an
impact evaluation on cash transfers to orphans (baseline survey scheduled for early 2008). Preliminary results
of (i) and (ii) have been presented in Burkina Faso and Ghana (January and July 2007), and further analysis is
ongoing. The analysis performed under (iv) has been published in two World Bank Policy Research Papers
(WPS # 3844 and # 3956) and one journal (Population and Development Review); it has been disseminated in
Burkina Faso (2006) and at various international conferences as well. Data collection under (iii) and (v) is
either ongoing or scheduled for the near future.

45.     In sum, the M&E sub-component of the project never completely achieved its objectives at the
outcome, output, or process levels; at the same time, however, SP-CNLS was:
             developing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework (comprising 18 impact
             indicators, 25 results indicators, and more than 100 process and input indicators);
             producing (at least for 2004 and 2005) the UNGASS country report on the HIV/AIDS situation in
             Burkina Faso; and
             consolidating large quantities of data from disparate sources for presentation (2002 through 2007)
             at the annual meeting of contributors and participants in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

While the documentation for the annual meeting was cumbersome to produce (comprising some 250 pages)
and not especially useful for management decision-making on a regular basis, the information provides the
only comprehensive overview of the national response.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

46.     Environment. At the time of appraisal, the project's environmental category was "C" and thus
did not need an environmental assessment, though the PAD noted there were concerns about hazardous
waste and proposed (in an action plan produced in November 2002) to address these concerns by
incorporating criteria (for disposal, IEC, and training) into the selection of sub-projects for communities
and of work program agreements of line ministries. As indicated in the supplemental grant document
(April 2005), the project was retroactively classified as environmental category "B"; a waste manage-
ment plan was prepared, reviewed and found satisfactory by the Bank, and disclosed to the InfoShop on
March 30, 2003.


                                                      10

47.      The proposed action plan for medical waste management had an originally estimated cost of 900
million CFA (about $1.8 million). Though the costs of implementing the plan were not foreseen in the
project design, the project did finance some preparation activities and training for hospital staff, and the
supplemental Grant was intended to finance initial implementation of the Action Plan. In April 2005, a
supervision mission recommended a series of legislative, regulatory, and technical actions; two years
later, the final supervision mission concluded that none of the recommendations had been followed up
and that they be deferred to the new project.

48.      Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management (FM). Early supervision missions were
satisfied with the directives established in the manuals and PMU's compliance with them, and an extensive
review of financial management procedures in November 2002 suggested only modest improvements (linked
mostly to the information systems). In June 2004, subsequent review affirmed the basic elements (including
systems and personnel), and suggested: (i) better coordination and supervision among the financial managers
in the ministries and provinces; and (ii) increased efforts to initiate quarterly Financial Management Reports
(FMRs). A final FM review in April 2007 contained a dozen or so shortcomings and recommendations for
project budgeting, accounting systems, internal controls (for equipment, vehicles, gasoline, etc.), supervision
of the financial management component, use of technical and financial audit results, and inadequate FMRs.
The April 2007 review rated FM as moderately unsatisfactory due to significant shortcomings on internal
controls, in particular those related to budget control and analysis.

49.      Conversely, despite repeated recommendations to improve procurement (e.g., updating of the
procurement plan, insufficient quality of the tender documents, disproportionate use of sole-sourcing,
etc.), the project was consistently rated Satisfactory.

50.      Review of the DCA/DGA. Except for an early supervision mission (November 2002), there is
no evidence that the Bank systematically reviewed the DCA/DGA; however, the PMU provided a final
analysis (October 2007)13 which concluded that all of the clauses were fulfilled except for the mid-term
review, which was combined (with Government concurrence) with a mid-term review of the overall
national strategy.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.      During project preparation and for much of project implementation, institutional arrangements
for coordinating the national strategy and the project were slowly worked out, principally among SP-
CNLS (Presidency), UGF (or the PMU of PA-PMLS housed initially in the Ministry of Finance), and
the line ministries (especially the Ministries of Health and Social Affairs). The final step was the
merger of PMU within SP-CNLS in April 2005, about 15 months after the date agreed on at negotiations.
As a result, both the institutional arrangements and the management capacities have been strengthened
for the future.

52.      In July 2005, a second strategic framework (2006-2010) was adopted and reaffirmed the need to
continue the multi-sectoral approach of the previous strategic framework. In addition, the strategic
framework emphasized the principle of the "three ones" (common funding, harmonized procurement
and financial management procedures, and shared monitoring and evaluation indicators and practices).
In line with these principles (and in addition to the PRSC), the Board approved the Health Sector
Support and Multi-sectoral AIDS Project (HSSMAP) on April 27, 2006 for SDR 33 million (US$ 47.7
million equivalent). The PAD argues, as a rationale for Bank participation, its ability to:

                                                        11

             encourage harmonization among donor partners, including for HIV/AIDS, health programs,
             and community interventions;
             promote institutional reforms and finance key priorities essential for MDGs, including
             funding for community and nongovernmental organizations, and strengthening monitoring
             and evaluation-and to pilot reforms that are later integrated into national systems (such as
             performance contracting);
             manage the risks associated with decentralization and budget support, including capacity-
             building and financial management (especially, continued difficulties with liquidity).

53.     The new project was declared effective in August 2007 and will support a sector wide approach
and provide flexible financing through a pooled funding mechanism for the HIV/AIDS strategic plan.
Very similar component activities (as well as the TAP's interventions) and a number of the performance
indicators for the HIV/AIDS project have been included in the HSSMAP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

54.     As part of the ICR mission's objective of sharing the methodology for and preliminary results of
the ICR, the following section (and the accompanying table in Annex 10) was originally included in the
Aide-Mémoire and discussed with Government authorities and other stakeholders during the wrap-up
meeting of the ICR mission which visited Burkina Faso in October 2007. The text has subsequently
been translated into English and the conclusions modified to take into account subsequent comments,
discussion, and decisions from the review meeting.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

55.     The relevance of the project's overall strategy and components as well as its specific activities are
rated satisfactory14 from the perspectives of the Bank's objectives and Burkina's priorities in the fight against
HIV/AIDS.

56.     With respect to the Bank's policies and strategies, the Project's Development Objectives (PDOs):
             support the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) adopted in 2000, updated in 2003, and revised for
             the period 2005-09; and
             correspond to the original intent of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region
             in their modification and anticipate many of IEG's recommendations in its evaluation of the "first
             generation" projects.15

57.     With respect to Burkina's priorities, the Project's Development Objectives (PDOs):
             support two of the four priorities of the Poverty Reduction Strategy adopted in 2000 and updated
             in 2005: (i) access of the poor to social services and especially to prevention, care, treatment, and
             control of HIV/AIDS; and (ii) promotion of good governance through strengthening capacity at
             decentralized levels;
             correspond to the National Strategic Plan to Fight HIV/AIDS both for the period 2001-2005 and
             for the revised plan for the period 2006-2010; and
             contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal 6 which aims to halt the
             spread of HIV/AIDS and begin to reverse the current trends.



14Though IEG uses a four point scale for rating relevance, efficacy, and efficiency, ICRR guidelines (OPCS, June
2007) do not provide similar explicit ratings scales. For consistency's sake, the ICR team used the six point scale which
is mostly used throughout Annex A of the ICRR guidelines to orient its considerations.
15See OED, Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance (2005), pp. xvii-xviii.

                                                           12

58.      Finally, it should be noted that, in analyzing the key sector issues, the current Health Sector
Support and Multi-sectoral AIDS Project has built on no less than six areas addressed during the
implementation of the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project (see the HSSMAP PAD, paragraph 9). In
other words, the project's concerns were relevant in 2000, continued to be relevant in 2007, and are
expected to be relevant through the HSSMAP closing date in 2010. The project's relevance would have
been rated highly satisfactory except that the design did not sufficiently develop strong and coherent
links between inputs, outputs, and outcomes either within the individual components or between the
components and the overall expected impact. To be rated highly satisfactory would have required a
clearer operationalization of the project's key words noted in Para. 6 (e.g., scale up, capacity, mitigate)
combined with a more robust M&E system and systematic use of the results.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

59.      Achievement of the PDOs was rated as moderately unsatisfactory. As shown in the accompanying
table (Annex 10), two of the four outcome indicators included in the original DCA were eliminated from the
amended DGA and only partial data were available for the remaining two. Moreover, assessment of the PDOs
must take into account two additional elements which increase the number of outcome indicators for
consideration:
              the new ICR format automatically reclassified the DCA's output indicators as intermediate
              outcome indicators, and in the ICR Team's estimation, three should be considered as such in
              determining the overall outcome rating while the others are simply outputs; and
              the restructuring of the project requires that "separate outcome ratings (against original and revised
              objectives) be weighted in proportion to the share of the actual disbursements made in the periods
              before and after approval of the revision."16

On the basis of 14 potentially quantifiable outcome/intermediate outcome indicators, the ICR found that 8
were achieved, 3 were not (with 2 missing their objectives badly), and 3 had no data (and thus considered not
achieved).17 Whether using the strict outcome results or the combined outcome/intermediate outcome results,
the project must be rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

60.      Achievement of the output indicators was rated as moderately unsatisfactory as well, due in part to the
lack of achievement (for those in the original DCA) and in part to the weighting formula (for those in the
amended DCA).

61.      Finally, though not directly attributable to the project, there are data which indicate an improvement in
the situation prior to and during the project period:
              a time trends review from individual surveillance sites shows a sharp drop in prevalence
              (including among women aged 15-24), which began in the late 1990s through early 2000s,
              suggesting reduced incidence in addition to increased mortality (see Annex 3);
              the 2003 DHS provided the first national level HIV estimates, which resulted in a significant
              downward revision of prevalence levels (2% nationally), largely because earlier models
              overestimating the HIV prevalence in rural areas, and most of the sentinel surveillance sites
              were urban based;




16ICRR Guidelines (June 5, 2007), Appendix B, p. 42.
17Subsequent to the ICR mission, the Government has provided data for commercial sex workers, truckers, and miners,
but the data is from the initial studies of the NGOs involved in the targeted interventions and should probably be
considered as baseline information rather than end results.

                                                            13

            results from the sentinel surveillance correspond closely with the findings on urban
            prevalence levels in the DHS (e.g., about 4% in 2003).

While these results represent the combined efforts of both the Government and its technical and financial
partners, the project did contribute to undeniable progress in several important areas:
    · organizing and strengthening the public response for prevention and care and treatment at both central
        and decentralized levels;
    · increasing the geographical coverage of VCT and PMTCT services and consequently the number of
        persons tested and the number of mothers receiving treatment to prevent transmission of the disease to
        their children;
    · increasing the number of PLWHA receiving treatment with ARVs; and
    · based on data from the expanded number of sentinel sites, decreasing the rates of new infections.

3.3 Efficiency

62.     Project efficiency was rated as moderately unsatisfactory based on a consideration of: (i) the
inherent inefficiencies introduced by the MAP strategy; (ii) the role of the MAP in financing the national
strategy modalities used to implement the different components; and (iii) the financial management practices
of the PMU. These considerations are addressed in more detail in Annex 3.

63.     As one of the earliest MAP operations, the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project conformed to the
recommended structure and (to a lesser extent) resource allocations with certain consequences for overall
efficiency. First, while there was discussion of targeting and priorities, the potential efficiency of Components
1-3 were not yet known. Second, as the Task Team Leader pointed out in one ISR, there was a tendency for
the components to operate somewhat vertically, both among themselves and between the MAP activities and
those of other partners. Third, there was a preoccupation with rapid start-up and disbursement, and this
project (with its good disbursement record) was perhaps encouraged: (i) to spend too rapidly on previously
tested but still unproven interventions; and (ii) to expand components or to add activities in the name of
flexibility but to the detriment of efficiency.

64.     Further, over time, the MAP financed a decreasing proportion of the overall program. New partners
(Global Fund, private sector, etc.) and new projects (TAP, AfDB) focused on more specific interventions such
as VCT, or treatment while the MAP continued to focus more generally on prevention and care and support.
At the same time, analysis by the Task Team (and by AfDB during its project preparation) showed that: (i)
expenditures for line ministry activities included disproportionate amounts for per diems, fuel, etc.; (ii) unit
costs for the community projects were relatively high; and (iii) projected budgets for the targeted interventions
were substantially higher than expected. There was also concern about the costs of Component 2, given its
coverage and likely impact since: (i) provinces were selected on the basis of their population rather than their
prevalence rate; and (ii) the vast majority of the sub-projects were in rural areas where prevalence was
estimated at less than 1%.

65.     Finally, weak planning and budgeting practices (with the resulting need to review priorities,
correct unit costs, negotiate reduced budgets, etc.), consistently late approval of annual work plans (in
March or April thus effectively reducing the time for executing activities and budgets to 8-9 months),
and constant concerns about insufficient funds (accompanied by amendments to the DCA/DGA to
reallocate funds among categories) contributed to inefficiencies during project implementation.




                                                      14

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

66.      Though the project can legitimately claim to have been and continue to be satisfactory for its
relevance, this rating cannot overcome the greater importance of and the moderately unsatisfactory ratings for
efficacy and efficiency. The overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

66.      The final external evaluation18 identified a number of the project's positive contributions with
respect to gender and social development:
             Targeting and involving women are essentials to lead the social mobilization effort in
             general and particularly in the case of pregnant women to sensitize others and to accompany
             them to be tested.
             Using appropriate communications channels to reach youths (clubs, peer educators,
             performances, etc. in secondary schools).
             While decentralizing structures and capacity to the village level is important, these structures
             must deal with a variety of local issues in addition to HIV/AIDS.
             The multitude of structures (NGOs, associations, village organizations, etc.) at decentralized
             levels can sometimes provoke political problems and personality clashes which weaken their
             impact and make them less able to respond adequately to outside pressures (from political
             powers, donors, etc.).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67.      While the institutional arrangements and financing for the national strategy (mentioned before)
were strengthened for the long-term within the project, institutional arrangements within the ministries
and at provincial levels remain precarious. Though line ministry coordinating committees at central and
decentralized levels (CMLS and the Cellules Relais) have a legal status, seats remain unfilled and
budgeted resources are mostly non-existent (though the Ministry of Finance has generally provided
some funds and several ministries are including very modest funding in their 2008 budget submissions).
In the 13 (of 45) provinces supported by the project, there was a very positive impact on activities
related to HIV/AIDS, but the PMU's final evaluation asks whether the motivation of the provincial
coordinating committees (CPLS) will fade with the lack of funding. The Government has initiated
studies on this issue,19 and the new IDA-funded project will allow time for additional reflection.

68.      Weak financial management impacted on institutional development in at least two ways. First,
the project's efforts to establish the annual planning and budgeting process were significantly disrupted
by the lack of funds at critical moments; thus, while the structures were primed to function, they were

often forced to slow down or stop. Second, efforts by the project to strengthen financial management
capacity within the line ministries and facilitate project expenditures by recruiting financial managers
had a decidedly negative impact not anticipated during preparation, which engendered: (i) costs not
commensurate with the amounts being managed; and (ii) conflict with the existing line ministry
financial staff (Administrative and Financial Directorate, DAF).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

69.     Government's commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS and the institutional and strategic measures
described previously constitute the major risk mitigation factors in achieving the development outcomes.
Since 2001, the Government has systematically: (i) promoted institutional arrangements (at central,
provincial, and community levels); (ii) developed consistent and coherent national strategies; (iii)
adopted appropriate program policies and procedures (for testing, care and support, and treatment); (iv)
mobilized significant amounts of financing (from public, private, and donor sources); and (iv) improved
absorptive capacities (through harmonized procedures among sources and modalities for decentralized
spending).

70.     Particularly significant progress has been made in enhancing surveillance, expanding testing and
counseling, acknowledging (and slowly reducing discrimination against) PLWHA, and providing
PMTCT and ARV treatment. No significant progress was recorded on introducing measures for waste
management.

71.     Despite these impressive gains, controlling (and potentially reducing) the spread of HIV/AIDS
depends on inculcating (and sustaining) behavioral change, on which Burkina has encountered many of
the difficulties faced by other countries. In this particular area, both prevailing international experience
and Burkina's project results require rating the risk to development outcome as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

72.     Despite the fact that both the QER (in comments not included in the official panel report) and
the QAG assert that "the project was not ready to be implemented when it was approved" (particularly
with respect to M&E and FM), the ICR rates preparation as satisfactory given the relevancy of the
project's objectives, the urgency with which it was prepared, and the mostly successful efforts made to
respond to reviewers' concerns.

73.     From the initial portfolio review through negotiations, the Bank's preoccupations were clear and
clearly transmitted to the Government: (i) establish intervention priorities focusing especially on contact
points (geographical, socio-cultural, etc.) where the disease was most likely to be spread; (ii) determine


                                                     16

how to scale-up these priority interventions for prevention and care and treatment; and (iii) define and
strengthen institutional relationships to ensure effective implementation. The PHRD studies contributed
to the first; the results of the previous IDA-financed projects contributed to the second; and dialogue
with the Government throughout the preparation (and in negotiations) contributed to the third.

74.      The QER (January 2001) noted the progress in developing the project on a very fast track and
the many positive elements of project's design, including: (i) its consistency with the Bank's emerging
cross-sectoral approach to supporting the establishment of an institutional framework for community
action in Burkina; (ii) the appropriateness of the proposed emphasis on a flexible and demand driven
response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Burkina; and (iii) the clarity of the monitoring and evaluation
activities to be developed in the project.

75.      While supporting as appropriate the "learning by doing" character of the project design, the
Panel stated that "flexibility should not come at the cost of accountability" and urged the Task Team to:
(i) manage expectations (acknowledging that this first operation will itself likely only begin the process
of reversing the growth in the incidence of the disease); (ii) phase the "ambitious" set of outputs and
outcomes to establish realistic benchmarks for newly established institutions requiring satisfactory
completion of initial capacity-building efforts; and (iii) prepare a detailed plan for the first year of the
project to ensure that the project gets off to a quick start. As indicated previously, the Task Team
responded adequately to each of these concerns.

76.      In three other areas noted by the QER (and cited by the QAG), the Task Team was less
successful in providing:
              clearer links between the proposed project and ongoing or planned efforts to strengthen the
              "biomedical response" to HIV/AIDS;
              greater specificity on the project design and particularly on the management of funds for the
              community sub-projects and the targeted interventions; and
              more specific modalities for using the results of the M&E system in decision-making about
              the flow of resources.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

77.      The QER, Panel noted that, as for other MAP projects, success will require intensive Bank
support during project implementation and urged management to assure that adequate resources be
available. At the Decision Meeting, a further recommendation was made that the Task Team get
agreement from management on a supervision strategy and resource level for reference in the project
file. Annex 16 in the PAD did this and sought $150,000 for FY02. For FY02-04, the Bank allocated
almost $500,000 for supervision of which $450,000 was actually spent.

78.      Initially, the project benefited from frequent supervision missions (three per year in 2002 and
2003) and from field-based supervision beginning in September 2003. In August 2004, the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the project and rated the quality of supervision to be "satisfactory" (2
on the QSA6 rating scale). The QAG noted a number of strengths (e.g., adequate/complementary
staffing and substantial budgets, detailed and candid ISR reporting, etc.) and positive results on handling
weaker aspects of the preparation (e.g., environmental issues, institutional development, etc.). The
QAG noted that: (i) the ISRs could be shorter and more strategic; and (ii) "ratings occasionally appear to
have been disconnected from actual project progress or not clearly enough explained" (especially for the
M&E and FM ratings, which were "sometimes overestimated").


                                                      17

79.     After the QAG, the quality of supervision declined. Between early 2005 and September 2006,
TTL responsibilities for the ISRs and for the supervision missions seem to have been shared; in
September 2006, full responsibility was transferred to a fourth TTL based in the field. Between May
2005 and May 2007 (as pointed out in the final supervision mission Aide-mémoire of May 2007), no
formal supervision missions were conducted. In fact, beginning as early as June 2004, supervision
missions dealt with several projects simultaneously (the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response and the
Supplemental Grant, the Treatment Acceleration Program, and the Health Sector Support and Multi-
sectoral AIDS Project), and the emphasis on the start-up of the TAP and the preparation of the
HSSMAP may have reduced the amount of time the Task Team could devote to the MAP.

80.     Perhaps more significant than the somewhat uneven approach to supervision at different stages
of project implementation was the Task Team's inability (despite dialogue and proffered Technical
Assistance) to solve the problems of a project whose components (as pointed out by the QAG) were
advancing at very different speeds. Rapid expansion and high disbursements for line ministry work
plans (Component 1) and community sub-projects (Component 2) stand in stark contrast to the long
delays and inadequate results produced by the pilot Burkinavi treatment program (Component 1), the
targeted interventions (Component 3), and the development of M&E (Component 4). Based on a
reading of the ISRs, it may be (and the QAG suggests this as well) that the Task Team could have
focused more on outcomes and less on components to draw attention to this unbalanced
implementation.20

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

81.     ICR guidance states that when the rating for one dimension is in the satisfactory range (in this
case for quality at entry) and the other is in the unsatisfactory range (for quality of supervision), the
rating for overall Bank performance normally depends on the outcome rating, which was moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

82.     Within the overall context of MAP implementation and based particularly on: (i) government's
ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives; (ii) progress in developing the
enabling environment (politico-institutional, technical, financial, and administrative); (iii) strengthened
implementation capacity at central, provincial, and community levels; (iv) productive relationships with
donors, partners, and other stakeholders; and (v) the adequacy of transition arrangements, the project
might well earn a satisfactory rating. However, persistent weaknesses in (i) financial management and
procurement; (ii) arrangements for monitoring and evaluation (especially the use of such information in
decision-making and resource allocation to improve efficacy and efficiency); and (iii) lack of progress
on waste management require that the rating be reduced to moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




20The ISRs should, at some point, have reflected different ratings for PDO and IP rather than being (with one
exception) identical.

                                                           18

83.      It was agreed that the PMU (Unité de Gestion Financière, UGF) be integrated from the Ministry of
Finance into SP-CNLS at the time of negotiations and the transfer be effective before January 2004. The
PMU was finally integrated in February 2005 at which time it ceased to be an implementing agency. Both
prior to and subsequent to the integration of the PMU, however, its performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory. Despite the presence of an experienced unit, the weaknesses noted above in procurement,
financial management, and especially project (as opposed to program) monitoring and evaluation diminished
the quality of the unit's performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

84.      Lessons can be learned from each of the three major "story lines" which emerge from examining
the preparation and implementation of this project.

85.      First, though an early MAP (with the inherited weaknesses of the original design), this project
differed from other MAPs by relying on previous project experience (and a well-trained PMU) to
introduce some innovative elements (e.g., Component 3's targeted interventions) and a number of fairly
sophisticated approaches (e.g., for monitoring progress and measuring achievement). In fact, this
created a project which worked at two different speeds (see paras. 35 and 83): Those things which the
project knew how to do from previous experience it did well (Components 1 and 2), and those things it
knew less well (and for which there were perhaps insufficient incentives to do better) it did less well.

86.      How to balance effective implementation of well-mastered processes with appropriate capacity-
building and incentives for innovative approaches constitutes a continuing challenge for TTLs and Bank
management. The enormous delays in recruiting the NGOs already active in HIV/AIDS to implement
the targeted interventions in Burkina was due to the Bank's limited flexibility to use civil society
structures for project implementation and resulted in long delays and very limited success in addressing
these high risk groups.

87.      Second, though the project was in many respects exemplary in its inherent relevance to Bank
policies and country strategies and its ability to respond to the evolving national needs, the indicators
chosen to measure this response did not keep pace. Indicators were selected and eliminated, measured
(or not) haphazardly, and generally ignored as a management tool throughout much of the project period
(at least by the project)(see para. 41). Though not a new lesson, this project illustrates once again the
need for: (i) objectives and performance indicators to be carefully selected; (ii) an adequately designed
M&E system to exist at the start of project implementation; and (iii) appropriate structures to be in place
to ensure that information is used strategically for decision-making.

88.      Third, though the decision to move from a series of projects (Population and AIDS Control,
HIV/AIDS Disaster Response and the Supplemental Grant, and Treatment Acceleration) to a more
programmatic approach (Health Sector Development) to address Health and HIV/AIDS was almost
certainly appropriate, the period from 2004-2006 was probably both confusing for the Government and
distracting for the Task Team (see para. 82). With two complementary but complex projects addressing
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the preparation of the Health Sector Development Program should probably
have been delayed.

89.      Each of these areas has implications for ACTAfrica specifically and Bank management more
generally. Given the generally similar components of each MAP, ACTAfrica should have been
providing counsel from its experience across the range of MAP interventions and drawing the Task

                                                      19

Team's attention to the need for better measurement and more balanced implementation. There is
nothing in the record (supervision mission reports, ISRs, MTR, etc.) to indicate that ACTAfrica played
any such role in the implementation of this project.

90.     Finally, the broader issue of institutional relationships within the Bank for oversight of the MAP
projects should perhaps be examined in more detail: The complexities of (i) coordinating the different
concerns of DC and field-based management; (ii) juggling administrative requirements for current
project implementation while developing a future program; (iii) organizing technical inputs from a
number of Bank agencies, including the Global AIDS Program, ACTAfrica, GAMET (hosted by the
Bank but a service of UNAIDS), DECRG, etc. are such that true project management may be
beyond the ability of any single TTL; and (iv) ensuring that adequate supervision resources is
allocated to the task team.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies: See Annex 7

By letters of December 20, 2007, (no. 2007-0016941/MS/CAB and no. 2007-1384/PRES/CNLS-IST/SP), the
ICR team received Borrower's comments on the draft French version of the ICR dated December 6, 2007.
While most of the comments not related to the translation into French have been taken into account, the ICR
team would like to highlight the following:

With respect to the information in the data sheet:
            Point A (Basic Information): These data are system generated and stored in the World Bank
            project database.
            Point B (Key dates): In view of the system's constraints, the Borrower's reference to the dates of
            Grant effectiveness is mentioned in paragraphs 21 and 33.
            Point F (Results Framework Analysis): The original Target Value date should correspond to the
            original credit closing date: December 31, 2005 or the amended closing date at the time of the
            supplemental Grant: December 31, 2006.

With respect to the other comments:
            Paragraph 1: The information related to the prevalence rates comes directly from the Project
            Appraisal Document, paragraph 1.4.
            Paragraph 3: The report cited was written in 2000 when UNAIDS existed.
            Paragraph 32, point 1: The ICR does not state that the issue was not resolved, but that agreement
            at negotiations was implemented with some difficulties thereafter. Point 2: The English version
            of the ICR does not contradict the point made by the Borrower.
            Paragraph 33: The Borrower is correct that the supplemental Grant was delayed by the legal
            opinion; but an ISR indicates that the original credit effectiveness was delayed due to the
            recruitment issues.
            Paragraph 34: These points were made in the ISRs and concern particularly the early years of the
            project.
            Paragraph 38, point 1: The ISRs indicate differences of opinion between the Task Team, PA-
            PMLS, SP/CNLS-IST at the time of the mid-term review. Point 2: The ICR does not state that
            the SP/CNLS-IST refused to carry out a project mid-term review, but rather recommended that it
            be integrated into the review of the strategic framework. The information is taken from the ISRs.
            Point 3: The ICR does not state that the studies were not agreed to by the Bank, but rather argued
            that (based on the conclusions of the Task Team in the ISRs) their results were of dubious
            quality.




                                                       20

          Paragraph 62: Financial management practices are noted in paragraphs 48, 65, and 68 and are
          addressed in Annex 3. A qualified audit, among other documents consulted, suggests that there
          were issues in this area throughout the project.
          Paragraph 64, point 1: A table that shows these amounts was provided to the ICR team. Not only
          perdiem are mentioned, but also a range of other operating costs. Point 2: The sub-projects
          were implemented in rural areas.
          Annex 10: The Borrower's point is made in paragraph 61 of the ICR; accordingly target
          indicator must therefore not be overly ambitious. The Project overall outcome rating remains at
          moderately unsatisfactory.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

        Component 1: Line Ministry Work Programs. The component financed three interventions: (i)
capacity-building of the SP/CNLS-IST; (ii) support for the Ministry of Health; and (iii) strengthening of line
ministry structures and financing work plans at central (CMLS) and decentralized levels (CR).

        SP/CNLS-IST strengthening. In addition to contributing to the operations of the SP/CNLS-IST
(planning and coordination, personnel salaries, etc.), the project financed the construction and equipment of
new offices.

        Support for the Ministry of Health. In addition to the Ministry's own work plan for its CMLS, the
project directly supported expansion of PMTCT (in seven health districts) and the Burkinavi operational
research study which included ARV treatment for some 290 PLWHA). Indirectly, the project contributed to
an overall program which scaled up services during the period of the project as indicated in the table below:

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

         Two major weaknesses in the design and implementation of the project constrain any attempt to
analyze the economic and financial implications of the project. First, the conservative (and probably
realistic) results framework is essentially incomplete since it:
              does not address lives saved (through reduced incidence or decreasing prevalence) or lives
              extended (through treatment);
              only partially addresses the linkages between inputs, knowledge and behavior; and
              does not sufficiently address the linkages between inputs, coverage, and utilization of services.

As a result, expectations for what was supposed to occur as a result of expenditures on Components 1 and 2;
and to a lesser extent Component 3 are not clear, and the use of existing positive data on the evolution of the
epidemic (as shown below) cannot really be used.

           Evolution of HIV prevalence between 2000-2006 among pregnant women aged 15-24

Second, as has been mentioned several times in the text, the lack of an effective M&E system within the
project makes linkages between project data and program data difficult.

         This analysis follows on IEG's evaluation of the first generation MAP projects21 which bases the
project's economic and financial results on the counterfactual of no assistance and on its contribution to: (i)
deepen political commitment to controlling the epidemic; (ii) expand and strengthen national and sub-
national AIDS institutions for the long-run response; (iii) enlist NGOs in the national response and reinforce
their capacity to provide access to prevention and care among the high-risk groups most likely to contract
and spread the infection; and (iv) enhance the efficiency of national AIDS programs.

         Increased political commitment. In addition to expressions of commitment embodied in the
MDO's, the national strategy, and the statements of the President, the periodic UNGASS reports for 2004 and
2006 contain one potential measure of the project's contribution to political commitment, as expressed by the
policy index, which increased from 71% in 2003 to 77% in 2005.22

         Two additional measures should also be considered: (i) increased Government financing of
HIV/AIDS through its own resources; and (ii) Ministry commitment to devote 1% of their own budgets to
supporting the line ministry actions. With respect to Government financing, the amounts have increased

With respect to the 1%, while none of the line ministries were able to achieve the 1% budget line item for
HIV/AIDS, SP/CNLS-IST's annual report for 2006 shows that ten ministries did finance activities.23

Though other partners provided financial and technical support, the project was probably the most important
source of financial support.

         Enlist and reinforce NGO capacity to provide services among the high-risk groups. The project
attempted to do this in one of its most innovative approaches for: (i) developing principles for mapping
populations and targeting interventions; (ii) recruiting NGOs already present and working in Burkina; and
(iii) accompanying the interventions with rigorous operational research methods. That this intervention was
delayed by a series of procurement difficulties and encountered financial constraints (linked both to the costs
proposed by the NGOs and to the expenditures of other components) meant that the project was really not
able to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

         Enhanced efficiency. Throughout the implementation period there were concerns about the
project's efficiency and particularly the kinds of activities and the amounts and types of expenditures for
Components 1-3. A posteriori (and without a detailed analytical accounting), it is difficult to reach a
judgment about the project's efficiency. With respect to the kinds of activities, it can be noted from the
tables presented in Annex 2 is that:




23Secrétariat Permanent. Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (SP-CNLS), Bilan Général 2006, Table 40, p. 109.

                                                                30

              for Component 1, the evolution indicated in the summary of Ministry activities seems
              reasonable: from capacity building in years 1-3 to prevention in years 2-4 to care and support in
              years 3-5;
              for Component 2, the evolution of activities does not seem nearly so clear-cut, perhaps because
              the project: (i) was more directive with the Ministries and (ii) respected the demand-driven
              nature of this component; and
              for Component 3, it is impossible to discern any trend since the interventions only lasted a year
              or so.

         With respect to the amounts of the expenditures, the results are somewhat different:
              for Component 1, there seems to be very little relationship between annual activities and
              expenditures;
              for Component 2, comparing unit costs for prevention and for care and treatment in terms of
              beneficiaries and activities can only be indicative, but not surprisingly, care and treatment is
              more costly (particularly on an activity basis); and
              for Component 3, management costs were fixed at 10% of operating costs and there are not
              comparable units (not even the number of beneficiaries, which would seem to be a particular
              weakness of the approach used).

         Some evidence has been collected along the way (though not systematically), which may justify
somewhat the monies used by the project:
              for Component 1, the Ministries of Defense and Security showed, based on a study of 2640
              soldiers and police recruited between 1999-2001 (all HIV negative) and re-examined again in
              2004, that intensive prevention campaigns can work: only 3 had become HIV positive;
              for Component 2, an evaluation in 199924 showed a significant difference between areas covered
              or not by sensitization efforts: in covered zones, 79.4% said that they had changed their behavior
              as a result of being reached while in uncovered zones only 59.7% said they had change their
              behavior;
              for Component 3, the recent work by Khan, Brown, et al. cited in the ICR demonstrates the need
              to focus on core groups and to tailor prevention strategies to their specific characteristics.

         Overall, the project certainly enhanced Government's commitment and allowed it to expand and
strengthen its strategy at national and sub-national levels. It was not able to build effectively on the existing
NGO capacity to provide services among the high-risk groups though this capacity still exists and may well
be continuing with other sources of financing. And though perhaps not the most efficient operation, there is
evidence to suggest that it was on track in several regards and, in any case, filled a gap in the comprehensive
program that allowed other partners to focus on more efficient interventions.

INTRODUCTION

Burkina Faso is one of the hardest hit countries by HIV/AIDS in the West African sub-region south of the
Sahara, with a prevalence rate estimated at 7.17% in 1997. To help combat this epidemic, the Government of
Burkina Faso and the World Bank Group's International Development Association (IDA) signed a
Development Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement 3557-0-BUR) on September 6, 2001 and a supplemental
Grant Agreement associated with Development Credit Agreement 3557-0-BUR (Grant H 160-0-BUR) on
June 2, 2005 to achieve the goals of the National Multisector AIDS and STl Control Program Support Project
(PA-PMLS). This project marked the World Bank's will to assist the Government of Burkina Faso with the
implementation of the HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (CSLS) for 2001-2005.

II.     STRENGTHS, ACHIEVEMENTS, WEAKNESSES AND LESSONS OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA-PMLS

In addition to the abovementioned results, the implementation of the PA-PMLS enabled Burkina Faso to
develop HIV/AIDS and STI prevention and control capacities and capabilities. However, certain weaknesses
were found, which gave the players involved useful lessons for the future.

2.1. Strengths and achievements
    -   Existence of regional networks of associations to prevent and control STIs and AIDS (RALIS);
    -   Involvement of management staff from the ministries and institutions via their duties as chairs of the
        ministerial AIDS committees (CMLS);
    -   Capacity-building via training and the availability of documents on standards for the case
        management of PLHIV;
    -   Implementation of micro-projects in French and national languages;
    -   National expertise available;
    -   Building of the skills and technical capacities of the SP/CNLS-IST in monitoring and evaluation;
    -   Improvement in the indicators on the different focal points and sectors (see Annex I);
    -   Visibility of the SP/CNLS-IST and the other implementing and coordinating structures.

2.2. Weaknesses
    -   Running of most of the ministerial AIDS committees (CMLS) and their structures, which remains
        dependent on external financing;
    -   Mobility of the members of the ministerial AIDS committees (CMLS) and the local units (cellules
        relais) with implications in terms of the loss of institutional memory;
    -   Slow approval and allocation of funds, making it hard to implement annual planning and causing a
        break in the socioeconomic case management of infected and affected persons;
    -   Absence of formalized management procedures for the funds allocated to the local units (cellules
        relais) by the ministerial AIDS committees (CMLS);
    -   Too many associations working in the same geographical areas and fields with a resulting
        fragmentation of actions, which does nothing to facilitate supervision and monitoring-evaluation
        work;
    -   Absence of strategies for the target groups in all the country's regions, especially gold panners and
        commercial sex workers, to capitalize on the achievements given the mobility of these targets;
    -   Inaptitude of the structures to sustain the program and probable disappearance of the leadership from
        certain structures at the end of the project.

2.3. Lessons learned
    -   Set up a mechanism fostering associative action by the structures in a given place;
    -   Introduce mechanisms and/or arrangements for closing the financial year to prevent breaks by the
        budget estimate for the activities of the first quarter of year Y+1 in the Year Y allocation;

                                                        39

    -  Take up the option of a strategy for target groups at risk (gold panners and commercial sex workers)
       throughout all the country's regions;
    -  Include decentralized resource management mechanisms in the procedural manuals.

III. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT

The Coordinator manages and coordinates the project. He liaises with the Government and the World Bank.
He works with the implementing and coordination structures on one side and the other partners on the other.
In this regard, he informs the political authorities, the World Bank managers, and the other project
implementing players. The management of the PA-PMLS enjoyed:
    -  A good understanding between the IDA and the Government, with the effect that credit reallocations
       were accorded as they were needed;
    -  The sound involvement of the lead managers of the implementing units in the advisory structures set
       up.

3.1. Main World Bank decisions furthering the implementation of the project
    -  Renewal of all the Project Coordination Unit (UCP) and SP/CNLS-IST staff contracts financed by
       the Population and Aids Control Project (PACP) for the management of the PA-PMLS;
    -  Recruitment of managers for the ministries;
    -  Setting up of management tools and instruments (monitoring & evaluation system and accounting
       and financial management system);
    -  Acceptance of three Credit Agreement extensions (2003, 2005 and 2006);
    -  Acceptance of a Grant Agreement extension (2006);
    -  Acceptance of three amendments to the Credit Agreement resulting in reallocations of funds by
       category and two resulting in reallocations of funds by category for the Grant;
    -  Raising of the level of the special accounts for credit expenditure;
    -  Signing of a supplemental grant agreement in 2005 for a sum of five million US dollars (CFAF 2.5
       billion) in the form of an additional budget to complete the project's goals;
    -  Lifting of the budget limit, which fostered the 100%-financing of the ministerial AIDS committees'
       action plans.

3.2. Main World Bank decisions hindering the implementation of the project
    -  Frequent changes of contacts, mobility of monitoring staff at the World Bank, and a multitude of
       people working on the project (consultants recruited by the World Bank and specialized World Bank
       personnel);
    -  Slow responses to requests concerning procurement contract awards and financial management.

3.3. Main Government decisions furthering the implementation of the project
    -  Compliance with commitments made with the Bank (effective payment of the national counterpart
       funding, action taken with respect to the recommendations made by the Bank and the evaluation
       missions, etc.);
    -  Regular updating of the national public procurement regulations;
    -  Provision of personnel;
    -  Existence of texts regulating the operations and organization of the different central and
       decentralized structures (ministerial AIDS committees and local units).

3.4. Main Government decisions (or lack of decisions) hindering the implementation of the project
    -  No updating of the texts governing project management;
    -  Frequent changes to the staff working in the coordination and implementing structures;
    -  Changes to the senior managers in the ministerial departments, resulting in a high turnover of
       managers in the coordination and implementing structures.



                                                     40

To sum up, project management enjoyed a good quality of relations between the World Bank and the
Government. Similarly, the requests for documents for use for other purposes demonstrate the credibility
accorded the coordination activities and the positive performance of the different project players.

IV. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT

The project cost estimated at US$28.70 million (CFAF 19.05 billion) breaks down as follows:
    -   US$22 million (CFAF 15.4 billion) by the IDA, accounting for 80.84 percent of the project cost in
        the form of a credit initially in 2001;
    -   US$5 million (CFAF 2.5 billion) by the IDA, accounting for 13.12 percent of the project cost in the
        form of a grant in 2005;
    -   CFAF 910 million in 2001 and CFAF 100 million in 2005, totaling CFAF 1.01 billion, by the
        Burkina Faso State, accounting for 5.30 percent of the project cost in the form of a subsidy;
    -   CFAF 140 million by the communities, accounting for 0.73 percent of the project cost.

The above table presents the overall situation for the four sources of financing (Credit 3557, Grant H 160,
Government counterpart funding, and contribution from the beneficiary communities). The sharp drop
observed between the initial estimates and the adjusted estimates is due to a combination of the following
three factors:
    -   The underlying fall of the US dollar, which lost some 30% of its value over the course of the
        project's implementation, leading to substantial foreign exchange losses for the project (CFAF 4.242
        billion for the Credit and the Grant);
    -   The cancellation, when the adjusted estimates were made, of the beneficiary communities'
        contribution, initially estimated at CFAF 140,000,000;

4.3. Recurring costs generated by the project, with an impact on the State budget

The recurring costs concern the profitability and/or capitalization of the different actions taken:
    -   Running of the structures allocated resources by the PA/PMLS: vehicles, computers, audiovisual
        equipment, and operating supplies.
    -   Continuation of the socioeconomic case management of persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.

CONCLUSION

The implementation of the project enabled Burkina to make marked progress in controlling and preventing
HIV/AIDS and STIs. The project's contribution and the other players' contributions to combating HIV/AIDS
and STIs brought about:
    -   An improvement in prevention, especially in terms of the use of condoms wherein the proportion of
        users rose for both men and women;
    -   An improvement in the treatment of opportunist infections and a growing interest in screening
        among the population;
    -   An appreciable increase in the number of OVCs managed by community-based organizations;
    -   An upturn in the socioeconomic case management of people by the ministries and the families
        concerned;
    -   A keen interest in ARV therapy for persons infected by HIV/AIDS (850 people under the Project and
        7,908 under the Treatment Acceleration Program (TAP), representing a total of 8,758 for the World
        Bank out of a national grand total of 15,409 persons receiving ARV therapy at June 30, 2007);
    -   A reduction in the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in general, which fell from 7.17% in 1997 to 2% at the
        end of 2005.

In addition to these outcomes presented in the annexed table, which do not always reflect the reality due to a
lack of reliable statistics at certain levels, the PA/PMLS played an important role in the launch and scaling up
of initiatives to control and prevent HIV/AIDS (financing of player activities, implementation of micro-
projects, and various activities via targeted interventions). The experience and know-how gained by the
PA/PMLS benefited other players such as the projects in progress, financed by the AfDB and Belgium
Technical Cooperation (CTB).

The PA-PMLS made a substantial contribution to the implementation of the HIV/AIDS strategic plan
(CSLS), in which it was a definite catalyst.

Point A: Basic Information
    -   Revise the project name with Projet d'Appui au Programme National Multisectoriel de Lutte contre
        le SIDA et les IST (PA-PMLS) ;
    -   Information on the Grant H 160 of June 2, 2005, for an amount of SDR 3 400 000 or US$ 5 million
        equivalent is not included ;
    -   Revise the name of the implementing agency with Permanent Secretariat of the National
        HIV/AIDS/STI Council (SP/CNLS-IST).

Point B: Key Dates
    -   the effectiveness date for Credit 3577-0 is March 4, 2002 instead of April 3, 2002;
    -   the effectiveness date for Grant H 160-0 is November 29, 2005.

Point F: Result Framework Analysis
With regard to indicators for objectives a), b), c), d), f) and g), the original and end of project target values
are the same: June 30, 2007. The original dates revised and corrected as indicated in approval document
should be September 6, 2001 or June 2, 2005 which correspond respectively to the signing dates of the
Agreement for Credit 3557/BUR and its amendment by the Grant Agreement H 160.

                                    Review and Comments on the Report

Paragraph 1
    -   The first sentence of the first paragraph must be corrected as follows: at the time of project
        preparation, Burkina Faso was rated second after Côte d'Ivoire as the most affected country by
        HIV/AIDS in the sub-Saharan region...... the rest remains unchanged;


                                                       44

     -   On the data, the prevalence rate estimate for pregnant women of 2% in mid-80s must be revised as
         Burkina Faso declared its first cases of AIDS in 1986;
     -   Indicate the data sources for the prevalence rate for children born of sero-positive mother at the
         hospital of Banfora of Comoé;
     -   Replace hospital of Banfora of Comoé with "Regional Hospital Center of Banfora in Comoé
         Province".

Paragraph 3
     -   Under point 1: replace UNAIDS with WHO because UNAIDS was not created in 1986;
     -   Under point 3: instead of Demographic Health Survey, read Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).

Paragraph 32
The content needs to be eliminated or rewritten:
     -   under point 1: the disagreement was eventually resolved when the Government authorized the
         opening of the Project special accounts and the second-generation accounts in commercial banks or
         financial establishments;
     -   under point 2: on the institutional arrangements, the transfer before end 2004 did not involved the
         entire Project Management Unit (UGF) but only the two staff responsible for Project monitoring and
         evaluation in order to strengthen the SP/CNLS-IST capacity; the merger of the UGF and the
         SP/CNLS-IST in April 2005 was a Government initiative supported by the World Bank; this merger
         was not planned at the time of the negotiations.

Paragraph 33
The delay in credit effectiveness was not due to staffing recruitment for the SP/CNLS-IST but due to the
delay in obtaining the National Assembly authorization for Project ratification and from the constitutional
council for obtaining the legal opinion.

Paragraph 34, point 3
There was no institutional assessment of SP/CNLS-IST showing its weak capacity and the Program
inadequacy: this statement should be nuanced.

Paragraph 38
This is the first time that the notion of tension between the SP/CNLS ­IST and the PA-PMLS has been
mentioned. The source of information is not clear; more details should be provided concerning the existence
of these tensions.

It is not the SP/CNLS-IST who refused to carry out the Project mid-term review, but rather the then task
team leader who believed, on the basis of some terms of reference transmitted by the Project Coordination to
the World Bank, that the mid-term review was not required. This argument was based on the fact that the
mid-term review of the National Strategic Framework was planned for the same period. The Project has co-
financed the preparation of some studies for the national review in order to provide background reference for
the Project.

It is mentioned that the project has prepared studies of doubtful quality. The Project did not work in isolation
and all studies have followed the procedures, which require Bank approval. If this information must remain
in the report, examples should be given because the Project cannot realize studies on its own.

Paragraph 42
Confusion is noted in the footnote; the GAMET special team was directly financed by the World Bank to
support the establishment of a national monitoring and evaluation system for the strategic framework and not
the Project; the work that has been carried out only refers to the national level, the project indicators were
integrated into the national indicators.


                                                        45

Paragraph 45
The World Bank has always insisted on the fact that the monitoring and evaluation area should be managed
by the Monitoring and Evaluation Department of the SP/CNLS-IST; this is what justified the transfer of the
technical staff to the SP/CNLS-IST.

Paragraph 52
Instead of the revised strategic plan (2006-2010), the ICR should refer to the second strategic framework for
the fight against AIDS 2006-2010.

Paragraph 62
Explain the notion of "management practices of the PMU" or eliminate this point. The remark concerning
contracts with the same suppliers is not sufficient for referring to management practices (the coordination did
explain at that time the situation; it was relative to procurement of fuel where the same supplier total of
Burkina Faso is most often the lowest evaluated bidder). In addition, the detailed explanations that were to
appear in Annex 3 are not there.

Paragraph 64
     -   the statement relative to the activities of the ministries and in relation to perdiem are those of a
         World Bank representative during the first year of project implementation, which had been reported
         in a document without adequate financial analysis;
     -   It must be noted that 13 provinces are largely urban centers; the point in the first paragraph of page
         17 is not founded.

Paragraph 67
Kindly nuance the statements since decrees that create from the central to the village levels the committees
for the fight against AIDS exist. The texts that establish the structures exist and have been updated for the
creation of the CSLS 2006-2010.

Paragraph 68
The poor management practices are not sufficiently justified; strangely, everyone was in agreement with the
capacity strengthening of the ministries with financial management staff recruited under the Project. This
recruitment results from an evaluation of the capacity of the structures in procurement and financial
management and accounting under the advices of the World Bank.

Annex 10
The Project is a support project, which contributes up to 20% of the financing of the strategic framework for
the fight against AIDS and STI.

It is surprising and particularly inappropriate to attribute the level of achievement of the indicators
established for the national plan to such project or to one project. In fact, the achievement of the national
political objectives, whichever the areas or sector, cannot be attributed to one project as it can only contribute
to national level.

Consequently, the classification of the ratings for this Project must be revised for objectivity, equity and
common sense.


                                                                     Done in Ouagadougou, December 18, 2007
