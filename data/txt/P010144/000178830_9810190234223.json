          by modern electronic switching equipment; replacing openwire\n            lines by high quality radio systems; extending local\n            services; providing high capacity and stable transmission\n            network; and providing basic telecommunication to rural\n            areas currently poorly served. Major components of the\n            project are: (a) installation of about 17,000 lines of local\n            automatic switching equipment (including 8,000 lines for\n            replacement), associated cables and subscribers plant, and a\n            total of about 16,000 new telephone connections, and about\n            250 local call offices; (b) installation of three new trunk\n            automatic exchanges and expansion of eight existing trunk\n            automatic exchanges; (c) the upgrading of two existing\n            microwave systems, installation of five new microwave\n            systems, about 150 UHF/VHF systems of different sizes and\n            5,200 channel ends; and (d) about 500 long distance public\n            call offices in rural areas."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
