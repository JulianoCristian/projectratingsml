PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANMA
FIRST TKLECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 1020-CE)
PREFACZ
1.       This Project Completion Report (PCR) presents a review of the
Telecomiunications Project for which an IDA credit 1020-CE was provided for
US$30.0 million to the Government of Sri Lanka for telecommunications
developmnt undertaken by its Ports and Telecommunications Department (PTD)
which subsequently became the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Department
(SLTD).
2.       The PCR was prepared by SLTD and submitted to IDA and reviewed in
Sri Lanka in March 1988 by an IDA supervision mission. It provides a good
description of the origins, ac,  vements and problems in project
implementation. The quality of report is acceptable and is attached as
such. A few aspects noted or absent from SLTD's version have been
incorporated in the wHighlights* section of the report.
3.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower and the Executing Agency
for comments and the comments received have been annexed to the Report as an
Attachment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 1020-CZ) 
dIGHLIGHTS
The Projoct Completion Report was prepared by the So;rower's Sri
Lankan Telecommunication Department (SLTD) as agreed under the project
(DCA, Section 3.04), and initially submitted to IDA Ln 1987. The report
was reviewed in the field by an IDA mission in March 1988 and subsequently
amended. The revised report provides a good description of the project's
origins, execution, achievements and problems. It is of good quality and
acceptable. To comply fully with standard Bank requirements, the following
revisions have been made:
-    a basic data sheet has been prepared;
-    project cost tables have been revised (Attachment 1); and
-    IRR calculations have been revised (Attachment 2).
The main objective of the Bank support for this first
Telecommunication Project in Sri Lanka was to assibt the Government (GOSL)
and SLTD in overcoming the major constraints that impeded the development
of the sector: underinvestment, reliance on obsolete equipment and
institutional deficiencies. Substantial progress was made in the
development of the sector and institutional building.
The mai.. Project achievements are set out below:
(a) addition if about 38,700 subscribers;
(b) improvement in local and long distance facilities with the
increased digitalization of the network;
(c)  extension of the telecommunication service to rural areas
with the establishment of 110 PCOS and multi-access radio
system;
(d) improvement in organizational structure with the separation
of the Postal from Telecommunications services. This
development initiated under the project was followea Lp with
proposed legislation in 1988 to create an independent,
commercial telephone company;
(e) improvement of SLTD's financial performance with the ability
to substantially fund its investments from internal sources;
and,



- v 
(f) turning a net outflow of hard currency into a net inflow
($10.0 million equivalent in 19a7) under revenue sharing
agreemet,ts for international calls.
The Borrower's Performance
2.1      The overall performance of GOSL., the Borrower, and SLTD, the
beneficiary, has been quite satisfactory. Given that this was the first
Bank-financed project in the telecoinunivations sector, SL-D very quickly
adapted to the Bank procedures and procurement practices. The project
reporting was regular. There were, however, substantial delays in project
implementation, largely due to a late decision to move from analogue to
di&ital technology and consequently the need to redesign part of the
network. Digital technology has now become the world wide standerd for
telecommunications switching and the delay caused by the change to this
technology was well justified by the benefits in the form of lower
operating costs, flexibility, additional services and advantages related to
future expansion of the network. The conflict and unsettled conditions in
the Northern and Eastern Provinces also delayed project implementation by
disrupting the installation program in these areas. Governmetnt budgetary
constraints resulted in a local currency shortage for SLTD and impeded the
timely installation of some of the c.ble network for the Project.
2.2      Performance in the institutional areas has been exemplary.  The
Government moved quickly to establish a separate telecommunications
department (August 15, 1980) wll in advance of the covenanted date
(December 31, 1981). SLTD also established a Fundamental Planning Unit and
introduced commercial accounting practices from 1981 as agreed under the
project. The number of SLTD staff was brought down from 31,200 in 1981 to
8,600 in 1986, when the project was substantially completed, and the ratio
of staff to 1,000 telephones was brought down from 117 in 1981 to less than
70 in 1986, which is better than SAR projections.
2.3      As agreed (DCA Section 4.06), in 1981 SLTD introduced new
commercial accounting procedures, including revaluation of fixed assets.
These procedures consisted of some new accounts and ye&r end adjustments of
some SLTD cash accounts, which had to be maintained for GOSL budgetary
purposes. This whybrid' (commercial and cash) accounting system provided
adequate information on SLTD's commercial performance as well as serving
Government cash accounting purposes. To avoid the need co maintain two
complete accounting systems in public utilities required by Government to
maintain cash accounts, this hybrid system could also be considered under
other projects. Audited commercial accounts have been received up to 1986,
although later than covenanted (DCA, Section 4:07).
2.4      SLTD's financial performance was satisfactory during the whole
project period. The rate of return on ravalued assets in operation
increased from 182 in 1981 to 262 in 1986 -- well above SAR projections of
about 19% and the covenanted level of 152 (DCA, Section 4.09). Tariff
increases in 1983 and 1985, together with lower operating costs per
subscriber (para. 2.2) explain SLTD's good financial performance. At the



- vi-
end of the project period in FYs 86-87, SLTD generated over US$40.0 million
internally , which permitted GOSL to take more funds out than invested in
the sector.
2.5      In 1980, SLTD increased the collection rates for international
calls as agreed under the project (DCA, Section 4.03) and has, except for
traffic to India, maintained these rates above corresponding accounting
ratei thereafter.l/ This change in tariff policy has been highly
successful, and Sri Lanka now has more incoming than outgoiL; international
calls from all major countriet (except India). In moretary terms, this
means that a net outflow of hard currencies to pay for incoming
international calls in 1980 has been turned into a net har_  "rrency
surplus of ovez US$10.0 million in 1987, with a corresponding beneficial
effect on Sri Lanka's balance of payments.
IDA's Performance
3.1      IDA played a significant role in the development of the
telecommunications sector under this project by supporting sector
reorganization and institutional improvements, integrated nationwide
development of telecommunication facilities with modern digital technology
and extension of services to rurai areas through installation of multi-
access radio system. The supervision of the project by IDA missions was
very regular and helped Government and SLTD to focus on the priority needs
of the sector and the project and to overcome implementation problems.
Government's willingness to substantially restructure the sector can partly
be attributed to the Bank's efforts (IDA has continued its support for
further restructuring towards an independent, commercial telephone company
under a PPF (P-372-CE)). In retrospect IDA's performance under this
project has been constructive and flexible, and a continuing role for the
Bank is foreseen it: IDA supporting Government's efforts to restructure the
sector under the proposed Telecommunications Act of 1988.
Project Costs
4.1      In SLTD's draft PCR the estimated project costs appeared to be on
the high side, apparently due to inclusion of some non-project components.
As a result of a review carried out in Sri Lanka during March 1988, SLTD
submitted revised project cost estimates (Attachment 1) which have now been
incorporated in the text and analysis of the PCR.
Incremental Rate of Return (IRR)
5. 1     In SLTD's PCR, the IRR was estimated at 28Z.  This IRR was
recalculated with substantially different assumptions (Attachment 2) to
conform to normally accepted Bank standards. This recalculation resulted
in an IRR of 29Z, well above the appraised IRR of 172.
1/ In Annex 5 of the PCR, the main international rates are indicated. The
headings to the tables in this annex have been switched, however,
(accounting instead of collection and vice versa); the same error
occured in the SAR.

Conclusions
6.1      Substantial delays were caused by the need to adopt moderm digital
technology in the switching and transmissions systems and ethnic conflicts
in the North and Eastern areas; otherwise, the project was executed
reasonably well. The expansions of substantially integrated digital
facilities, local and long distance, improved the access to
telecoumnunication service both in urban and rural comunities. The
performance of the Borrower *nd the executing agency (SLTD) has been good.
6.2      The "hybrid" (commercial and cash) accounting system (para. 2.3)
proved useful and could also be used in other Bank projects for public
entities that are required by law to maintain cash accounts. The revision
of collection rates for international calls led to sharply increased
foreign exchange earnings; such revision should be made standard for
telecommunications projects.
6.3      The results in the area of institution building have been very
positive. The creation of a separate Departmex.t of Telecomwunications, the
introduction cf commercial accounting and the current effort to create a
new regulatory framework and an independent, commercial operating entity
under the proFzsed Telecommunication Act are very encouraging. Continued
IDA support for restructuring of the sector and a possible leading role in
cofinancing would help considerably to consolidate the institutional
improvements achieved under this Project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Rate of Return on SLTD's 1981-86 Investment Program
1.       These IRR calculations were made on the same assumptions as the
ones stated in Annex 6 of SLTD's PCR, with the following exceptions:
(a)   part of 1986 capital expenditures have been excluder as they
belong to subsequent investment programs;
(b)   price and wage increases for material and labour required
for the operation of pre 1982 installations have been
excluded from incremental operating costs;
(c)   additional revenues from pre 1982 installations due to
tariff increases have been excluded; and
(d)   cash flows have been inflated by the CPI up to 1988 (rather
than the revaluation index used in SLTD's PCR).

SRI LANKA
FIRST TLELCOS MICATIONS PROJECT
(CUDIT 1020-Cl)
I.  INTRODLICTION
1.01  Telecommunication Services in Sri  Lanka are a Governmnt
monopoly provided by the Sri Lanka Telecommunications
Department functioning under the aegis of the Ministry of
Posts & Telecommunications.   A seperate Departmont known
as the  Department of Posts provides  Postal Services but
Post  Offices  are  utilised  by  the  Telecommunications
Department for the bulk of the work in handling telegraph
services.   Overall telecommunications  sector policy  is
determined by the Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications
through which the Government Treasury allocates the funds
r-equired  by the  Telecommunication  Department both  for
capital investment  as well as the  recurrent costs.  The
revenue c4erived from its  services is channelled directly
into the Consolidated Ftind of the Treasury. The Director
of   Telecommunications   heads  the   Telecommunications
Department   with  one   Deputy  handliing   international
telecommunications and 4 other Deputies handling the work
of the domestic network.
1.92  Recognition has been given by  the World Bank to the fact
that  Telecommunication services  in  the  Island form  a
vital part  of the infrastructure necessary  for economic
development and this has resulted in an appraisal of the
Telecommunication sector by the World Bank Staff in April
198C. On the basis of this appraisal and the associated
discussions  with  the  Government, the  Bank  agreed  to
provide a loan of US.$ 30 Million for improvements to the
domestic telecommunication network.   This loan whic h was
guaranteed by tthe Government in the normal manner was
scheduled  to  close  on  30th June  1985.   The  project
envisaged to be implemented with this loan is the subject
of this report.
1.03  Particulars of telephone gr owth  (Appraisal vs Actual) is
given in Annex 1. The broad indications are that the
targets expected  were reached after about  one year form
the expected date.
II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND COVENANTS
2.01  Prep4ration, Appraisal and Negotiations
As mentioned  earlier the appraisal of  the project under
consideration  was  carried out  in  April  1980 and  was
followed by negotiations which ultimately resulted in
approval of the loar. by the Executive Directors of the
Bank.  The Loan Agreement was signed on June 24, 1980 and
became 'effective on September 24, 1980.

2. C2  Project Ob.lectives
Th? broad objectives  of the project were  to improve the
quality of ser5vice to existing subscribers, provide
increased access to service in areas currently served and
extend  communications to  the more important rural areas
now unserved. The specific project objectives were:
(a)  To  develop  the   internal  network  by  installing
switching equipment to replace some equipment which
had served their ec:oiomic life.
(b)  To  provide additional  subscriber  cable  pairs  to
match the switching equipment, and,
(c)  To   providep  tih,   t.r uni  and   iL rnction  equipment
necessary  including  cables   for-  a  balanced  and
i ntegrated devel opmerrt.
It was accepted that the above measures would go a long
way towards  meeting the existing unsatisfied  demand for
Telecommunication Services in the relcevant parts of the
country.
2.03  Project Description
(a)  Installation of about 9,300°) lines of local autoMatic
exchange  equipment  in 68  excharnges  about  41,600
pair-kilometres of telephone cables, and associated
subscriber  plant  for  connection of  about  16,200
lines and 250 local public call offices;
(b)  Replacement of  7,900 lines of  antiquated, worn--out
local  switching  equipment  in 268  exchanges  (144
manual exchanges and 46 rur-al automat c exchanges to
be absorbed  by other exchanges and  78 eXchanges to
be  replaced)  and  about  31,400  pair--km.  of  old
cables.
(c)  Installation of three  riew trunk automatic exchanges
with  about  65C.0  terminations,  and  expansion  of
existing  eight trunk  automatic exchanges  by about
65E) terminations;
(d)  Installation  of   automatic  number  identification
equipment (ANI) in all  existing local exchanges and
automatic message accounting equipment (AMA) in four
tertiary trunk automatic  exchanges for intr oduction
of toll-ticketing and installation of bill processor;
(e)  Upgrading of  two mict'owave routes  and installation
of five new microwave systems, about 150 UHF/VHF
systems and associated multiplex equipment for about
5,250 channel ends



-3-
(f)  Installation of about 500 long distance call offices
for extension of service to rural population centres
with post offices, but currently without telephone
service: and
(g)  Civil  works and  other facilities  for implementing
the project.
2.04  Project Cost  Estimate
The total cost of the project was estimated at SL Rs.
566.4 Million (UJ.S.* 36.3 Million) with foreign cost of
U .S.$ 30 Msil1lio-n) as indicated.

Association, among others, to study the long-term (10 to
20  years)   development  needs   of  the   public  tele-
communications  sector   in  Sri  Lanka,   establish  the
objectives and priorities in that sector, and determine
the means and plans most suitable for the achievement of
said  objectives   and  priorities.   A  unit   has  bee.
established to meet this requirement.
Section 4X)6 -
The ourrower shall Lause FTDa
(a) by January 1, 1981, to commence implementation of
accounting    practices    satisfactory    to    the
Association; and
(b) beginning with its fiscal year 1981, to maintain
records, including financial statements, adequate to
reflect  the  financial   performance  of its  tele-
communications operations in accordance with such
accounting practices.
The requirements of both (a) and (b) have been met.
Section 4.07
The Borrower shall cause PTD to:
(i)   have its accounts and financial statements (balance
sheets, statements  of   income  and  expenses  and
related  statements   for  its   telecommunications
operations) for   each  fiscal  year   audited,  in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles
consistently applied, by auditors acceptable to the
Associationg
(ii) (A) furnish to the Association as soon as available
but in any  case not later than  eight months after
the end of each such year copies of its financ4el
statements for its telecommunications operations
for such year; and



(B)  furnish   to  the   Association  as   soon  as

audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such
detail as the Association shall have reabionably
requested; and
(iii) furnish to the Association such other information
concerning the accounts and financial statements of
PtD and the audit thereof as the Association shall
from time to time rea,onably request.
Audited accounts upto 1985 have been forwarded to
the World Bank; unaudited accounts for 1986 are
also with the Bank and steps are being taken to
have them audited early while accounts are being
finalised for 1987.
Section 4.08
For the   purpose  of  calculating   the  rate  of return
specified in Section 4.09 of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall cause PTDs

classification of its fixed telecommunication assets
and propose to the Association a method for their
valuation or revaluation to be carried out at all
times in accordance with consistently maintained
procedures  satisfactory  to  the   Association. The
method of re-valuation of fixed assets had been
agreed with the World Bank Mission and steps are
being taken to complete inventory and classifiction
of fixed assets; the extent and complexity of the
task as well as the current conditions in Sri Lanka
have  resulted  in  a   delay  in  implementing  the
inventorisation
(b)  commencing  with  fisca-  year begining  January  1,
1981, to calculate said rate of return on the basis
of   the   average   value    of   its   net   fixed
telecommunication assets in operation as determined
each  year   in  accordance  with  the   methods  of
valuation and revaluation referred to in paragraph
(a) above- For the purpose of this Section, the
term "value of PTD's net fixed telecommunication
assets in operation" has the meaning assigned to it
in Section 4.09 (c) (ii) of this Agreement.

(including adjustment to the structure and
level of its tariffs) as shall be required to
realize an annual rate of return of not less
than fifteen per cent (15%) in each of its
fiscal years 1980-1984 on the average value of
its  net  fixed   telecommunication  assets  in
operation.   The Borrower  shall  cause PTD  to
determine by June 30, 1984 a rate of return
satisfactory to the Association, to be realized
for the period after December 31, 1984.
(b)  Before June  30 each year, the  Borrower shall cause
PTD on the basis of realistic f-recasts, to review
thm adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirements
set forth in paragraph (a) above for the next
following fiscal years, and shall furnish to the
Association  a   copy  of   such  review   upon  its
completion.
(c)  For the purposes of thic Sections
(i) the term "net operating income" means gross

III - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.t:)1 Credit Effectiveness and Project Start Up
The Credit Agreement specified  Seitember 10, 1980 as the
initial date of Credit Effectiveness with no special
conditions.   Although  the  intention  was  to  commence
procurement immediately after the start of the project
the  process of  procurement suffered  some delay  due to
technical considerations, in  particular, the decisio,i to
go  in   for  digital  technology  instead   of  analogue
equipment originally envisaged. Another factor which led
to some delays in procurement was the divergent sources
that were involved.
0.n2  Procurement
Althoucjh  the  intention  was  to  commence   procurement
immediately after  the commencement, there was  a certain
amount of  ur-avoidable delay due main7ly  to the technical
considerations.  These  arose mainly  as a result  of the
decision to go in for digital tethnology instead of the
analoque equipment originally envisaged. Moreover due to
th-e somewhat wide geographical dispersion of the areas to
be cover-ed by the project, on the spot appraisals became
necessary. However-, these problems were overcome during
the course of time.
.0:,.( The other aspect affecting procurement was the fact that
th7e local funding which was accepted on a year by year
basis  from  the  Sri  Lanka Treasury  was  found  to  be
inadequate to meet the supplementary local expenditure.
In addition there was also the fact that throughout the
duration   of  the   project  tthere   was  a   continuing
depreciation of the Sri Larka.
3.0.4 Project Revision
Technically a  major revision in  the project arose  is a
result  of supplanting  analogue  equipment   by  digital
equipment.   This  resulted  in   a  certain  measure  of
-e-lesign particularly of the  microwave radio systems and
in some instances it was necessary even to change the
routing  of the  radio path.   Pulse code  modulation was
also  extensively  used  in  the  provision  of  junction
circuits while the number of multiaccess systems a,so had
to be increased.
The above  revisions were  necessitated by the  fact that
the time  appraisal was  one of transitiou;  in technology
from analogue to digital.   However, although the changes
resulted   in  a   certain   amount  of   delay  in   the
implementation of the poject and an increase in project
costs they also provided a rapid transformation in the
island's telecommunications system from one of analogue
technology to digital technology.



9-
Implementation
_____ ________
3.05  At appraisal the project  was sch-dul-d for completion by
31.12.1984. Several forces contributed towards the delay
in implementation.   One of  the initial reasons  was the
necessity to do a considerable amount of re-thinking on
the *change over from analogue to digital systems of
transmi-sion based on rapidly changing trends in the
technology. The project covered in a geographical sense
several areas which would be considered as rural and
practically all these were a considerable distance away
from tolombo and apbrt from each other by long distances.
As a matter of fact the Nothern most area Jaffna which
was included in the project  has up to date not benefited
from the project since it has not been possible becauue
of terrorist activity to install the equipment which has
been transported there.   Another factor that contributed
towards the delay was that although the bank had agreed
to loan U.S * 30 million, loc-al funds were not provided
by the Government as scheduled due to constraints in the
National Budget as a tesult of the ethnic problems in the
country. Hence some of the -equired equipment such as
generators air-conditioning and even the PCM equipment
had   to  be   pr3cured   from   the  subsequent   annual
allocations.   This  led  to   a  situation  where  items
procured under the bank credit could be installed, but
not commissioned and utitised meaningfully until the
balance inputs wore fourtd and installed.
3.06  The Major part of the  project was completed by December,
1986 w*'cept for two or three areas that were commissioned
in  2987.  Howevor,  the  situation in  the Northern  anf-i
Eastern parts' of the Island has not permitted thb,
implementation of the.Projec.t in the Jaffna & Trincom'rnAle
areas.  In Jaffna 2,00. lines of switching equipment hA'

1.11     Actual total costs up to 31.12.86 increased by almost 58Z.  The main
reasons for the cost variations are explained below:
(a) General. The scope of the project as envisaged earlier was expanded
considerably in order to eliminate as many imbalances in the network
as possible in each of the individual areas taken up under the
project.   This required modificatio .s of the extent and capabilities
of local network and the routing of trunk circuits. These
modifications coupled with heavy local reinstatement costs and the
variations in exchange rates between the US Dollar, the Japanese Yen
and the Sri Lanka3 Rupee gave rise to an unanticipated increase.
(b)  Local Costs.  Apart from the design modification, local costs also
increased about 154Z (in equivalent US$) due to inflation and payment
of custom duty and turnover tax.



- 11 -
(c) Forelgn Costs. The increase in foreign costs of about 361 resulted
from the expanded scope of the work and the devaluation of the Sri
Lankan Rupee relative to both US Dollar and the Japanese Yen.

3.11   The   rate  of    disbursement    was  not    unsatisfactory
considering the aforementioned impediments that were
encountered after the initiation of the project. Although
tthe nrojrect  was expected  to be  implemented by  30 June
1984, in actual  fact there was a timte  over-run of about
2-1/2  yFiar s,   buit  it  was  possible   tO  eISisure  that

IV - Operating Performance
4.01  At  the  time  of 'appraisal  the SLTD  had  drawn  Ltp  a
development programme for  Telecommunications  containing
on-going works from the previous period and other works
to be  executed during  the programme  period as  well as
plans  for investment  tu be  undertaken at a  subsequer-nt
stage, in addition to the dievelopment proposed under the
IDA project. While the on-going works carried over were
completed,  all other  aspects proposed  suffer-ed serious
setbacks dcue to the scarcity of foreign and local
funding. Under the F4ank project, some 17,200) lines of
local automatic  exchange equiprrent were to  be installed
by December  31, 1986 and approximately  13,600 lines had



- 14 -
been  completed.   Of  the   73,000  pair  kilometers  of
telephone   Lables  and   associated  subscribers   plant
envisaged,  abouIt  71,000   pair  ki lometres   comprising
appro-timately 95% of work had  been done.  It is expected
that  the   balance  of  switchirg  equ.ipment   would  be
completed and commissioned by the enci of 1987.
4.02  As regards  the three new Trunk  Automatic- Exchanges with
about  650  terminations proposed,  the   work  has  been
completed  with 750  terminations  while  the existing  8
trunk automatic exchanges tave been expanded by about 780
terminations as agairnst. the expected 650.
4.03  Number  identification equipmcnt  has been  installed and
tested and partialy commissioned.  The commissioning will
be completed when the  processor capacity of the existing
tertiary centres is augmented.
4.04  In respect  of the 150 UHF/VHF  systems and the multiplex
equipment  for  about 5250  channel  ends  for the  radio
systems, the  designated parameters hadi been  changed and
about 60 UHF systems  commi ssi oned with some 2600 channel
ends.
4.05  One aspect in which the implementation +ell far short was
the installation of about  500 long distance call offices
for rural  population  centres. Only  about 110 of  these
have been installed.
4.06  At  the  time  of  appraisal, the  number  of  applicants
awaiting  service in  the Island  were about  40,000 with
about 20,000  of these beiing  in Colombo and  the balance
being in the rest of  the Island.The lor-ng waiting time is
mairnly attributable  to lach  of traff:iccable  capacity in
the networ-k  to accept new subscribers.   Si1nce such long
periods of waiting would reflect on the accuracy of these
numbers,  in 1985  the  SltTD decided  to  call for  fresh
registrations with a registration fee of 9L Rs.2505/- from
all those who had been registered  up to that time.  As a
result  of  this  e++ort,  tte  number  of  registrations
reduced  drastically  to  some   23, 000.   Pr- i or  to  the
app' ication  of  a  regi-stration   fee  about  9,0)Cio  new
applications  were registered  annually  and the  average



- 15 -
waiting period around 31st December 1986 was about two
years. The present indications are that the number of
new applicants would continue to increase every year at a
rate of approximately double the number of the previous
year. During the period of implementation of the Project
the number of new connections provided was approximately
6,000  per year.   Without  taking into  account'any  new
connections the demand i.e. existing subscribers (95,C00)
plus  those waiting  for  service (75,000)  for the  next
three years is  estimr,ated at around 170,000  about 60% of
which would  be in Colombo Metropilitan  area.  The major
difficulty in expanding the services continues to be lack
of funds allocated by the Treasury and hence the access
to service  continues to  be poor.   As at  31st December
1986, the average telephone penetration was about 6 DEL
and e telephone stations per thousarnd of population.
4.07  Deficiencies in the Telecommunications network identified
at the tirr.e of &ppraisal have been remedied to a certain
extent by the implementation of the Project.  The project
also facilitated a major change from analogue to digital
technology  and provided  subscriber  direct dialling  to
many areas.   This in turn  has stimulated the  growth of
telephone traffic  and incidentally resulted in increased
pressure on the system.
The multi access systems installed under the Froject have
facilitated provisiion of service to remote subscribers,
thus improving  the quality of service  but the increased
number   of  subscribers   has  occasionally   introduced
congestion into the system.

V - FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Intrgductigon
5.01  The  Financial  Performance   of  the  Telecommunications
Department,  throughout  the  project  period,  was  more
satisfactory than was forecast at the appraisal stage, as
will be seen from the graphical illastration Annex 6 and
7 and para.5.O8 to 5.10 below.
Account inas
5.02  The   accounts  o'   the  Sri   Lanka  Telecommunications
Department (SLTD) are maintained on a Cash Basis. In
addition, Year-end adjustments are made to these accounts
in  order  to  produce  commercially  oriented  financial
statements.  The  accounts of SLTD are  kept manually but
some computerisation is expected to take place within
about a year including the possible use of P.Cs.
5.03  During   negotiations,   assurances   were   given   that
commencing   January  1,   1981   SLTD  would   introduce
satisfactory accounting routines and  that these would be
reflected on financial statements for the fiscal year
1981  onwards.   This  has   been  achieved  and  audited
commercial accounts for 1981 and 1982 have already been
forwarded to the Bank. Provisional commercial accounts
for 1983 through 1985 were prepared for internal purposes
by the SLTD staff and these were forwarded to the world
Bank in June 1986. Commercial accounts for 1986 are also
being prepared by  the SLTD staff and are  expected to be
forwarded to the World Bank shortly.
5.04  As a Government department,  SITD's accounts  are by  law
audited by the Auditor-General and his staff.In addition,
SLTD has its own internal audit unit.
5.()5 During negotiations, assurances were given that SLTD
would provide thze Association with financial statements
within eight months of the end of each fiscal year and
the corresponding audit report about two months later.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to achieve these
deadlines.
5.06  M/s  Kulatunqa  and Company  (who  ar-e  a firm  of  local
Chartered Accountants) were engaged by SLTD to prepare
the accounts of SLTD for the calendar years 1981 to 1984
inclusive  on  commercially   accepted  principles.   The
accounts for 1981 and 1982 were prepared and submitted to
the Auditor-General for audit and copies were forwarded



--17 -
to the World Bank. Ever, before the Auditor-General had
completed his audit of the 1981 and 1962 accounts,
Messrs. kulatunga & Co., prepared provisional accounts
for 1983 and 1984 and these too were sent to the World
Bank.   The Auditor-General's  Report of  21st July  1986
mentions a number of adjustments which require to be made
in the 1981 and 1982 accounts and similar adjustments
will also need to be made in the provisional accounts
prepared for 198:3 and 19B4.
5.07  M/s.    KLulatL.nga  and   Company  attended   meetings  on
25.05.87, 28.0:5.87 and 24.06.87 irn the Chief Accountant's
Office in SLTD and completed adjustment of the 1981 and
1982 commercial accounts by 30.06.1987 and estimated that
they would be in a position to prepare the Final Accounts
for 1983 and 1984 by 30.11.1987.
5.08  Income   Statements,  Balance   Sheets  and   Funds  Flow
Statements oh a commercial basis for the calendar years
1981 to 1984 ate presented .n Annex. 2 and comments on
the  Financial   Statements  are  given   in  Annex.3.The
Financial    Performance   of    the   Telecommunications
Department was better than had been forecast, at the
appraisal stage, and this was partly due to slightly
higher Operating Revenue than forecast and partly due to
lower Operating Expenses apparently resulting from the
reductior, of man power and other resour-ces.
5.09  Summarised  performance  details  are given in Table 5.1.
The Actual Rate of Return was better than forecast,
particularly for 1983 and 1984. The Operating Revenue
per  DEL  was higher  than  forecast  from 1983  onwards.
Lastly, the Operating Ratio was better than forecast for
the years 1981 and 1982 and significantly better for the
years 1983 and 1984.
5.10  sash Flow remained satisfactory  over the project period.
Net  Internal   Cash  Generation,  as  a   precentage  of
construction requirements (which is also referred to as
contribution to expansion) was better than forecast. In
addition, the Actutal Debt Service Coverage was also more
satisfactory than had been forecast at the appraisal
stage.

5.11  The Staff Appraisl Report of 18th April 1980 gave details
of SLTD's dome3tic telecommunications tariffs which came
inito force on 1st March 1980.  Subsequently, tariffs were
altered in December- 198C0, Dec:ember 1983 and December
1985.  A summary of  the principal tariffs effective from
1st December 1983 and 1st December 1985 are given in
Annex.5 and 5.A respectively.
5.12  Local calls through some old exchanges are charged for on
an untimed basis but lo-al calls from newer exchanges are
cthar-ged f .wr  on a timed  basis.  All long  distance calls
are charged for on a timed basis. Long distance calls
are priced higher during prime business hours than during
nights and early morning.
5.13  Rental charges  for business and commercial  entities are
higher than rentals for private and non commercial
subscribers and for religious institutions.
5.14  Due to  high traffic  congestion and long  waiting times,
subscribers in areas with STD facilities often require
operator assistance to connect their long distance calls.
Such "operator connected STD calls" have a surcharge of
Rs.1.00 per call, as compared with the rate for normal
STD calls. Unlike STD calls, full three minute periods
are charged tor even if cnly a fraction is used.
5.15  As  regar-ds  SLTD's   international  tariffs,  the  Staff
Appraisal Report of 18th April 1980 mentioned (in 3.09)
that   Collection   Rates   were    substantially   below
international  Accouriting Rates  and  that  this was  the
reason for the high outgoing international traffic as
compared  with  incoming   traffic.   Since  March  1960,
Collection Rates have been increased -substantially and,
at the present time there is an excess of inconming
traffic over outgoing traffic on all major routes excbpt
India.   It is  believed  that the  principal reason  why
incoming traffic from India is lower than outgoing
traffic is because STD facilities in the direction India-
Sri Lanka was not available from India until August this
year.
5.16  The  Accounting Rate  shown for  each country  is shared,
between Sri Lanka and the country concerned, usually on a
50/50 basis and this matter needs to be borne in mind
when comparing Accounting Rates with Collection Rates.
In order words, while a particular Collection Rate
represents the amount collected for an outgoing call only
50% of the corresponding Accountinig Rate would be paid to
the relevant foreign administration.



- 20 -
5.17  Accounting  Rates  are  fixed  in  agreement  with  other
Administrations and the trend is towards lower Accounting
Rates,  because   of  the   lowering  of  costs   due  to
technological advances. There would be no advantage in
Sri Lanka pressing for lower Accounting Rates because
tt?re is an excess of incoming traffic over outgoing
traffic. As regards Collection Rates, howevwr, these are
kept under review and are amended from time to time. It
is proposed to introduce reduced tariff off peak hours to
harniess the available idling capacity.
5.18  Tele..;ommunication  tariffs   are  designed   to  generate
adequate funds to meet the goals of efficiency and
equity. The tariff revisions in December 1980, December
1983 and December 1985 were made in conjunction with the
Tariff   Committee    of   SLTD.   When    the   National
Telecommunications Commission is established,Tariffs will
be reviewed in consultation with the Commission.
Accounts Receivable
5.19  SLTD's billing  for the Greater-  Colombo Area is  done by
the EDP Department which receives the input from the
Billing Centres in the Colombo Metropolitan Areas. In
addition,  the  billing   for  three  outstation  Billing
Centres  has   rece-tly  been  transferred  to   the  EDP
Department and, once this work is running satisfactorily,
consideration will be given to computerising the billing
for  other  outstations.   At  present,  billing  for  25
outstations is done manually by the respective billing
centres situated in the regional telecommunication areas.
A uhification of the procedures has been achieved for
billing in Colombo and in the outstations.
5.20  Rental is billed annually in advance and call charges are
billed monthly.   Once the difficulties  experienced with
the transfer to computer billing have been resolved, it
is expected that computer bills will be despatched by the
end of the month following the month to which they refer.
It is expected that this will be achieved before the end
of December,1987.   Bills in  respect of  25 outstations,
billed manually are despatched within three weeks after
the end of the month to which the bills relate, which is
considered satisfactory.

5.21  At  present  the  procedures  for  enforcing  payment  of
arrears are operating fully In the manually billed
exchanges and partially in resp.ct of others due to the
arrears in computer billing. However, it is hoped that
these arrears will be brought up-to-date by the end of
Dec,1987. If arrears exceed an upper limit stipulated by
the Department, subscribers will be debarred from call
originating facilities. If arrears go back beyond four
months, a subscriber will be disconnected. Subscribers
who make a guaranteed deposit are not disconnected until
the total amount due exceeds their deposits.
5.22  The  same general  principles  for  enforcing payment  of
arrears apply to Government subscribers except for the
Armed For-ces, Police and Hospitals. Negotiations are
being  carried  out  to  improve the  procedure  of  debt
collection from Government Departments.
5.23  At the time of preparation  oa  the Staff Appraisal Report
in April, 1990, accounts receivable had to be estimated.
However, at the present time it is possible to know the
exact amount of accounts receivable.
24  Where  fre.  service is  provided  (e.g.  for Members  of
Parliament,  for  staff  of   the  SLTD  and  the  Postal
Department)  the value  of such  services is  included in
billings and in operating expenses. This free service is
not extended for international calls.
VI - INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
h)ranisation and Man&-emont
1  One   of   the   assurances    obtained   during   credit
negotitation for the Project was that the Government will
create by Deceomber 31,1981 a separate Telecommunication
Department instead of continuing to function under the
aegis of the Department of Posts & Telecommunications.
This measure had been a long-felt need for the adequate
development of the telecommunications system and happily
was achieved during the project peroid. On 15th Aug. 1980
the telecommunication entity broke away from the Postal
administration and started to function as a separate
Department although it continued to work under the
umbrella of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.



- 22 -
The planning unit envisaged in the appraisal was set up
with a Deputy Director as its Head who also had the
function  of   Electronic  Date  Proce-sing.    This  i-,
perhap-,not a happy grouping which would need to be
rectified at a later stage. During the project period
several changes were necessitated at senior levels due to
attrition   and  this   also  had   its  impact   on  the
implementation of the project. Towards the last phases
of implementation of the project the Government of Sri
Lanka also made a tentative policy decision to privati-e
the Telecommunication sector and adequate measur-s have
been taken by the setting up of a "Shadow" Board which
has made fair progress up to now. It is expected that
the privatisation concept would be a reality by 1988.
The organisational structure of the proposed compar-i is
currently under consideration and would be based on the
need to permit the proposed company to function as a
viable commercial concern unfettered by governmental
requlations.    It   is   envisaged   that   a   National
Telecommunications Commission would alsc be establisheo
concurrently   in  order   to   minimally  regulate   the
activities of the company and provide the neess-ary
balance between the requirements of the company, the
Government, telecommunication subscribers and the general
public.   It is  expected  that the  company  once it  is
formed would be provided with a certain measure of World
Bank credit on a Project for development of telecommuni-
cations for which this Project Completion Report would
serve as a basis.
The current Organisation Chart of the Telecommunications
Department is given in Annexe.7. The separation of the
Telecommunication sector from the Postal department has
made it possible to develop the telecommunications system
in the country to an extent that it has not been possible
before.   It is  now  evident  that a  Telecommunications
Department which can be operated independently could
indeed be not only profitable but also provide the
necessary infrastructure development for the growth of
the economy.
-4ff Recruitment and Training
"2 The number of staff associated with telecommunication as
at April, 1980 was 10,405 which worked out to an average
of about 130 personnel per 1,000 telephones. The number
of employees as at the end of 1986 had been brought down
to 9,856 indicating that there has been a substantial
reduction during the project period. The average number
per 1,000 telephones on this basis is about 94.



- 23 -
6.03  During the project period  the exodus of senior personnel
continued practically unabated and this naturally had it-
impact on the availability of staff to man the senior
posts in the newly formed Departmentl the international
market for telecommunication engineers, perhaps, drew
away people whose experience and training would have been
immensely useful. This in turn had some adverse effects
on the implementation of the project.
6.04  The  period   in  question   has  happily  seen   a  vast
improvement achieved in the field of training of staff.
The planning that had gone into this aspect has now
manifested itself in the establishment of a substantial
Central Telecommunic tion Training Centre about 8 miles
North of Colombo e;clusively for training in internal
plant practice.   The earlier Training Centre,  which had
been establisned with UNDP/ITU assistance,is at Moratuwa,
about 12 miles South of Colombo, and is providing
training in external plant. The new Central Training
Centre has residential accommodation up to about 150
trainees   at   any   time   and   includes   residential
accommodation for some of the senior staff as well. A
former   senior   telecommunication  engineer   eminently
suitable for the task is in charge of the Training
Programmes and is being remuneratLd by the UNDP/ITU. The
new  Trai'ing  Centre  is  being equipped  and  hat  also
received turther  assistance from the  ITU by way  of the
servicms of a manpower planning expert. The Training
Centre at Moratuwa continues to function mainly for
training in external plant work while two other Regional
Training Centros have also been established at Kandy and
Salle for the same purpose.
VII - PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
_____________________
C^X  The   Physical   Installation  Targets   projected   were
generally achieved albeit with some delay except for a
small   number  of   exchanges  which   remained  to   be
commiseioned at  the end of 1996.   A substantial portion
of the network has now been digitalized and in particular
there has been a considerable improvement of telephone
services  in  rural   areas,  particularly  those   which



-24-
have  been  included  n  the  project.   Had the  funding
expec:ted from the Treasury materialised the scope of the
project would  have had  far reaching  effects by  way of
a-cess to service as well as quality of service. The
figures of revenue countrywise r-eflect a heavy increa-e
it, the use of telecommunication  services and there is no
doubt  that  the project.  has  been  more than  partially
responsible   for    this   situation.         An   important
contribution towards project achievement could also be
expected from the new traininrg facilities available and
the  training programmes  envisaged.   Since the  project
covered mnriy  rural areas  which have long  suffered from
Jack  of coniir,u.-ication  for economic  advancement, it  is
reasonable to conclude that, apart from increases in
revenue, a substantial contribution has been made towards
the econimic upliftment of these rural areas.
7.02  Project Spin-off
Frior to the project period the only telecommunication
materials  manufactured  in   Sri  Lanka  were  procelain
insulators,   overhead  fixtures,   concrete  posts   and
concrete/cement ducts,  the latter for use  in the laying
of underground  cables.  During the period  PVC ducts for
laying of cables were also introduced in the SLTD and the
smaller  sizes  of  FVC   covered  cable  is  also  being
manufactured in  Sri Lanka.   For some  tima to  come, it
will probably be  unlikely that the country  can create a
sufficiently large  market for-  the local  manufacture of
more  sophisticated   items  in   the  telecommunications
sector.
Rate of Return
7.03  The  Internal  Rate of  Return  (IRR)  for the  1981-1986
investment  programme is  estimated at  28.03% using  the
basis  outlined in  Annex.6.   This  rate represents  the
return for the project and compares favourably with the
estimated  IRR  at the  appraisal  stage  of 16.6%.   The
Economic  Rate  of  Return  (ERR)  canriot  be  dccurately
calculated due to insufficiency of data, but is estimated
to be in excess of 40%. The ERR is substantially higher
than the IRR because:
(i)    In calculating the IRR,  rio increase in revenue
has been considered after- 1986, in respect of
the 1981 - 1986 investment programme, whereas
the ERR would include the increase in revenue.



- 25 -
(ii)   Some  of  the  equipment  installed  under  the
project  has  spare  capacity  and  can  handle
higher   traffic   with  a   small   additianal
investment. However, when calculating the IRR
the increase in revenue due to the higher
traffic has not been taken into account whereas
when   calculating  the   ERR  this   would  be
inrcluded.
(iii) When calculating the IRR no estimate has been
made of the indirect external benefits to other
sectors (such as transport, agriculture, public
service  etc.,   from  improved   and  expanded
telecommunication   services),   whereas   when
calculating the ERR such benefits would be
included.
(iv)   When calculating the IRR no attempt was made to
estimate   the  consumer   surplus  (which   is
undoubtedly large given tne high unsatisfied
demand for telecommunication services) whereas
the consumer surplus would be included when
calculating the ERR.

Annex 3 P. 1
(see also 5.09 to 5.11)
SRI LANKA TELECOMMUNICArTIONS DEPARTEIlENT
NOTES ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introductio,n
1.    Forecasts  were prepared  for  1980 to  1984  inclusive but
Commercial Accounts were prepared by Messrs Kulatunga & Co. for
1981 to 1984. Accordingly, it is possible to compare actual and
forecast  results for  1981  to  1984 only.   The  1981 and  1982
accounts have been amended,  where necessary, by Messrs Kulatunga
t Co., in the light of the Auditor-General's Report of 21st July,
1986.  The provisional  accoLunts prepared for 1983  and 1984 have
been used  in Annex.   2 because  Messrs Kulatunga  & Co.,require
time until 3t8st  November 1987 to prepare the  Final Accounts for
the  years dnd  the  Auditor --Gener-al 's Report  will be  available
about four months after submission of these accounts for audit.
2.    Messrs Kulatunga & Co.have prepared  he Commercial Accounts
for 1981 to 1984 inclusive in accordance w.th guidelines provided
in February and March, 1984 by World Bank Staff.
3.    Provisional  Commercial Accounts for 1985 were prepared for
internal purposes by SLTD staff and a copy of these accounts was
forwarded to the World Bank in June, 1986. Commercial accounts
for 1986 also are being prepared by SLTD staff and it is expected
that a copy will be forwarded to the World Bank by 3oth November
1987.
Income Statement
4.    Total operating revenues for 1981, 1982 and 1983  were very
close to the  forecast operating revenues for these years and for
1984 the actual revenue was only 12% higher than the forecast.
The fact that the forecast and actual figures are so close'
indicate that a great deal of care was exercised when preparing
the forecasts.   It will be  seen that actual revenue  from telex
and telagraph charges in 1983 and 1984 was somewhat lower than
the corresponding forecast figures: this was mainly because of
increased use of facsimile facilities the income for which has
been included as telephone revenue.
5.    The Forecast "Salaries"  for  1981 to 1984 are  appreciably
higher than the Actuals and this is probably due to the fact that
the Forecast figures include certain items(e.g. Overtime, Travel
and Other Aliowances, Meals, Medical supplies etc) which have
been treated as "Operation and Administration" expenditure in the
actual figures.



- 41 -
ANNEXX
Page. 2
6.    Actual expenditure on "Maintenance" for  the four years was
only 4% higher than forecast which appears acceptable.
7.    The Forecast  of "Operation  and  Administration"  expenses
assumed  that  this  expenditure   would  increase  by  25%  p.a.
However,the actuals were much lower mairly due to severe Treasury
constraints  on  actual expenditure  in  these  four yea;s.   The
substantial increase in expenditure in 1984 was mainly due to the
fact  that the  Turnover Tax  payment  was SL  Rs.  41.2  million
higher than in 1983. The 1984 payment included settlement of
arrears of Turnover Tax for prior years.
8.    The  depreciation  charges,  because of  revaluations, were
higher than forecast because an index was used for Fixed Asset
revaluations and the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against the SDR
to a greater extent than was forecast.
9.    The Forecast  Interest payments have been calculated at 10%
on SLTD's average long  term debt to the Government in each year,
inclusive of loans obtained in foreign currency for SLTD. The
actual interest figures however have been calculated at 12% p.a.
on the Zoreign Currency Loans only in each year. In effect, the
bases used are different and the interest figures are not
therefore comparable.
10.   The "Exchange Losses and write  offs" are in fact mainly
Exchange  losses  on  Foreign   Currency  Loans,  caused  by  the
progressive depreciation of  the SL Re. against the US  $ and the
Yen.
11.   "Net Income" for  each of  the four  years  was  well above
the corresponding forecast figure and the actual net income for
the four year period exceeded the forecast by 95%, which must be
regarded as highly satisfactory.
12.   "Operating Ratio", which is operating expenses expressed as
a % of operating revenue, is more favourable than forecast for
all years from t981 to 1984.
13.   The "Rate of Return" which is operatirig income expressed as
a % of Average Net Fixed Assets, is also more favourable than
forecast for all years from 1981 to 1994.

Balance Sheet
14.   The actual "Stores"  figures  for 1981  1982 and  1983 were
substantially higher than forecast mainly because stores could
not be charged to Capital and Revenue Expenditure because of
budgetary constraints imposed by the Treasury. However, the
value  of  stores  on  hand   as  at  31.12.1984  was  below  the
corresponding forecast figure.
15.    Forecast "receivables" for  1981 to 1983 represent between
21.65 and 2.75 months of billings for the years, whereas the
actual receivable represent about 4 months billings in 1981, 3.6
months billings in 1982 and about 3 months billings in 1983.
There  was   therefore  a  definite  improvement  in actual  debt
collection during the 1981 to 1983 period. The actual receivable
at the end of 1984 however represented about 5.3 months billings
and this was mainl,' due to delays in billings and collections
following the ethnic problems in the 3rd quarter of 1983. It
shout-d also be noted that the 1983 and 1984 receivable fiqires
were estimates made at the time the provisional accounts were
prepared. However, more accurate figures will be available when
Messrs Kulatunga & Co., prepare the final accounts for 1983 and
1984 by the end of November, 1987.
16.   The actual "accumulated profit' figures are higher than the
forecasts, because the "Net Income" earned annually was higher
than forecast.
17.   The actual "revaluation reserve"  figures  are  higher than
the forecast for the reason mentioned in paragraph 8 above.
18.   "Debt to  Bovernment - Long Term"  includes  funds received
from the Treasury (other than those mentioned in 19 below) and
the SL Re equivalent of Foreign Currency Loans obtained by the
Treasury on behalf of SLTD. These debts also are in fact part of
Government Equity and a better appreciation of the variation in
Government  Equity  from   year  to  year  can   be  obtained  by
considering "Debt to Government-Long Term" as Government Equity.
"Debt to Government - Long Term" decreased in 1983 and 1984
because of the increased short-term Government funding in these
years mentioned in paragraph 19 below.



- 43 -
Annem E
eaat 4
19.   "Debt to  Government - Current" rose  substantially in 1983
and 1984 because of substantial increases in Treasury advances
for  stores.   The increase  is  due  to  the practices  used  in
Government  accounting: if  severe  budgetary  restraints had not
been imposed in 1983 and 1984 more stores items would have been
charged to Capital and Revenue expenditure, and TSA Stores
Advance  Account  (and  consequently   the  "Debt  to  Government
Current") would  have been  reduced.  The  reduction in  "Debt to
Government - Current"  would  of   course  have  been  offset  by
corresponding increases in "Debt to Government - Long Term", to
reflect the increased long term investment in the business in the
torm of fixed assets.
Funds Flow Statement
20. The Funds Flow figures are obtained entirely from the Income
Statements  and   Balance   Sheets. As   figures  in  the  Income
Statements and Balance Sheets have been specifically commented on
in paragraphs 4 to 19 above, no additional comment is provided on
the Funds Flow Statements.

ANNEX 6
(Please see 7.04)
SRI LANKA TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT (SLTD)
RtAe of Return on Investment Proqramme
1.   SLTD's Investment Programme for 1981 to  1986 includes  the
project  and ongoing  and  other works.   The close  relationship
between the project,  the  ongoing and  other  works,  makes  any
separation very arbitrary, as regards incremental costs and
revenues. Accordingly, the rate of return calculation is based
on the whole investment programme for the years 1961 to 1986.
2.    The deflator  used in  the  calculations  is  based  on the
composite index suggested by World Bank Staff and used to revalue
assets when preparing the draft commercial accounts for 1986. As
commercial accounts were first prepared for the calender year
1981, 1981 has been treated as the base year.
3.    The benefit period  extends to 2004,  by which  time it is
envisaged that the equipment will have substantially completed
its useful life.
4.    The incremental costs and revenue for each year have been
calciulated by reference to 1981.   From 1986 onwards, it has been
assumed  that  the incremental  costs  and  revenues will  rEmain
constant  in real  terms -  this  same assumption  was made  when
preparing the  STaff Appraisal  Report in 1980.   Operating costs
are exclusive of depreciation and interest - which was the basis
used when preparing the staff appraisal report in April, 1980.
5.    No residual  value for the  programmed  investmens has been
taken into account, because the 1981 discounted value of these
would be insignificant.
6.    A summary of the costs, revenue, and net  benefits is given
below: -
Year         Deflator   Capita]       Incremental    Net Benefits

1983          0.83        496.2      30.3      246.3      (260.2)

ANNEX 6
Page. 2
The net  benefit stream results in a rate of  return of  8.03% as
against 16.6% calculated when preparing the Staff Appraisal
Report in 1980.
7.    A sensitivity analysis performed gave the following  result
in place of the figure of 28.033% shown above.
(a) 10% increase in capital expenditure             25.22%.
(b) 10x. increase in operating costs                27.62%
(c) 10% decrease in revenue                         24.55%.
(d)  Combination of (a), (b, and(c) above           21.71%
8    The economic rate of returri is substantially higher than the
rate of 28.03% shown above for the following reasons:
(a) No attempt has been made to estimate the consumer surplus.
It is known, however, that an unauthorised market for
telephone   exists  islandwide   and  inside   Colombo  in
particular.
(b)  No increase in revenues due to this project investment has
been  considered after  1986.  When  additional facilities
are installed under subsequent projects, the investment
during 1981 to 1986 will produce additional revenue.
(c)  Some  of the  equipment  installed under  the project  has
spare capacity and could handle higher traffic with low
marginal investment.  Despite this,  the full capital cost
of the project has been included when calculating the rate
of 28.03% shown above.
(d) When preparing the Staff Appraisal Report in 1980, the
internal rate of return was shown as 16.6% and the
economic rate of return as 33.1%. In view of the fact
that subscribers and potential subscribers are willing to
pay c.irrent tariffs and taking into account that tariffs
have been increased twice since 1980 and are to be
increased again shortly the economic rate of return would
be in excess of 40%.

Dear ;r :olfickip
This is with reference to your letter of September 21,
1988 inviting my observations on t.2 Project Completion F.eport 1020 CE.,
I t:nz. you for giving me this opportunity and I am zlad to submit
the followius observations :-
I Shou.L add that this project commenced at a time wthen
this Board was not in existence and was completed in 1987, many months
after this Board was constituted. Whatevqr coi.ments I am making should
therefore be viewed in this context.
There is no question t}at the project has iade a major
contribution to the development of Telecommtnication Services of this
country. This is p_:.rticularly true in respect of the extension of
tihene services to the rural areas particularLy for the major develop-
mental schemes in the country and the change over to digital exchanges.
Also a condition of the IDA credit t:..t the Telecommunication Services
should be constituted as a separate Department has been a major structur-
al change whicl has contributed to tl.e success of t.is project. The re-
vision on prices alone has resulted in an increa e in revenue by
U3 310 million according to the PCR.
the project reveals t,at if the Telecommunication Services
could be operated efficiently it could not only be highly profitable
but also be an important earner of foreign exchange for this country.
The decision to clange over to digital exchange hias 'oeen a clear demon-
stration of the technical capabilities of the staff of the Department.
Mis is all the more reason w.y urger.t measures should be taken to
restructure the Telecommnications Sector.
I an, glad to find that -our report refers to the proposed
restructuring of the Telecommunications Department by the enactment of
t'.e Telecommunicutions Act wkiclh will establish a Teleco.munications
Comission and Pet up a C).iprvq to operate the Telecommunication Zervices.
71.is will amount to a radical chl:'nc of the exi::ting institutional and
tec'nical framework wlich in our vie.; is the sine qua non for the rapid

development of the Telecommunic-tion Services of this ooLntry. I am
also glad to note that your project has drawn attention to the import-
once of a commercialisod approach in the management and conduct of
the Department as a means of rendering it a highly profitable enter-
prise. Mis should help to orient the thinking of tho Department on
these lines ard thereby facilitate the endeavours of this Board to
bring about a radical change in the outlook of its personnel from
a negative and static departmental approach to a dynamic and creative
co:nmercial outlook.
The importanoe of expediting this restructurine is borne
out in the delay in the completion of t_is project.  No doubt this
delay could be attributed to the constraints and red tape within the
government bureaucracy as well w the problems of obtaining looal funds
from the Government at given times. These delays havu inevitably con-
tri'buted to t'e cost over run wLich was also due to the depreci.tion
of the rupee. Yet if the -'tork had been expedited this over run would
have been reduced considerably. To that extent delays in completion
are attributable to the limitations a.nd constraints in t:.e departmental
structure.
This is clear proof th_t an autonomous entity whic'. is free of
bureaucratic control slueh as is envisaged by this Board could obviate
such delays not only by providing for the necessary funds but also by
implementation of its plans on a more ratiomal basis.  Our attention
haI  been dra-n to the requirement t:.at by 31st .rch 1981 the Department
should have finalized a complete inventory of assets for c'assification
and valuation of assets.  It does not appe&r that such an inventory
-nd classification has been prepared up to now. It slould be mnentioned
t!at since its inoeption the TESL has attached urgent importance to the
necessity of a valuation of assets a d appointed an Azsets Committee
which included the Director of Telecommunications :ad "in,ancial Consult-
ant.  The Committee sujoested the appointment of a Board consisting of
3 engineers and an accountant who were given the task of inventorising
nad classification of assets by personal visits and personal inspection.
MTe T3SL in fact even offered to provide the SLTD with f.unds required
for t'he purpose of t:is Board of Survey. It is unfortunate th;t there
has been some delays in the work of this Board and it is a matter of
regret th.at up to now their work has not been completed.  The 3oard is
I.oping that t.is work coald be expedited anid completed -t the earliest
o-portunity because it will be appreciated tlh t without such a complete
inventory and classification of assets no proper valuation can be made
-other than a purel- superficial one arrived at on a hypothetical basis.
-e are also impressed Ly the IR  of 29g iwhich has been
.chieved which speaks well for the performance o. the project in physical
and financial terms. however, as ire 3re unaware of the ossumptions on
wLich this calculation wras made, no detailed comments can be given. The
report refers to "a lybrid system c. accounting". It should be pointed
tut however that at present tLere is no co..;-,ercial accounting system in
operaticn. W.hat is bing done is a "post balance-sheet adjustment" which
provides information on a commercial basis.  It should be mentioned that
as ,art of its work the TBSL is ergajed on revising tlhe accounting systems
aind training of the accounting persownnel to enable a si.ooth transition
to a comnercialised accounting system.
'IV con cusion is that t.e project has been of great value
in a number of respects.  It has achieved major improvemLents in the
1elecommunicAtion Services of the country and also effected siCniiicant
-/3.
