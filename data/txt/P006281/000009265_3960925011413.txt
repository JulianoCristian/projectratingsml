PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - SERCTPE NITROGEN FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1406-BR)
PREFACE
1.       On April 19, 1977 the Bank approved a loan of US$64.0 million
equivalent to Petrobras Fertilizantes S.A., (PETROFERTIL) to assist in the
financing of the Sergipe Nitrogen Fertillxer Project (Loan 1406-BR). The
loan was guaranteed by the Government of Brazil. At PSTROFERTIL's request,
as of November 4, 1981,the Bank cancelled US$12.0 million equivalent from
the loan reducing It to US$52.0 million equivalent. In January 1982, with
the agreement of thc Bunk, the Project ownership was transferred to
Fertilixantes Nit;ogenados do Nordeste S.A. (NITROFERTIL), a subsidiary of
PETROPERTIL. As a consequence -.f the transfer, the repayment and other
obligations under the Loan Agreement were assumed by NITROFERTIL.
2.       Following the closing of the loan on May 31, 1983, IND Staff
visited Brazil in December 1983 for the preparation of the Project
Completion Report (PCR) and had discussions with the Govercment, PETROBRAS
and NITROPERTIL, the Project Implementing agency. A follow-up mission
vislted Brazil In October 1984 to finalize the draft PCi prepared by
NITROFERTIL. This report reflects the findings of these missions as well
as a review of the project files and related documents.  The Borrower's
comments are reproduced in Annex 13.
3.       This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - SERGIPE NITROGEN FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1406-hR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Brazil's agricultur&a  policy aims to increase agricultural output
by expanding the area under cultivation and using intensive agricultural
pra.tices supported by extension programs, increased fertilizer
application, better credit availability and use of improved seeds. In this
context the Government has encouraged domestic production of fertilizers to
reach self-sufficieucy to ensure their reliable supply to farmers (para
1.0 1).
2.        In pursuit of this policy, PETROBRAS, a Government-owned
petroleum company, was entrusted the task of expanding nitrogenous
fertilizer production in Drazil. IG March 1976, PETROBRAS organized
PETROFERTIL, a subsidiary, to buill, own and operate the Sergipe Nitrogen
Fertilizer Project (the Project) as well as two other ammonia/urea
projects. The Project was appraised in July 1976 following a request from
PETROBRAS. The Board approved a Bank loan of US$64.0 million equivalent to
PETROFERTIL at an interest rate of 8.2% per annum (p.a.) with a maturity of
about 15 years, including a grace period of 4 years. The loan, which
became effective on August 31, 1977, was guaranteed by the Government for a
fee of 1.8% p.a. (pars 1.03-2.02).
3.        The Project comprises an ammonia plant of 300,000 tons per year
(tpy) and a urea plant of 363,000 tpy capacity with the necessary
utilities, and infrastructure. The Project facilities were mechanically
completed in July 1982, 18 months behind the original schedule.
Commissioning and start-up of the plant were carried out smoothly and units
exceeded their rated capacity without difficulty (para 2.03-3.01).
4.        The Project employs 482 people.  The majority of operating
manpower was recruited and trained by NITROFERTIL, a subsidiary of
PETROFERTIL created in January 1982 with the agreement of the Bank, to own
and operate the facilities. The performance of foreign engineering firms
was generally satisfactory. Local firms provided detailed engineering
services under the supervision of foreign licensors (pars 3.04-3.06).
5.        PETROFERTIL followed generally acceptable procurement procedures
for construction, equipment, erection and civil works. With Bank
assistance, difficulties encountered at initial stages of Project
implementation were eliminated by completely reorganizing the procurement
department and establishing efficient procurement procedures. Through a
special agreement with Brazilian Vendors Association for some specific



- vi -
Items on the reserve list, international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures wire applied for Brazilian manufacturers, resulting in lower
costs. Although the performance of the local vendors was in general
satisfactory, delays in 4eliveries by some Brazillan manufacturers
fabricating sophisticated equipment for the first time In 4razil were
unavoidable (para 3.07-3.09).
6.        Tocal Project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$283.4
million. At Project completion the actual cost was US$244.7 million
representing a 14% underrun mainly due to: (i) some reduction in Project
scope, (ii) use of ICB procedures for some of the reserve list equipmett,
and (iii) major devaluation of the Cruzeiro in December 1979 against the US
Dollar. Of the total Bank loan of US$64.0 million equivalent, the actual
utilization was only US$52.0 million equivalent. At the request of
PETROFERTIL, as of November 4, 1981, US$12.0 million equivalent of the loan
was cancelled (para 3.11-3.12).
7.        Due to the depressed fertilizer demand in 1983 In the wake of the
Brazilian recession, the capacity utilization of the plant was restricted
to avoid building up high inventory levels; annual capacity usage for
ammonia and urea units were 81% and 67Z, respectively. In 1984, however,
the fertilizer market situation improved and units capacity utilization
reached 88.5% and 80% 'estimaced), respectively; utilization rates in 1985
and thereafter are expected to be over 10% (para 4.01-4.04).
8.        The financial rate of return (FRR) for the Project is now
estimated at 8.9% compared to the appraisal estimate of 18.6%. The
reduction in FRR is mainly due to the Government's current pricing policy.
At the time of appraisal urea/feedstock price ratio was about 5.9, whereas
the prevailing ratio in 1984 was only 2.8. The Project's financial results
are consolidated with NITROPERTIL's financial statements; NITROFERTIL has
satisfactory financial ratios meeting the financial covenants agreed upon
with the Bank. The economic rate of return is now estimated at 14.9%,
slightly lower than the appraisal estimate of 17% inspite of the completion
delays. The net annual foreign exchange savings from the Project are
estimated to be about US$87 million. In addition, the Project has resulted
in substantial technology transfer to Brazilian firms (para 5.01-6.04).
9.        Beginning from the early phases and all through the
implementation period of the Project, the Bank played a significant role in
helping PETROFERTIL to arrange Project financing, improve Project
management, organization and procedures, especially in procurement area,
and constantly monitoring the Project to identify the weak points in the
implementation. The Project has been successfully implemented meeting its
main objectives of: (i) ensuring timely and e-onowical supply of
fertilizers to farmers by converting a natural resource to a much needed
and imported commodity; and (ii) improving the Northeast region's economic
structure (para 7.01-8.04).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - SERGIPE NITROGEN FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1406-BR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1,01      Brazil's agricultural policy aims to increase agricultural
production to make Brazil one of the world's foremost producers and
exporters of agricultural commodities. Braxil plans to achieve this
objective both by expanding the area under cultivation and by using
Intensive agricultural practices supported by extension programs, increased
fertilizer application, better credit availability and use of Improved
seeds. From the mid 1960's, as a result of rural credit expansion as well
as subsidized Inputs needed to modernize Brazil's agricultural sector,
fetLilizer consumption increasad rapidly. Annual fertilizer consumption
growth rates which had been negligible before 1966, Improved to an average
rate of 352 annually through 1972 and moderated to 142 annually during
1973-80. Until 1974, Brazil's fertilizer industry consisted of a large
number of relatively small companies, mainly concentrating on importing,
blending and distribution of fertilizers. In 1974, the Government launched
the National Fertiliter Program for a major expansion of production
capacity based on large-scale, efficient plants to achieve self-sufficiency
by the mid-19809. The Bank supported three of these projects - the gas-
based ammonia/urea complex in Sergipe, Salvador, in the Northeast (Loan
1406-BR), the fuel oil-based ammonia/urea project near Araucaria, Parana,
In the Southeast (Loan 1256-BR), and the Valefertil phosphate fertilizer
project near Uberaba, Minas Gerais, in the Centerwest (Loan 1411-BR).
Other projects included in the National Fertilizer Program, and not
supported by the Bank, were not implemented.
1.02       Fertilizer consumption in Brazil has grown rapidly but
erratically, responding to changes in the country's economic conditions.
The fertilizer nutrient consumption in Brazil increased from 2.5 million
tons in 1976 to 4.0 million tons in 1980, but decreased to 2.2 million tons
in 1983, due to the poor foreign and domestic economic situation of the
country and the elimination of subsidies for agriculture. In fact, the
high Inflation rates, large public deficit, and the increased volumes of
subsidized rural credits forced the Government, in 1980-81, to review its
rural credit policies for agricultural investment and production. As a
result, Brazilian agriculture faced a new reality of non-subsidized
financial costs for agricultural inputs and investments. Faced with this
situ&tion the Brazilian farmer in the first year (1981) of the new rural
credit policies depleted his fertilizer inventories and in the second year
(1982) started cutting back ou fertilizer application. This resulted in
very sharp decrease in demand during 1981-83 - nearly 36% - dropping
present conisumption level to that prevailing in 1976-77. This transition
period coincided with the initial production years of the two new
nitrogenous fertilizer projects supported by the Bank, which as



-2-
a result could not be operated at their target cap4cities. The recent
recovery of international prices for agricultural couodities
traditionally exported by Brazil opens up a new horizon for the internal
fertilizer demand; consuption trend in 1984 seems to support this
development. By 1990, Brazil's fertilizer consumption is expected to reach
4.0 million tons of nutrients per year, the level achieved in 1980;
representing an annual growth rate of 92. This growth rate appears
reasonable given the fact that fertilizer demand In Brazil grew at an
average rate of 35% p.8. during 1966-72 and 142 o.a. during 1973-80.
1.03      The expansion of nitrogenous fertilizer production In Brazil was
entrusted coo Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS), a Government-owned
petroleum company-responsible for the exploration and exploitation of the
country's hydrocarbon resources. PETROBRAS was already substantially
involved in the chemical industry through its subsidiary, Petrobras Quimica
S.A., (PETROQUISA) which had responsibility for PETROBRAS interests in the
chemical and petrochemical industries. In view of the growing fertilizer
activities, PETROBRAS organized, in March 1976, a new subsidiary, Petrobras
Fertilizantes S.A. (PETROFERTIL) to foster the development of the domestic
fertilizer industry, and in particular to own and operate the proposed
Project in Sergipe and also the two other fertilizer projects supported by
the Bank.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Identification. Preparation. Appraisal,
Approval and Loan Effectiveness
2.01       Following a request from PETROBRAS for Bank participation in the
Project, a Bank identification mission visited Brazil in May 1975. The
Project was jointly prepared by PETROBRAS and PETROFERTIL and was appraised
in July 1976. The process technology, engineering features, procurement
procedures, and co-financing arrangements were extensively discussed with
the Bank during and after appraisal. The Bank was also concerned with the
availability of gas for the Project and engaged a consultant to review the
matter independently. Since the selected location was in a remote area
without any supporting infrastructure, the Bank also studied the related
infrastructural requirements such as fresh water supply system, railroad
transportation facilities and natural gas collecting, treating and
transportation systems.
2.02      On April 19, 1977 the Bank Board approved a loan of US$64 million
equivalent to PETROFERTIL at an interest rate of 8.2% p.a. and a maturity
of about 15 years, including four years of grace.  The Government, for a
fee of 1.82 p.a.,guaranteed the loan bringing the cost of the loan to
PETROFERTIL to 10% p.a. The loan became effective on August 31, 1977.
B. Prolect Description and Objectives
2.03      The major objective of the Project was to contribute towards the
growth of the agricultural sector of Brazil by reliably providing



-3-
fertilizers to the farmers at stable and economic prices, and converting a
domestic natural resource to displace an important imported commodity.   In
addition, a secondary objective was to improve the economic structure of
the depressed least industrialized Northeast region through the Project's
infrastructure and employment opportunittes. The Project was designed for
300,000 metric tons per year (tpy) of ammonia and 363,000 tpy urea
capacity. At 90% capacity level, of the total ammonia production, 190,000
tpy was for captive use in the urea facility with the balance of about
80,000 tpy for direct sale. The Project Includes the following main
facilities: (i) ammonia plant-907 tpd (1,000 short tons/day); (ii) Urea
plant-1,100 tpd; (iII) storage and handling facilities, including 30,000
metric tons bulk urea storage; (iv) bagging facilities and 10,000 tpy
refrigerated ammonia storage; (v) water supply system from the Sao
Francisco river itcluding a connecting 90 km pipeline; (vi) a railroad spur
line and loading facilities; and (vii) effluent disposal system.
2.04      Originally, the principal raw materials to be consumed by the
Project were the natural gas and vacuum gas oil at an anuual rate of 215
million normal cubic meter (Nm ) and 109,000 tons, respectively and
about 50,000 tpy Bunker C fuel for steam generation. Later PETROBRAS
decided to supply sufficient natural gas to meet all feed and fuel
requirements of the plant. Now, at its rated capacity (902), the plant
will consume 305 million (NO3) of natural gas per year.
Ill PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project has been completed successfully and has achieved its
major objective of producing fertilizers at economic prices - thus
contributing to the growth of the agricultural sector iii Brazil. The
facilities were mechanically completed in July 1982, about 18 months behind
the original schedule but at costs 142 lower than estimated. The
pre-operational phase was short and the plant was able to reach commercial
production within one month (para 4.01).
B. Project Scope
3.02      There has been no significant change in the Project scope except
for the following minor modifications, made with the approval of the Bank,
which helped to reduce the investment cost without affecting the economy,
efficiency and safety of thf plant:
(a) replacement of steam turbine drivers of the ammonia
compressor by an electric motor. This change was made
to minimize liquid fuel use, which reduced the size of
steam producing facilities;
(b) increase of electric power supply to meet the
additional demand as per para (a) above;



where NITROPSRTIL has ammonia and urea plants In operation. Supervisory
staff was recruited partly from Camacari plant. The devised training
program was detailed and comprehensive considering that very few skilled
labor was available locally. A total of 236 people were trained of which
154 were employed. In addition, 24 engineers in different disciplines were
hired and trained during this period*
B. Performance of Engineering Contractors
3.06.    Project execution was supervised by PETROPERTIL's Sergipe
Nitrogen Fertilizer Project Team, supported by PETROBRAS' fertilizer
project Implementation unit, Construcao de Fertilizantes Nitrogenado
(COFEN) and by PETROBRAS' engineering department. One engineering firm of
USA and one of Jdpan took the responsibilities of providing licenses, basic
engineering, erection, pre-operation and start-up supervision for the
ammonia and urea units, respectively. Two Brazilian engineering companies
undertook the execution of detailed engineering of the ammonia and urea
units and ancillary facilities, under the supervisiou of the respective
process licensors. PETROFERTIL WaS, in general, satisfied with the
services provided by the contractors. At the initial phase of the Project
Implementation, some coordination problems between foreign and domestic
engineering companies surfaced but were solved in time.
F. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.07     PETROFERTIL followed generally acceptable contracting and
procurement procedures. It used international competitive biddings (ICB)
procedures In accordance with Bank guidelines for procuring foreign
equipment and material. Among foreign suppliers the most important country
of origin was the USA (Annex 3); the latter won about 42 of the total
contracts financed by the Bank.
3.08      At the initial stage of Prject implementation, PETROFERTIL had
difficulties in understanding and following the Bank guidelines. Later,
with Bank assistance the procurement department was completely reorganized
and systems were established for more effective procurement activities. In
addition, a special agreement for this Project was made with the Srazilian
Vendors Association (Participation Agreement) whereby instead the of
traditional two-way division of items into imported and domestic which
existed in Brazil at the time, a third category was introduced under which
a part of the reserve list items were put for ICB. The Brazilian vendors
participated in these ICB procedures. This arrangement resulted in
increased competition and lower prices for domestic equipment as in the
case of rail cars and some other high pressure equipment.
3.09      During appraisal, it was estimated that 65% of the total
procurement of equipment, materials and services (by value) would be
domestic against 35% foreign. The actual results were close to the
estimates at 62% local and 38% foreign (para 3.11). Although the



-6-
performance of the vendors was in general satisfactory, there were delays
in deliveries by some Brazilian manufacturers fabricating sophisticated
equipment for the first time in Brazil. However, as illustrated by the
case of ammonia converter fabrication, the local manufacturers took quick
measures to shorten the delays and agreed to complete final welds at site
to comply with the construction schedule. There were no problems in
obtaining equipment supplier's cooperation and assistance in carrying out
the required mlnor repairs/modifications related to the equipment problems
encountered during commissioning and initial operation.
G. Project Implementation Schedule
3.10      The mechanical compi2tion and commissioning dates of the units
are given below.

Urea Unit              July 1982           September 1982
The Project was mechanically completed in July 1982, 18 months behind the
appraisal schedule. The above delay was mainly due to the following
factors: (i) delays in ge;ting the official approvals by Industrial
Property Institute (INPI)'/ and Banco do Brazil for the signing of the
process know-how contracts; (ii) delays in finalizing the approved vendors
list; (iii) delays in finalizing the "Participation Agreement" with
Brazilian Vendors Association and in obtaining CACEX approval; (iv) delays
in the delivery of locally produced machinery and equipment; and (v) delays
due to inefficacy of "package units" suppliers. The major delays took
place at the very beginning of the Project and arose principally from the
cumbersome processing of the permits required by Brazilian regulations.
The Project management team tried successfully to overlap the testing and
commissioning with the final stages of the construction activities to
reduce delays. The contribution of NITROFERTIL's operating experience
resulted in smooth testing and commissioning and enabled the plant to reach
commercial operation within a month.
H. Capital Costs, Disbursements and Financing
3.11      A table summarizing the Project's capital costs is presented
below.

involving payment of foreign licence fees unless the licensor holds
patents registered in Brazil. Toyo patent was approved for
registration in October 1977.

Total actual Project cost was US$244.7 million, 14% lower than the
appraisal estimate of US$283.4 million. The decrease in capital cost was
mainly due to: (i) minor modifications in Project scope (para 3.02); (ii)
use of ICB for local procurement; and (iii) a major devaluation of the
Cruzeiro in December 1979 against the US Dollar. The following table
summarizes the variations in Project cost by categories.

The late start of foreign procurement activities and delays in completion
of the Project as noted in pars 3.10 above, caused longer than estimated
loan disbursement period.  The Project cost disbursement schedule is given
in Annex 4.
3.12      Total Project cost of US$244.7 million has been financed with
equity provided by PETROFERTIL of US$114.0 million and FINOR2/ US$2.8
million, and borrowings--US$47,6 million from local sources ind US$80.3
million from foreign sources. Details of the Project financing plan are
given in Annex 5.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned -arlier (para 3.10), the Project facilities were
mechanically completed in July 1982 about 18 months behind appraisal
schedule, but the Project recovered part of the delay by overlapping the
final stages of construction with testing and commissioning. This wis
possible due to the earlier completion of the utility facilities. The
commissioning of the plants went smoothly. After feedstock feed-in, in 33
days the plant produced ammonia (September 15, 1982) and was able to
achieve full capacity operation. The Urea plant produced its first urea
(September 29, 1982) after nine hours of feed in. The ammonia plant passed
the acceptance tests in October 1982. Plant performance, product quality,
capacity usage and production cost were within the guaranteed limits. The
urea plant's first acceptance test in December 1982 presented snme minor
problems in product quality, but this was corrected by the NITROFERTIL
operating team with the active assistance of the licensor. The plants were
formally accepted without achieving an 802 capacity utilization for at
least two months as stipulated in the Loan Agreement. Subsequently th-c
plants have operated well.
4.02      The production levels achieved during 1982-84 are given in
Annex 6-1. During the first month of operation (October 1982) the ammonia
plant achieved a capacity utilization of 582, and the urea plant 50%.
During the first year of operation (1983), the ammonia and urea plants
produced a total of 243,624 and 242,458 tons of ammonia and urea,
respectively, corresponding to 812 and 672 of capacity usage,
respectively. Capacity utilization of the ammonia plant exceeded 1002 of
rated capacity in August 1983 and in November 1983 the plant achieved 120%
capacity usage. The urea unit reached 100% capacity utilization by
September 1983 and was able to operate at 1102 of capacity during November
1983.
B. Build-up of Production
4.03      It is estimated that the plant will produce 264,750 tous of
ammonia and 292,630 tons of urea in 1984; in the first nine months of 1984
production reached 187,000 and 203,000 tons of ammonia and urea,
respectively. Expected production for 1985 is 272,730 tons ammonia and
312,300 tons of urea which corresponds to 91% and 86% capacity usage,
2/ Fundo de Investimentos do Nordeste (Sudene).



- 10 -
respectively. Thereafter, the plants should be able to maintain a 902
capacity utilization. Although the plants could have operated at their
design ratings in 1983-84, the lower capacity usage has been mainly due to
market conditions. In 1983, the ammonia and urea plants were down for 54
and 58 days, respectively, due to the high inventory levels at the plants.
This situation, however, was temporary because of the start of production
both at Araucaria and Sergipe plants at the same period. The sales and
inventory levels of Sergipe plant is given in Annex 6-2. Production
estimates for the next four years, considering the expected market growth
for the Project is sumarized below:

C. Marketing Aspects
4.04      As discussed in Chapter I earlier, the development of fertilizer
market in Brazil was rapid but erratic, and also distributed in the country
unevenly. The fertilizer demand of the Northeast region is low compared to
the available production facilities in the area, therefore, some part of
the production has to be shipped to the South where the demand is high.
However, through the Government's development plans for the Northeast
region, it is expected that by 1990 the production of the existing plants
would be absorbed locally. The existing nitrogenous production capacity
and fertilizer consumption (past and projected) are given in Annex 7.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Pricing Policies
5.01      Since the input and output prices for the fertilizer industry are
set by the Government, the financial performance of the Project depends
upon the Government's pricing policies. Price controls by the Government
started in September 1975 with NPK blends and in 1977 were extended to
basic fertilizers and raw materials as well. These controls prevailed
until December 1980. Periodic adjustments were made on the basis of
changes in production cost. In 1981-82, prices were partially deregulated,
with controls remaining only on raw materials. However, in 1983 -price
regulations were reestablished for the fertilizer sector as a whole. Under
the current system, ex-factory prices for locally-produced fertilizers are
set quarterly by the Government's Interministral Prices Council (GIPC)
using a cost-plus system that theoretically allows a most efficient



- 11 -
producer a 18.82 before tax average return on investment. The presently
designated most efficient producer is Camacari plant which was however,
built many years ago at lower capital costs and has been substantially
depreciated. Therefore, under this formula the ex-factory prices fixed by
GIPC do not permit an efficient producer with more recent facilities which
have higher asset value to earn a satisfactory financial rate of return and
these prices also tend to be beLow international prices (CIF). This policy
may be in conflict with the understanding reached with the Government
during loan negotiations and recorded in the Guarantee Agreement. However,
such shift in the Government policy needs to be looked in light of the
current economic situation in Brazil where the Government, in its efforts
to control inflation, is trying to keep the prices under control.
Nevertheless, the Bank should take up the matter with the Government.
B.   Financial Rate of Returr.
5.02      The financial rate of return (FRR) has been calculated using
actual prevailing prices, corrected to 1983 constant dollars. The
operating costs and revenues as well as the prices of inputs and outputs
are given in Annex 8. The FRR for the Project is now estimated at 8.9%
(Annex 9), much lower than the appraisal estimate of 18.6%. As noted in
para 5.01 above, the main reason for this difference is the Government's
pricing policy with the resulting changes in the input-output price
ratios. At appraisal, the urea/natural gas price ratio was 5.9. In 1983,
this ratio was 3.7 and in 1984 it further decreased to 2,8, resulting in
the low FRR for the Project. In addition, despite the cost underrun, the
18 months delay in Project completion and depressed fertilizer demand in
1983 have also contributed towards lower FRR. As noted in the economic
analysis, if ex-factory fertilizer prices in Brazil were to be adjusted to
international levels (CIF price), the financial rate of return will
increase to 12%.
C.   Financial Results
5.03      As mentioned earlier (para 3.03) in January 1982 the Project
ownership was transferred from PETR0PvRTIL to NITROFERTIL. In addition to
the Project, NITROFERTIL operates otrtkb fertilizer facilities including a
substantially depreciated ammonia/urea facility at Camacari which yields
good financial results. Income statements and balance sheets for the
Project and NITROFERTITL are presented in Annex 10. Selected financial data
for NITROFERTIL are presented below.

* Estimate.
NITROFERTIL's financial position is sound and meets the loan covenants of
maintaining a debt/equity ratio of 60:40 or better, and current of ratio
not less than 1.2. However, due to major devaluations, it fell short of
the agreed minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5. The situation is
however, expected to improve in 1985 and thereafter with greater capacity
utilization; the debt service coverage ratio in 1985 is expected to be 2.1.
VI. ECONOMItC PERFORMANCE
A.   Economic Rate of Return
6.01      The Project's economic rate of return (ERR) has been determined
using the input and output price assumptions summarized in Annex It.
Tradeable items have been priced on the basis of projected international
prices allowing for transportation and handling charges. Prices for
noo-traded items have been assumed to be the same as the fiuancial prices.
The natural gas has been valued on the basis of its calorific value
equivalent of fuel oil. Due to the limited fertilizer demand if the
Northeast region, part of the product produced in that region has to be
shipped to the South. With Sergipe plant in operation, the Camacari plant
had to divert its Northeast supply to the South incurring an additional
transportation cost. To correctly assess the economic viability of the
Project the incremental transport cost are also considered and the Project
is penalized in the calculation of ERR as done at appraisal. Project costs
and benefits are shown in Annex 12. The ERR for the Project is now
estimated at 14.9% slightly lower than the appraisal estimate of 17% and is
satisfactory in spite of the completion delays.

S. Foreign Exchange Savings
6.02      The average annual foreign exchange value of the Project's
production, with the facilities operating at 90% capacity, Is about US$89
million (in 1983 constant dollars). Most of the materials, including feed
and fuel, and services used in the Project are of domestic origin, except
for chemicals, catalyst, spares, etc., the cost of which is estimated at
US$1.5 million p.a.. Therefore, the net foreign exchange savings before
debt service will be about US$87 million per year (in 1983 constant
dollars)- compared to the appraisal estimate of US$91 million (in 1983
constant dollars); in 1976 constant dollars this figure was US$65 million.
The debt service payments on foreign loans will average about US$12.5
million annually in the first ten years.
C.  Technology Transfer
6.03      The Project has been implemented with substantial involvement of
8razilian engineering firms and manufacturers. Using know-how and basic
design obtained from process licensors, the detailed engineering was
carried out by Brazilian firms. Several equipment for the Project were
also obtained from Brazilian suppliers. Very sophisticated multi-wall high
pressure equipmeut such as reactors, exchangers as well as some rotary
equipment were manufactured for the first time in Brazil under license
agreements with reputable foreign firms. The heavy equipment manufacturing
industry of the Brazil benefited immensely by obtaining the technology and
know-how to supply such equipment and machinery to the Project. The
engineering firms as well as engineering staff of the Project absorbed very
effectively the technology transferred to them and now should have
significant capabilities in carrying out similar projects.
D.   Environmental Aspects
6.04      The Project facilities were designed in conformity with
environmental regulations and norms agreed to during Project appraisal.
However, during Project implementation, it was realized that the rivers in
the plant neighborhood have large residence time and therefore could not
handle the pollutant levels the plant would discharge. To overcome this
problem, the design was changed and a 30 km underground and 4 km undersea
discharge pipelines were constructed for safe disposal of pollutants inLo
the ocean. With regard to air pollution, the plant is operating comfort-
ably below the allowable limits of urea dust and ammonia emissions. The
height of furnace and boiler stacks were designed on the basis of high
sulfur fuel oil. The plant, however, is using natural gas with the result
that sulfur emmission is negligible.
VII. BANK ROLE
7.01      At-various phases of the Project, the Bank worked closely with
PETROFERTIL and NITROFERTIL. During Project appraisal and the early stages



- 14 -
of Project implementation, the Bank participated in formulating the project
financing arrangements especially for the foreign exchange component. At
the initial phase of the Project the Bank provided technical advice to
organize procurement activities and also advised on the development of
Project organization. The Project sets a good example of a project in
which dedicated work by the Project management aided by Bank support has
resulted in a successful project meeting its economic objectives and
contributing to the needs of the country.
VIII. GQNCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Apart from the 18 months delay in Project completion, the Project
was successful in: (i) keeping the Project cost under control; (ii)
achieving a short commissioning and start-up period; (iii) reaching the
design rates of the individual units during acceptance tests; (iv)
obtaining excellent operating performance with plants running more than a
year without major problems; and (v) maintaining good operating cost
performance by consuming feed and utilities at or below design norms. The
delay in Project completion occurred at the initial phase of Project
implementation due to administrative problems, delays in the delivery of
equipment manufactured by the Brazilian suppliers (para 3.10). But once
the initial problems were solved and a capable efficient Project
Coordination and Control Team was formed, tIe Project was implemented
efficiently.
8.02      Notwithstanding the delays in Project completion, which were
mainly due to factors outside the control of Project msnagement, the
Project has been completed successfully due to the ability of PETROFERTIL
and NITROFERTIL management groups, which carried out the Project with
enthusiasm and dedication. The management facilitated utilization of the
expatriate expertise to full advantage and there has been smooth and useful
transfer of technology.
8.03      The financial performance of the Project is below the appraisal
estimates. This is because of the Governument's current pricing policy
which is based upon a cost plus formula for a designated efficient producer
in tha country, which was built many years ago at lower capital costs and
whose facilities have been substantially depreciated. This policy gives
the Project prices lower than the appraisal estimate (paras. 5.01 and
5.02). These prices are also below the inte.rational (CIF) prices. In
addition, _ompletion delays and depressed fertilizer demand in Brazil in
1983 have contributed to lower financial returns for the Project. Although
the Project gets a lower financial rate of return given the present pricing
policy it, nevertheless, continues to make significant contributiou to
Brazil's economy given its 14.9% economic rate of return, by helping on the
one hand in the development of the Northeast region, and on the other hand
in converting economically a natural resource into a much needed fertilizer
and saving the country much needed foreign exchange.



-       ~-  15 -
8.04      Overall, the Project is considered as a satisfactory
accomplishment achieved through close coordination of efforts between
PETROFERTIL/NITROFERTIL managers and the Bank staff. The Project has met
its main objectives and under the expert direction of NITROFERTIL
management can be relied upon to continue to be a successful industrial
enterprise in Brasil. A lesson which this Project illustrates is that a
capable and dedicated Project Management, under a project unit concept with
sufficient authority and autonomy, ard the involvement of an operating
company with experienced staff during commissioning of the plant, can have
a dramatic impact on the success of Project implementation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
1.  Economic price of natural gas is assumed to be equal to the price of
heavy fuel oil on a calorific value equivalent basis.
2.  It is assumed that ammonia and bulk urea prices will retain 1:1
relation at international market.
3.   For bagging US$15 is added to bulk urea prices.
4.   The Project benefits are reduced by incremental transportation cost of
displaced production of Camacari due to the limited demand of the
Northeast region which will be supplied by the Project.
5.   For shadow pricing, local components of capital cost and other inputs
and services are adjusted by using standard conversion factor of 0.83
for Brazil.
6.   Local operating cost items, utilities, fixed costs are converted to
1983 constant dollars, and assumed to remain constant in dollar terms.
7.  For financial rate of return, actual input and output prices (as of
January 1, 1985) are expressed in constant 1983 dollars and assumed to
remain constant for the life of the Project.
