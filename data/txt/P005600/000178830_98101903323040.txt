APPRAISAL OF A RAILTAY PROJECT
i.       lThe Government of Tunisia and the Tunisian Railways have asked the
Bank and the Association for a loan and a credit of US$ 8.5 miilion equir--
alent each to help finance a railway rehabilitation and modernization pro-
ject which will be part of the Government's Second Four-Year Plan, 1969-J197 .
The propose(d loan/credit would cover the project foreign exchange elemen't,
estimated at 58% of the project total cost.
ii.       A UNDP-financed Transport Survey, covering all modes of trans-
portation in Tunisia, was recently completed by the consulting firm Ital--
consult, wi-th the Bank acting as Executing Agent. The transport sector of
the Government Four-Year Plan 1969-1972 will take into account the consul-
tant's recoirmendations on transport policies and investment. The Plan i'3
being reviewed by the Bank.
iii.      Rail transport - performed on two networks, recently amalgamated -
is the responsibility of the State-owned Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT). SNCFT's management is reasonably competent and opera-
tions are generally efficient. The financial relationship between the Gov-
ernment and the Railways - as set forth in SNCFT's present Statutes - is in-
adequate, and SNCFT's present financial position is unsatisfactory.   MeaSures
to correct the situation have been agreed upon. Submission of SNCFT's
amended Statutes to the Tunisian National Assembly and implementation of tha
agreed financial measures should be conditions for sizning of the proposed
loan/credit.
iv.       Passenger and freight rail traffic has been growing steadily over
the last 10 Years and is exDected to continue to increase at an overall annnu-
al average of 8%. SNCFT's freight traffic is largely of a bulk nature, sai2>
able for rail transport.
vI        The pronit consists of track re'npwal. thA purchase of motive nower
and rolling stock, provisions for track equipment, workshops and consulting
services, and interest drlring c-onstruction.  It generally crovers the immediatp
requirements of SNCFT to cope with present traffic demands.   The consultant
studies inclulded in the pronec-t will lard to the identification of a npcond
railway project, the timing of which will depend. upon the satisfactory execu-
+Jion ofr then nrreseQnt rjet
vi.     The~ pro  ti. +is   4nicV11u asioun lnnrl is jifiedNrl onr, anomi,r
grounds.  In addition to the project investments, measures will be taken 'o
ntcrease reven.ue prasets bvely wich will enable SNCFT +^ ezr a 71 return
on the net fixed assets by 1973.



-ii-
vii.      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan and an IDA
credit of US$ 8.5 million each. The proposed loan would be made to SNCFT
with a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace. The term is related
to the economic life of the project items. The proposed credit would be
made to the Government of Tunisia and relent to SNCFT on the terms and con-
ditions of the proposed Bank loan.

1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01~.JJ  T,e nover-r.-,e.-1t ofL T-   ar.d ',1U.te State-owned ±W-LL.n R1..Ll
in August 1967 requested the Bank and the Association to assist in financing
a railway, rehabil tation and modernization project which is part of th e
Government's Second Four-Year Plan, 1969-1972. The proposed loan and c:red t.
amounting to US$8.5 million each, cover the estimated foreign exchange cost
of the project, or 58% of the total project cost (US$29.2 million equivaler-t).
The project comprises track renewal, the purchase of motive power and rollIng
stock, provisions for track equipment, workshops and consulting service3,
and interest during construction due on the proposed Bank loan.
1.02      The proposed loan and credit would be the third Bank Group operatf,on
in Tunisia for transportation. In 1964 and 1968 two loans totalling USS1T.$
million were made for ports development to the Office des Ports Nationaux
Tunisiens '(OPNT). Construction of the project financed by the 1964 loan
was satisfactorily completed in November 1967.
1.03      This appraisal report is based on (i) information supplied by the
Government of Tunisia and the Tunisian Railways; (ii) the findings and recoYQ-
mendations of the UNDP-financed Tunisian Transport Survey carried out by
Italconsult in 1967/68; and (iii) the findings of a Bank appraisal missi.oll in
June 1968 and a follow-up Bank mission in October 1968, when full project 1b.z
became available. The latter mission reviewed Italconsult's recommendatioivs
with respect to railway investment. Both Bank missions comprised Messrs. Awar,
Brechot andi De Grvse, and this renort has been nrenared by them.

has been declining as mining, manufacturing and tourism have grown more rapid-
ly in recent years. Tnisia's first oil refir.     was openede in 1      A
steel plant began production in 1964. Further development in industrializa-
tion, particularly light manufacturing, is being encouraged. The growing
vrolume of tourist traffic has stimulated building construction and associated
actit- ies.. T,e principal sources of foreilg exchange earnings are tourism
and phosphate.
B. Transport System
2.04      T'unisia, when it became independent in 1956, inherited a fairly ex-
tensive and relatively well-developed transport system to which there have
been modest additions over the past decade. With a coastline of about 1,200 km,
the country has four major commercial ports: Tunis-La Goulette, Bizerte-Iienzel
Bourguiba, Sfax and Sousse, all of which are under the control of an autono-
rmous port authority, Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNTX._/ In addi-
tion, the Government has decided on the construction of a new deepwater port
at Gabes in the south-east as an outlet for phosphate exports.d/ The OPNT has
been the beneficiary of two Bank loans; the first (380-TUN), amounting to
US$7.0 million was made in June 1964 and construction works have been satis-
factorily ccmpleted; the second (573-TUN), amounting to US$8.5 million was
signed in November 1968.
2.05       there are about 16,000 km of roads in the country, almost
two-thirds of which are surfaced.   The road network is best developed in the
north where industrial activities are concentrated.   Road maintenance should
be substantially improved.  Many of the most heavily used main roads are in
need of major improvements including higher standard surfacing so as to re-
duce vehicle operating costs and to handle projected traffic increases.   More
agricultural access roads are required to stimulate agricultural production
and exchange. The possibility of Bank assistance for the highways is under
consideration.  Despite these highway needs, the rail investments in this
proposed project are of high priority. In 1966, road transport accounted for
900 million ton-km of freight, while the railway performed 1.3 billion ton-km,
or 60% of the total; and of a total of 1.5 billion pass-km, road transport
accounted for about two-thirds and the railway for one-third.
2.06      The railway network consists of 478 route-km of standard gauge and
1.522 route-km of meter gauge track.  The two gauges link at Tunis.   A de-
tailed description of the railway system, its organization, management and
operations is given in chanter 3 of this reports All rail transport is oDper-
ated by the "Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens" (SNCFT) except
for an electric streetcar line serv1ng the northern suburbs of Tuni s.
2.07      Whi le there are several airfields located throughout the cownt:-
internal air transport for cammercial purpose is insignificant. The prinici-
pal international airport i9 located near Turns and, with the com.pletion. of
the terminal building and other facilities relating to air traffic control
now underway, this airport appears to be adequate.
1/ The port and maritime sector are discussed in detail in Report No. TO-6L8b.
2/ Since in-formation to assess the economic justification of this port is not
fully available at the present time, the Government's request to include
direct rail access to the port has been excluded frorm this project (see
Annex 4, paragraph 1).

C. Transport Itlicy and Coordination
6.08      The Government exercises a large degree of control over the trans-
port sector. This is pa-ticularly true of rail and road trnisport where
tariff approval, licensing of routes for road transport, traffic allocation
ofL comma,odities, control1 of 34InVesta.ntS, f-Core4igr. eXch-.2ner allocation and taxa-
tion are all instruments of control.
2.09      The road transport industry is organized on a geographical basis,
eilh the operatirg uni ts largely beirg publicly ow.ned regional tran9port oMn-
panies. The privately owned trucks are mainly employed in local and intra-
regional trade . While most of the regiona'l pub±ic compan.es are fnanc-I
self-sustaining, a number of the smaller ones are of doubtful viability. The
trucking system suffers from rigid regulation with respec' to inter-zonal op-
erations and the distribution of traffic "rights". A reorganization of the
trucking industry,together with a review of existing traffic 1rights" is unoer
consideration by the Government, and it is expected that competition between
public and private truck transport would result in a more efficient utiliza-
tion of the total vehicle fleet. The tax system applying to the road transport
industry at present consists of nearly a dozen separate taxes and could be
simplified. A main feature is the unbalanced tax distribution between cars
and trucks, the former paying more than their share. Road user charges, in
the sense of' the total taxes collected on the use and ownership of vehicles,
(exclusive of those deriving from city streets) amount to about 80% of the
total expenditures on highway maintenance and construction that Italconsult
estimate as being desirable. In practice, however, the sums collected exceed
the actual expenditure on highways largely because the highway network gen-
erally has been inadequately maintained. The tariff structure regulating
trucking is outdated and many official tariffs are below cos-ts. However,
systematic exceptions to the official tariffs are tolerated. A new tariff
structure mcre related to costs is under study by the Government. Finally,
foreign exchange allocations for the purpose of replacement and expansion of
the aging vehicle fleet have been tightly controlled and this has led to the
import of large quantities of spare parts.
2.10      Despite the policy of favoring rail traffic through regulatory
measures, with little reliance on competition and free consumer choice, the
financial c(ndition of SNCFT remained poor until its recent take-over of the
profitable 'Southern network serving the phosphate industry. Government inter-
vention in the rai)ray hais aimed at subsidizing export commoditice (phosphate
from Kalaa I)jerda, iron ore) and passenger services through an inadequate!
tariff structure and this has been largely responsible for the past railway
deficits.
2.11      Recent investment decisions in the transport sector have been taken
largely on an unplanned, ad hoc, basis by the different operating agencies,
Frequently without the application of economic criteria. Transport policies
have not been conceived as an integral part of general economic policy. A
major UNDP-i'inanced studv of transport planning and policies has recently
been completed by the firm Italconsult.  One of its main conclusions is thetE,
notwithstanding the absence of coordinated policy planning, there is no ma;oi 
distortion of traffic allocation among the various modes of transport.   The
transport settor of the Second Four-Year Plan 1969-1972 will talce into a(-6ox'unt
-talconsult's recommendations on transport investment and ccorAination. The Plan



is being reviewed by the Bank, and agreement is expected to be reached on.

A. 0 aani7,.4;or Mnagement and Staff
3.01      The first railway line in Tunisia was opened to traffic in 1876, and
operated by prvate enterprise. uTn 1922 the uoverzrwnent purcnased the North-
ern Center network which was then operated on a concession basis by the "Com-
pagnie Fermlbre des Chei4ns de Fer Tunisierlns" until taken over, on January 1,
1957, by the Government-owned "Soci6te Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens".
The Southern s,yst*em remained owned and operated by the "Compagnie des Phos-
phates et du. Chemin de Fer de Gafsa" until January 1, 1967, when - in accord-
ance withA1 thIle Concession Agreerm-LenI,s - it was also taken over by SNCFT.
3.02      SNCFT is admbiis'ered under Statutes dated December 27, I956, by a
Board of Directors whose eight members are appointed by the Government.   By
Statute, four Board miemt-lbers (including the Chairman) are from Government, tvTo
from railway staff, and two are persons of outstanding competence from public
or private sectors.  The present Board comprises five civil servants, two
railway personnel representatives and the President of the National Mining
Bureau, so that, in fact, six of the eight Board members are from Government.
Although the main railway users (phosphate and iron ore) are present through
the National Mining Bureau representative, SNCFT Board should be enlarged to
include representatives of other users; a more balanced representation of all
interests concerned would be achieved with the following Board composition,
on which agreement has been reached during negotiations:
Government       4 (including the Chairman)
Personnel        2
Users
Total     10
3.03      Tne powers of the Board are lim'ted by the over-riding authority of
the Government whose prior approval is required for: ti) decisions which,
under the Corporation Law, require the approval of the general assembly of
shareholders; (ii) the operating and capital budgets; (iii) the rules and
regulations for personnel; (iv) tariffs; (v) the sale of assets; and (vi) bor-
rowing. The freedom of SNCFT in day-to-day railway operations is not affected
by these requirements.
3.04      WhLle the Statutes state that SNCFT's main function is rail opera--
t_ ns, they nevertheless provide for the possibility to expand SNCFT's activi-
tias to other fields. In the past, SNCFT has been made responsible for the
collection and trading of alfa and for the setting-up and operation of a
foundry./ SNICFT has since been freed from these activities which interfered
with its main function and adversely affected its finances. During nego-
tiations agreement has been reached that SNCFT shall not, except in accordance
TTS    .   de T~Fo...erie et de Mecanique (Sofomeca)



with a financial plan satisfactory to the Bank, be made responsible for non-
rail activities.' -
3.05      All executive functions are vested in the General Manager (President-
Directeur Gene'ral) who must be chosen frcm the Government rpnresentatives of
the Board; he is also the Board Chairman. He has adequate authority in all
spheres of railway administration.  Honwever, his reolacement in case of
absence or temporary incapacity is made on an ad hoc basis, and there i9
need for the appointment of a Deputy General Manager.  Agreement on thi-s has
been reached during negotiations.
3.06      There are five departments reporting to the General Munager: General
Studies AcLministr!tion, Finance, Sed Tch4 cal                latter ts reh pone
sible for Operations, Mechanical, and Permanent lWay Divisions.  The internal
organization - the details of which are in Chart I - is adequate.
3.07      There is a shortage of qualified senior staff- to improve the situa-
tion, SNCFT has obtained, under a 1968 contract with Sofrerail, 12 French rail-
way staff of inrte,m.ediate level for a period of tl-ree years. Although helpful
for day-to--day operations, the assistance does not suffice to compensate for
SNCFr's lack of experienced senior staff at managerial level. To correct
this, SNCFI has agreed to the appointment of two high caliber experts,
for a period of two years, who -ili  advise the General Manager. Agreement
should be reached during negotiations on the terms of reference of the experts,
the foreign exchange cost of wnom is included in the proposed loan.and credit.
In additiorn to these experts the project provides for the appointment of consul-
tants3 to ccarr-y out frou  specifiLP-c stu"di-es w.-h"Jh are Cd'iscussed later in tI-1h;is repor-t.
3.08      The General Ivianager has full authority over the railway staff which
he appoints, assigns, promotes and dismisses in accordance with the rule!s and
regulations for personnel and within the budgetary authorizations. At the e:id
of 1967, the total personnel establishment was about 7,850, with a producti-
vity per nmLn employed of about 200,000 traffic units.  These figures colpare
favorably with the performance of many railways over the world.l/
3.09      ';NCFT permanent personnel comprises two categories: established staff
(personnel titulaire) and unestablished staff (personnel auxiliare); the aver-
age remuneration of the latter is about half that of the former. In addi-
tion, there are seasonal workers. The total establishment as of March 31,
1968, was as follows:
1/Traffic LMits are ton-km + pass-km. On the basis of the most recent in-

it has been the policy of SNCFV to transfer old staff from the unestablished
to the established category, so that it can be entitled to pension. At March
31, 1968, unestablished staff on the Northern-Center network accounted for only
9% of total personnel while on the Southern network it totalled 22%. SNCFT
intends to pursue this policy.
3.10      While the salary level has remained generally stable, the policy
mentioned above has affected the average cost per employee, which increased
by some 12% over the last 5 years. Over the same period, total staff cost
(including cotribution for pension) averaged about 55% of working expenses,
which is reasonable.
3.11      Established staff is entitled, at age 60, to a pension serviced by
the Goverrment-owned Caisse Nationale des Retraites; there is also an early
retirement plan, at age 55, for certain categories of established staff.
There are no official pension arrangements for unestablished staff nor for
seasonal workers.

(i) Track
3.13      The Northern Center network is 16522 km long; 478 Ian, or 31% is
standard gauge (1.436m) and 1,044 km, meter gauge (see Map).   The entire system
is single-track except for a 17 km suburban section, Tunis-Hanmam Lif.   In gen-
eral, the terrain presents no difficulties. Curves total 290 km,i bridges 13 km;
and tunnels. 2.4 km. There are about 1,500 level crossings, mostly unprotected.
3.11      The Southern network totals 4'6 Im, all meter gauge and single-track.
It comprises 379 kIm of main lines and 77 km of branch lines to the phosphate
3-15      Track on the Northern-Center network is laid with different types
and weights of rail and largely overaged; ballasting is often inadequate. De-
tails are given in Table 1.  About 65% of rails are at least 50 years cld;l
and 63% of the track is 30 kg/m or less, which is light and limits speeds and
axle=lIoads. S.,hort-g of finan^e and equipr.en.t hn-s resulted in insufiin
maintenance, and sections of the track are worn out. At SNCFT's request, the
con.dition of th=e track was studied in 1966/67 bdy a group of French consultants



- 7 -
(Sofrerail-Setec) who made a systematic survey of the Northern-Center network
and prepared a detailed rehabilitation program. This program, together with
Italconsult's findings, has been used to identify most of the track itemis of
the proposed project described in chapter 4 of this report.
3.16      Track on the Southern system is largely all of the same type and
weight and two-thirds of it have been recentlv relaid. Details are also
given in Table 1. The main line Sfax-Gafsa-Metlaoui is in good condition
and suitab:le for heavy phosphate traffic.  Ramil on the two other mair   lines
(Graiba-Gabes and Metlaoui-Tozeur), although light (25 kg/m) is adequate for
the low traffic carried. Most of the branch lines to thile Mir.es require com-
plete renewal with heavier rail (36 kg/m) to allow for a 16-ton axle load.
3.17      The Statutes of SNCFT provide that track and structures on the
Northern-Center s-ystem remain the propervy of the State and are put at the
disposition of SNCFT. Maintenance and capital expenditure for track incurred
since January 1, 1957, has been shared between State and SNCFT on a 60%--40%
basis. This situation is largely inspired by the French Railways' thesis
which considers that rail users sho-uld not be expected to pay fullly for rail-
way infrastructure, and that tariffs based on total investment cost, including
track, would lead to distortion in favor of the road. According to Ital.con-
sult Transport Survey, road user charges in Tunisia cover almost 80% of what
would be the proper level of expenditures if all the needed constructior. and
maintenance of intercity roads were carried out. Since, in.fact, expend.itures
for road construction and maintenance are lower than the estimated proper
level of needs, it is considered that intercity road users pay their full
share. To establish the basis for fairer road-rail competition the Government
has agreed during negotiations to transfer to SNCFT full ownership of track
and structures (including land) for which maintenance and capital expenditures
will henceforth be charged to SNCFT. SNCFT's Statutes are being amended ac-
cordingly.
3.18      Signalling consists of color lights on the Tunis-Sousse line and of
inadequate mechanical signals on other heavy traffic lines; SNCFT is currently
studying modernization to improve safety. Traffic is controlled by central
telephone dispatch from Tunis. The communication system is unsatisfactory,
mainly because of inadequate maintenance by PTT.  Agreement has been reached
during negotiations that the Government will reauire PTT to maintain the
telephone lines of SNCFT in accordance with sound engineering practices.
(ii) Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.19      SNCFT's motive power and rolling stock at the end of 1967 is de-
tailed in Table 2 which also gives the age of the equipment.

sion of heavier track and reinforcement of bridges, it is planned by SN(FT
that new lo;comoti-ves on tlhe NorUhenI-CenTer network shou-d also be at leas.t
1,400 h.p., allowing for increased train loads and speeds.   Except for ].oco-
motives of 620 h.po purcnased in i950, to be replaced partly under une pro-
posed project, the locomotive fleet is reasonably well maintained.
3.21      Most passenger traffic is carried by railcars and trailers wh.ch
provide adequate service. The railcars average l8 years of age which is
high, and 1their partial replacement, together with part of the trailer fleet,
is urgentlr required and is provided for in the project. More than half of
all passengrer cars are over 50 years of age; 20 cars are currently being
procured frcm West Germany through supplier finance. SNCFT's policy is to
replace passenger trains by railcar services as much as possible - which is
reasonable - and to scrap the old passenger car fleet progressively.
3.22      Over half the total freight car fleet of 5,334 units is more than
50 years old. Most of these cars are of the two-axle type and their ave!rage
capacity, of about 15 tons, is low. Cars over 40 years old, numbering 3,839,
with a total capacity of about 60,000 tons, could be replaced by 2,400 cars
of improve(d design, a reduction of 37%. As a first step, the 640 cars pro-
vided in the projec:t will reDlace some l.hOO old cars.

equipment will be necessary to meet the traffic increases forecast by the
Italconsult Transport Suirvey.  To determnne the technica1 chr-nranteristics
of the equipment required to meet such increases, SNCFT has agreed to ap-
noint consultants (probably Italconsul t) w.ho 1A1  (i) review! the prssent

3.25      CESCFT has two main workshops, one in Tunis with a staff of about
1,000, the other in Sfax with 340 men.  Although the equipment in both shops
is largely obsolete, performance remains generally satisfactory.   The Tunis
workshop serves only the Northern-Center network; the Sfax workshop, which
came with the Southern network. serves the latter. This arrangement mav re-
sult in duplication of specialized staff and spare parts, and it may be tech-
nically and financially advantageous to redistribute work on a fumntional
rather than a geographical basis. SNCFT has agreed to appoint consultants

power is unsatisfactory with low engine-km/engine-day ratio and availability.
The average tuurn-round time of freight cars (l *7 and 7., days ons
and meter gauge respectively) could also be improved. These results are, to
some extent, due to the present poor condtion of the equipment and the track- 
3.27      Thansfer of freight between the two gauges is possible only in Tunis
and La Goulette stations. There is no axle-change installation. Transferred
tor.age is about 30,000 tons per annum. Ailthough two gauges in an integrated
system constitutes a restriction, this does not significantly impair SNCFT's
operations.
3.28      Operational efficiency on the Southern network is good.   In 1966,
availability of locomotives was 90%, with an engine-km/engine-day ratio of 311;
average tonnage hauled per phosphate train was high at 1,185 tons.   Average
turn-round time of freight cars, 3 days, was satisfactory, and it would have
been even better with larger storage facliities for phosphate at the mines
and at the port of Sfax.
3.29      On sane lines traffic is very light and it is not expected to grow
significantly. This is particularly the case for the section between Mateur
and Beja on line 3. During negotiations, the Government and SNCFT have -,
agreed to close the section.
3.30      It is also questionable whether operations on line 15 - from Sousse
to Henchir-Souatir - will be justified in the foreseeable future. In this
connection SIJCFT has agreed to include in the terms of reference of the cost-
ing consultant referred to in para. 3.44, provision far recommendations Dn
the closing of uneconomic lines and for alternative solutions. During nego-
tiations, the Government and SNCFT have also agreed to submit to the Bank
the consultant's findings and recommendations, together witl thei.r own views:
and intentions, and to.seek agreement with the Bank on future operations on
uneconomic lines.

D.  Traffic
(i) Freight
3.31      Table 4 gives freight traffic statistics in tonnages and ton-km
broken dowm by main commodities, over the period 1962-1967.  Between 1962 and
1966, total freight traffic on the Northern-Center network grew from 2.18 mil-
lion tons to 2.77 million tons, an increase of 27%, or 5.4% per annum; ton-km
increased similarly from 404 million to 509 million, the average distance per
ton carried averaging 184 km haul. Iron ore from Tamera and Djerissa and
phosphate from Kaiaa Djerda averaged about 551% of total ton-km.. Becuise_
of crop failure and decrease in mineral production, traffic on the Northern-
Center iletwork dropped in 1967 to;a level comparable to that of 1962/63.

E. Present; Finances
(i) Statutory Regime
3.37      T'he financial relationship between the Government and SNCFT, and
their respective financial responsibilities, are laid do-wn in SNCFT's Statutes
of December 27, 1956. The main features are as follows:
(a) the Government, when imposing general or partial tariff
reductions, is under obligation to compensate SNeFT;
(b)  if, after receipt of above contributions, SNCiuris income
account is still in deficit, the latter is compensated -
after depletion of the reserve fund - by a Government sub-
vention; in case SNCFT's income account shows a surplus,
contributions under (a) above are reduced or cancelled so
as to balance the account; if, after such cancellation,
the income account still shows a surplus, the latter is
to be used (i) to replenish the reserve fund up to 10%
of gross operating revenue, and (ii) to reimburse past
Government subventions. All surplus funds left after
replenislnent of the reserve fund and reimbursement of
subventions go to the Government.
3.38      These provisions are inadequate in that the Government's obligation
to compensate for revenue lost as a result of its action applies only as long
as SNCFT is in deficit. In addition, the above provisions limit funds left
annually to SNUCFT to the armunt of the reserve fund and the annual depreciation
provision.  This would not allow SNCFT to undertake the financing of an :Ln-
vestment program, such as the project, the execution of whic:h is '
be spread over a number of years.
3.39      In practice, the financial provisions of the Statutes have not been
fully implemented. Government compensation for loss of revenue has so far
been granted only for iron ore transport; no specific compensation has been
made, or requested by SNCFT, for passenger traffic where numerous fare reduc-
tions are irmosed by the Government. The total Government contribution to
balance SNOFT's accounts has nevertheless been substantial; it amounts to
D 12.3 million for the period 1957-1967, and represents 20% of total gross
receipts.  Details on the past contributions from users and State are given
in Tahle 6.
3.a40     The mntter was discussed with the Goverrnment and SNCFT who ackrLow-
ledged that the present system did not promote the efficient allocation c,f
transport resources of the coLuntry, and that it cn,Mtituted an inGreaqinp
burden on the general budget.  During negotiations it was agreed that SNCFT's
Statutes will be a.mended on the basi +of the following principles:
(.) tariffs will be assessed ona basis reasonably related
to costs;
(b) tariffs will be adjusted from time to time so as to produce
re-vunues sufficient to cover all operating expenses, includ-
ing depreciation, and to earn an adequate return on the value



- 12 -
of net fixed assets in use;
(c) if, in exceptional circumstances, the Government should
deem it necessary that certain services be provided at
less than official tariffs, the resultant subsidy will
not be a burden on SNCFT but will be paid for by the
Government;
(d)  internally generated funds (net operating revenues plus
depreciation and other provisions) will be maintained by
SNCFT at a level sufficient to (i) meet debt interest and
amortization. (ii) provide adequate working capital,
(iii) establish and retain adequate liquid reserves to
meet accruing liabilities end future contingyencies. and
(iv) cover a material part of the cost of capital invest-
ments. including replareminfts;
(e) no dividends will be distributed before the requ7ir nmpen+t-
under (d) are met;
(f)  as a transitional measure, and until tariffs can be

adjustments, it must decide on the amount of compensation and subvention.
due to SNCFT. Tariff adjustments are by and large made on the bas.is of
what the Government considers traffic can bear. In general, the tariff
structure i.s inadequate and it requires an overa  review by the consul-
tants referred to in paragraph 3.44. Since January 1, 1957, there have
ueenr no uar.i±1 Increases except for the selective increases made on
October 1, 1966, which averaged 30% for passenger and 5% for freight.

On the Northern-Center network average receipts, although increased as a re-
sult of the 1966 tariff adjustments, remain below average costs. This is
particularly evident for passenger traffic, where, because of numerous fare
reductions imposed by the Government, the average receipt does not cover op-
erating expenses excluding depreciation. On the Southern network costs are
covered.  The above figures are tentative and should not be considered as a
suitable basis for tariff adjustments; however, they are indicative of the
present position and underline the need for a fundamental review of the tar-
iff structure.
3.43      The present situation on the Northern-Center network stems from the
Government policy (i) to improve the competitive position of phosphate nCnd
iron ore on the world market, (ii) to keep prices of food products low (main-
ly cereals and flour), and (iii) to promote welfare through reduced fares.
Export prornotion would be better achieved through reduction or cancellation
of ad valorem export duties levied since 1964 on phosphate (10%) and iron ore
(5%) rather than by imposing below cost rates on the railway. This was dis-
cussed during negotiations, and the Government acknowledgt-d'that the-present
system was inadequate, and confirmed that studies were presenrily undertakeft
to review the overall export promotion policy_for minerals.
3.44     'The correct solution would be a cost-based tariff structure.   As
SNCFT's accounting system does not now provide the data for this purpose,
SNCFT has agreed to appoint consultants (probably Sofrerail) who will e;tab-
lish a detailed cost accounting system and recoimmend a structure and levrel
of tariffs which would be such as to nrovide SNCFT with a satisfactory finan-
cial rate of return on its net fixed assets within a reasonable period of time

(iii) Operating Results
3.45     lThe income accounts for the years 1962-1967, as shown in SNCFT's
books are in Table 7.  Although until 1966 contribuitions from the State have
increased steadily, SNCFT's operating ratio has deteriorated from 101% in 1962
to 110% in 1966.  The situation chaneed in 1967 wit.h the take-over of the
Southern network, which is operated at a substantial profit; the 1967 consoli-
dated accounts for both networks show a small pnofit, the first for SNCFTT
since 1960. However, the income accounts in Table 7, which are presented in
accordance with the provisions of SNCFT's present Statutesj do not conform
with generally accepted accounting principles, and they do not reflect the true
earning position of SNCFT. To assess the latter the income ac^ounts have been
adjusted by the exclusion of Government contributions and the inclusion of a
depreciatiron charge more appropriate for the assets in use, as explainecl in
detail in ALnnex 1; the amended results are given in Table 8. It shows an
unsatisfactory position, -th an operatng r         eueriorating frorn 12i-c$ in
1962 to 139% in 1966, then improving substantially to 107% in 1967, largely
because of the take-over of the Southern network, and to a lesser extent,
because of the 1966 tariff increases. In 1967, the rates of return, expressed
as percentage of t1he net fixed assets as valued in Annex 2 and in Table 9,
were -14.3% for the Northern-Center network, 13.8% for the Southern network,
and -2.9% f'or SNCFT. They indicate a fundamental unbalance between the
two networks and an unsatisfactory overall result.
(iv) Financial Position
3.46      SNCFT's balance sheet as of December 31, 1967, as registered in the
books, is summarized in Table 10. The balance sheet does not reflect SN'CFT's
position in that only part of the fixed assets are taken into account
(D 6.2 million net fixed assets as compared with D 21.4 million shown in
Table 9). The balance sheet shows an unsatisfactory current position, at
0.66, and, because of undervaluation of capital, the debt/equity ratio is
55/45. The unsatisfactory current position is mainly due to (i) large
receivables owed by the Government, State-owned companies and the Gafsa
Phosphate Company, and (ii) current debts resulting from treasury advances
and interest accrued thereon, and from payments made by the Government to the
previous railway concessionnaire.
3.47      At the Bank's request the Government, on March 11, 1969, took the
following measures:
(a) Clearing of outstanding current accounts, at December 31,
1968, between the Government, SNCFT, the Gafsa Phosphate
Company, Government-owned companies, and the National
Pension Fund; and
(b)  Incorporation into SNCFT's equity of outstanding treasurv
advances.



In addition the Government agreed during negotiations to also incorporate
into SNOUT's equity (i) the interest accrued on treasury advances, and
(ii) payments made by the Government to the previous railway concessionraire.
Details on the financial measures taken and to be taken by the Government
are given in Annex 3. They will improve SNCFT's current and liquid position
satisfactorily.
(v) Accounting and Audit
3.48      SNCFT's accounts are reasonably well kept, the anomalies described
earlier resulting from inadequate statutory provisions rather than from the
accounting system itself. There are presently no adequate cost accounts; to
correct this, the setting up of a detailed cost accounting system has been
included in the terms of reference of the consultants referred to in
paragraph 3.44.
3.49      Audit of all Government agencies is carried out by financial
comptrollers appointed by the Minister of Finance. All commitments of
expenditures over D 5,000 are subject to the prior approval of the
comptroller appointed to SNCFT. Although this does not result in serious
delays in authorization, the figure is low and the prior apJproval of the
comptroller should be required only for larger commitments, over D 20,000.
Agreement on this has been obtained during negotiations. The comDtroller
reports annually to SNCFT's Board on the balance sheet and related financial
statements. After Board approval. the statements are submitted to the
"Commission de Verification des Comptes," then for final approval to the
Ministers of Public Works and Finance.
3.50      The audit carried out by the financial comptroller is largely
of a budgetary nature; it confirms that expenses have been properly
authorized and that the accounts are presented in accordance with the
Statutes. The audit by the "Commission de Verification des Comptes" is
carried out irregula rly  The abo ve arrangements do not comply w.ith generally
accepted auditing standards, and during negotiations SNCFT has agreed to have
its accounts audited annually, commencing with the fiscal year 1969, by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank, who will report to the
Ministers of Pthblic Whorks and" Finance

4. THE PROJECT
A. The Second Four-Year Plan 1969-1972
4.01      A railway nian - which -'c1-1 be incorporated in the transport sector
of the Government's Second Four-Year Plan 1969/1972 - has been prepared.
It calls for exmenditures of about D 25.3 mlllion Cu7ss 48 rIllion equivalent),
with a foreign exchange component of about US$ 23 million. The railway
plan is of the riaht order of magni+tude in that -t takes into account S"CFT's
financial and technical resources during the plan period. During negotiations
it was agreed that, unless the Bank otherwise agree, and -until the proposed
project is completed, SNCFT shall not undertake any investments other than
those prov ded for under the railway plan.

Although not without merit, proposals under (b) to (f) are considered to be
of lower priority or for items for which adequate justification has not been
adduced at the present time and they have been excluded from the proposed-
project (see Annex L).
B.  Description of the Project
4.03      The project consists of the high priority items of the railway
plan. It anounts to D 15.3 million (US$29.2 million equivalent), with a
foreign exchange component of D 8.9 million (US$17.0 million), or 58% of the
total project cost. The proposed loan/credit will finance the foreign
exchange caoponent, including interest during construction due on the
proposed Bank loan. The project contains only replacement items which are
urgently required and fully justified at the present traffic level.
Additional equipment will be necessary to meet future traffic requirements
and the consulting services provided in the project are intended to identify
the future needs. The list of project items is in Table 11; they are
summarized below anid described in the following paragraphs.

4.04             Track renewal and improvement works take into account tWhe
present poor condition of the track and traffic density. Track will be
renewed, totally or partially, on four main lines and on branch lilnes irl the
Southern mLning area, over a total length of 352 km. Heavier rails, increased
sleeper density, better ballasting and reinforcement of bridges Wili perirat
higher speeds and axle-load, thus improving operating efficiency. Deta-ils
of works to be performed on each line, with expected time schedule, are
given in Table 12.
4.05     Motive power and rolling stock include seven mainline diesel
locomotives (three for standard gauge and four for meter gauge'j oi 1,4'J 1p
to replace 17 diesel locomotives of 620 hp purchased in 1950, which are
uneconomic to maintain and operate; the new, more powerful locomotives will
also make double and triple heading of trains unnecessary. Ten railcars
of 600 hp, of modern design and increased capacity (four for standard gauge
and six for meter gauge) will replace 17 units which must be scrapped; the
five trailers (two for standard gauge and three for meter gauge) will replace
an equivalent number of overaged units. 640 freight cars (all meter gauge)
of improved design and capacity will replace 1,415 cars over 40 years of age.
34 ballast cars are for track works under the project and continuing            :
maintenance requirements.
4.06      Workshop equipment is limited to minimum requirements; more
eauipment will be needed but it cannot be defined until the study of the
workshops, to be undertaken as part of the project, is completed.

4-. J     Tile consulting services are th-iose described in paragraphs 3.07U
(management), 3.23 (motive power and rolling stock), 3.24 (stations), 3.25
(workshops), and 3.414 (costing).  Terms of reference for all studies have been
agreed with SNCFT. Finalization of the contracts is expected soon and
completion of the studies by mid 1970.   it is expected that the consultants'
studies will lead to the identification of a second railway project, the
scope and timing of which will depend upon the performance in the execution
of the present project.
4.08      For the reasons given below the proposed loan includes a provision
for interest, and other financial charges due on the loan during the construc-
tion period of the project:
(a) funds generated by SNCFT during 1969-72 will not be suf-
ficient to finance SlNCFT's share of the project and
simultaneously pay interest on the proposed loan;
(b) although SNCFT will progressively profit from cost reductions,
the benefits resulting from the project will nevertheless
not be fully felt until 1973;
(c)  substantial pavments of Tunisia's foreigan debt fall due
during 1969-72; postponement until 1973 of interest pay-
ments on the nronosed loan will help spreading the burden.

4.L0      Cost estumcates of the foreign exchiange elerments of the project
are based on the most recent quotations obtained under international
comipetitive bidding for similar items financed by the Bank uroup.  The
provision for motive power and rolling stock includes an allowance ranging
from 5  to 10% for spare parts. Although there is presently no indication
that world prices for steel - the main component in the project items -
would increase, such possiDility should not be ruled out because of
the continuous increasing cost of labor in industrialized countries. An
overall contingency allowance of 5% has been added to the foreign exchange
estimated cost of the project, and consequently to the proposed loan/credit.
Estimates for local works are based on actual costs for similar works
recently carried out by SNCFT; ad valorem custom duties are those presently
applied. A 5% contingency has been allowed for works payable in local

4.12       Under the present SNCFT regulations bids over D 50,000 must be
approved successively by SNCFT's Board, a special Award Board for railway
contracts and the National Board of Award. The average delay for final
approval is about six months which hinders seriously managerial action.
During negotiations ageement was reached on simplified procedures, namely:
(a)  Contracts up to D 100,000 will be entered into by the
General Manager, without prior approval from SNCFT Board,
or Government.
(b)  Contracts over D 100,000 will be approved by SNCFT Board,
after consultation with a Railway Award Committee.
4.13       The project is expected to start by mid-1969 and its completion
is forecast for theern of 1972. All the foreign exchange items are ex-
pected to be imported in 1969/71, with the proposed credit funds fully
disbursed in 1970 and the proposed loan funds fully disbursed in 1971,

5. FUTURE TRAFFIC, EARFNINGS AND FINANCES
A. Future Traffic
5.01       Traffic prospects for SNCFT are good. A study made by Italconsul.t,
as part of the Tunisian Transport Survey. shnws tht. rnil +.trffic is ex-
pected to increase steadily, although unevenly, for all categories of pas-
sengers and goods. Details of traffic forecasts for the period 1968=1975 are
in Tables 13 and 14; an analysis per category of traffic and groups of coin-
modities is given in Annex C; it+ takee irt a    "ccoA+ +h-"- devlopen -of a mr,ore
competitive transport sector. The summary of traffic trends shown in TabLe 15
indicates that the actu.al 1966-1967 and expeted 196Q-1975 average anual
increases are 6% on the Northern-Center network, 11% on the Southern network,
with An over-ll weighted 8% for SNOFT    These averages are considered to b)e
realistic.
5.02       Phosphate traffic projections on the Southern network are based on
the assumption t.ht thQ C-afsa=G-abes railway 'lr.ei d,nheand the port of Gabes wiuL
be operative by 1973. From 1973 on, phosphate traffic has been apportioned
be+tween the 'fx and G-abes routes; ,.7 fL.L±ion twnS (3.0 million tons for
export; 0.7 million tons for the fertilizer plants) are expected to be carried
on t.he existing Sfax route and the remainder, about 2 million tons, on the
new Gabes rouite.  This distribution is consistent with the Government intention)

Sf,ax. TYwevr, itV rmay be that continued export through Sfax will prove un-
economic, anci in this event it is understood that the Bank and the Government
will review the situation.
B. ruture Operating Results
5.-03      A detailecl operating income and expenditure forecast 1968-1975 is
given in Table 16. The revenue forecast is based on the traffic forecast



- l1 -
using present tariffs; the forecast expenditures take into account the cost
of movina the -row.i.n  traffic expected over the period. Notes on t.i-ir compi-
lation are in Annex 6. Gross operating revenue is expected to rise from
D 9.c mnilion in 1968 +o D 1 1 rnlion 4,- 1 07e  , -        of 59A  wi t]e
operating expenses, including a provision for depreciation, would increase
from D 9.6 milI';on. in 1968 to D 12.e million i17   an icrease OI 31A.
5.04       Depreciation. although Talhul-ated at the hich figu"re of 175 of
gross operating revenue, remains nevertheless low (2.0O) - 2.5-;) <when compared
with gross fixed assets as tentatively valued by the Bank.  It may wiell be
that part of the fixed assets should be wxritten-off and that the value of
gross depreciable fixed assets will be lower than the figures arrived at in
Table 9. A detailed valuation of SiNGFT's fixed assets is included in
the terms of reference of the costing consultants referred to in para. 3.i4.,
and agreerment has been reached during negotiations that SNCFT will provide
for depreciation allowances, from 1971 on, based on replacement value of all
depreciable fixed assets and their useful life calculated in accordance with
sound accouniting principles.

The operating ratio which was 107% in 1967 is expected to improve to 87% in
1972, at the end of the project period, and to 83% in 1975.  However, as
shown in Table 16, improvement of SNCFT's operating ratio is due to the
Southern network  the Northearn-C-Gnter netw.^.ork continlinrg to operate at a
deficit.  ThLs indicates that, on the basis of present tariffs, phosphate
from the South would continiue subsidizi1g other traffic, -d in -rtic- -ar
passenger traffic, on the Northern-Center network. Measures to correct the
situation are discussed in para. 5.07.
5.06       The interes~ coverage ratio would improve progressively to 13.3
times in 1972, and decrease to about 4.0 times thereafter when interest on the

improve to 7.7 times in 1972, and decrese to about 4.5 times thereafter when

5.07       The expected rates of return on the average net fixed assets given

While, on the basis of present tariffs, SWICFT's rate of return is expected
to improve steadily, and reach an overall satisfactory level by 1975, the
rate of return on the Northern-Center network remains negative. It has been
agreed durirg negotiations that the rates of return on both networks will. be
progressively balanced, with SNCFT yielding by 1971 a rate of return of not
less than 4%,, and by 1973 - when the full benefits of the project will be
felt - a rate of retturn of not less than 7% on the net fixed assets in use.
It has also been agreed that the rate should improve further in subsequent
years.  The financial tAr Ats for 1971 and 1973 will be calculated on the
new valuation of the fixed assets arrived at by the costing consultant,
in agreement with SNGFT. The target for 1971 woul-d require only an overall
tariff increase of about 1.5%. However, to attain a better balance between

5.08       During negotiations confirmation was obtained that, subject to
approval by the "Commission d'Approbation des Investissements"t, net operating
revenues - if reinvested n Tuir.sia - are exempted from income tax. Since
SNCFT's revenues will be fully used to finance part of the railway plan,

C.  Project Financing and Proposed Bank Loan and IDA Credit
5.09       The foreign exchange element of the project cost is estimated at
D 8,925,000 (US$17,000,000 equivalent), or 58% of the total project cost.  It
is proposed that the project be financed by a Bank loan and an IDA credit of
US$8.5 million each.  SNGFT does not benefit from exemption and
custom duties to be levled on the project import components are included in
the project local cost. They are estimated at D 2,170,000. The Governmint
has agreed during negotiations that the custom duties will be reinvested in
the project through capital contribution to SNCFT's equity. The balance of
the project cost, D 4,250,000, will be financed by SNCFT's own funds.  The
financing plan of the project would thus be as follows:

5.10       The proposed Bank loan would be made to SNGFT which has the right
to borrow, Subject to Government approval. A term of 25 years, including
a 4-year period of grace, would be appropriate. The proposed term is related
to the expected average economic life of the Droject items. estimated at about
27 years. T'he proposed IDA credit would be made to the Government who would
relend the troceeds to SNGWP on the terms and conditions of the proposed Bank
loan. Durirng negotiations agreement has been reached on a subsidiary loan

included in the railway- plan 1969-72, ad  in particular for the construction
of the new railway line Gafsa-Gabes, at an estimated total cost of D 6 million.
Whnile the Gcovernment has decided on the construction of the 'lne dUr--ing the
project period, no arrangements have so far been made for its financing and,
although a Government participation shouid not be ruled out, the cash flow
assumes that the full cost of the construction would be borne by SNCFT. In
any event, it has been agreed during negotiations that, during the project
period 1969-72, investments outside the project, to be fully financed by
SNCFT's own funds, shall not exceed D 6 million.

5.13      Cash availability, although generally satisfactory, is expected
to lower towards the end of the project period. Therefore it is possible that
during the proiect period Si}GFT will need financial assistance outside the
Government contributions referred to in para. 5.11. It has been agreed.
during negotiationa that; should the need for some asistanrse arise; the
Government will provide SNCFT with funds on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the BLank.
5.1h      If traffic and revenue levelop a.n as ePectpd. a quhqtantial cash
surplus should accumulate from 1973 on. Part of the surplus is expected to
finanGe a nortion of the capital inveAtmPnts which will he rmnirpwd to cone
with the expected increases in traffic.
E. Forecast Balance Sheets
5.15      The pro-forma balance sheet position, 1968-1975, is given in
Table 18 and the r8+n for 1968R 1972 and 1975 are smm.arized below:
(D 000)
1968          1972          1975
Net Current Assets         1,3h5          2,46h        10,h03
Net Fixed Assets          22,uLl         39,665        35,-82
Total     23,756        L2,129         h5,685
Debt                       4,273        12,723        11,1h6
Equity                    19,483        29,406         3j439
Total     23,756        12,129         45,685
Although debt is expected to increase from D 4.3 million in 1968 to D 12.7
million in 1972, an increase of about 300,, the debt/equity ratio will not
exceed 30/70 which is satisfactory. Details on debt service over the period
1968-1979 are given in Table 19. During the project period the current ratio
would vary between 2.0 and 3.0 and the liquid ratio between 0.7 and 1.7. The
latter may result in inadequate working capital and, as explained in para.
5.13, may require Government assistance.
6. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
6.01      A major objective of the proposed project is to reduce the costs
of handling traffic at existing levels of output on SNCFT. A small, but
incidental, increase in the total capacity of the system will result, how-
ever, from the improved track conditions, more powerful motive power and
newfer rolling stock as well as from the improvements in managerial and
general operating efficiency envisaged under the project.   For reasons
explained in para. 3.23 the focus of the project has been limited to
existing requirements and not future needs.
6.02      I'he major elements of the project are highly integrated, with
slightly over one-half of tlhe total cost being for track improvements and
one-third for more powerful locomotives and new rolling stock. Accordingly



the method of analysis used was that of comparing the totals of the various
elements of costs - operating, maintenance, and overhead - wizth and withDut
the project.  Because particular parts of the project consist of items with
unequal economic lives (such as track improvements and locomotives), the
benefits were evaluated on the basis of the shorter-life item and appropriate
adjustments made for the residual value of the longer-life item.
6.03      The main measurable benefits of the project stem from: (a) a reduc-
tion in the cost of maintaining track, locomotives, and rolling stock: (b)
savings in traction costs; (c) savings resulting from a general increase in
operating efficiency over the entire railway system through a better uti-
lization of equipment - e.g. decreased turn-around time and less deadweiight
of freight cars hauled; and (d) passenger time savings. The benefits under
these headings were initially estimated by Italconsult as part of the recent
Transport Survey and subsequently reviewed and revised by SMCFT and in tie
Bank.
6.o0      On this basis, the principal elements in the project were evaluated
separately, i.e. line by line including track; motive nower and rolling stock
(see Annex'7).  The economic returns for the four lines in the iNorthern-
Center network are as follows:
Tine I Ai
L ne 5            12,
Tine 6     
Line TA           13,'
A sample of the costs/benefits analysis for Line 6 is given in Table 20.
6 o5      In view of the high degree of interdependence of track renewal and
motive nower and equipment renewa1 on these four lines, each can be cons:i'ered
as a sub-project of a larger one for which the overall rate of return is
slightlv over 12,3.
6.o6      TI the . Souther.n region, t.he project provides for co.mlete renewal
of 49 km of track for the branch lines serving the phosphate mining industry.
The total 1eng+'h of the branch lines is 77 km of whiJch 28 k, have already,
been renewed and upgraded. The renovated lines have a capacity of 36 kg,/m
versus 25 kg/yn on the remaining lines.  GiMven the present and prospectivt,
levels of phosphate traffic, these lines would have to be replaced about
once ere-. t.hree y-ears unless +..r   capaclUy A. upgradeUU UV _ lg/mL. 
their complete renew¢al and improvement as provided for in the present project
would result in considerable saWvinrgs in recurrent capital out'lys estira-ted
at D 250,000 annually over a period of 30 years, as well as some possible
reduction in normal maintCenance cost.  Onu thU basis of estimated -sviJgs in
recurrent capital outlays alone, the benefits from this investment would

yil  a rate ofl re- iL%  ,   taus,  about 2/J.
6.07      Th^.e proj`ect will have obher benefits to the national econoxmy and
which will accrue to railway users in the first instance rather than to
SNCFT . LTese are impvuved quality of service in terms of frequency,
regularity and reliability, less damage to goods, etc. The value of these



- 26 -
additional benefits, however, has not been quantified.   To this extent,
therefore, the above estimated rates of return understate the full economic
benefits of the proposed project which is economically justified.
7.  RECOPMENDATIONS

financial measures, be made conditions of signing of the proposed loan and
credit.
7.03    The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank- loan and an IDA
credit of US$18.5 riillion equivalent each. Thae proposed loan would be made
to SNCFT with a term of 25 years, including 4 years of grace.   The proposed
credit tiould be made to the Government of Tunisia and relent to SNCFI on
the terms and conditions of the proposed Bank loan.

Tentative Evaluation of SNCFT's Fixed Assets as of
December 31, 1967
Northern-Center Network
In accordance with SNCFT's present Statutes, fixed assets
on the Northern-Center netwgork taken over from the Government on
January 1, 1957, have been evaluated nominally at D 3.0 million
for the purposes of the opening balance sheet. The initial
contribution of the Government to SNCFT's equity was assumed to
be the same amount. Although the Statutes provide for the
revaluation of the initial fixed assets within a given period of
time, this has not been finalized so far. A tentative evaluation
of gross and net fixed assets, as of December 31, 1967, has been
made in the Bank; it includes all track works - the ownership of
which is to be transferred to SNCFT - as well as acquisitions made
by SNCFT since January 1, 1957.  The evaluation is based on present
replacement costs to which annual depreciation allowances, calculated
on generally accepted percentages, have been applied.  The results are
in Table 10.
Southern Network
The Agreements between the State and the Gafsa Phosphate
Comnanr provide that- at the end of' the Goneession for thp onpration
of the Southern railway system, the surrender value of part of the
f'ix  assets w-ill be reimbu,rsed hyr the State±. to~- t-he co.mpn.  The
inventory of these assets has been made and the Government and the
companmr hauv areed on a sett.1 rnent o'f ) 2.8 millionn  Sinee this
surrencler value covers only part of the fixed assets, it cannot be

Reasons for ELimination from the Proposed Project
of the Following Four-Year PDr tan
1. Construction of the Gafsa-Gabes Line
(a) Phosphate output from Southern Tunisia is presently about
3.4 million tons per annum. About 2.7 .,mLillion tons are exported througa
the port of Sfax and 700,000 tons are used by fertilizer plants instalLad
at Sf ax.
(b)  The present maximum capacity of the Gafsa-Sfiax railway
line is about 5 million tons of phosphate per annur; the present
phosphate exporting capacity of the port of Sfax is estimiated by
Italconsult at 3.6 million tons a year. With rclatively minor
investments the capacity of the railway line could be increased to
8 million tons a year, t'hat of the port of Sf a, to 7 mi:Llion tons.
(c) The Government long-range plans provide for substantial
increases of t'he phosphate production of Southern Tunisia; the latest
figures available are:
1972:   5 million tons
1975: 6-8   "i
1980: 18     1      1
This would require improving extractive techniques in the existing mines
and opening new mines which would be operative from 1970 on; the
estimated cost would be at least US$ 100 million equivalent.  The
Government expects to obtain financing through barter arrangements drith
East European countries. Negotiations with Bulgaria for a US$ 30 m:illion
financi ng are reported to be cormpleted; ne,otiat,,ions with other countries
are at various stages of progress.
(d) Since the Government long-range forecasts for phosphate
product;ion go substantially beyond the capacity of the Gafsa-Sfax line
and the port o.' Sfax, the Government wants to keep investments for t1;ese
facilities to a minimum. Instead it has decided on the construction of
a deep water port at Gabes and the construction of a new railway link
between Gafsa-PI'Dilla and Gabes (see Map). The cost of Gabes port i.s
estimated at about US$ 16 million equivalent, of which about 80% wi]l
be financed through Italian bilateral aid; constructicn is expected
to start, by early 1969 and to be completed by 1972. Simultaneously
with the construction of the port the Government intends to build at
Gabes a nower station and a chemical complex (Industries Chimiques
Maglarebines) which would utilize part of the phosphatue produced in the
South. The construction of the Gafsa-Gabes railwav line of about llhC 1Ti
is estimated at D 6 rmllion (US$ 11.4 million equivalent); it is alsc
schedled for cornpletion hy 1Q72.

(e)  The Government has recently submitted to UNDP a request
for a long-range study of tihe phosphate problem in Southern Tunisia.
The study will assess whether (i) extractive teclmiques and productivity
of the mines could sufficiently be improved to reduce costs.  (ii) the
quality of phosphate could be improved, possibly by calcination, at a
cost which keeps it; worldwide competitive; and (iii) market nronnPetf
would allow Tunisia to increase substantially its share. The study should
then make recommendations as to whether Tunisia shouldi pursue its nresent
policy towards increasing production and quality, or review its targets.
(f) Because of the many uncertainties involved it is preferable
to postpone consideration of possible Bank participation in the financing
of the investment (mines, railwiay, port) until more data is available.
Therefore, the rGafsa-Gabes railway line has been excluded from the
proposed project.

1.        Main line passengers are expected to increase fro- 1--4 .2 rllion
in 1966 to 7.1 million in 1975, while pass-km grow from 348 million to
574 million, an increase of 65%, or 7% per annum. T-he a-verage dlstance
travelled per passenger is expected to increase slightly from 82 km to
90 km. The projected 7% grawth is somewhat higher than the 'O average
annual growth for the period 1962-66 because of the continuous, although
slow, increase of GNP.
2.        Commuter passengers on the Tunis-Hammnan-ULif suburban line are
expected. to increase from 10.5 million in 1966 to 20.4 million in 1975,
with pass-km increasing from 136 million to Y65 million. The projected
growth is 11% per annum as compared with 9% during 1962-66. The high
average annual increase results from the expected development of servicd
activities in Tunis.
3.        The average annual growth of all passenger traffic on the Nlorth-
ern-Center network is expected to be 8%o per annum as compared with 77 dur-
ing 1962-66.
Freight
Prospects for iron ore are not encouraging and rail traffic for
this commodity is not expected to increase substantially. An increasing
portion of the output is expected to be utilized locally, at the El Fouladh
steelworks and the cement plants, while exports would remain practically a.4
the same level. The expected traffic growth over the period 1966-75 is 1%
per annium.
5.        Phosphate output from Kalaa Djerda is expected to increase from
25?.000 tons in 1966 to 360.000 tons in 1975. with ton-km increasing from
63 million to 86 million, an average annual increase of 4%. The pro;!ec-

Notes on Forecast Operating Income and apenditure Table 18)
A. Income
1.        Revenue! from passengers has been calculated on the basis of the
1967 average receipts per pass-km for each category of traffic (Northern-
Center main lines, Tunis-Hamman-Lif commuter line, Southern main lines).
2.        The same rule has been applied to compute revenue from each
category of freight on the Northern-Center network (iron ore, phosphate,
"other" goods). For phosphate on the Southern main line M'etlaoui-Gafsa-
Sfax the new tariff imposed by the Government since January 1, 1968 has
been applied.   (El 1 per ton up to 3 million tons, D 0.9 per ton for ton-
nages in excess of 3 million). The same rate prorated on a distance basis,
has been applied for phosphate to be hauled, from 1973 on. on the new Gaf-
sa-Gabes line.
3.        Other traffic revenue (mail, parcels, LCL, etc.) has been esti-
mated at D 350,000 per year; non-traffic revenue at D 100,000 per annum.
14.       Tax on gross revenue has been deducted from income; the presen'
5.5% rate has been applied.
B.  Exenditure
5.        Operating expenses for passengers and freight on the Norther:n-
Center network have been calculated on the basis of the amended 1966
income account figures shown in Table 8. (Because of substantial de-
crease in t.raffic in 1967, traffic unit costs for that yrear are higher
than normal; therefore, they have not been used as reference for future
cost projections).  After elimrination of epenses relating to "other"
traffic and non-traffic activities, total operating expenses have been ap-
nlied 45% to passenger traffic anrd  5% to freight traffic 1/.  In 1066,
variable costs on the Northern-Center network amounted to ET% of total
passenger costs and 38% of total freight costs 1/. These percentages     av
been applied through the period 1968-75 to assess the expected cost per
pass-km and ton-a..
TMe-se percentages result fCro.   a costu stuu-.iy made by Ialconsult as
part of the Tunisian Transport Survey.

6.        Since no detailed cost information is available for the Southern
networK, future costs on this system have been based on the 1967 amended
income accounts shown in Table B, with variable costs estimated at 40%;
this is a generally accepted percentage for most railways.
7.  As stated ea.'-er, theovalu2t50n of gross and net fixed assets
has not been completed, and the final results may deviate from the tentative
vaLuation made in the Barnk.  For this reason, it is difficult to relate, in
terms of percentage, depreciation to gross fixed assets. Instead, annual
depreciation allowances for tLhe period 1068-75 have been est.imated at 17%
of the gross operating revenue of each year.
8.        Interest takes into account financial charges on existing loans,
the details of which exe in Table 19. In addition, it includes the financial
charges of the proposed Bank loan, except for interest during the project
construction period 1969-72 which has been capitalized.  The proposed Bank
loan has been assumed at 614 interest per annum with a term of 25 years
including a 4- year period of grace.  Ihe proposed ITD  Credit has been
assumed to be relen-t by the Government to SNCFT at the same terms and
conditions.

in 1966 was estimated at D 600,000, or D 400 per km. Based on engineering
a~s.esnents, an in'tial anrual average maintenance cost of D 200 per km for
new track has been assumed as a reasonable estimate. This figure would in-
crease over 5-year iLtervals to reach D 1400 at the end of L 40 years, the
average life expectancy of the rails.  Given the advanced age of existing
lines (over 40 years), and assuming that in -he absence of renewal proposed
in the project they would continue in use up to 60 years, successive main-
tenance cost increases during the years 140 to au ha-ve been estirmated at an
annual rate of 2-2.5%. Thus, savings in track maintenance costs have been
estimated for each line to be renewed, considering its age and com,lparing
the projected maintenance costs with and without the investment in reneiwal.
To these annual savings was added a further reduction in annual maint.enance
cost estimated for each year at 1% of the investment in renewal and upgrading
of structures, to be performed concurrently with the work on the track   quip--
ment. The annual sum of these two elements thus represents the expectedi bene-
fit stream stemming from the investment in track renewal.
Economies on Maintenance of Rolling Stock and Motive Power
a) Locomotives
2.        The annual maintenance cost of locomotives was estimated at D 6155CC)0
or an overall average of D 10,000 for each of the 63 existing units. For each
new locomotive the estimated average saving in maintenance cost is D 6,ooo
per annum. But since each new locomotive will provide enough traction capacity
to replace about Eke of the existing locomotives, the "avoidable cost" of mai.n-
taining the replaced locomotives is also added to the initial savings in nzan-
tenance cost.  The distribution of these total savings per line was estimatea
separately for the standard gauge and the meter-gauge networks, on the basis
of gross ton-km hauled (GTKH).
b) Railcars
3.        The annual maintenance cost of railcars is about D 460,000 or an
overall average of D 9,700 for each of the 47 existing units, and D 75,000
for trailers, or about D 2,000 per unit.
4.        For each new railcar  the estimated average annual saving is D 4,500.
To t+h.i- i9 Adedp the "avoidable maintenance cost" resulting from the replace
ment of 17 old units by 10 new units. For new trailers, the annual savingil in
ra nter.ancn e-cos. was estimated at an average of D 800 per unit.  Distribut:iin
of savings by line was a]so made on the GTKH basis, for DtandaId gauge and
mrter gauge separately.

c) Freight Cars
5.        "MTe annual cost of freight cars maintenance is D 340,000 for
3,476 cars on the MIorthern-Central network, or about D 97 per unit.
6.        Based on engineering analysis, an initial maintenance cost of
D h7 per new wagon has been estimated.  This cost would increase over 5-year
intervals to D 97 at the end of 40 years. Between the age of 40 and 60 yearst
successiir  maintencnce cost wonild increase at 2-2.50 n.a. and level off be-
yond 60 years.
7.        Since new cars will have a greater capacity than the existing units.
the nnmhbr of new ivnnS ,-ireivi-rei for n aiven volrlme of traff_c will be less.
This would result in additional savings equivalent to D 97 of avoidable main-
terarce Ct perut, applied to the 94ifp"ence in the i      n^m.r  uf units re-
quired to meet present traffic.  This additional saving of D 97 per "unlt

rasdual values were es"-LaetJ  as of t hte en' of the .jt5Ih year on t1h Ua;;-. U.
historical cost minus depreciation.  The residual values were thus treated
as a `negatlve cost" in computing the intermad- rate of ret-uri.
Savings in Operating Costs and Overhead
9.        rne average cost per GT.i of freight trains was estimated at
D 0.001, which is equivalent to the saving per GTKH empty wreight arising7
from the reduced number of cars required for present traffic.   Lhis saving
stems from the smaller tare weight of new cars with a greater net capacity.
10.       Additional savings in general operating and overhead costs result-
ing from the overall increased operating efficiency of the railway system,
and attributable to the combined investment in the various elements of the
project have been estimated at about D 241,000 for the year 1970, or 28-- of
estimated overhead cost. About 1h% of these savings represent reductions
in overhead costs attributable to passenger services, the balance of 869
being equally divided between similar cost reductions attributable to freight
services and to general adiministrative expenses.
Passenger Time Savings
