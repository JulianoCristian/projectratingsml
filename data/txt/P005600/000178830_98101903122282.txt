REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SOCIETE NATIONALE DES CHERMINS DE FER TUNISIENS WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA AND A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
GOVEXNMENT OF TUNISIA, FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan and a proposed credit both in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to $8.5 million, making a total of $17 million.
The loan would be made to Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Tunisiens (SNCFT) with the Guarantee of the Republic of Tunisia; the
credit would be made to the Republic of Tunisia and its proceeds
would be relent to SNCFT for the rehabilitation and modernization of
the Tunisian railwzays.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank's operations in the transport sector started with
a port loan made in 1964 in the amount of US $7.0 million, followed four
years later by a second port loan armunting to US $8.5 million. In
August 1967, the Government of Tunisia and SNCFT approached the Bank
group for assistance in financing a railway rehabilitation and moderni-
zation project which was then in preparation as part of the Government's
Second Four-Year Plan, 1969-1972. The project conforms with the
findings and recommendations of the Tunisian Transport Survey financed
by UNDP and carried out by Italconsult in 1967/1968. The Bank was the
Executing Agency. Appraisal of the project was completed in October
1968.
3.        Negotiations for the IDA credit and the Bank loan took place
in Washington on March 17-28, 1969. The Government of Tunisia was
represented by Messrs. Moncef Belhadj Amor, Director of the Budget;
Abdelhakim Slama, President-Director General of SNCFT; Tahar Ayadi,
Financial Manager of SNCFT; and Taoufik Ladjimi of the Public Works
Ministry.
Bank, IDA and IFC Operations
4.        The proposed credit, the fourth for Tunisia, would increase
IDA's total lending to Tunisia to $32.4 million; the proposed loan,
the seventh for Tunisia, would increase the Bank's total lending to
Tunisia to $66 million.  Following is a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits to Tunisia as of March 31, 1969.

5.        The slow disbursement of the cooperative farm loan and credit
reflects the organizational difficulties encountered in the execution of
the project. The Bank and IDA are keeping close watch on the progress of
the project and are working with the Government of Tunisia to accelerate
the pace of execution.

6.        In May 1966, IFC made an investment of D300,000 (about
$575,ooo) in Societ6 Nationale d9Investissement. In addition to this,
IFC has invested $1.5 million and lent $2.0 million to NPK-Engrais, a
phosphate fertilizer company.
7.        An $800,000 highway engineering project and a $150,000 tech-
nical assistance grant for a 'Plater Master Plan Study are expected to be
submitted to the Executive Directors shortly.

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.      A report entitled "Appraisal of a Railway Project" dated
April 11, 1969 (PTR-6) on the proposed project is attached hereto.
9.      The railway network consists of 478 Km. of standard gauge
and 1,500 Km. of meter gauge track. Railroad traffic in 1966 was 1.3
billion ton/Km. *and 0.5 billion pass./Km. while road traffic was 0.9
billion ton/Km. and 1.0 billion pass./Km. Rail traffic has been
growing steadily over the last decade and is expected to continue to
increase at 8 percent per annum on the average. Freight traffic is
largely in bulk (phosphate and iron ore) and suited for rail transport.
10.     The proposed project consists of track renewal for the northern-
center network and branch lines in the mining district, the replacement
of diesel locomotives, railcars, trailers and freight cars, track main-
tenance equipment, workshop equipment and consulting services. These
items are urgently needed to meet present traffic levels efficiently.
The consulting studies are expected to lead to the identification of
a second railway project.
11.     TThile the project is being executed, consultants will assist
SNCFT (a) to set up a traffic cost accounting system and to work out a
schedule of tariffs related to the cost of providing services (b) to
review the conditions of rolling stock and maintenance and repair
facilities (c) to improve its overall efficiency and (d) to study
the modernization of main stations. It is proposed that related expenses
incurred since April 1, 1969, with a maximum of $100,000 be reimbursed
from the Credit Account.
12.     The cost of the project includes $25.8 million for purchase
of equipment and track works, $0.7 million for consulting services and
$1.3 million for contingencies. The foreign component of this cost
is $15.6 million to which has been added interest on the Bank loan
during construction of $1.4 million making a total foreign exchange
requirement of $17 million. cNCFT will finance the local currency



cost of the project out of its own cash generation except for an amount
equivalent to the customs duties on the items included in the projectf.
This amount will be invested in the project through a government contri-
bution to SNCFT's capital.
13.     SNCFT would be required to reach a financial rate of return of
at least 4 percent in 1971 and 7 percent in 1973 and thereafter on net
fixed assets in use. Furthermore, the existing imbalance between the
rates of return on the northern-center and southern networks is expected
to decrease with the progressive implementation of the proposed cost-
based tariffs. The economic rate of return of the project is about
12 percent.
14.     Procurement for the project will be made in accordance with
Bank and IDA international bidding procedure except for about $300,000 of
special fastenings for concrete sleepers which would be bought directly
from the patentholder for reasons of standardization of the track mainte-
nance. As in previous loans domestic suppliers would be accorded a
preference of 15 percent or the import duty, whichever is lower. However,
this provision is likely to be inoperative since there is little dormestir
production of items included in the project.
15.     The proposed loan and credit would be signed only after (i)
the agreed new statutes of SNCFT have been submitted to the Tunisian
National Assembly, and (ii) agreed financial measures have been completed.
Fulfillment of these conditions of signing is expected shortly.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe Nationale
des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the draft Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of Tunisia and the Association, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section L (iii) of the Bank's
Articles of Agreement, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asso-
ciation, the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan and the
text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.     The draft Loan, Guarantee and Development Credit Agreements
conform substantially to the pattern of agreements for railway projects.
I would call your attention to the following features:
(i) Both the Loan and Development Credit Agreements have
identical provisions with respect to the allocation of
the proceeds of the total financing to be provided by
the Bank and the Association for the Project (Schedule 1
of both Agreements);



- 6 -
(ii) Except for that portion of the Loan which will finance
a part of the interest and other charges on the Loan,
the proceeds of the Loan uill not be disbursed until
the amount of the Development Credit has been fully
withdrawfn or conmmitted (Section 2.03 of the Loan Agree-
ment and above-m,(.nticned Schedule 1).
IL8.      The Loan, Guarantee and Credit Agreements will be subject to
ratification by Tunisia's Nat4onal Assembly.
PA'PT V - THE ECONOJVY
19.       The last economic report, "Curre~nt Economic Position and
Prospects ot Tunisia" (VII.-3a), dated Mlarch 19, 1968, was circulated
to the Executive Directcrs on April ], 1963.  A "Memorandum on Current
Economic Developments" (EN@-8) is being distributed separately. No
change in the Bank's earlier conclusion as to Tunisials creditworthiness
is suggested at this time. In view of the continuing high ratio of debt
service charges to current foreign exchange earnings, amounting to about
25 percent in 1968, and in the light of Tunisia's undertakings to the
Bank on economic policy and its overall record of groiwth, Tunisia is
considered as remaining eligible for a blend of IDA credits and Bank
loans. This is in conformity with the consensus reached at the May 1968
meeting of the Consultative Group for Tunisia.
PART VI - COMPLIAJC?E WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEiMENT
20O.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply
with the Articles of the Bank and the Association respectively.
Robert S. NIcNamara
President
