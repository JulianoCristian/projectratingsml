1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
Pakistan is making steady progress towards the health related Millennium Development Goals.  
But its rate of progress remains slow relative to its GNP per capita of US $ 652 and lags behind 
its South Asian neighbors in terms of fertility, maternal health and child mortality outcomes with 
relatively high infant mortality rate of 77/1000 live births and fertility rate of 4.8 children per 
woman. Pakistan needs to increase the coverage of essential public health services to improve 
health outcomes which will remain an obstacle to its economic growth and high levels of 
poverty. The Government of Pakistan is cognizant of the above challenges and is implementing a 
medium-
term human development strategy, outlined in GOP’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
and Medium Term Development Framework, which aims to increase public investment in the 
health sector. The strategy focuses on strengthening the health systems by improving quality of 
care in partnership with the private sector with a focus on the marginalized population. In 
addition, it is addressing governance issues by improving accountability at the local level 
through the devolution of administrative and financial powers to the district governments.
 
Polio Eradication Initiative: 
The project
 
is part of the WHO-launched Global Polio Eradication 
Initiative (GPEI).  The largest international public health initiative has been successful in 
eliminating Polio from all but 6 countries (Pakistan, India, Niger, Afghanistan, Egypt and 
Nigeria) with reducing polio cases globally by more than 99%, to about 1265 cases in 2004 Polio 
eradication remains a global priority because a single infected child puts all the world’s children 
at risk of contracting the disease.    
 
Pakistan has made tremendous efforts and made significant progress in its efforts to eradicate 
Polio since 1997. The numbers of confirmed Polio cases have decreased substantially from 
around 1147 in 1997 to 53 in 2004.  In 2005, 12 Polio cases have been reported. The technical 
Page  2
partners (WHO and UNICEF) assessment is that Pakistan is likely to interrupt transmission of 
Polio by the end of 2005. Pakistan will need to continue SIAs for another three years following 
the last confirmed case of polio till the country is certified Polio free.   
 
2. Objectives 
 
The project will assist Pakistan’s effort to eradicate polio through supply of the oral polio 
vaccine (OPV), needed during 2006-07, for the country's supplementary immunization activities. 
The objective of the proposed credit is consistent with the original project development 
objective. The primary targeted group for the proposed project is Pakistan’s under five children.  
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
IDA has supported Polio Eradication since 2003 through the Partnership for Polio Eradication 
Project. The project has contributed significantly to GOP’s efforts
,
by 
ensur
ing
 regular and 
timely supply of OPV for SIAs and 
achieving 
high coverage (average coverage of 97%) of 
targeted population during SIAs in 2004 and 2005.  Polio eradication is at a critical stage in 
Pakistan and sustaining the eradication effort is important not just for Pakistan but also for 
the 
world
.
As it is a global priority, it is largely financed by the Development Partners, who are 
now counting on the Bank's contribution and actively seek to use the leverage of the IDA buy 
down for financing of the eradication efforts. IDA financing would add value by: a) ensuring 
timely availability of Polio vaccine for SIAs; 
and 
b) 
help 
maximize the results of the 
investments of other donors
.
T
he Bank through the original and this project, is 
implementing a new financing approach to encourage urgent action on a global public 
good with significant externalities. 
 
4. Description 
The proposed project will finance only the first component of PEI as in the original project. The 
proposed project will be financed through Specific Investment Lending. As the original project, 
the proposed credit will be on standard IDA terms with a special provision for a third party 
funded Trust Fund to cover the service and commitment fees and purchase the credit at its net 
present value once the project has been successfully completed.  IDA would support Pakistan 
PEI and global eradication efforts in partnership with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Bill 
Gates Foundation and United Nations Foundation (UNF).  
 
The proposed credit would finance the procurement of OPV required for SIAs in 2006 and 2007. 
The estimated costs of the PEI for 2006/07 is US $ 97 million, of which US $61.42 million are 
required for OPV procurement.  The Government of Japan is likely to provide parallel financing 
of US $14 million. IDA would finance about US $ 47.42 million. The cost of supplemental 
operations and surveillance will be financed by WHO and UNICEF. 
 
The proposed Credit does not require additional implementation capacity beyond what is already 
in place for PEI and the existing project.  The existing procurement, financial management and 
disbursement arrangements including accounting and reporting systems will continue for the 
proposed credit as applied under the parent project. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and 
Page  3
supply of OPV through its international procurement division, based in Copenhagen as agreed in 
the present project.

6. Implementation 
 
The project will be implem
ented through the Ministry of Health’s Expanded Program on 
Immunization and does not require additional implementation capacity beyond what is already in 
place for the PEI.  The project will be monitored through the existing monitoring mechanisms 
and already functional surveillance system. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and supply 
of OPV through its international procurement division, based in Copenhagen as agreed in the 
present project. 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
SIAs will end with polio eradication and there will be no need to sustain these. Polio eradication 
benefits are infinite because the disease will be extinct, unless a man-made mistake or disaster 
makes it reappear. The development partners and technical agencies are committed to eradicating 
polio in Pakistan and globally.   
 
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
The project design reflects lessons from past Bank operations in the South Asia region including:  
a) the need to keep the design simple and well-defined; b) use the regular structures for program 
management rather than Project Management Unit; and c) ensure coordination with other 
development partners.   
 
9.  Safeguard Policies  
 
The project is not envisaged to cause environmental risks. The project will significantly 
contribute to the eradication of wild polio virus from the environment. The project has a strong 
poverty focus.  Poor people living in unsanitary conditions are at greatest risk for contracting 
polio.  In addition, children in poor families tend to have the lowest immunization coverage.  The 
project, by supporting SIAs will target poor, remote and underprivileged communities, and 
children whose mothers are unable to take them to health facilities due to restricted female 
mobility.
