The credit will provide\n            additional resources for the Second Partnership for Polio\n            Eradication Project (PPEP 11)) to help meet increased\n            financing requirements for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccine\n            (OPV) for Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative\n            (PEI). The new credit, as the original credit, will be on\n            standard International Development Association (IDA) terms\n            with a special provision for third party funded Trust Funds\n            to cover the service and commitment fees and purchase the\n            credit at its net present value once the project has been\n            successfully completed in accordance with the terms of the\n            Financing Agreement (FA). The Second PPEP is a follow-on\n            project of the first PPEP. The project development objective\n            is to assist Pakistan's effort to eradicate polio\n            through supply of the OPV for the country's\n            Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) during 2006-07\n            for immunizing all children up to five years of age. Polio\n            Eradication Initiative has three components just as in the\n            original project. However, IDA will be financing only one\n            component, the procurement and timely supply of OPV. The\n            project development objectives and all other aspect of the\n            project will remain as in the original project."}, "docdt": "2007-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
