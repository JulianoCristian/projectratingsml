I. Introduction
1.     The Project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors for additional financing
o f SDR 14.00 million (US$ 21.14 million equivalent) to the Islamic Republic o f Pakistan. The
proposed credit will provide additional resources for the Second Partnership for Polio
Eradication Project (PPEP 11) (Cr. Number 41450) to help meet increased financing requirements
for procurement o f Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) for Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI).
The proposed credit, as the original credit, will be on standard International Development
Association (IDA) terms with a special provision for third party funded Trust Funds to cover the
service and commitment fees and purchase the credit at its net present value once the project has
been successfully completed in accordance with the terms o f the Financing Agreement (FA).
IDA would support PEI and global eradication efforts in partnership with the Melinda and Bill
Gates Foundation, Center for Disease Control (CDC) and United Nations Foundation (UNF).
IDA'Spartners will cover the costs of the service and commitment fee of the project and "buy
down" (Annex 4) the net present value o f the credit once agreed performance measures are
achieved.

11.     Background
2.      Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) i s part o f the World Health Organization
(WHO) led, multi-country effort insupport of a global public good i.e. eradication of polio from
the world.     The global program has successfully reduced the disease burden by 99% and
eradicated Polio in all but four countries2 by end 2006. The virus remains endemic in these
countries accounting for 93% o f all cases in the world. Stopping virus transmission in these
countries i s the final challenge to ensure global eradication.

3.      The Second PPEP i s a follow-on project o f the first PPEP. The project development
objective i s to assist Pakistan's effort to eradicate polio through supply o f the Oral Polio Vaccine
(OPV) for the country's Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) during 2006-07 for
immunizing all children up to five years o f age. Pakistan has made good progress towards Polio
eradication since 2003 through sustained and intensified efforts. However, despite effective
implementation o f SIAs with high coverage o f targeted population in 2006, the number o f cases
increased from 28 in 2005 to 40 in2006. Inaddition, 3 new cases have beenreported in2007.

4.      The increased number of polio cases is due to resurgence of one of the three Polio
viruses. The virus transmission continues in four geographical zones including parts o f
NWFP/FATA; Balochistan (with 64% o f cases from the two provinces), Karachi, and Northern
SindWSouthern Punjab. The virus transmission extends up to Southern Afghanistan which
witnessed an outbreak o f polio during 2006. Despite the increase in number o f cases, there is
epidemiological evidence that virus transmission has been further restricted in Pakistan and the
opportunity for eradication remains strong as evidenced by: a) most areas o f Pakistan, and the
vast bulk o f the national population, are polio free; b) continued reduction o f genetic diversity o f
circulating wild viruses; and c) reduction o f wild polio 1 virus transmission in large areas. Table
1 below outlines Pakistan progress towards polio eradication since 1997.

5.      The Second PPEP was approved on January 26,2006 and became effective on March 08,
2006. The project finances only one component o f PEI i.e. procurement o f OPV through United
Nations Children Fund (UNICEF).               The original credit of U S $ 46.70 million, US $ 46.69
million (99%) has been disbursed, almost 11 months earlier than envisaged. The un-disbursed
balance o f US $ 1.20 million (due to SDR US $ exchange rate fluctuation), i s likely to be
disbursed by end May 2007 and utilized by end July 2007. Overall project implementation
progress as concluded by the recent Supervision Mission i s satisfactory with all implementing
agencies adequately discharging their responsibilities, activities executed satisfactorily and the
Borrower is in compliance with the legal covenants.

111.    Rationale for Additional Financing
6.         The proposed Credit would finance the procurement of additional OPV required for
extra SIAs in August-December 2007 and January 2008. The credit i s consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy approved by the Board in June 20064, and i s aligned with its
priorities which seeks to support Pakistan to accelerateprogress inhuman development, focusing
on the poor and vulnerable. The proposed credit i s consistent with the original project
development objective and meets the requirement o f BP13.20 on additional financing as outlined
below:

    Despite making progress and achieving 97% coverage o f the targeted population in SIAs
    Pakistan continues to face challenges with continued transmission o f wild polio virus in four
    zones o f the country and in neighboring Afghanistan. The modified strategy endorsed by
    Technical Advisory Group (a group o f International and National experts) and technical
    partners focuses on ensuring good quality SIAs, increasing the number o f sub-national
    immunization days (SNIDS) and case response campaigns, enhancing coordination with
    Afghanistan, and increasing the use o f type specific monovalent vaccine for specific rounds.
    The increased number o f rounds has increased the amount o f vaccine required and
    operational costs, placing new financial burden on the Government o f Pakistan (GOP).
    Given the limited resources and other competing priorities, the GOP i s unable to secure
    additional financing for the procurement o f OPV.

    The GOP has explored alternate financing options including from other development
    partners. CIDA i s likely to support financing for surveillance in 2007 but other partners have
    not committed resources for OPV procurement inthe given time frame.
    Polio eradication is largely financed by the development partners, who are more and more
    counting on the Bank's contribution (and actively seek to use the leverage o f the IDA buy
    down) for further financing o f the eradication efforts;
    Overall project implementation progress has been satisfactory; all implementing agencies
    have adequately discharged their responsibilities and the Borrower i s in compliance with the
    legal covenants.
    The original Credit is 99% disbursed and the remaining funds are fully committed for use
    duringMay -July 2007.

IV.     ProposedChanges
7.      The project development objectives and all other aspect o f the project will remain as in
the original project. The only change with additional financing i s the change in one o f the two
performance monitoring indicator. The project performance indicator "OPV arrival 5 weeks
before each round in Islamabad" to measure timely availability o f OPV i s difficult to achieve due
to global supply shortage. As the third party performance audit for the first PPEP indicated, the
indicator i s inappropriate to assess GOP performance as OPV arrival i s determined by the global
supply situation beyond the control o f GOP. The project team reached agreement with the
program and technical partners to revise the performance indicator to one which i s realistic,
measures GOP's performance and is within the control o f GOP. The indicator is: "timely arrival
of OPV at the District storesfive days before each of the SIA". The indicator will be measured
in at least one third o f all districts for each round (districts to be randomly selected) by WHO
monitoring teams and measured through review o f stock register maintained at the district level.
The legal documents will be amended to incorporate the new indicator and agreed during
negotiations.

V.      Appraisal of the ProposedAdditional Financing
8.      PEI has three components, however, as inthe original project, IDA will be financing only
one component, the procurement and timely supply o f OPV, which will comprise "the Project".
SIAs during August 2007-January 2008 will require about 140 million doses o f OPV, costing
about US $ 21.14 million (Annex 1 and 2). The shortfall o f US $21.14 million equivalent will be
met from the additional financing under the proposed project5. The breakdown o f the project
cost, project financing plan, project costs by procurement arrangements and disbursement are
summarized inAnnex 2 and 3.

9.      The Federal, Provincial and the District Governments are fully committed to polio
eradication. The proposed Credit does not require additional implementation capacity beyond
what i s already in place for PEI and the existing project i.e. the existing public health structures
at federal, provincial and district level with oversight by MOH. The project is ready for
implementation as it supports an ongoing program. The credit will be monitored through the
existing monitoring mechanisms and already fully functional quality surveillance system. The
existing procurement and disbursement procedures applied under the present project will
continue. UNICEF will undertake the procurement and supply o f OPV through its international

5The IDA project will only finance procurement o f OPV, which is not dependant on financing by other
Development Partners as their financing is not part o f the IDA project.

procurement division, based in Copenhagen as agreed in the present project. A new draft
procurement agreement between the GOP and UNICEF i s being finalized. An Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) o f the project will be prepared within six months after Credit closing.

10.      Procurement, Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The existing
procurement procedures applied under the original project will continue. Simplified acceptable
financial management arrangements including accounting and reporting systems are in place for
the project and will continue for the additional credit.

11,      Environmental Aspects and Safeguard Policies: The project i s not envisaged to cause
environmental risks. The environmental category for the supplemental credit i s C. The
additional credit as the initial project will support SIAs inAzad Jammu and Kashmir (AJQ6.

VI.      ExpectedOutcomes
12.      The project will contribute to the eradication o f wild polio virus from Pakistan and the
world and thereby contribute to a global public good. It i s expected that additional financing will
ensure timely availability o f OPV for additional round and will help immunize 140 millionunder
five children during last five months o f 2007. The project, by supporting SIAs will target poor,
remote and underprivilegedcommunities, and children whose mothers are unable to take them to
health facilities due to restricted female mobility. Inaddition, Vitamin A i s also administered to
children as part o f SIAs. Vitamin A benefits the poor children by decreasing vitamin A
deficiency related blindness and also reduces the risk o f infant and child mortality.                          The
supplementary immunization activities will end once polio i s eradicated globally, so there will be
no need to sustain SIAs and related costs. Polio eradication benefits are immeasurable because
the disease will be eradicated from the world and all transmission will cease.

VII.     Benefits and Risks
13.      Procurement and supply o f additional OPV through the proposed credit will assist in
achieving the original project objective. The project i s likely to benefit all Pakistani children
below the age o f five, but it will benefit poor and disadvantaged children, who are more likely to
get infected. The project will eradicate polio and it will no longer be a public health problem in
Pakistan thereby freeing resources for other sectoral priorities. The benefits o f Polio eradication
will go far beyondthe nationaltarget group as it will also benefit the all children o f the world.

14.      The biggest risk is that being a global public good it heavily depends on all countries
being successful in eradicating Polio. Failure on the part o f one country will undermine the
global effort.     Although efforts to eradicate Polio have been hugely successful however,
intensified SIA efforts have not been able to eliminate Polio in four countries successfully.
Despite epidemiological evidence o f reducing transmission, virus remains endemic and may not
lead to polio eradication by end o f 2007. This will delay global polio eradication requiring
additional efforts and funds for at least the next three to five years. The GOP i s fully committed
to the project and the Polio Eradication Initiative. It i s making all efforts including involvement
o f all stakeholders, three levels o f government and collaboration with regional countries.

Implementation has been strengthened through the support o f the development partners with
provision o f intensive and highquality technical assistance.




VIII. FinancialTerms and Conditionsfor the Additional Financing

15.    The additional financing will have the same conditions as the original project Le. it will
be on standard IDA terms with a special provision for third party funded Trust Funds for IDA
buy-down to purchase the credit at its net present value once the project has been successfully
completed inaccordance with the terms o f FA.

                                  IDA Buy-downMechanism
Introduction
1.      This annex describes the arrangements for the implementation o f the IDA buy-down
mechanism for polio eradication projects, which aims to convert the terms o f a normal IDA
Development Credit to grant terms through provision o f additional external donor resources
under clearly defined performance criteria.     In the context o f the Pakistan, this Additional
Financing for the Second Partnership for Polio Eradication Project i s the fourth operation
utilizing this mechanism. The first two credits for Pakistan have been converted into grants
through this mechanism. The resources for the additional financing will become available as a
result o f agreements between IDA and the United Nations Foundation (UNF) with funding from
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and between IDA and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation (BMGF). The buy-down mechanism complies with IDA'Sexisting financial policies.

The Partnership
2.      The Bank's Health, Nutrition and Population Anchor explored the possibility of
partnering with BMGF and with UNF and CDC to assist polio eradication by providing countries
with IDA financial resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The BMGF and CDC
through UNF agreed to provide funds to separate IDA-administered trust funds (Polio
Eradication Trust Funds or PETFs) that will buy down the debt incurred by recipient countries
for successful implementation o f polio eradication projects. In addition to making commitment
and service charge payments to IDA on behalf o f the recipients during project implementation,
the PETFs will, upon successful project implementation, buy down the net present value o f the
principal amount o f the development credit.

The Mechanism
3.      The IDA FA will include two special previsions:

I.ThePETF, willpaytheapplicableservicechargesandcommitmentchargesaccruedduring
    the projects implementation period, if any, and
11. The PETF will buy down the principal amount o f the credit upon successful completion o f
    the project (as determined by a performance audit to be conducted by the World Health
    Organization).

4.      The buy-down will be funded by contributions to the PETFs from the CDC through UNF
and from the BMGF. The buy-down mechanism operates in three stages-credit signing, project
implementation, and project completion. These stages are described below.

At Credit Signing
5 ,     Based on the prevailing discount rate (the prevailing SDR-basket Commercial Interest
Reference Rates (CIRR) on the date o f credit signing) and the foreign exchange rate
(SDR:USD), IDA estimates the net present value o f the credit at final buy-down. The PETFs
sets aside funds that are denominated in USD and invested pending disbursement. The set-aside


                                                14

amount equals IDA commitment and service charge payments over the projectedimplementation
period and the estimated amount needed to buy down the principal o f the credit at the end o f the
implementation period.     IDA hedges the foreign exchange risk under its existing currency
rebalancing mechanism.
DuringProjectImplementation
6.      Under the project, IDA, acting on a request from the recipient country, disbursesfunds to
UNICEF, the agency responsible for procuring the polio vaccine. UNICEF in turn supplies the
vaccines to the recipient government. The PETF pays the commitment and service charges on
the disbursed amounts during the implementation o f the project. Ifthe implementation period i s
substantially longer than initially projected, funds required to pay service charges could exceed
the funds set aside. However, the investmentincome on the set-aside buy-down amount provides
a cushion against this risk. Ifthe implementation period exceeds five years, the responsibility for
servicing the credit will revert to the recipient country unless UNF and BMGF grant an
extension.

At ProjectCompletion
7.      As in the original project, upon completion of the project, WHO will conduct a
performance audit to determine if the IDA funds achieved their intended result. The performance
audit measures the results for two indicators:

        Timely arrival o f OPV at the district level; and
        Vaccination coverage for OPV during the vaccination campaigns.

8.      Ifthe WHO performance audit evaluates the project as satisfactory, the IDA buy-down
will be triggered. The PETFs will then pay off the IDA credit at the net present value o f the
credit based on the defined foreign exchange and discount rates to buy down the principal o f this
credit (Repayment Amount). IDA will in turn cancel this credit and release the recipient from
any future liability. If the credit i s not fully disbursed, the final Repayment Amount will be
calculated on a pro-rata basis.      If the WHO performance audit evaluates the project as
unsatisfactory, the recipient remains obligated to pay back IDA on the terms o f the credit.
