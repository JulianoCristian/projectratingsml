Some lessons learned included: the\n            project had a simple design, procurement by United Nations\n            Children's Fund (UNICEF), and a straightforward\n            objective of supporting one component of a larger\n            effectively functioning national program. With a relatively\n            simple project design and objectives, it was easier to\n            measure success. This principle could be applied to projects\n            across sectors and countries; however it does need to be\n            acknowledged that development issues often do not have\n            simple solutions, and hence the complexity of many Bank\n            projects. Also, the simple design could have compromised the\n            Bank's role to have an effective dialogue for the\n            entire Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). The project\n            was entirely implemented by the existing EPI management unit\n            and hence sustainable after project completion. Ensuring\n            realistic indictors to measure project success is important.\n            The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) supply indicator as developed\n            was ambitious, and when developed did not take into account\n            the global OPV demand-supply situation. At the same time, an\n            early recognition of the inappropriateness of an indicator\n            and revising/changing it can be critical to project success."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
