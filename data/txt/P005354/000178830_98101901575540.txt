SUMIARY
i.        BNDE was very active in 1966 and 1967.  In number and volume,
its operations exceeded those of any previous year. Direct investment
operations approved (loans and equity investments) were $12.1 million
equivalent in 1966 and $10.3 million in 1967, and disbursements were
$9.6 million and $9.8 million equivalent, respectively. In addition,
BNiDE approved for rediscounting at the central bank medium-term loans
granted by commercial banks aggregating $9.4 million equivalent 1/.  Total
assistance approved was thus $31.8 million equivalent during these two years.
Of this total, 90% by amount was financing of majority private and lO/,majority
gcvernment enterprises. BUDE was also active in promotion of new enterprises.
ii.       In the same two years, total investment in industry and tourism
aggregated about $114 million equivalent, so that BNDE provided, or
helped to provide, about 28% of the total.
iii.      The bulk of BNDE's assistance fell in two sectors, the food
industry (31.5%, most of which was a large rediscountable credit for a
sugar mill) and the textile industry (26.3%). The rest was fairly
evenly divided among a number of industries, of which the tourist industry
(i.e. hotels) received 6.4%.
iv.       While impressive in quantity, the quality of these investments
was uneven, and some appear rather weak. This may be particularly but
not exclusively so for a number of new, mainly small, textile mills.
The coincidence of a very rapid expansion of investment in textiles with
two successive bad harvests (1966 and 1967) created a situation of, at
least temporary, over-capacity, the domestic market could no longer
absorb the total textile output, most enterprises were not competitive
in exports, and many of them found themselves in financial difficulties.
Financing of new textile mills is now held back and, with the good out-
look for the 1968 harvest, there is hope that the textile situation will
slowly go back to normal.
v.        BNDE has not so far suffered any serious losses, and the
repayment record of its borrowers is good.  lqevertheless, BNDE is exposed
to substantial risk and, although BNDE's ability to meet its obligations
is not likely to be jeopardized, continued rapid build-up of reserves is
essential.
vi.       Staff, appraisal and follow-up procedures continued to improve
in the two past years, under the leadership of Mr. Benkirane, the
Director General of BNDE. However, weaknesses still exist in these
respects, and the decision-making at Board level (for commitments of
2/ Concerning this amount, see footnote 2 on page 4 of report.



-ii -
US$ 150,000 and more), usually done through mail voting, has offered
little possibility for discussion of the merits of investment projects
by the directors and little opportunity for them to influence
management's views.
vii.      Strengthening of appraisal standards and investment criteria,
management, and the Board's role in decision-making has therefore been
agreed upon during loan negotiations. An Executive Committee, created
by the Board on May 31, 1968, now examines and decides, at meetings, on
most of the investment proposals, up to a maximum commitment of
DH 4 million ($800,000) in any single enterprise, while larger proDosals
will be considered by the full Board, also at meetings. An Advisor, to
assist BNDE's management at all stages of appraisal and decision-making,
will be engaged before the end of 1968.  As the Director General has no
Deputy, a qualified nerson to fill this post is being sought, but no
candidate has yet been found.
viii.     As a further means of lessening BNDE's exposure in weak
projects, agreement has been reached with the Government that it will
provide full guarantees for projects judged by BNDE not to meet its usual
criteria of financial and economic soundness, but which the Government
may nevertheless have good reasons to see implemented.
ix.       BNDE's financial performance has not so far been satisfactory.
Net profits increased from 4.9Wb of equity capital in 1963 to 6.99% in
1967, leaving available for distribution as dividends only 3% in 1964
and 1965, 3.5% in 1966 and 4% in 1967. The reason for the slow improve-
ment in profitability is the low spread on borrowed funds (costing 5%
net to BNDE, the additional interest expense being refunded by the
Government on a subsidy basis, while BNDE lends at 7%) and the low
leverage. When the Bank first lent to BWDE and IFC decided to invest in
its shares, in 1962, it was hoped that BMDE's shares would, within a few
years, become profitable enough to attract private Moroccan investors.
This has not happened.
x.        Discussions have been held with BNDE and the Government about
the possibility of increasing BNDE's lending rate in order to improve
the profitability. The Government has so far been opposed to such action
but now plans to make a full review of the interest rate structure in
Morocco in order to lay a basis for reviewing its position. As an
immediate measure for improvement of BNDE's position, the Government
proposed, and an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of BNDE decided,
on June 24, 1968, to reduce BNDE's share capital from DH 30 million to
DH 20 million by redeeming shares at par, for cash or for bonds. At the
same time, the Government made a new loan of DH 10 million to BNDE, on
long term (30 years) and at low (2%) interest, and ranking pari passu
with the share capital in the case of liquidation of BNDE.



-iii-
xi.       The profitability outlook is therefore now better, and
dividends of 6-7T may become immediately possible. However, this rate
is unlikely to make BNDE's shares easily marketable.
xii.      Taken together, the various measures to strengthen BIMDE
constitute a considerable improvement, and are believed an adequate
basis for recommending a new, the third, Bank loan to BNDE. Because of
the need to watch closely the effect of the measures taken and BNDE's
performance in general, a loan to cover requirements for a period of
about one year is considered appropriate. It has been estimated that
BNDE could effectively use $15 million in foreign exchange for such a
period.
xiii.     The provisions of the pronosed new loan should follow closely
those now usually applied to development finance companies.  No change
is proposed in the amount ($150,000) which BNDE can commit from the
loan for single projects without the Bank's prior approval. The
restrictive effects on MNDE's borrowing capacity of a new definition of
debt and equity, in line with recent practice for other development
finance companies, have been offset by a proposed change of the allowable
ratio from previously 3:1 to 4.5:1. In absolute terms, the new ratio
means a small increase of BNDE's borrowing capacity.

APPRAISAL OF THE
BANQUE NATIONAIE POUR IE DEVELPPE=NT ECONOMIQUE
I.   Introduction
1.        The Bank has granted two loans to BNDE: the first, $15 million,
in December 1962, the second, $17.5 million, in May 1966. Both are fully
committed. IFC invested about $1.5 million in BNDE shares alongside the
first loan. BNDE has requested a third loan from the Bank.
2.        This report examines whether ENDE is a suitable borrower for a
third Bank loan. It concludes, like the two previous appraisal reports
(DB-3b, December 10, 1962 and DB-27b, April 26, 1966), that, on balance,
BNDE is.  This conclusion, as well as the whole report, is based on
experience of a six-year old relationship, on a mission to Morocco in
October 1967 to re-appraise BNDE and another mission in February 1968 to
discuss the loan request, on loan negotiations held in Washington in May
1968, and on the review and evaluation of all evidence and material
available.
II.    BNDE
3.        Objectives; Policies.  The objectives of  INDE, a development
finance company established in 1959, are to assist the economic develop-
ment of Morocco through medium- and long-term investment in productive
enterprises, mainly private, through the promotion of and technical
assistance to such enterprises, and through the active encouragement of
capital market operations. Its Statement of Policy (Annex 1), adopted
in 1963, gives BNDE a particular role in the industrial field, but it has
0           also been active in other sectors, such as tourism.  BNDE will finance
non-private enterprises only when private capital to carry out the
project cannot be found on reasonable terms.
4.        The Institution.  Of the present DH 30 million share capital
(prior to the reduction which is presently under way), the Government
owns 43.5%, IFn 25%, foreign financial institutions 16.7%, and private
Moroccan shareholders 14.8%.  Nore details are given in Annex 2.  The
proportionate distribution will remain approximately the same after the
reduction.
5.        The Board of Directors (Annex 3) consists of 17 members.  Of
the present Board, 8 directors have been nominated by the Government
(including the Chairman and the Director General). Five are private
Moroccan bankers and businessmen, 3 represent the foreign shareholders,
and one IFC (Mr. E. T. Kuiper).



-2-
6.        An Executive Committee of the Board was created on iMay 31,
1968, to replace the former Consultative Committee.  Its composition and
powers are described in paragraph 39.
7.        By agreement between the Government and the Board of BMDE, the
chief executive of BNDE (the Director General) is nominated by the
Government (through its Board representatives) and appointed by the Board.
Since July 1965, Mr. I"bhamed Benkirane, former Director of Credit in the
Banque du Maroc (the central bank), has held this position.  He is a
member of the Board, and of the Executive Committee. He has a renewable
tenure of contract of two years at a time. The present term expires in
July 1969. A general Advisor to BNDE will be engaged soon and a person
to become Deputy Director General is being sought (see paragraphs 36-37).
8.        The organization is divided into seven departments or sections
(see Annex 4). Staff number 71, of whom 31 are professionals. Except
for four foreign staff members, of whom one is a department head, all
staff are now Moroccan.
9.        _prations.  Summary statements of BNDE's operations are given
in Annexes 5 and 6. Total financial assistance approved amounted to
DH 650 million by the end of 1967.  Of this total, DH 266 million was in
the form of direct medium- and long-term loans; DH 337 million, inter-
mediary commitments for medium-term rediscountable (at the central bank)
credits granted by commercial banks; DH 17 million, equity investments;
and DH 30 million, guarantees. Average loan size is about $277,000
equivalent; average equity investment, about $105,000.
10.       Up to 1965, the annual volume of new direct loans granted was,
on average, about DH 25 million.  In comparison, an amount of DH 56
million was granted in 1966, and DH 50 million in 1967.  New annual
rediscounting commitments have shown great fluctuations, from a low of
DH 11 million in 1964, to a high of DH 71 million in 1967, mainly
influenced by the incidence of occasional very large commitments.
l1.       Resources.  Of total resources in use at end-1967, DH 195
million, share capital and reserves were DH 38.6 million or 20,o, the
Government had contributed (apart from its shareholding) DH 30 million
or 15%, the Bank DH 89.2 million or 46%, local bond issues DH 16.4
million or 8%, and short-term liabilities DH 21.3 million or 11%.  As of
August 31, 1968, the second Bank loan had been fully credited (since
July 1968), but an amount equivalent to DH 40 million ($8.0 million) was
undisbursed. Apart from normal recoveries on loans not required for
debt service and other internal cash generation, the second Bank loan
was BNDE's only available resource for further disbursement.

12.       Capital Structure.  Summarized balance sheets for 1964 through
1967 are given in Annex 7. In 1965 through 1967, the current position
remained negative (0.60:1 at end-1967), but about half of the current
liabilities consisted of short-term (3-6 months) bonds held, mainly, by
insurance companies and automatically renewed at maturity. The ratio
between total equity and other long-term funds was, at end-1967, 1:3.5.
Total equity was 22% of the total loan and investment portfolio out-
standing; reserves alone stood at h.83%o of the same amount.
13.       Financial Results.  Summarized profit and loss accounts are
shown in Annex B. BNDE's lending rate of interest, for direct loans,
has remained unchanged at 7% since 1959, when it came into existence. In
addition, BNDE charges a commitment fee of 0.75-0.85% p.a. on undisbursed
portions of loans, and certain other fees.  On rediscountable credits,
granted by commercial banks at 6.5-7%, BNDE retains a commission of 3/4%
if the credits are held by the banks themselves, and 1-1/8% if the credit
is rediscounted at the central bank. On average equity investment out-
standing, BADE earned dividends of 1.3% in 1966 and 2.1% in 1967.
14.       In return for BNDE's keeping its direct lending rate at 7%, the
Government refunds to BNDE, on a subsidy basis, all interest expenses on
its borrowings in excess of 5% (up to 7%), so that its total interest
spread is 2%. Administrative costs, in 1967, were 1.3% on average total
assets. Earnings after financial costs and administrative expenses but
before provisions and taxes, as a percentage of average total assets,
were 2.0% in 1967, down from 3.1% in 1963.
15.       Net earnings after provision for losses and taxes, as a per-
centage of average equity, increased from 4.90% in 1963 to 6.991% in 1967.
On share capital (at year-end), they represented 4.6h4% in 1963 and 8.83%
in 1967.
16.       BNDE's first dividend, 3%, was paid from 1964 income.  The
dividend remained at 3% for 1965, was increased to 3.5% for 1966, and
further to 4% for 1967. The remainder of income was allocated to
reserves, the main portion under tax exemption.
III.   Role of BIDE in the Moroccan Economy
Contribution to Investment
17.       BNDE is still the largest domestic source of medium- and long-
term lending to the industrial and tourist sectors of the Moroccan
economy. The growth of its activity, especially in the past two years,
has been impressive, mainly in the area of medium- and small-scale
private enterprises in a fair range of industries (see Annex 5).



18.       The following table compares BNDE's a.pprovals of long-term
financing operations of all kinds in the industrial and tourist sectors
with estimated net public and private sector fixed asset investment in
those sectors in the past three years (DHI million):
Year        Public          Private            Total          BNDE Approvals
1965          204             117               321                 81
1966          106             164               270                 84
1967         n.a.            n.a.               300                 78 2/
Directly (loans, equity investments) or indirectly (rediscounting
commitments), therefore, BNDE has participated to the extent of between
32% (in 1966) and 26% (in 1967) of all investment in these sectors.  As,
on average, BNDE financing of any kind has represented about 43% of the
total investment cost of the projects BNDE assists, one can estimate that
BNDE participated in the financing of 74%, in 1966, and 60%, in 1967, of
all investments, public or private, in industry and tourism. As about
three-fourths of BNDE's assistance went to the private sector, it is easy
to see that BiDE has been a partner to a predominant portion (perhaps
85-9W0%) of all investment carried out under private sponsorship. This
clearly demonstrates the crucial place BMDE now occupies in the develop-
ment of private industry (in a broad sense) in Morocco.
19.       To balance the picture somewhat, it should be noted that a
considerable portion (26% in 1966, 57% in 1967) of BNDE's operations is
a result of its being an intermediary (between the commercial banks and
the central bank) and secondary risk-taker for rediscountable, medium-
term credits, for which the commercial banks assume the primary risks.
Economically speaking, BNDE's role in these credits is of secondary
importance. Typically, however, these credits make part of a financing
plan in which there is also a direct loan from BNDE (normally to finance
imported goods), so that BNDE's partnership is an integral and essential
pre-requisite. Even so, leaving aside the rediscountable credits, BNDE's
direct loans and investments were about 23% in 1966, and 18% in 1967, of
total estimated investment in the relevant sectors. Since, as has been
noted, BNDE's participation in the total cost of projects assisted is
about 43o, it is once again indicated that, also in a direct way, BNDE
was partner to a large portion of all new investment. Statistics of this
type are seldom very reliable, but the importance of BNDE in mobilizing
and assisting investment in MvIorocco is unquestionable.
BNDE's estimate (Annual Report 1967).
2/   This excludes an unusually large (DH 45 million) rediscountable
credit approved in the last days of 1967, inclusion of which
would distort the 1967 total. However, Annex 5 puts this credit
into the 1967 total.



Contribution to Economic Growth
20.       A study made by BNDE /concludes (with appropriate rese v,ations)
that enterprises which had received direct loans from BNDE added- about
DH 265 million in 1966, and about DH 294 million in 1967, to the gross
domestic product. Total investment in these enterprises was around
DH 687 million, and the annual value added was thus around h0% of the
investment. If this is correct -- and one must take such statistics
with considerable reservation -- it is a good result.
21.       A major reservation here stems from the fact that, in the 1963-
1967 period, industry's contribution to the GDP remained fairly static at
a level of 12-13%; this seen against a background of a low annual rate of
economic growth (in real terms) of 1.9% (in 1963-1967) to 2.2% (in 1964-
1967).  BNDE in its study mentioned above points to one of the reasons
for there being under-utilization of capacity in important sectors. While,
for example, there was a fairly reasonable utilization, in 1967, of 75% of
installed capacity in the cement industry, in the two important sectors
of textiles and edible oils utilization was little more than half (57% for
cotton spinning/weaving, 5010 for oils).  In the latter two sectors there
is now clearly over-capacity, most enterprises are small and operate only
at one or two shifts, and better utilization of existing capacity is a
matter of great importance. The question of whether BNDE may have
assistved capacity expansion somewhat too indiscriminately in certain
sectors will be discussed later (paragraphs 29-34).
Other Factors in BNDE's Economic Performance
22.       Shift from Public to Private Sector.  Since the beginning of
BNDE's association with the Bank Group in 1962, its direct financing
operations have shifted markedly towards assistance to the private
sector. Since its operations began, about 71%' of financing of any kind
has been in the private sector.  In 1966, by comparison, 86% went to
majority private enterprise, in 1967, 60%. In 1967, however, the lower
percentage was entirely due to a single large rediscountable credit to
a Government sugar mill. Both in 1966 and 1967, BNDE made no direct
loans to Government enterprises.
23.       Encouragement of Moroccan Ownership.  While, in the 1959-63
period, almost half of all assistance from BNDE went to predominantly
foreign-owned enterprises, in 1966, by comparison, 38% went to such
enterprises, and in 1967 only 23l.  The reason is not that foreign
investor interest in ilIorocco has declined (BIDE financing to foreign-
sponsored projects was substantially higher both in 1966 and 1967 than
/ BNDE Annual Report 1967.
Value added taken as net sales minus purchases.



-6-
in the two preceding years), but rather that BIDE has significantly
contributed to encourage and to create investment possibilities for
Moroccan-owned capital.
24.       Introduction of Better Investment Standards.  BNDE has done
much to introduce and make known better methods and standards for the
appraisal and follow-up of investments. Although important weaknesses
still exist (discussed in paragraph 33), not only has BNDE itself gone a
long way toward more consistent and critical appraisal, on financial and
economic criteria, since 1962, but it has also, through its collaboration
with commercial banks on rediscountable credits, and through its direct
relations with clients, helped to instill in the business community a
stronger sense of the need to apply such criteria rather than pure
security considerations.
25.       Promotion.  BWTE has long undertaken a considerable amount of
successful promotion in tourist projects (through its subsidiary SOMADET),
and has more recently broadened its work in this field into the industrial
sector, in areas which include plastics, tripolyphosphate, bitumen and
lubricants, cement, feed, fish-meal, olive oil, bottling and refrigeration.
Many of these studies have resulted in the establishment of enterprises.
The tourist projects are nearly all successful or likely to be so.
However, some of the industrial projects have run into initial difficulties.
Never"tleless, BNDE has a philosophy of not merely waiting for projects to
come to its doors, but of actively promoting new ventures where
opportunities of foreign exchange savings or earnings present themselves.
26.       Tourist Lending.  A new feature in BNDE's activity was the
beginning, in the second half of 1966, of lending to the tourist sector
through the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH), the Government's chosen
instrument for the financing of tourism.  Although differences in BNDE
and CIH appraisal and disbursement methods, as well as difficulties in
relating those methods to the Bank's disbursement procedures, have so far
inhibited BNDE from becoming really active in hotel projects, BNDE, in
applying its usual appraisal methods, has contributed to a more critical
approach to such projects. While hotel loans amounted to only 11% and
14% of the total direct loan approvals in 1966 and 1967, respectively, all
parties concerned have now agreed to certain modifications of the
procedures which, it is hoped, will give them better practicability for
all. The outlook in this field is discussed in paragraph 52.
Relations with Government
27.       An important asset to BODE is the confidence and support it
enjoys from the Government. BNDE not only has the Government as its
major shareholder, but also benefits from contributions of low-cost,
subordinated funds, subsidies, and rediscounting privileges.



- 7 -
In its operations the staff of BNDE work closely with officials of the
economic ministries. Government officials are generally satisfied that
BNDE has worked well in harmony with the objectives of its economic
development plans. The other side of the picture is that this relation-
ship has resulted in a high degree of reliance on Government views and
opinions and, in certain cases, in a difficulty for ENDE to assert its
own views.
IV. Operational and Financial Performance
28.       Over the years, both the strengths and weaknesses in BNDE have
come more clearly to light. The main problems encountered, and the
solutions to these problems, which can be seen, or which have been agreed
on, are discussed in the following.
Quality of Portfolio
29.       The heavy expansion of MNDE's business in recent years has not
been without considerable increase in exposure to risk. This is especially
apparent in the textile sector, investments in which, at the end of 1967,
represented about 33% of BNDE's portfolio. But also a number of other
enterprises financed appear to be weak, and some are in difficulties. It
is difficult to measure the degree of risk involved, because the largest
element of the risk depends on the future for the Moroccan textile
industry.
30.       BNDE reacted slowly to Bank advice in 1966-67 on over-capacity
developing in the textile sector, but has since shut off the high level
of financing in this sector - a policy of import substitution which was
undertaken very rapidly and through a nunber of enterprises of a scale
too small to be economically efficient. Economic factors, such as two
successive bad harvests (1966 and 1967) reducing sharply purchasing power
among the rural population, and failure of the Government to take, at an
early enough time, action to curtail imports to offset increasing textile
inventories, aggravated the bad effects of the rapid build-up of capacity.
An analysis made by BNDE of a sample of 11 textile companies (out of the
40 it has assisted) shows that sales dropped by 15% from 1966 to 1967,
inventories increased by 11%, sales prices decreased between 10% and 25%,
and six of the eleven companies ended up with a small or large net loss.
Given BNDE's large exposure in the textile sector, the poor situation of
the industry at the present time gives cause for some concern.
31.       Fortunately, 1968 is going to be a good year for agriculture,
and this should help to improve the companies' sales and perhaps reduce
the large inventories. It also appears that the Government, which had
plans for setting up several large textile mills, on top of the many



-8-
medium and small ones hardly yet gone into operation, has decided
at least to postpone its plans. This is essential for re-establishment
of sound conditions in the textile sector. BNDE will assists its clients
in modernizing and improving their existing plants, and is making a
study of the situation in the textile sector to be able to assess more
clearly its future.  With the growth of BNDE's portfolio in other sectors,
its relative exposure in textiles should decrease over time to a more
reasonable level.
32.       A large portion of BNDE's loans and investments made is young
of age and has not really reached the stage where an evaluation based on
actual performance - including repayment performance for loans - is
possible.  On the other hand, of BIDE's total portfolio of loans and
investments at end-1967, DH 178 million, about DH 52 million, or 29% were
old investments covered by Government guarantees. Of the remaining
DH 126 million, it was estimated, in October 1967, that DH 30 million
consisted of loans and investments to companies in various degrees of
serious difficulties; DH 13 million in textiles and DH 17 million in
other sectors. As against this assessment, BNDE's experience in
delinquencies has been good (orly about 2% of all loans are in arrears or
default), and securities and personal guarantees held by BNDE for its
loans will no doubt ward off too serious losses. Nevertheless, a
considerable area of heavy risks overhangs BIDE.
Investment Criteria and Appraisal Standards
33.       The somewhat indiscriminate assistance by BNDE to the expansion
of the textile industry, as well as its financing of a number of weak
projects (many of which were either rejected by the Bank for use of Bank
funds or approved only after lengthy correspondence and with considerable
reservations), emphasize the need for BNDE to tighten up its investment
criteria and to continue its efforts to improve appraisals. In the
latter, the application of independent judgment on technical and marketing
aspects is still weak, and conclusions do not always follow from
information provided. IWhile the considerable progress already mentioned
(paragraph 2h) was noted, this question was at the center of the recent
loan negotiations with BNDE, and BNDE assured the Bank that the
necessary efforts will be made. It should be noted that BNDE has recently
strengthened its technical staff, and intends to engage soon at least one
more engineer.
34.       It was recognized, during the loan negotiations, that there
probably have been, in the past, and will be, in the future, cases of
projects in which the Government, having to consider the social,
political and regional interests of the country, takes a strong interest,
and which it would like to see financed, but which cannot be justified
on strict financial and economic criteria. IWith its close association



-9-
with the Government, and being the only source of long-term industrial
finance, BNDE is hard put to turn down such projects in the absence of
alternative ways of financing. To solve this problem, the Bank has
suggested to the Government the creation of a special development fund
for the financing of this category of projects. BNDE, if the Government
so agreed, would act as a manager of the fund against an appropriate fee
or commission. BNDE's role would be solely advisory and administrative;
the final decision, and the risks, would be assumed by the Government.
The Government has not found it possible to create such a fund, for the
time being, but has agreed instead to provide unconditional and full
guarantees for BNDE loans to projects which do not meet BiDE's usual
investment criteria, but which the Government may consider to be in the
national interest. Such projects would not, in any event, be financed
by Bank funds.
Management
35.       Related to the question of strengthening appraisals and invest-
ment judgment is that of strengthening BIDE's management. The present
Director General, Mr. Benkirane, has managed BNDE for three years, but he
is alone. With the rapid growth in the volume of business, an increasingly
heavy load has been placed on the Director General, who bears responsibility
for most of the decisions on day-to-day affairs. As he has no Deputy, he
has long felt the need to find a qualified person for this position, but
has not so far found one.
36.       During the loan negotiations, it was agreed that BNDE would
recruit an Advisor, initially for a term of one year, before the end of
1968. BNDE is now actively seeking to find a qualified person for this
position. The Advisor would be available to the staff, management, and
Board of BNDE, would assist in the improvement of appraisal standards,
and would give his advice on all investment proposals before BNDE, both
during the appraisal stage and during the various stages of decision-
making. When the Advisor's term comes to an end, or if he should leave
before his term of contract is out, BNDE will consult with the Bank on
what further steps should be taken.
37.       The engaging of the Advisor, however important, would not
resolve the problem of finding a Deputy. A Deputy is needed both to
share the Director General's workload and to provide for continuity and
depth in the management of BNDE. It was agreed, during the loan
negotiations, that BNDE will continue to look actively for a suitable,
qualified, person for this position, with a view to an early appointment
so that the Deputy can work with and benefit from the presence of the
Advisor.



-10-
Decision-making
38.       In the past, decisions on investment proposals have been made
either by the Director General (up to DH 750,000) or by the Board. A
Consultative Committee, whose composition, apart from the Chairman and
the Director General, consisted entirely of representatives of various
economic ivfnistries and Government agencies, made recommendations on
each proposal. The Board meets only four times a year, and most proposals
for it to decide on have therefore been submitted to the Directors and
voted on by mail.
39.       It has proved difficult, under this procedure, to get an
effective exchange of views among Board members or to focus their
collective attention on the issues they must decide on. Hence, it has
been difficult for the Board to play the strong role it ought to in
decision-making.  Because of this it was agreed, during the loan
negotiations, that the management would propose to its Board important
changes in the decision-making process. The changes, which were approved
by BNDE's Board at its meeting on May 31, 1968, involve the abolition of
the Consultative Committee and the creation of an Executive Committee
composed of Board members. The Committee consists of seven members: the
Chairman and Director General of BNDE, two Government directors, two
private resident directors and the IFC director. Although it would have
been desirable also to have a foreign director (other than the IFC
director) on the Committee, the Government was opposed to the concept and,
in any event, no such director felt that he would be able to attend a
sufficient number of meetings to take on this responsibility. If and when
the foreign directors should be willing to take a seat on the Committee, IFC
would be ready to abandon its seat to make room. The Committee meets
about once a month and has been given powers to approve primary risk
commitments by BIDE up to a limit of DH 4 million in any single invest-
ment enterprise, and all commitments, irrespective of size, for
rediscountable, secondary risk credits. However, all matters of policy,
including any proposal for financing involving questions of policy, are
to be exclusively the preserve of the Board.
40.       These arrangements should improve the opportunity for discussion
among Board members, and between Board members and management, practically
eliminate the need for mail voting, reduce the number of projects for
consideration by the full Board to a few, important, cases to which Board
members could give the attention they deserve, and generally strengthen
the role of the Board, in session or in Committee, in the making of
decisions.



-11-
Financial Position and Results
41.       Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Position.  On the face of it,
BNDE's current position (0.60:1 at end-1967) is weak. If the short-term
notes (see paragraph 12) should, for one reason or another, not be
renewed by the insurance companies holding them, BNDE might find itself
in some temporary difficulty. The danger is not very real, however,
first, because of an understanding between BNDE and the insurance
companies that the latter would not refuse renewal unless BNDE had been
warned sufficiently long in advance and, second, because B2DE's use of
these funds, although ostensibly long-term, is to a large extent
temporary financing of loan disbursements for which BNDE already has the
Bank's undertaking for reimbursement. This is, therefore, profitable
management of short-term resources, unlikely to jeopardize BNDE's
financial position.
42.       The many weak loans and investments made and held by BNDE (see
paragraphs 29-32) are likely to result in some losses. It is almost
impossible to predict the extent of these losses, which will depend, in
considerable degree, on the future of the textile industry. It is not
considered likely, in any event, that losses will exceed the total of
BNDE's reserves, now DH 8.6 million, or 4.8% of the total portfolio.
This possibility, however, indicates that BNDE's financial position is
weak, though not critically so. It is important, therefore, that BNDE
continue to build up reserves at a rapid rate, so as to keep them at
least at the same proportionate level as now and, preferably, to increase
them.
43.       There has been a healthy excess of net cash inflow to service
BNDE's debt and BTDE should have no problems with its debt service even
if quite substantial losses occur.
44.       Profitability.  BNDE has had a structural weakness, from the
point of view of profitability, because of the large size of its equity
in proportion to borrowed funds (for short, "low leverage"; see paragraph
12). Combined with the fact that its spread on new funds, borrowed and
re-lent, is only 2% (see paragraph 14), of which administrative expenses
(having come down, in percentage of average total assets, from 2.0% in
1961 to 1.3% in 1967) take more than half, this explains the sluggish
growth of BNDE's profitability. Net profit has grown only from 4.90% in
1963, to 6.99% in 1967, on average equity, and from 4.64% to 8.83%, over
the same period, on the share capital. Because of the need to contribute
a substantial portion of earnings (665 in 1967) to reserves, only a 4%
dividend on shares could be paid for 1967. This is insufficient to make
BNDE's shares marketable, an event which was hoped for when the Bank
first lent to BNDE and when IFC became its shareholder.



-12-
45.       Because of the low spread, BNDE's profitability does not respond
well to increases ia the volume of financing and, hence, increased
leverage. The most obvious solution would therefore be to increase the
spread, by raising BNDE's lending rate of interest (7%). This possibility
has been discussed with BNDE, and with the Government. The latter will
have to approve an increase of the lending rate if BNDE is to continue
receiving the rebate on the cost of borrowings (see paragraph 14). The
Board of the Bank expressed its concern about BIDE's low lending rate of
interest in 1962, on the occasion of approving the first loan, and the
matter has been one of continuing concern since then. The Government is
not yet prepared to approve a higher rate. However, it now plans to make
a full review of the interest rate structure in Morocco, in order to lay a
basis for reviewing its position.  Reliance cannot at this time be placed
on expectation that BNDE's interest rate will be increased.
4t6.      As an immediate measure to improve BNDE's profitability, the
Government suggested, and BNDE's Board agreed, on Nlay 31, 1968, to propose
to the shareholders a reduction of BNDE's share capital by one-third, from
DH 30 million to DH 20 million., in order to increase the leverage on the
remaining share capital proportionately. The reduction was approved by a
shareholders' meeting on June 2h, 1968 and is presently under way. The
distribution of ownership will remain, with very minor adjustments, as now.
The shareholders have been given the choice between redemption in cash,
at par value, or in bonds, guaranteed by the Government, at 6% interest
repayabl3 over 10 years. The reduction of share capital is offset by a
new loan in the same amount from the Government. This loan of DH 10
million, subordinated to other debt and ranking Pari passu with share
capital, is on terms and conditions similar to the two previous Government
loans (2% interest, repayable over 15 years after 15 years of grace). The
new cash contribution of the Government in this operation is DH 5.7 million,
the remainder being provided by the Government's share in the capital
reduction.
47.       IFC has agreed to this proposal by the Government to reduce the
share capital because it will enhance BIDE's profitability and hence make
the BNDE shares which remain outstanding somewhat more attractive to
private investors, which was one of IFC's original objectives in investing
in BNDE. IFC has opted for redemption of the one-third of its shares in
cash.
48.       Effect of Changes.  To the extent shareholders are willing to
reinvest their proceeds in bonds, this will add to BNDE's long-term
resources, but the total amount is expected to be only about DH 1.7 million.
Otherwise, BNDE's resource position will be unchanged, its borrowing capacity
(based on the total of equity and quasi-equity) the same, but its capacity
to invest in shares of companies (normally limited to an amount equivalent
to the institution's own equity) reduced from about DH 39 million to about



-13-
DH 29 million. The total of paid-up equity investments and subscribed,
but as yet unpaid, investments is about D.I 20 million, so that there will
be room for only about DH 9 million more.  This, however, should enable
BNDE to make new investments at its past pace (about DH 3 million/year)
for three years more, and probably longer, as its reserves will increase
unless very heavy write-offs become necessary.
49.       The reduction of the share capital increases BIDE's ratio of
total debt to equity (as of mid-1968) from 4.4:1 to about 6.2:1. The
ratio between share capital and quasi-equity will change from DH 30/30
million now to DH 20/40 million hereafter, or from 1:1 to 1:2. The return
on share capital, as a result, will increase by about one-third, and
dividends of about 6-7% should become possible while maintaining reserves
at least in the present relationship with portfolio.
Evaluation of Improvements
50.       Adherence to stricter business criteria, strengthening of staff,
the agreement on special financing arrangements for weak projects,
strengthening of management and decision-making, taken together, should
constitute a substantial improvement of BNDE's efficiency and ability to
make sound investment decisions. Given the importance of BEDE to Morocco,
these developments should substantially improve BiNDE's ability to con-
tribute to the economic development of 1Sorocco. In addition, the structural
measure of reducing BNDE's share capital is likely to result in a higher
return on equity and may thus be a step in the direction of making BNDE's
shares more attractive to the Moroccan public. On the assumption that
the steps in process will be effective, the conclusion is that they will
rectify the weaknesses which had developed and which had threatened
adversely to affect BNDE's performance. There will, however, be a need to
continue to watch closely the progress of BNDE in all aspects of its
operational and financial performance.
V.    Prospects
Investment Outlook
51.       Trends. The shift of emphasis in B71DE financing in recent years,
away from financing of enterprises in the public sector and toward the
financing of a variety of medium- and small-sized private industrial
ventures, has produced considerable benefits to the economy in import
substitution. The opportunities for such activity in coming years appear
to be less than in the past.  Consumer markets in M4orocco are small for
many products, and are largely confined to the major cities, while the
rural population, about 80% of the whole population, has little disposable



-14-
income and still remains largely outside the monetary economy. There is
therefore now a high degree of market saturation in many of the import-
substitution consumer goods industries (e.g. textiles), but some import
substitution is no doubt still possible in some sectors. The character
of industrial financing appears to be changing towards the development of
industrial projects closely linked to Moroccan agriculture and food-
processing, and toward industries with foreign exchange earnings potential.
The latter includes tourism, which has a high priority under the Govern-
ment's five-year plan. The extent to which BNDE can continue to
participate in this sector will be an important factor in its future volume
of business.
52.       Tourism.  It is the Government's policy to centralize lending
for tourist projects through one agency, the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier
(CIH). Its preference would have been for the Bank to grant a direct
loan to the CIH for this purpose. For a number of reasons, the Bank
has not found it possible so far to lend to CIHI, but will continue to
keep the institution under review with a view to determine its suitability
as a direct borrower from the Bank.  MIeanwhile., it was agreed during loan
negotiations that the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 26, whereby BNDE
re-lends Bank funds to CIH for tourist projects, after the usual appraisal
by BADE of the project, will continue at least during the period of
commitment of the proposed Bank loan to BIDE. Projects involving direct
BNDE loans of DH 31 million ($6.2 million) are now under active study by
BNDE, anid preliminary discussions have started on further projects which
might need another DH 48 million ($9.6 million). This is about one-third
of all projects under study or discussion.
53.       Industry.  Projects for direct BNDE loans involving DH 42 million
($8.4 million) are under study at BNDE, and further possibilities for
lending DH 99 million ($19.8 million) under preliminary discussion. They
include three very large projects (a mixed-ownership beet sugar mill, a
paper pulp expansion project, and a caustic soda project linked to the
paper pulp one) which alone, if found feasible, could require DH 90 million
($18 million) of loans.
Operational and Financial Outlook
54.       Business and Resources Required in the Short Term. While all
projects now under study, in an active or preliminary way, could require
as much as DH 220 million ($44 million) of BADE funds, many of these
projects - as is normal - are not likely to materialize, others are too
big for BNDE to appraise and finance alone, and many are likely to take
considerable time before they can be carried out. In particular because
of the doubt regarding various very large projects, any forecast of likely
loan approvals by BADE is subject to great uncertainty.



55.       All things considered, BNDE Aight be able to approve loans, in
the next 12 months, for about one-third of the total under study mentioned
above, or about DH 70 million. This compares with DH 56 million in 1966
and DH 50 million in 1967, and takes into account the real possibility
that BNDE will finance portions of the very large projects under study.
In addition, BNDE might find possibilities for equity investments of some
DH 3 million.
56.       The requirements for funds to cover both a backlog of projects
already approved and the new estimated approvals of loans and investments
in the next year, appear as follows:
DH million
Backlog of projects approved                20
New loan approvals - one year               70
New equity approvals - one year              3
93
less: Surplus of internal cash
generation                           15
Net new requirements                        78
DH 78 million corresponds to $15.6 million, or rounded $15 million. As,
in the past, 85-90% of all BIDE loans have been for the financing of
imported goods, and this pattern is likely to continue, the entire $15
million would be used for imported goods and could therefore be financed
by the Bank.
57.       Longer-Range Outlook.  The forecasts contained in Annexes 9-12
are based on the assumption that DH 70 million forecast for the next year
will be a slightly higher than ordinary level of loan approvals, and that
a more normal level (including tourism lending) for the next few years
would be around DH 65 million, which is still higher than in any year so
far. Disbursements are expected to be around DH 60 million a year
(compared with DH 49 million in 1966 and DH 50 million in 1967).  If BNDE
discontinues lending to CIH for tourist projects (see paragraph 52),
approvals and disbursements are likely to drop below these estimates.
58.       Financial Structure.  If the Bank were to be the only supplier
of new long-term funds to BNDE, the Bank Group's share (including the IFC
investment) in BNDE's total non-current debt and equity would be about
64% by end-1968, 7MZ by end-1969, and 7h4, by end-1970. This suggests
that BNDE should be encouraged to obtain substantial amounts of new long-
term funds from sources other than the Bank. During the loan negotiations,
it was agreed that BNDE will actively seek to do so.



-16-
59.       As forecast, conventionral borrowings would more than double from
DH 106 million at end-1967 to DII 218 million at end-1970. The ratio of
long-term conventional borrowing to equity and quasi-equity would increase
from 1.5:1 to 3.0:1, so that by the end of 1970 BNDE would reach its
current borrowing limit.  In line with recent practice for other development
finance companies loans, the new Bank loan agreement for BNDE will exclude
from the borrowing base those maturities of quasi-equity that are payable
by BNDE before the last maturity on any Bank loan. Thus redefined, a new
borrowing limitation of h.5:1, which is slightly in excess of the old
3 to 1 ratio, is proposed for the new loan.
60.       Profitability.  While the changed capital structure (see para-
graphs 46-19-Twill have little effect on the rate of BNDE's earnings on
total resources, profitability in terms of owner's funds (equity and share
capital) is expected to increase considerably above the 1967 level:
1967     1968     1969     1970
Profit before Tax and
Provisions in relation
to Average Total Assets     2.041o   2. lQY    1.90%   1.73%
Net Profit to Average
Equity                      6.99%   10.9%    11.1%    11.2%
Net Profit to Share
Capital                     8.871/  16.2%    17.7% 19     1;
These are probably optimum forecasts, however, which assume provisions for
losses at an annual level of DH 500,000 per annum, approximately equal to
the provision made for 1967. The need for BNDE to keep its reserves at a
5-6% level of the overall portfolio will consume about two-thirds of net
profits, so that dividends of more than 6-7.o on the shares would not be
feasible.
VI.   Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusions
61.       BNDE has made a vital contribution to the development of industry
in the past and a more modest one to the development of tourism. Its
assistance, however, has been somewhat indiscriminate in character, and
sufficient weight has not always been given to the necessity of a sound
financial and economic return on investments. A better performance in these
/ This is the return on the old share capital (DH 30 million).  On the
new capital (DH 20 million), the return would have been 13.2%.



- 17 -
respects is required to make sure that scarce resources, mainly foreign
exchange, are put to effective economic uses.
62.       To achieve this, measures for strengthening of staff, manage-
ment and decision-making, and improvement of BVIDE's profitability, have
been agreed upon with BNDE. In addition, the Government has agreed to
give unconditional full guarantees for the financing of projects which
do not meet BNDE's normal criteria for investment, but which the Govern-
ment nevertheless considers should be implemented. It is reasonable to
hope, therefore, that BNDE's performance in the future will be increasingly
strong, and its use of resources effective and economic.
63.       BNDE's financial position is weaker than would have been desirable,
mainly because, by its lack of selectivity in past financing, there have
developed heavy areas of potentially high risks in its loan and investment
portfolio. Although the situation is not considered to be such as to
jeopardize BNDE's creditworthiness, it is important that BNDE continue to
build up protective reserves at a rapid rate, and that it refrain from
getting into heavier exposure in sectors under strain, such as textiles.
64.       BNDE can be considered a suitable borrower of a new Bank loan.
However, there is need to watch closely the effectiveness of the changes
introduced, or about to be introduced, as measures to improve BNDE's
performance. It would therefore be appropriate for the Bank to grant a
new loan in an amount which would meet BNDE's requirements for new
resources for a period of about one year, so that there will be an early
opportunity for a complete re-assessment of the effectiveness of the
changes mentioned and of BNDE's suitability as a continuing channel for
Bank funds into the Moroccan economy, and of the need, if any, to seek
further improvements before more Bank funds are made available.
Recommendations
0            65.       A new Bank loan to BNDE should be geared to its ability to
effectively use new foreign exchange resources for a period of about one
year. On this basis, an amount of $15 million would be suitable.
66.       The features of the proposed loan should be those normally
applied for loans to development finance companies. Hence, the proceeds
should be used to cover the foreign exchange cost of specific projects,
and the Bank's normal commitment charge would apply to the undisbursed
portion of the loan. The amortization schedule for the loan should reflect
the repayment schedules for BNDE's sub-loans or of those agreed upon
between the Bank and BN1DE for equity investments. Mo change is proposed
in the $150,000 limit which BNDE can commit from the loan for any single
project without the Bank's prior approval. The loan agreement should
stipulate a maximum ratio of total debt to equity, as these terms are now
usually defined for this purpose, of 4.5 to 1.



-18-
67.       Before the proposed new Bank loan becomes effective, the
reduction of BAIDE's share capital from DH 30 million to DH 20 million, and
a new loan of DII 10 million from the Government to BiNDE, both on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, should have entered into force.

Statement of Pblicy
(Approved by the Board of.DIi ctorsonIIarch 29, 1963, and Amended
on March 7, 1966)
1.        BIDE's general investment policy will be guided by the following
principles:
(a) 3NDE's obJective will be the encouragement of productive
investment in Morocco, chiefly in the industrial field.
To that end it will assist particularly in the financing
of private industrial enterprises to which the major
portion of its resources will be devoted.
(b) BTDE will assist a non-private enterprise only in special
circumstances, and when private capital cannot be found on
reasonable terms to carry out the project.
(c)  BNDE will assist a non-industrial enterprise only when
capital cannot be found elsewhere on reasonable terms.
An enterprise will not be considered "private" if the Government or any of
its agencies directly or indirectly hold 505 or more of its outstanding
voting stock.
2.        BNDE will consider enterprises only on the basis of their economic
and financial merits. To this end, projects will be analyzed as to their
economic desirability, technical feasibility, financial soundness, manage-
ment competence, etc., to insure that only sound productive ventures are
financed BNDE will finance only projects which:
(a) have a high economic priority, and
(b) promise to provide a satisfactory rate of return on the
investment.
BMDE wqill perform adequate supervision of the operations it finances.
3.        BEDE should, as appropriate, make use of a variety of forms of
investment, including, within the limits of sound financial practice, equity
participations, and the underwriting or participation in the underwriting
of securities sold by investment enterprises.
4.        In order to assist the development of the Moroccan capital market
BNDE should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to other private
investors, with due respect to its own interests and to those of the other
participants in the investments sold.



Annex 1
Page 2
5.       'When one or more commercial barnks narticipate with BDUDE in
lending to an enterorise, BNDE should exert every effort to ensure that
the terms of all the loans, taken together, are well suited to the
needs of the enterprise.
6.        BlADE should, whenever aniropriate, extend technical assistance
to its clients in respect of the formulation, execution and operation of
wrojects.
7.        BNDE should not make direct credits (other than those covered
by a public guaranty) or other investments for any single investment
enterprise aggregating more than 10% of BNDE's paid-up capital, reserves
and outstanding long-term Government loans.  In entering into discounting
arrangements with a commercial bank, involving contingent liabilities,
BNDE will limit the amount of its individual commitments on the basis
of its assessment of the financial position of the bank concerned and in
the light of BNDE's share capital and reserves.i/
8.        In general, BIDE should not take any single equity participation
larger than the smaller of (a) 10% of BIDE's paid-up capital and reserves
and (b) 25% of the share capital of the investment enterprise concerned.
In the case of underwritings, BNDE might take a larger commitment in the
faith that it will not in fact have to take up more than the proportion
of shares here indicated.
9.        BNDE will build reserves consistent with sound financial
practice. It will annually appropriate a portion of its income to
reserves. Appropriations will be made so as to build up total reserves
to a level that is appropriate to the size and quality of BNDE's portfolio
of loans and equity investments, while permitting the distribution of an
adequate dividend to ENDEts shareholders.  The Board of BNDE will review
every year the situation in this respect.
- BNDE's management intends to propose to its Board of Directors,on
September 2h, 1968, the following amendment of the first sentence of
paragraph 7, to which the Bank has agreed:
"BNDE should not normally make direct loans or other
investments in favor of one single enterprise aggregating
more than 10o of BlADE's paid-up capital, reserves and
outstanding long-term Government loans, with the exception
of such loans and investments which are covered by a
Government guarantee or guarantee from the Caisse Centrale
de Garanties or by a bank guarantee after examination of
the financial position of the bank concerned."
