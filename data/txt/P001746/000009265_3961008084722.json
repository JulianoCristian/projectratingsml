Related objectives are to improve local capacity to\n            allocate training resources as a function of labor market\n            demand and to increase the involvement of the private sector\n            in the management, provision and financing of VET. The\n            project will finance three components: a) the consolidation\n            of pre-service VET services, by upgrading facilities,\n            revising curricula, improving teacher quality and increasing\n            management capacity; b) the establishment of a Vocational\n            Training Support Fund to develop demand-driven,\n            employer-financed skills upgrading and apprenticeship\n            training; and c) the establishment of an Employment and\n            Training Observatory, to improve labor market information\n            analysis and dissemination."}, "docdt": "1996-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
