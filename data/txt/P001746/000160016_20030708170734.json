The project had made some contribution to the\n            vocational and technical education system, however, there\n            were issues of institutional and financial sustainability\n            for all the three components. The overall performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned that fit into the larger context of global\n            lessons are discussed. One important lesson drawn from this\n            wider context is that institutional change is an important\n            requirement for expanding vocational education ands\n            training. This lesson is very relevant in the case of the\n            project and core institutional requirements/activities for\n            the implementation of the project should have been in place\n            before the start of the project. The recommendation here is\n            that project approval dates could be extended where\n            necessary, to ensure that institutional requirements are in\n            place. Effectiveness delays and late start-up of key\n            activities e.g. the setting up the Vocational Training\n            Support Fund (VTSF) and the vocational training tax (VTT),\n            could have been avoided. From the broader context of lessons\n            learned, maintaining relationships among various partners\n            and employer groups and the vocational education and\n            training system is critical. The project should have done a\n            better job of maintaining closer and effective links with\n            stakeholders, by bringing together all components and key\n            players right from the beginning. Multiple implementing\n            agencies overseeing various components of the project made\n            coordination challenging and led to difficulties in\n            maintaining the integration of project components. Where\n            multiple agencies are involved, an understanding should be\n            reached on coordination arrangements within existing\n            institutional structures before the project starts. In cases\n            in which capacity for project coordination is weak,\n            arrangements should be made for skills transfer during\n            project implementation. The lesson here is that possible\n            barriers to ensuring effective relationships should be\n            identified very early in the project and addressed in order\n            to mitigate implementation problems. A further lesson drawn\n            is that key partners should be involved in the project\n            beginning with project preparation. For example, in the case\n            of this project, although agencies such as French\n            Cooperation and SwissContact supported vocational and\n            technical training, these agencies were not coordinated,\n            leading to each establishment working on its own.\n            Governments should be more strategic by fostering\n            partnerships with other providers, promoting social equity\n            and filling critical skills gaps. Lastly, Project planning\n            should build in flexibility to absorb changes as a result of\n            elections, institutional reshuffling and shifting of key\n            staff during project implementation. Projects should\n            anticipate the possible impact of changes in government\n            mid-stream of project implementation to ensure steady\n            project implementation.
