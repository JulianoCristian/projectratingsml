help reduce\n            power shortages there, and to replace existing generators\n            scheduled to be retired in the late 1980s, resulting in\n            substantial fuel savings.  The project provides for the\n            construction and installation at Trombay of a second 500\n            megawatt thermal power generating unit, comprising a\n            turbogenerator, a steam generator, electrical and mechanical\n            equipment, and associated works.
