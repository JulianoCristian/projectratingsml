(i) a difficult balance of payments\n            situation; (ii) inadequate public savings; (iii) sluggish\n            performance of both the industrial and agricultural sectors;\n            and (iv) an overregulated economy. In addition to improving\n            these areas, the loan includes action programs to improve\n            public administration and also aims to achieve economic\n            deregulation and export development. Deregulation will\n            permit market forces to determine more adequately the\n            allocation of scarce resources. Export development is\n            essential to the achievement of a viable balance of payments\n            in the medium term. The loan will finance imported raw\n            materials, intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer goods,\n            capital equipment and spare parts. Counterpart funds are to\n            be used for economic development related expenditures in the\n            public sector investment program."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
