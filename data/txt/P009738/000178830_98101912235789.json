The project would assist\n            IDBI in carrying out industrial sector investment studies,\n            in strengthening the financial institutions dealing with\n            this sector, namely State Industrial Development/Investment\n            Corporations (SIDC/SIICs), and in developing projects\n            particularly in the less developed States. A major benefit\n            will be to pool private and public capital and establish\n            close working links between public and private sector\n            partners in joint ventures. Better management and speedier\n            implementation of sub-projects is expexted to result.
