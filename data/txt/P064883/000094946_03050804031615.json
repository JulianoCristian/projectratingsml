The\n            project would help to alleviate rural poverty, reduce\n            pressures upon and improve management of the natural\n            resources base by: (a) increasing social capital around\n            natural resources management, through support to\n            communities, organizations and local authorities\n            (traditional and municipal) to jointly define and implement\n            a local development vision which takes natural resources\n            management and sustainability objectives into account; (b)\n            increasing opportunities to sustainably improve productivity\n            and diversify farming and other (off-farm) livelihood\n            systems; (c) extending and strengthening ongoing efforts of\n            indigenous communities to establish permanent conservation\n            areas within broader zones of biodiversity of global\n            importance and to maintain the habitats which sustain this\n            diversity; and (d) establishing and piloting a framework for\n            environmental services markets to sustain local incentives\n            for conservation. The proposed project will form a part of\n            the Government's program of interventions in the\n            implementation of the Peace Accords for the Western\n            Altiplano. As some 95% of the population of the proposed\n            project area are Mayan, the proposed project can also be\n            considered an indigenous (Mayan) peoples development\n            project. There are four project components. Component 1\n            (Sustainable Livelihoods) is oriented toward improving the\n            welfare of the rural poor through promotion of sustainable\n            use and Conservation of natural resources. The component\n            consists of two subcomponents: Subproject Grants and Local\n            Institutional Strengthening. Component 2 (Biodiversity\n            Conservation) will finance activities to strengthen local\n            and national capacity to conserve natural habitats\n            containing globally important biodiversity and other areas\n            providing locally and nationally important environmental\n            services. The component comprises activities for protection\n            of sites of global importance; intercultural environmental\n            education; and biodiversity conservation monitoring and\n            evaluation. Component 3 will (i) develop the framework for\n            policies and markets for environmental services, through the\n            elaboration of a National Strategy for Environmental\n            Services; (ii) provide local and foreign technical\n            assistance for research and special studies and training for\n            local and national officials working in areas related to\n            development of environmental services policy, legal\n            framework and pilot programs; and (iii) design and implement\n            pilot projects aimed at developing capacity, methodologies\n            and instruments for market-based incentives for provision of\n            environmental services.
