This paper uses\n            data from highland Guatemala to assess the potential for PWS\n            to reduce poverty by examining whether the recipients of\n            payments for environmental services are likely to be poor.\n            The watersheds in which PWS would be feasible due to the\n            presence of downstream water users are mapped, and compared\n            to maps of poverty rates and densities. Poverty rates vary\n            substantially in areas where PWS could be developed.
