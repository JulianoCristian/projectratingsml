This\n            report identifies the Constitutional laws and particularly,\n            the Peace Accord provisions formulated in 1996, which\n            guarantee that indigenous populations of rural areas be\n            given security of land tenancy as a basis for improving\n            their well-being and guaranteeing their liberty and dignity.\n            The Convention for the International Labor Organization and\n            other international agreements contain provisions\n            recognizing the right of indigenous peoples to ownership and\n            possession of lands traditionally belonging to them as well\n            as allocating resources to help them develop institutions\n            that will help them preserve and maintain indigenous\n            knowledge, innovations, and practices that conserve and use\n            community biodiversity in a sustainable way. The general\n            strategy for indigenous participation a) incorporates and\n            strengthens community organizations/participation at all\n            levels--municipal and regional--and communicates with\n            indigenous peoples in their own languages, and in their own\n            cultural and spiritual idioms and using their own spokesmen;\n            b) at the local level, relies on and strengthens local\n            government entities (alcaldias auxiliaries and directives\n            communitarias) so that each community's interests will\n            be legally represented; c) at the municipal level, fosters\n            the participation of local representatives from civil\n            society with municipal representatives to ensure the best\n            use of resources; and d) at the regional level, recommends\n            the structure of an association of municipalities, such as\n            an association of mayors from the project area, where every\n            department affected by the project has as a member a\n            permanent representative from each locality. Bilingual\n            indigenous interpreters should participate with each\n            association formed for a department. Consensus at the\n            municipal level as well as at the regional level is the\n            abiding principle guaranteeing participation in implementing\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
