                         Improvement in the PEFA indicator #26 (scope, nature and follow-up o f

                         management strategy i s updated annually, based on sound cost/risk analyses
                         under different scenarios, (ii)a government securities yield curve in the
                         domestic debt market i s built up, and (iii) risks embedded in guarantees
                                                                     the
                         are properly assessed and quantified on an annual basis;

Objective and     public expenditure management reforms to address poorly managed fiscal spending
Contribution to   and to help improve fiduciary conditions; (ii)public expenditure allocation reforms

                  assistance, especially for cushioning the impact of the economic crisis and enhancing
                  the coverage of the social assistance programs going forward.
                  The PE DPLl i s integrated into the proposed Country Partnership Strategy as
                  updated by the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR)
                  accompanying this operation. The proposed Operation will provide support towards
                  the accomplishment o f the objectives o f Pillar I1 of the Country Partnership Strategy
                  (CPS) - providing opportunities and broadeningparticipation in growth.
Risks and Risk    The proposed DPL series has substantial risks. Serbia went into the financial crisis
Mitigation        with a high current account deficit, aggravated by rapid foreign currency credit
                  growth and large cross-border borrowing o f domestic enterprises. An ongoing IMF
                  program hinges on ambitious fiscal adjustment targets and requires very significant
                  external financial support and private sector debt rollover. Specific risks include:
                          The global economic outlook, while improved, remains uncertain. Economic
                          risks are somewhat mitigated by the multilateral support package including
                          from the IMF enhanced stand-by arrangement of EUR 3 billion, developed
                          in close cooperation with the proposed DPL.
                          Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable balance of payments
                          financing needs over the next few years. Risks are somewhat mitigated by
                          Serbia's pursuit o f a robust agenda o f policy reform, and as above, also by
                                                                           -
                          the size o f the multilateral support package.
                          Capacity o f some public sector institutions to design and implement
                          ambitious reforms, while much improved over the past few years, remains
                          relatively weak. Improving it i s an important component o f this Operation,
                          but institutional change comes slowly. The risk mitigation strategy includes
                          attempts to mobilize relevant technical assistance where possible.
                          Political risks, while moderate, remain. The speed o f program
                          implementation could be slowed down by the existence of a broad-based
                          coalition Government; although at the same time the coalition Government
                          helps to ensure sustainability of the reform effort. The programmatic design
                          with a series of three DPLs i s intended to leave some flexibility as to the
                          pace, scope and content o f reform program. Risks are also mitigated by the
                          economic crisis which has highlighted the necessity and urgency o f r e f o h .

            IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
    PROGRAMMATIC PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                   TO THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA


                                     I.       INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed US%lOO million equivalent Programmatic Public Expenditure Development
Policy Loan (PE DPL1) to the Republic o f Serbia i s the first in a planned series of three Operations,
aiming to assist the Government of Serbia's efforts to improve productivity o f public spending and
to cushion the impact o f the economic crisis, especially on Serbia's most vulnerable. The
programmatic series, a envisaged in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) as updated by the Country
                        s
Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), i s planned to amount to at least US$200 million. These
three loans are expected to be executed sequentially during 2009-2011, and there i s an envelope of
US$lOO million equivalent for the first Operation. The proposed PE DPL series, which i s aimed at
reducing the size of Serbia's large public sector, i s complemented by a private and financial sector DPL
series, aimed at facilitating the growth o f the private sector, through enhancing the business enabling
environment, strengthening financial discipline and building a more efficient and stable financial sector.

2.       With a relatively large public sector already going into the crisis, expenditure
reprioritization and a reduction of current expenditures will be critical over the medium term,
especially amid Government plans to increase spending on needed infrastructure. The objective of
the proposed PE DPLl i s to support reforms that will help improve the productivity o f public spending,
structured around three key policy areas: (i) public expenditure management reforms to address poorly
managed fiscal spending and to help improve fiduciary conditions; (ii)     public expenditure allocation
reforms to improve the quality o f spending in the largest spending sectors; and (iii) social assistance,
especially for cushioning the impact o f the economic crisis and enhancing the coverage o f the programs
going forward.

3.       The proposed PE D P L l (the preparation of which started prior to the onset of the financial
crisis) focuses on public expenditure management reforms. Going forward, the proposed PE DPL2
focuses on expenditure rationalization measures targeting the public administration wage bill and the
pension bill, where crisis-related nominal freezes are currently in place, and medium-term reform issues
take on particular urgency. The proposed PE DPL3 focuses on expenditure rationalization in the social
sectors, including payment reform in health and rationalization o f the school network - areas where
potential fiscal savings are the largest as per recently completed Bank Analytical Work (see IV.E).

4.      The Operation has been conceived within the context of the Country Partnership Strategy
Progress Report (CPSPR) to accommodate the need for additional budgetary and liquidity support
occasioned by the global economic crisis. The total lending envelope for Serbia has been increased by
US$300 million beyond the original Country Partnership Strategy allocation. This additional lending i s to
be allocated to development policy lending which would help meet Serbia's medium term financing
needs. The proposed Operation would be part o f a coordinated financing package with the IMF and the
European Commission.
                                   11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                   A.       POLITICAL CONTEXT

5.       Last year brought some degree of political stability although the on-going international
economic crisis i s bringing new challenges. In 2008 there were both presidential and parliamentary
elections which resulted in pro-EU political parties gaining a majority and holding the presidency. Serbia
signed and ratified a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which i s a significant
step towards gaining candidacy status and eventual full membership. In addition, and ahead of ratification
of the SAA by EU member states, Serbia decided to implement the part of the agreement related to
liberalization of trade. The relatively broad coalition that forms the current Government has over the past
year handled a number of serious political issues (including the arrest of some of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indictees) and economic challenges (including the
impact of the international financial crisis).

                         B.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Pre-crisis

6.      The economy grew strongly until 2008, fuelled by both exports and domestic demand, and
on the back of significant economic changes since 2000. Real growth o f gross domestic product (GDP)
averaged 6.2 percent in 2007 and 2008. Growth was fueled by high demand linked to a significant credit
boom and increases in real wages. Output has risen in real terms by nearly 50 percent since 2000, as the
corporate sector started to post profits and the banking sector was restructured. The positive supply
response also appears to reflect increases in productivity and output o f recently privatized and de novo
firms, as evidenced by the particularly rapid rates of output growth in precisely those sectors which have
recently undergone extensive privatization (e.g., steel, cement, retail trade, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar
and banking) or attracted foreign investors.

7.       But strong economic growth was accompanied by a widening current account deficit and
increasing private sector debt. Although exports grew rapidly, domestic demand grew even faster which
resulted in very high import levels and consequently a trade deficit reaching about 22 percent of GDP.
The current account deficit reached 17.1 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 8.7 percent in 2005:Most of
the increase in the current account deficit (CAD) was due to the increase in the private sector's share in
the savings-investment balance; indeed, the private sector accounted for 90 percent of the current account
deficit in 2008. In 2008, FDI reached an estimated 5.4 percent o f GDP and the outflow of portfolio
investment (mainly in the last quarter) was equal to 0.3 percent o f GDP. A surge in bank and enterprise
borrowing from abroad led to a large surplus in the capital account, boosting gross international reserves
through the first quarter of 2008, when reserves reached US$15 billion (or 9 months of imports). Later in
the year, reserves declined somewhat and at the end of the year were USD 11.5 billion (or 7.4 months of
import).

8.       Rapid credit growth in the banking sector (primarily in FX-indexed loans) and increased
cross-border borrowing o f domestic enterprises was a key factor in the overheating o f the economy.
While deposits grew, lending outpaced the growth in deposits with the loan to deposit ratio increasing
from 99 percent at the end o f 2007 to 125 percent at the end o f 2008. In addition, since 2007 Serbian
enterprises owed more to parent banks than to local banks (by 20 percent) and that increased further to a
43 percent higher stock o f debt to foreign than to local banks at the end of 2008.

9.       Domestic overheating and external imbalances were not sufficiently counterbalanced by
fiscal policies between 2005 and 2008. The fiscal balance o f the consolidated government sector moved
from a surplus in 2005 o f 0.8 percent o f GDP to a deficit o f 1.9 percent o f GDP in 2007 - and then further
to a 2.5 percent deficit in 2008. While expenditures decreased in the last couple o f years comparing to the
peak in 2006, revenues are also lower. The drop in fiscal revenues from 2005 to 2008 (from 42.9 percent
o f GDP to 40.9 percent) i s primarily due to lower collection o f VAT, excises and personal income tax
revenues - especially in the final quarter o f 2008. Capital revenues also decreased sharply. Serbia's social
insurance funds covering health, pensions and unemployment, which have run deficits o f over 5 percent
o f GDP since 2007, were key factors in the deteriorating fiscal performance o f the consolidated general
government. Shortfalls in these funds were covered by transfers from the central government, with the
largest transfer for pensions (5 percent o f GDP in 2008).

10.     Economic growth helped to reduce poverty. Poverty in Serbia fell from 12.7 percent o f the
population in 2004 to 6.3 percent in 2008, which translates to over 400,000 people rising above the
poverty line.' Increases in salaries, pensions, and social transfers, the main income sources for poor
households, drove this reduction. These improvements, however, are not even throughout Serbia: poverty
i s markedly higher in rural areas-home to about two thirds o f all poor Serbians-and among vulnerable
groups, particularly refugees and internally displaced people. Poverty i s also strongly correlated with the
education level o f the head o f household.

Crisis Impact and Economic Developments in 2009

 11.     Economic activity fell sharply in the final quarter of 2008 and in 2009, due to plummeting
activity in the tradables sector. Growth in the last quarter o f 2008 declined to 2.8 percent (y-o-y) as
compared to an average growth rate o f 6.5 percent in the previous three quarters. Preliminary estimates
for the first half o f 2009 suggest a decline in real GDP o f about 4 percent, comparing to the same period
o f 2008. Industrial output was about 17.5 percent lower in the first half o f 2009 compared to the same
period in 2008. More recent industrial production and trade indicators suggest that output i s stabilizing in
the second half o f 2009, indicating a full-year real GDP contraction o f about -4 percent.

12.      Inflation pressures are receding somewhat, albeit from a high level. Serbia entered the crisis
period with relatively high inflation at above 10 percent (in the last quarter o f 2008). CPI inflation
declined to 8 percent in August, down from 8.5 percent in July, mainly on account o f decelerating food
and utility prices. The CPI i s well inside the National Bank o f Serbia (NBS) 6-10 percent target band.
Alongside, the NBS has continued its policy o f gradual easing, reducing i t s policy rate to 12 percent in
July, down from 17% percent in January. The impact on inflation o f a 20 percent depreciation o f the dinar
against the euro in late 2008 was limited, supporting the adjustment o f the external accounts.

13.       The current account deficit i s forecast to decline to 9.0 percent in 2009, down from 17.1
percent in 2008. The collapse in external trade, with imports (particularly o f intermediate and capital
goods) falling particularly steeply, has triggered a correction o f the external account deficit in the first
half o f 2009. Exports in the second quarter o f 2009 were lower by 32 percent while imports continued to
decline even more and were down 41 percent compared to the same quarter o f 2008. External adjustment
has also been assisted by unusually strong unrecorded remittances, and more recently, some recovery in
exports. Capital inflows have turned positive again since February 2009 and the dinar exchange rate has
been roughly stable in 2009, after a twenty percent depreciation in late 2008.

 14.    The banking system has weathered the external shocks so far, and foreign banks have
maintained their exposure to Serbia. The large share o f FX or FX-indexed loans in the portfolios o f
Serbian banks i s a cause o f concern (about 75 percent o f all loans) and NPLs are increasing (increase
from 4.7 as o f beginning o f the year to 7.3 percent o f the total stock o f loans by the end o f July).
However, the risks have been tempered somewhat by the banking system's large share o f liquid assets
(24.7 percent as o f July 2009) and capital buffers (Capital Adequacy Ratio o f 21.2 percent as o f June).
Foreign banks are proving key to maintaining financial sustainability, and are maintaining their exposure
to Serbia.

forthcoming). Source: Staff calculations using 2008 HBS data and Serbia Poverty Update (2007) for the 2004
estimates. Since 2003 Serbia has moved to using HBS as the source o f poverty monitoring. However, the country
has also carried out three years of LSMS: 2002, 2003 and 2007, and the poverty estimates using this series show a
similar trend in poverty reduction - that poverty declined from 13.6 to 6.6 percent between 2002 and 2007.

 15.       The original 2009 budget approved in late 2008 was followed by a supplementary budget
approved in May 2009 to rein in the rising fiscal imbalances that followed the effects of the crisis on
tax revenues. This involved a massive fiscal adjustment equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP (EUR
 1.1 billion). Key measures are summarized in Box 1 below and include wage cuts for higher wage staff
and a nominal freeze in the wages of all other public employees (a nominal pension freeze had already
been implemented earlier in the year), a freeze of new hiring in the public sector, a 15 percent cut in
transfers to local governments, and sharp reductions in the discretionary budget of all budget users. The
revised budget ensured protection of social spending and envisages an increase in the allocation for
unemployment benefits. Other than some delays in the transfers of dividends and other non-tax revenues
and complications with enforcing the wage freeze in some public enterprises and local governments,
recent budget data seem to confirm that these measures have generally been well implemented and are
containing spending under the Republican budget.

 Box 1: Serbian Government Measures o f Fiscal Adjustment in May 2009 Supplementary Budget

 Measures on the expenditure side are intended to save RSD 74 billion (2.5 percent of GDP). These include:
 -  Cutting discretionary expenditures on goods and services, subsidies, capital and net lending o f all budget

 -   Wages fi-eeze in the administration at all levels o f government (RSD 13 billion). In addition public
     employees with wages over RSD 40,000 per month will have their nominal wages cut by 10 percent; those
     with wages over RSD 100,000, by 15 percent (ofthe amount over RSD 40,000.) This measure should bring
     in an additional RSD 1-2 billion.

 Measures on the revenue side are intended to raise a additional RSD 25 billion (0.9 percent o f GDP). These
 include:
 -    The transfer o f all net profits o f public enterprises to the budget (RSD 5 billion)
 -    Increase o f excises for fuel (RSD 4 billion)

 - Strengtheningtax administration (RSD 7 billion)
 16.     As has happened in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, public revenues
suffered significantly from the impact of the crisis; in Serbia's case the decline also reflects the
implementation of the Interim trade Agreement with the EU which eliminated most of the import
duties on the goods coming from the EU. As a result, VAT revenues were 10 percent lower in the first
half of the year comparing to the same period o f 2008 and customs revenues were 26 percent lower than
in the same period last year. The original fiscal target for 2009 was a deficit target of 3 percent of GDP.
By the summer however, and given the outturn for the first half o f the year, this deficit target proved out
of reach. The target for the consolidated general government deficit was missed by 0.9 percent of GDP, it
i s worth noting that this reflects solely the effect of the decline in economic activity in government
revenues. In fact, the spending execution remained in line with the IMF-supportedprogram, there was no
significant arrears accumulation, and the indicative ceiling on recurrent spending (of the Serbian
Republican Budget, in billions o f dinars) was met. More recent revenue data indicate an improvement.
As of early October 2009, revenues are 0.2 percent higher in nominal terms than they were for the same
time last year.

 17.    The growth slowdown is expected to lead to higher poverty rates. Between 2004 and 2008,
the fraction of the poor below the poverty line declined by half. However, with economic growth
projected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 from 6 percent growth rate in 2008, the fraction of the poor i s
expected to increase. Simulations based on data from the most recent household budget survey ( H B S



                                                            5
2008) shows that even a 5 percent decrease in the incomes o f those above the poverty line will increase
poverty by 1.4 percentage points, roughly 90,000 more people. Three transmission channels of the crisis
are likely to be the main sources of income declines. First, with industrial production and exports falling
sharply in late 2008 and early 2009, some workers will lose their jobs. Second, as the crisis continues the
inflow of remittances from the EU might fall due to the recession in those countries, even if at least in the
first 6 months o f 2009 they have risen by 6 percent compared to the same period in 2008. Finally, since
there i s a large fraction of the population in the informal economy, the decline in aggregate demand will
depress these group's incomes through second round effects. Reduced access to credit because of the
global credit crunch i s further impacting consumption.

 18.     The IMF i s providing substantial support to Serbia through an augmented standby
arrangement (SBA). The IMF had approved a 15-month stand-by arrangement for SDR 350.8 million
on January 16, 2009. It was a precautionary program amounting to 75 percent of Serbia's quota. In the
following months, the continued deterioration o f the macroeconomic environment led the authorities to
seek a strengthened economic program that could be supported by an extension and augmentation of the
stand-by arrangement. On May 15,2009, the IMF approved an augmented arrangement for some SDR 2.6
billion (around 3 billion, or 10 percent of GDP). The program period was extended to 27 months and the
arrangement was no longer considered precautionary. The core of the program i s a large and balanced
fiscal adjustment package to contain the 2009 deficit to sustainable levels. Measures include cuts in
recurrent expenditure and nominal freezes-although with protection of social spending-and mostly
temporary revenue increases. A second component i s that foreign banks have been asked to provide
voluntary assurances to broadly maintain their commitment to Serbia and keep their subsidiaries well
capitalized.

19.     The second and third reviews o f the program are expected to be concluded at the staff level
in early November. In August 2009, the IMF and the Authorities agreed to revise targets for 2009 and to
postpone the completion o f the second review, combining it with the third review. These reviews are
expected to be concluded at the staff level in early November; and to be discussed at the IMF Board in
December 2009.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

20.     The Bank i s satisfied with the adequacy of Serbia's macroeconomic policy framework.

21.     Serbia i s targeting a fiscal deficit of about 4 percent of GDP in 2010, with gradually
declining deficits afterwards. Further fiscal measures of about 1.5 percent o f GDP in 20 10 and medium-
term expenditure reforms will be critical in bringing down public spending levels over the medium term,
although the savings that such measures can produce in 2010 are limited. Significant fiscal adjustment can
be expected only in the outer years, once the lags and upfront costs associated with expenditure
restructuring have been overcome.

22.     The Government has already committed to a significant set o f expenditure rationalization
measures in 2010, which amount to estimated savings o f 0.75 percent o f GDP in 2010. Measures
include:

        a.    Extension o the 2009 pension and civil service nominal wage freezes. Serbia was one o f
                           f
              the first countries in ECA to respond to the crisis by freezing wages of civil servants (and
              reducing those o f the highest paid, see Box 1). This measure will remain in place for 2010
              as well, in a macroeconomic environment where inflation has been in the 6-7 percent range.
              In addition, Serbia was one of the few ECA countries to introduce a nominal pension
              freeze, which has also been extended to 2010 (this measure was recognized by the PER as



                                                     6
             one of the most important measures, both from a policy and from a fiscal savings
             perspective).

       b.    Nominal freezes and cuts for almost all items o the current expenditures. In particular,
                                                                f
             these will be applied to a large portion of spending on goods and services, subsidies (with a
             cut in the subsidy to the railroad company), and untargeted transfers to households and
             lower levels of government; targeted social spending on family and child allowances would
             remain protected.

       c.    Public sector rationalization. The Government adopted the Law on Defining the
             Maximum Number o f Public Sector Employees in October 2009, which lays the legal basis
             for the authorities to significantly reduce the size of the public administration as per 1
             January 2010. Preliminary estimates suggest that there will be a cut o f up to 14,000
             employees leading to savings equivalent to 0.2-0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 (after severance
             costs; savings will be higher in subsequent years).

23.    Options for further savings to reach the targeted fiscal adjustment are being discussed in
the context o f the finalization of the 2010 budget (to be approved by Cabinet by November 1, and by
Parliament in the course of December 2009). These include:

       a.    Frontloading Pension Reform. A new draft pension law i s planned to be ready for
             submission to Parliament in December, supported by a proposed PE DPL2, with key
             measures including raising the retirement age for women; tightening early retirement limits
             combined with actuarially fair penalties; and reducing the extra service credit for women.
             In addition, any changes in the existing system of pension indexation-after i t s temporary
             suspension in the context of nominal freezes of public wages and pensions in 2009-10-
             will be designed to substantially reduce over the medium term the financial transfers
             needed from the budget to finance the pension fund. Savings would be limited in 2010, but
             the reform would nonetheless be significant in reaffirming a sustainable medium-term
             trajectory of the fiscal deficit path.

       b.    Rationalizing Capital Spending in 2010. Although high quality public investment
             spending, in particular on infrastructure, i s critical for Serbia's growth and development
             over the medium term, there i s some room to rationalize the proposed plans for capital
             spending in 2010, in particular o f spending under the National Investment Program.
             According to initial estimates for the 2010 budget, capital expenditures were forecast to
             increase to 3.8 percent of GDP next year, which appears ambitious given 2.9 percent in
             2009. The Bank has indicated support of a downward revision o f capital spending by 0.3
             percent of GDP.

       c.    Accelerating the Rationalization of Social Service Provision. This includes provider
             payment reform in health and changes in resource allocation mechanisms to schools-areas
             where potential fiscal savings are largest as per recently completed Bank analytical work.

24.      The fiscal deficit i s projected to decline to 2.5 percent o f GDP by 2012. Revenues are forecast
to decline reflecting durably lower VAT collections (as consumption i s projected to fall relative to GDP)
and lower customs revenue (in part reflecting the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with
the EU). Nevertheless, revenue performance should be boosted by further efforts to improve the tax
                            s
administration as well a possible initiatives to strengthen public enterprise oversight to better control
expenditures and reduce subsidies. Under the structural reforms supported by the program, improvements
on the public expenditure side are expected over the medium term, thus leading to declining fiscal deficits
in spite o f the declining revenue to GDP ratio going forward.

25.       Serbia's GDP i s projected to pick up starting in 2010 (1.5 percent), having declined by 4
percent in 2009. Growth o f about 3-5 percent i s expected in 201 1-2012. The return to robust and more
balanced growth over the medium term i s predicated on a turnaround in global growth, but also on
structural reforms to make the economy more competitive and more export oriented. Private consumption
i s projected to gradually decline from the pre-crisis levels o f about 78 percent o f GDP to about 73 percent
by 2012. This reduction in the share o f private sector consumption in GDP would lead to higher domestic
savings consequently reducing the size o f the current account deficit over the medium term. Following a
significant drop in 2009, private sector investments are forecast to increase in 2010 and grow robustly
throughout the projection period, therefore contributing to GDP real growth by about 1.4 percentage point
each year throughout the projections period. The exchange rate i s projected to depreciate only gradually
in nominal terms thus leading to appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, on the back o f the
significant nominal depreciation o f the dinar against euro in the last quarter o f 2008.

 Note: Out o f total projected disbursement o f USD 5.3 and 6.1 billion in 2009 and 2010, respectively; IFIs are
 expected to disburse USD 1.6 and 2 billion. These amounts exclude IMF which i s projected to disburse this year
 USD 3 and in 20 10 USD 1.2 billion.

26.      Significant external adjustment i s forecast. The current account deficit i s projected to fall from
 17.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 7.2 percent by the end o f 2012. As with other countries in the
region, there has already been a marked reversal in the private sector imbalances, with the current account
deficit expected to decline by 8 percentage points of GDP. This adjustment process has been driven in the
near term by a sharp import decline arising from the drop in domestic demand, and over the medium term
by renewed export growth and increased worker remittances. Capital inflows are expected to cover about
47 percent of the current account deficit between 2009 and 2012, though a significantly smaller share in
2009 and 20 10. After a significant decline o f official foreign currency reserves in the second half of 2008,
these are projected to increase over the projections period. Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces
considerable balance of payments financing needs over the next 18 months. As estimated by the IMF,
Serbia's gross financing needs amount to EUR 8.26 billion in 2009 and EUR 8.95 billion in 2010. These
high financing requirements come primarily due to the fact that Serbia needs to amortize external debt o f
EUR 4.8 billion in calendar years 2009 and 2010. The remaining gap i s envisaged to be closed by IMF
financing which for this year amounts to 7 percent o f GDP, and by Bank and EC assistance.

27.      Public and external debt i s forecast to remain sustainable, and debt ratios would start
declining by 2011. Public debt i s projected to increase in 2009 and 2010, peaking at 32.6 percent, and i s
forecast to gradually decline afterwards. The increase in public debt will stem from increased borrowing
from both domestic sources and from international financial organizations in 2009 and 2010. As in other
countries in the region, total external debt i s projected to rise over the next two years, peaking at about
80.1 percent of GDP at the end o f 201 1, before gradually declining in the outer years. Most of the
increase in external debt i s due to increased public sector borrowing from abroad including from the IMF.
(The IMF's SBA accounts for about 10 percent of 2009 GDP, although i t does not add to public debt as it
i s not being used to finance larger fiscal deficits but to increase FX reserves). In addition, significant
disbursement from IFIs for the implementation of several major infrastructure projects, including
highway Corridor 10, i s expected. The stock of private sector external debt will also increase over the
projections period, but at a much slower rate than in previous years, from 45 percent o f GDP at the end of
2008 to a projected 50.7 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2012. Strong policies and structural reforms
supported under the program would lead to a resumption of growth and improved public and external
balances, underpinning the declining path o f public and external debt in the outer years.



                                                        9
28.       The external debt service financing requirement will be high over the upcoming period. Due
to the relatively short maturity of private external debt and decreases in the denominator, debt service as
shares o f GDP and exports i s expected to rise significantly. Serbia will thus need to spend annually on
average about 15 percent o f its projected GDP to amortize its external debt in the period 2009-2012; the
ratio o f short-term external debt (on a remaining maturity basis) to FX reserves i s 20 percent as of August
2009 (down from nearly 30 percent as o f end-2008). Securing funds to cover this high financing
requirement will be a priority for policymakers. The authorities have launched a Financial Sector Support
Program (FSSP), in which large private sector creditors-notably the foreign parent banks o f the major
banks-have been encouraged to maintain their exposures to Serbia, and they have responded favorably
so far. IBRD debt as a share o f external debt will decline to about 5.6 percent in 2012 (from 7.2 percent at
the end of 2008). Debt service to the IBRD will represent on average about 1.7 percent of total debt
service during 2009-2012.

29.      Standardized public debt stress tests show that Serbia's debt i s particularly exposed to
exchange rate and growth shocks. A 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate would increase
the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 10 percentage points by 2012, given that 90 percent of the debt i s
denominated in foreign currency (comprising mainly debt for frozen currency deposit and debt to
multilaterals and Paris Club o f creditors). Also, assuming standard "combined shock" test (half a
standard-deviationshocks to growth and the primary fiscal balance), the public debt stock would increase
by 3 percentage points of GDP, by the end o f projections period. Similarly, external debt sustainability
primarily depends on the exchange rate shocks. Further real depreciation o f 30 percent (on top o f real
depreciation o f nearly 19 percent from the period October 2008-January 2009) would increase share o f
external in debt by over 30 percentage points. So called "combined shock'' i.e. permanent 1/2 standard
deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance, would increase the
share o f external debt in GDP by 6 percentage point but still not endangering the sustainability o f the
external debt.

30.     The outlook i s subject to significant uncertainties. The main uncertainty on the external side i s
a slower than expected recovery in the EU which will continue to suppress demand for exports and capital
inflows. On the domestic front, both political and implementation risks emanate from the resolve and
capability o f the Government to prepare and implement short and medium-term public expenditure
reforms. At this juncture it i s particularly critical to move beyond immediate cuts in spending (i.e.
reduction o f the public sector employment, cuts in discretionary expenditures etc) and to also move

forward on structural reforms that will bring savings over the medium term, and supporting this will be
the focus o f the proposed DPL series. Although debt levels are forecast to start to decline in 201 1, the
risks associated with such debt levels remain high, however, not least because o f an uneven record o f
structural reforms in the past.


                            111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

3 1.    The strategic setting for reforms in Serbia i s to a large extent defined by the ongoing work
on Serbia's integration into the EU. The latest strategic document that defines the agenda o f EU
integration i s contained in the National Plan for Integration, in 2008. This detailed document explains the
Government's priorities for the harmonization o f Serbia's institutional and legal framework with the EU.2

32.      While navigating carefully through the current crisis, Government o f Serbia (GOS) i s
planning more fundamental reforms over the medium term to promote systems o f public
expenditure planning and management that respond to the longer term development needs of the
country and to exploit opportunities for expenditure savings through productivity increases in the
largest spending sectors. With a relatively large public presence in the economy already, efficiency and
cost effectiveness must be sought in the provision o f public services, and the management o f public debt,
and be supported by improved expenditure monitoring and control systems. The measures taken in the
supplementary budget, while effective in the short term, are not necessarily sustainable over time.
Eventually, more lasting systems o f pension indexation and public sector pay and employment will need
to be put in place and balanced against the substantial public infrastructure investment needs, including
those related to EU accession.

33.        Support for medium-term reforms i s key as the level o f public spending in Serbia remains
high relative to other countries in the region o f similar levels of income. Table 5 demonstrates the
economic classification o f consolidated general government expenditures. Capital spending as a share o f
GDP has been increasing in recent years, from 2.7 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 4.0 percent in 2008,
although i t i s still below the levels for other countries at similar stages o f development. While recurrent
spending as a share o f GDP has been roughly constant, there have been important shifts within recurrent
expenditures: while subsidies and interest payments have been declining quite sharply, transfers to
households (and pension payments in particular) have been on the increase. The public sector wage bill
has been in .excess o f ten percent of GDP throughout the past five years, with an increase in 2008.

35.     The Government's reform program in support of more fundamental and medium-term
reforms can be structured in three pillars. (i) public expenditure management reforms t o address
excessive and poorly managed fiscal spending with a particular focus on fiduciary issues; (ii)public
expenditure allocation reforms in the largest spending programs where crisis-related IMF-supported
nominal freezes are in place in the short-term and the design o f the medium-term reforms package i s
currently particularly critical; and (iii)
                                         social assistance to cushion the impact o f the current crisis and to
enhance the coverage o f the programs going forward.

PILLAR I-PUBLIC EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT REFORMS

Policy area 1.a: Putting in place a more comprehensive, integrated medium-term planning and
budgetingframework.

36.     Significant progress in improving public expenditure planning and management has been
made in recent years. The 2007 Public Financial Management Assessment and the more recent 2008
IMF report on public financial management reforms acknowledged progress achieved in budget
preparation, payment controls and improving the quality and scope o f information on the budget. An
important element o f this improvement was the establishment o f the 2002 Budget Systems Law (BSL)
with the inclusion of requirements for a Budget Memorandum (BM), an explicit budget calendar and
provisions for a medium term planning and expenditure framework, amongst other improvements.

37.      A number o f problems remain. Sector strategies are prepared for all key sectors. But in most
cases they do not include costing of investments and recurrent expenditure. Moreover, this strategic
planning phase i s not recognized in the current budget calendar and line ministries are given little time for
medium-term planning and budgeting under a medium-term budget constraint. Presently the B M i s
almost exclusively produced by the responsible department of the MOF, with little involvement of policy-
makers and other departments. Approval o f the indicative ceilings in the B M takes place before budget
beneficiaries have completed their submissions. The value o f the B M could be further enhanced by
providing indicative ceilings on a functional as well per economic and administrative classification. In
addition, determination o f the budget envelopes should be made within a considerationof the fiscal stance
o f the overall public sector (rather than central Government only).

38.     Currently, the budgets o f the central Government (on higher level of aggregation, i.e. using
the one-digit economic classification), as well as the three large extra-budgetary funds, are
presented in the budget memorandum. Including the sub-national governments (which are otherwise
already integrated in the Single Treasury Account) will provide a better basis to determine fiscal policy.
Several o f the benchmarks for the PE DPLl center on incorporation in the new BSL of features to bring
about improvements in these areas o f budget comprehensiveness. The new BSL will apply to a large
extent for the preparation o f the 2010 budget, and more extensively for the preparation of the 201 1
budget.

39.      Despite progress to date, the GOS recognized the need for further reforms. Although the
2002 BSL provided a good beginning, some of the important elements were not fully implemented, for
example, the medium term expenditure framework. Moreover, the 2002 BSL was unable to deal with
developments since i t s establishment, contains some ambiguities and inconsistency with other financial
management legislation and regulation. It did provide sufficient foundation for meeting EU accession
requirements or for effective achievement o f the Government's fiscal and budgetary objectives. The IMF
concluded in its December 2007 report that several important areas o f Serbia's PFM system require
further reform including budget coverage, preparation and execution, accounting and fiscal reporting,
internal control and external audit, and debt and cash management.

40.     The Government developed a set o f financial management improvements which were
included in a new BSL approved by the National Assembly in July 2009. The new BSL builds on
experience since the introduction of the 2002 BSL, and i s being reinforced by changes in complementary
financial legislation, regulations, and institutional and administrative changes. The package o f financial
management, accountability and reporting reforms embedded in the new BSL underpin a core theme o f
this DPL. Introduction of the new law, and just as importantly, measures to fully implement the
provisions and build the necessary capacity within public sector bodies to manage and achieve the
objectives o f reform are core elements o f the next two phases of the DPL program. In regard to public


                                                     13
expenditure planning and management, the DPL program focuses on achievement o f more comprehensive
information on revenue and expenditure, improved policy coordination, full implementation o f MTEF
requirements in budget organizations, establishment o f national investment planning within the strategic
phase o f the budget and improved monitoring o f extra-budgetary funds. The key elements o f the BSL
reform package are summarized in Box 2 below.

41.     The Government i s receiving technical support from the EC and IMF on budget planning
and preparation which i s targeted at following up on reforms introduced in the new BSL, including
those relating to changes in the Budget Memorandum and the development o f a medium term fiscal and
budget management framework.

Box 2: Key Elements of the Reform Package Incorporated in the New BSL.

      Expanded coverage o f the budget law to include bodies and activities not effectively controlled under the
      previous law, including extra-budgetary funds, and sub-national government finances;

      Establishment o f clear and appropriate objectives for the budget to achieve fiscal sustainability, efficient and
      effective resource management, low inflation and transparency o f government finance;

      Strengthened reporting to Government and the National Assembly, including a new requirement for six-
      monthly reporting to the National Assembly on budget execution, preparation o f consolidated, whole o f
      government financial statements and a requirement for financial reporting in accordance with international
      standards;

      Increased coverage and rigor in reporting o f fiscal strategy in the budget memorandum, including new
      provisions on reporting and measuring fiscal risks and contingent liabilities, strategy for managing public
      debt and explicit identificationo f national investment priorities;

      Enhanced budget calendar to include recognition o f a strategic phase preceding the setting o f ceilings for
      budget beneficiaries, and inclusion o f national investment priorities as explicit activities during the budget
      preparation phase;

      Explicit implementation deadlines for the medium term expenditure framework and program budgets in direct
      budget beneficiary financial plans and specific requirements on the contents o f financial plans covering
      explanation o f expenditures and outflows and national investment priorities;

      Introduction o f a national investment planning and coordination framework, integrated into the budget
      calendar and budget memorandum;

      New provisions establishing public internal financial control and internal audit arrangements, along with
      revised arrangements for budget inspection; and

      Improvements in classification and measurement o f public finances, including revenue and expenditure
      concepts, own-source revenue, budget surplus/deficit and the general government sector.


Policy area 1.b. Improving public expenditure monitoring and control (covering externavinternal audit
and procurement)

Budget Execution, Internal Control, and Internal Audit

42.    The GOS has undertaken a number o f steps to improve public expenditure execution
including implementation of a Modernized Treasury System (MTS) leading to a significant



                                                         14
improvement in the control and auditing environment for Serbia. This will provide treasury services
for all budget beneficiaries through a comprehensive Treasury Single Account (TSA) system. The MTS i s
integrated with the central payments system used by all direct and indirect budget beneficiaries. The
Government has connected a l l direct budget beneficiaries to the new MTS for recording o f receipts and
payments information, which i s mandatory for authorization of payments. Indirect budget beneficiaries
continue to use the central payments system and their financial information i s consolidated by parent
ministries for reporting purposes.

43.      There remains considerable scope for further work to broaden accessibility of the system
for indirect users and development o f the necessary skills to use the system. Further work i s also
needed to ensure that direct budget beneficiaries are using the system as intended and are making
efficiency gains by relying on the central system more and reducing or removing dependence on ministry-
specific systems. Accounting and reporting arrangements remain problematic, with different procedures
being undertaken across budget beneficiaries, significant departures between accounting and reporting
requirements in Serbia and international standards, and ambiguity in requirements for financial
information, particularly non-cash information, making it difficult to interpret financial statements and
reports.

44.     The new BSL provides a basis for establishing common practices for accounting and
reporting using international accounting standards. This may also require modification o f the MTS to
accommodate adoption o f consistent international accounting standards. Subsequent phases of this DPL
program will include steps towards full adoption of international accounting standards suitable for the
public sector in Serbia.

45.     Institutional arrangements for internal audit are at an early stage in Serbia, although ex-
post inspection has been a strong feature of financial control arrangements for decades. Actions to
adopt European Union requirements under the acquis communautaire and pre-accession obligations have
involved considerable work on a strategy to strengthen internal control and auditing arrangements in
Serbia. The Ministry o f Finance has a department for internal audits, which i s responsible for
coordination o f efforts to adopt EU pre-accession requirements, including the establishment of the Central
Harmonization Unit, which i s provided for in the new Budget System Law. Within the central
Government administration, more than 100 internal controllers and auditors have already been appointed
at 25 budget beneficiaries. The EAR has financed the training o f approximately 300 public servants in
aspects o f internal auditing and public internal financial control. However more training will be required
for those people to attain certification standards. The EC i s planning to assist the Government in
implementing public internal financial control and internal audit reforms as well as supporting to the
Treasury for refining aspects of the MTS (para 34 above).

46.     There remains considerable room for improvement in arrangements for internal audit
across the general government sector in Serbia. The Government's commitment to meet the pre-
accession requirement for the European Union offers strong motivation to achieve the public internal
financial control requirements of the acquis. However, providing effective legal and institutional
arrangements will need to be accompanied by considerable and rapid expansion of the number of
qualified staff to deliver adequate internal auditing arrangements. Even when there are sufficient numbers
o f adequately skilled audit staff across the general government sector, and in each major organization, the
value o f those arrangements will only be realized when reports are produced pertaining to all major
financial risks and the recommendations o f those reports are implemented by the organizations concerned.
The Government has agreed to a peer review o f i t s public internal financial control arrangements by the
European Union later in 2009 as a basis for planning and implementingthe next phase o f development.




                                                    15
47.      There will also need to be effective communication and cooperation between internal audit
bodies within Government bodies and the State Audit Institution (SAI). This will require the State
Audit Institution to be fully operational and functioning at optimal capacity in addition to the achievement
o f necessary strengthening of internal audit arrangements. The subsequent phases o f this program include
a focus on achievement o f required capacity for delivery o f audit reports across all five areas of SA1
responsibility, particularly in relation to audit o f the Republic o f Serbia financial statements.

Public Procurement

48.      The Parliament adopted a new Public Procurement Law (PPL) in December 2008. Before
that the public procurement in Serbia was governed by the PPL o f July 13, 2002, as amended on July 1,
2004. The new PPL should contribute to an improvement in tender performance and in efficiency o f
public funds spending. I t would need to be supplemented with further regulations, documents and other
implementationsupport measures going forward.

49.     The new PPL includes many improvements over previous pieces o f legislation. About two-
thirds o f the articles o f the previous law have been revised to improve definitions; to introduce
professionalization and certification o f the "public procurement officers"; to simplify administrative
procedures; to control and monitor the application o f the PPL; and to have a functioning complaints
system. The new PPL largely reflects the provisions o f EU procurement directives and EU provisions
such as: (i)  the use of design contests where possible; (ii)  the use o f some non-objective criteria for
contract award; and (iii)  similar award methods for intellectual services and other types o f contracts. In
addition to the new PPL, a number of pieces of secondary legislation have been updated as welL3

50.     While the Government has made concerted efforts to improve the country's public
procurement system, many challenges remain. They include: (i)         approval by the Government of an
updated Baseline of Strategy for Upgrading Public Procurement in Serbia and implementation o f the
agreed short- and long-term action plans by the respective stakeholders while ensuring compliance with
the PPL; (ii) introduction o f secondary regulations, including standard bidding documents, auditing and
control o f the application o f the PPL and the secondary pieces o f legislation; (iii)strengthening of
procurement planning processes and database; (iv) building up o f the capacity of procuring entities in
carrying out procurement in accordance with the provisions of the PPL; (v) improvement of the private
sector's awareness of their obligations and their rights when participating in public tenders; and (vi)
establishment o f well-functioning e-GP system.

External Audit

5 1.     Although the 2002 Budget System Law prescribes that Government accounts will be subject
to external audit, final accounts have so far not been audited. The Law on the State Audit Institution
was adopted in November 2005 with a view to establishing an independent body responsible for the audit
o f public sector accounts. With some delay, a five member Council was appointed, as the highest body o f
State Audit Institution (SAI), in late September 2007 under provisions o f the Law on SAI. According to
the Law, the Council i s obliged to submit to the Parliament operations manual, work program and annual
plan within three months from the establishment o f the Council. Draft documents were submitted to the


  This includes (i) Regulation on (Rulebook for) Tender Opening Procedure and Standard Form for Keeping
Records on Tender Opening; (ii) Regulation on the Standard Forms for Keeping Records o f Procurement Procedures
and Awarded Contracts; (iii) Ordinance on the Criteria for the Formation o f Public Procurement Committees. The
following new secondary legislations have also been prepared: (i) Regulation on the Certification o f the Public
Procurement Officers; (ii) Regulation on Awarding Low-Value Public Procurement Contracts. Both the updated
and the new draft regulations are awaiting government approval.

    Parliament by the due date and were approved by the National Assembly Finance Committee on January
    23, 2009. A reasonable SA1 budget was included as a separate line item in the 2008 and 2009 budgets o f
    the Republic of Serbia and adopted by the Parliament. The hiring o f staff by the SA1 i s underway, and
.   premises have been secured.

    52.      Further progress needs to be made towards making the SA1 fully functional and producing
    external audit reports across all areas o f responsibility defined in the Law. This would include
    employing sufficient qualified staff, further training o f the core staff, and producing comprehensive audits
    in accordance with the Law and the program of work submitted to the Parliament. The SA1 i s required to
    audit financial statements for the Republic o f Serbia, budget related aspects o f the National Bank of
    Serbia, mandatory social insurance funds, local self-government units and public enterprises. It has not
    been able to deliver audits in any o f the five categories to date. Finally, full implementation of the Law
    on State Audit Institution should be achieved, providing sufficient resources and capacity building for the
    SA1 to perform a l l o f i t s responsibilities and procedures in relation to auditees covered by the Law. The
    SA1 i s receiving support and advice from the Norwegian Supreme Audit Institution as it moves to
    implement its work program and applies i t s newly-establishedrules o f procedure.

    53.       One o f the remaining legacies of the socialism era i s the unfinished privatization o f state
    assets and restitution o f previously nationalized assets. Ownership and management of tangible state
    assets in Serbia i s still somewhat undefined. Formally, all the assets belong to Republic of Serbia (as per
    1996 legislation changes) though a l l other parts o f the Government have the right to use and manage these
    assets. On behalf o f the central Government, management of the state assets i s done by the Republic
    Directorate for Public Property. In the past three years two new developments led to further complication
    o f the situation in this field. First, dissolution of the former federation with Montenegro led to transfer of
    some o f the formerly federal property to the Republic o f Serbia and second, there was a public call to
    submit claims for restitution. As immediate step toward improved public property management the Bank
    started implementation of an IDF grant for the Public Property Directorate which will help improving
    capacities o f this institution to conduct in the foreseeable future the inventory o f all state assets. This
    inventory will serve as basis for next steps including devolution o f assets to lower levels of government
    and public enterprises; restitution in kind, where possible and privatization o f assets that are not necessary
    for the core Government's functions.

    Policy area 1.c. Improving public debt management

    54.      To meet future borrowing requirements in a proper manner, a stronger focus on
    Government debt management i s needed. Until recently practically all deficit financing in Serbia has
    been covered by drawing funds from the Government's deposits (reserves accumulated from the previous
    privatization proceeds). With a debt of over 30 percent o f GDP (end 2008), a remarkably low portion of
    the total debt i s denominated in the local currency (only 2.5 percent). This i s now changing. The
    authorities have recently completed a number of domestic issues and intend to start building up a
    benchmark series o f Treasury bills (T-bills) o f various maturities to aid in the.development o f the capital
    market and to provide budget finance while external markets are tight.

    55.     The Public Debt Law of 2005 provided for the establishment o f a Public Debt Management
    Administration (PDMA) within the Ministry o f Finance, to conduct public debt borrowings,
    manage debt risk reduction, prepare debt management strategies, monitor and analyze conditions
    and changes in the domestic debt market, monitor local government borrowings and beneficiaries
    o f government loan guarantees, and similar operations. This accords with the new focus on
    Government debt management as a policy area with i t s own long-term objectives, along with current



                                                          17
international thinking (see Box 3). The PDh4A will now be established, managed by a recently appointed
Director, and i t s operating funds provided for in the Republic budget. The existing Public Debt Law does
not provide for all necessary formal and legal preconditions for efficient public debt management (too
long borrowing procedures both in the domestic and international capital markets). Therefore, it i s
necessary to make an analysis of all the effects of the existing Public Debt Law enforcement, as well as
other regulations which serve for managing the domestic financial market, so that related problems and
necessary measures needed to be taken with the aim o f amending and improving the Law and other
regulations are unambiguously defined.

56.       Once the Public Debt Management Administration has been established, the immediate
challenges are to create a comprehensive debt database, prepare a comprehensive medium-term
debt management strategy, assess the risks in outstanding guarantees, and prepare a structured
staff training plan. At present, parts o f the debt are recorded on Excel spreadsheets. The Government has
started the process to develop a debt management strategy by including some guidance (mainly that more
T-bills in the domestic market should be issued) in the Budget Memorandum for 2009 and 2010. Still,
however, there i s no comprehensive medium-term strategy covering the refinancinglrollover risk,
currency risk, and interest rate risk o f the debt portfolio, and no discussion o f the necessary cost/risk
trade-offs that would be necessary going forward. Considering that the debt management objectives by
law i s "to decrease borrowing expenses for the Republic in accordance with a prudent risk level", a
strategy must be developed on how these objectives will be achieved in the medium term. In spite of a
legal requirement in both the Budget System Law of 2002 and the Budget System Law o f 2009, no
assessment of the risks in outstanding guarantees has been undertaken. A procedures manual for the main
debt management activities also needs to be prepared.

Box 3: Sound Debt Management Practices

Several debt market crises have highlighted the importance of sound debt management practices and the need for an
efficient and sound domestic debt market. Although Government debt management policies may not have been the
sole or even the main cause of these crises, the maturity structure, and interest rate and currency composition o f the
Government's debt portfolio, together with substantial obligations in respect of contingent liabilities have often
contributed to the severity of the crisis. To improve Government debt management, there has been a dramatic shift
in Government debt management practices globally. From being a mere vehicle for borrowing to meet the
Government funding needs, it has developed into a policy area on its own with specific long-term objectives,
medium-term strategies to meet these objectives, yearly borrowing plans to meet the strategy aims, and the
implementation of the borrowing plan utilizing a growing and more complex set o f financial instruments. This has
been accompanied by a new focus on the legal framework, organizational structure, system support, mechanisms to
coordinate debt management activities with fiscal and monetary policies, development of the domestic debt market,
and structured staff training plans.


PILLAR 11: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION REFORMS

57.      Public expenditure allocation reforms are underway in the largest spending sectors,
including wages, pensions and health and education. The Government's immediate focus i s on the
public sector wage bill and on pensions, the two largest expenditure programs, where IMF-supported
nominal freezes are in place and medium-term reform strategies need to be implemented particularly
quickly. Important public expenditure allocation reforms are also underway in the health and education
sectors; two sectors which jointly account for about a quarter o f Government spending. As outlined in
Box 4, which discusses key challenges in health and education, these sectors will be supported by the PE
DPL program as the series moves forward and as the immediate challenges presented by the fiscal crisis
have abated.




                                                          18
Policy area 2.a: Containing the public sector wage bill and improving public administration

58.     Since the initiation of pro-market reforms in 2001, there have been several attempts to
design and initiate comprehensive public administration reforms. These have been only partially
successful, due in part to frequent changes in Government and a resulting lack o f sustained political
support. Initial reform efforts (2004-07), supported also by previous Serbia SAC2 and one IDF grant,
centered on civil servants, which represent a relatively small share o f the public ~ e c t o rYet, each year
                                                                                               .~
Serbia continues to spend more than ten percent o f GDP on the public sector wage bill, excluding
employees in the public (state) enterprises. There i s evidence o f overstaffing in some sectors and average
wages as a share o f per capita GDP are above the levels o f EU8 and EU15 countries.

59.     The 2004-07 civil service reforms created a new position classification system, reflecting the
complexity and responsibility o f individual jobs and a corresponding compensation structure, with
pay tied to grade and performance. This system has now been fully implemented. The reform also
revised recruitment procedures, clarifying selection criteria, reducing the number o f positions to be filled
by political appointment, and allowing transfers across ministries to be used as a tool o f career
development. A Human Resources Management Service (HRMS) was established to oversee the
administration o f the system; however it still does not fully cover the central government.

60.      The reform also strengthened the framework for controlling the number o f employees in
the civil service. Prior to the reform, establishment control was based only on acts o f systematization,
prepared by each institution and approved by the Government at 3-4 year intervals. The number o f
systematized posts was considerably higher than the number of posts actually filled, allowing ministries
to recruit employees and then exert pressure on the MOF to provide additional resources. Under the
reform, each budget institution i s required to prepare an annual staffing plan, in accordance with an
annual Government decree. These plans set a ceiling on the number of positions that can be filled during
the budget year. Evidence on the effectiveness of this system, however, i s mixed.

61.      Control over the aggregate wage bill i s now a priority o f the Government. In the face o f
increasing fiscal constraints, the Government has adopted severe short term controls over the wage bill. In
the context o f the stand-by agreement with the IMF, the Government has introduced a nominal freeze in
wages o f all public employees through end-2009, with outright cuts in the nominal wages o f higher-
earning staff, and a freeze on new employment. These measures, while essential in the light of the fiscal
crisis, are not sustainable over the longer term. A long term freeze on salaries will make it difficult to
attract and retain competent staff. Hiring freezes, by the same token, run the risk of generating skill gaps,
as key staff retire and are not replaced.

62.      I n the coming period a more systematic and sustainable approach to public employment i s
needed, affecting both civil servants and public service employees. Staffing levels have to be adjusted
to reflect needs and budget constraints. Wages have to be set at competitive levels, with variations among
sectors reflecting market conditions rather than the relative strength of competing unions. .

63.       One o f the first lines o f reform should be the extension o f pay and grading reforms to
public service employees. The pay and grading structure o f public service employees i s now regulated by
a variety of laws and decrees which result in a lack o f transparency and considerable variation in pay for
similar jobs. An effort to introduce a uniform pay and grading system for public service employees was
launched in 2006. While considerable preparatory work was undertaken-- including an effort to define


 Teachers, doctors, and public enterprises employees, who comprise the majority o f the central government payroll
are employed under the general labor law or the old Law on Employment Relations in the Public Sector. Police and
military personnel are employed under yet another regime.


                                                       19
positions and fix salary scales to reflect market conditions--the reform was set aside during the numerous
electoral campaigns. The Ministry for Public Administration and Local Self-Government i s now
restarting the process o f public administration reform as marked by recent adoption o f the Public
Administration Reform Action Plan (to cover the period 2009-2012). As the exercise will involve roughly
ten times the number o f positions affected by the previous and instant civil service pay and grading
reform, it will require considerable technical (as well as political) support.

64.      The Government will also need to reassess its overall staffing needs. Although the aggregate
level of staffing i s not high by regional standards, there i s evidence o f overstaffing in primary education
(due to falling levels of enrollment) and in non-medical staff in the health sector. The Government's new
Public Administration Reform (PAR) action plan calls, inter alia, for functional reviews of the Ministry
of Public Administration and the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs. These may identify redundant positions.
The proposed introduction o f capitation based financing in the education and health sectors will also
facilitate downsizing (see Box 3 below).

Policy area 2. b: Making the pension systemfiscally sustainable

65.       Pensions are the largest single spending program in Serbia and the current pension system,
even after the 2001 and 2005 reforms, i s unaffordable. Pension spending in Serbia as a share o f GDP
i s the second highest in the region as shown in Figure 1, suggesting that even in a region where pension
spending i s typically high, the Serbian system i s spending too much.

66.      Serbia inherited a generous pension system from the former Yugoslavia, generous in many
dimensions with low retirement ages for men and even lower retirement ages for women, large
numbers o f privileged occupations with yet even earlier retirement, generous starting pensions and
full wage indexation o f pensions after retirement. Contribution rates o f 32 percent o f wage were
required to finance the system, but even these were insufficient. A new pension reform law was passed in
2002 which moved the pension system to a version o f the German point system in an effort to tighten the
link between contributions and benefits. Eligibility for disability benefits was also tightened using the
definition o f incapacity for any type o f work rather than incapacity for a particular job or partial physical
impairment. Statutory retirement ages were raised immediately. Indexation was moved to a combination
o f 50 percent of inflation and 50 percent of nominal wage growth. Many o f the parameters chosen for this



                                                     20
new system were similar to those chosen by the Croatian Government when it adopted i t s pension reform
in 1998, including a reduction in the contribution rate to 19.6 percent to help stimulate employment and
avoid unduly high labor taxes. When sizable deficits appeared under the reform, contribution rates were
raised in 2004 to 22 percent o f wage.

67.     As deficits continued, a second pension reform law was passed in 2005 which further raised
the normal retirement age and moved the indexation of pensions gradually to full inflation
indexation, which is international best practice, over the space o f four years. Pension increases were
reduced to semi-annual increases from the previous quarterly increase. To win over social partners, the
law also contained a provision that should the average pension fall below 60 percent of net average wage
in the first three years of implementation, pensions would be increased to reach the floor 60 percent.
Under normal scenarios, this provision would never have been activated. But Serbian real wage growth
reached the extraordinary level o f almost 20 percent in 2007, triggering this provision in January o f 2008.
The subsequent April 2008 increase was as legislated, but the October 2008 increase also included an ad
hoc increase above the legislated increase in part to satisfy a campaign promise to raise the level o f
pensions to the floor level. The combination o f this extraordinary increase and the fiscal crisis to put
severe strains on the Serbian budget. The Government responded to mounting fiscal pressure by
freezing pensions in nominal terms in 2009.

68.      Serbia's pension system remains unaffordable and the two most critical problems are the
high level of benefits and the large number of beneficiaries. Serbia has attempted to achieve average
benefit levels equal to 70 percent or more of net wage, similar to what existed in the old Yugoslavia, but
this average i s derived on the basis o f averaging all currently received benefits for old age pensions,
disability pensions and survivor pensions, including pensions for those who have contributed a few a 15
                                                                                              s       s
years. OECD countries, few o f which face the infrastructure needs that Serbia faces, have average
pensions below 50 percent o f net wage, if calculated as in Serbia. Moreover, too many people in Serbia
are retiring too young, raising the total numbers o f retirees and expenditures. Although the official
retirement age i s rising to 65 for men and 60 for women, 40 percent of beneficiaries are below the
internationally accepted retirement age of 65    .'
69.      The key measure to address the problems of the pension system in the short term is the
implementation of the nominal pension freeze. The nominal pension freeze currently in place i s an
effective way to lower the average pension level to a level more in keeping with Serbia's resources and
the current freezes will have a dramatic impact on pension spending. The 2009 freeze combined with a
return to inflation-only indexation thereafter would reduce aggregate pension spending by at least one
percentage point o f GDP over the next five years (to around 12.5 percent of GDP by 2015). Extending
the freeze through 20 10 would further reduce pension costs to an estimated 1 1.8 percent by 20 15.

70.      While the Government i s implementing the pension freeze, a new pension reform strategy
i s being designed to address the problems o f the pension system over the medium term and to
improve the system's sustainability. A Pension Reform Working Group has been established, and they
have identified a series o f possible reform measures, including identifying articles in the law which would
need to be changed to implement these measures. To help address the problems outlined in paragraph 66
above, measures under consideration by the Working Group include:

 Almost half o f the retirees below 65 are linked to generous early retirement conditions, with the remaining portion
divided between those who have experienced disabilities and those who have lost a family member.


                                                        21
        a.     Reducing pension benefits for early retirement and eliminating the 45 year limit on years of
               service;

        b.     Pro-rating minimum pensions for those who contribute for fewer than 35 years;

        c.     Moving towards equalizing retirement ages for men and women;

        d.     Indexing pensions to inflation post-retirement with the exception that if wage growth rises
               above five percent in real terms, additional adjustments will be permitted;

        e.     N e w proposals for farmers.

71.     The work with concrete proposals for moving forward i s expected to be completed early Fall.
Once the proposal i s concrete the package i s expected to be discussed with Government at large and
relevant stakeholders later in 2009. The new Pension L a w will be supported by the proposed PE DPL2.

Box 4: Reforms in Health and Education and the PE DPL Series

Health Despite an array o f management improvements to date, the Serbian health care system still suffers from a
wide range of inefficiencies. The hospital bed occupancy rate i s below the level o f new EU members and
considerably below the level o f older EU member states. While marginal efficiency gains can be achieved by
administrative fiat, the key to fundamental improvements in health care productivity i s a change in the way it i s
financed. The present input-based system o f financing encourages inefficiency in the use of resources and provides
no incentive for improved service volumes or quality

The Government i s now in the process o f reforming the health financing system. For primary care, it will adopt a
capitation based payment system, in which primary physicians are paid according to the number of patients on their
rosters. For higher level (hospital) care, the Ministry of Health and the HIF intend to move to an output-based (DRG
or prospective hospital payment) system. International experience shows that such reforms can generate substantial
savings but need to be carefully designed to prevent fraud. The Government should continue the pilot testing of
these reforms and move to full implementationas quickly as possible

Education The level of Government spending on education in Serbia i s comparable to other European countries (as
a percent of GDP) but its outcomes are considerably poorer. There i s evidence that significant savings could be
achieved through the rationalization of the school network, particularly at the primary level, without reducing
education quality. Serbia has too many teachers, given its present student population. As a result, many classes are
inefficiently small

Consolidating under-enrolled classes by shifting students to other classes in the same school (and grade) could
reduce costs by ten percent. Consolidating under-enrolled classes by shifting students to other schools within the
same municipality could reduce cost another 25 percent. The latter, however, would require some schools to be
closed. This i s a politically difficult step. Other countries in the region have found it useful to enlist local
governments in this effort. The Bulgarian Government, for example, allocates funding for education to each local
government on the basis of enrollment, and allows each local government to recommend which schools and classes
to close. Serbia should consider doing the same

Bank program The Bank dialogue in the health and education sectors i s currently being carried out in the context of
the following three Bank projects: Delivery of Improved Local Services, Health Additional Financing, and
Education Technical Assistance. Given the size o f these sectors, and the potential for improved efficiency, it i s
proposed that the sectoral coverage of public expenditure allocation reforms would be extended to include the health
and education sectors as the DPL series moves forward and the immediate challenges presented by the fiscal crisis
have abated. Proposed Prior Actions for PE DPL3 are identified in the policy matrix

PILLAR 111: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION OF THE MOST
VULNERABLE

72.     Serbia still had more than 400,000 people living below the poverty line in 2008. Between
2004 and 2008, Serbia's poverty rate declined dramatically with the fraction of people living below the
poverty line declining by half, from 12.7 percent o f the population in 2004 to 6.3 percent in 2008. With
economic growth projected to decline by 4 percent in 2009, this number i s expected to increase. As
discussed in Section VI, simulations based on data from the most recent household budget survey (HBS
2008) shows that even a 5 percent decrease in the incomes of those above the poverty line will increase
poverty by 1.4 percentage points, roughly 90,000 more people. This will require through improving the
access to, targeting and adequacy o f social benefits, and also improving the monitoring and tracking of
the demand for social assistance to match the needs of the new poor who will be emerging with the
unfolding economic crisis.

73.     Overall, Serbia spends relatively little on social assistance. Spending as a whole averaged less
than two percent of GDP in the 2005-2009 period. As a share of GDP, this i s lower than the average
spending in the OECD (2.5 percent, 2006) and in the EU countries (2.5 percent, 2006), and comparable
with the spending of ECA counties with similar level of economic development. Although Serbia
operates over twenty social assistance schemes, with multiple social objectives, there i s only one explicit
anti-poverty program, Material Support for Low Income Households (MOP), which i s very well targeted
to the poor: 76.6 percent of the transfer i s received by households belonging to the poorest 20 percent of
the population (LSMS, 2007). Serbia also means-tests other programs such as the pro-natal child
allowance. Other programs-such as aid to veterans and the disabled--are categorical and not explicitly
means tested, but may have positive distributional impacts due to the characteristics o f their recipients.

74.     Although public outlays on social assistance programs as a whole have increased as share of
GDP, from 1.3 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 1.8 percent in 2008, spending on programs targeted to the
poor i s particularly low and allocations for the MOP and child allowances have declined. As of
2008, only 7 percent of social spending was allocated to the MOP, with another close to 16 percent
allocated to the child allowance program. Together, spending on the two programs equaled only 0.44
percent of GDP, a figure far below the level of the majority of ECA countries (and down from 0.6 percent
of GDP in 2005).

75.       There are two reasons for the decline in allocations to the MOP and child allowance
schemes. First, Serbia's rapid economic growth over the last decade has reduced poverty levels
significantly, thereby reducing the number of potential beneficiaries. Second, legislative changes that held
back spending on means-tested social assistance and the numbers o f eligible beneficiaries. This was
accomplished through two major items o f legislation: the Law on Financial Support for Families with
Children, enacted in mid-2002 and amended in 2005, and the Law on Social Protection and Provision of
Social Safety to Citizens, amended in September 2004. The laws consolidated and rationalized the
existing range of social programs, abolishing regional differences in benefit levels and strengthening
means testing. Several provisions, nevertheless, tended to reduce benefit levels. The threshold for MOP
eligibility, set at five recipients per household, tended to exclude large households. The shift from wages
to cost-of-living as the basis for indexing eligibility thresholds also tended to reduce the number of
beneficiaries-at least at a time when wages were rising faster than inflation. And in 2005, the access for
working age able-bodied persons to the MOP was restricted to 9 months in one calendar year. The
introduction of changes in the child allowance brought an immediate reduction o f the number o f eligible
beneficiaries by 200,000 or 30 percent - from 682,000 monthly average for January-May 2002 (before the
introduction of the law) to 482,000 average for July-December 2002, and to a steady though more modest
reduction thereafter to 405,000 beneficiaries in 2008.



                                                    23
76.      I n the immediate term, the Government i s ensuring that social assistance transfers are not
affected by the fiscal spending cuts necessitated by the crisis. In May 2009, the Government adopted a
supplemental budget envisaging a 27 percent cut o f the budgets o f all ministries. The budgets allocated
for social assistance programs are however unaffected. This allowed increasing the means-tested monthly
child allowance by 30 percent and the eligibility threshold for it by 20 percent as of August 1, 2009.
Nevertheless, there are now indications that budgeted social assistance funds are insufficient to cover the
increased number o f approved MOP beneficiaries (by 7.3 percent in July 2009 compared to July 2008),
also taking into account the mandatory monthly indexation o f the benefit with the inflation rate. A
Working Group has been set up in late July, aimed at aiding those hardest hit by the economic crisis and
looking at ways to supplement social assistance this year. On August 27,2009 the GOS adopted proposed
by the Working Group measures for resolving outstanding pension and health insurance issues of those
employed in the hardest hit by the economic and financial crisis sectors of the Serbian economy.

77.       Over the medium term the reform measures planned by Government of Serbia relate to
increasing the coverage and improving the design o f the most efficient and well-targeted social
assistance program (while progressively limiting spending on selected less efficiently targeted
programs. At the time of the crisis, the two means tested and targeted to low income families programs
(the MOP and child allowances) need to be protected and used as crisis response instruments. The
targeting o f the MOP program i s particularly good, with over 60 percent of benefits going to families in
the poorest quintile and the extreme poorO6   Coverage i s an issue however with only 6.4 percent of the
poorest quintile and 40 percent of the extreme poor receiving benefits from the MOP program (LSMS,
2007). Low MOP coverage i s associated with weak outreach to the poorest - IDPs, migrating people
(Roma in particular) and high cost o f application. The very poor cannot comply with certain
administrative and documentary conditions or cannot pay for their issuing and/or re-issuing. Eligibility i s
verified too often and required documents are issued for fee which i s not affordable for the poorest.
People who migrate, have no permanent address or cannot provide certain documents, cannot meet the
eligibility criteria. Moreover, the approach to identifying beneficiaries i s rather passive than pro-active -
the social workers rely mostly on the inquiries / demand coming from applicants rather than undertaking
active outreach with information dissemination and/or identification of potential beneficiaries.

78.      There is thus a strong case for scaling up the MOP, to cover a higher share of the poor and
to improve its efficiency by linking the cash assistance to social care and employment services         A  ....
new Social Protection Law i s under preparation, aiming (among other things) to improve the access o f
vulnerable groups and larger households to the MOP and to increase the MOP adequacy in the case o f
larger households. In addition to improving coverage of the poor, adjustments to the equivalence scale are
also envisaged, to bring them in line with those used in OECD countries. At present, the MOP benefit
favors smaller households (with up to three members) while larger households are discriminated against.'
The equivalence scales' adjustment would require increase of the MOP budget - assuming current
spending at 0.14 percent o f GDP, with the `standard' OECD equivalence scale where each child "counts"
for 0.5 and each adult second and next adult - for 0.7, the MOP spending will increase to 0.22 percent of
GDP in 2009.



  The 2006 H B S does not single out householdfamily income from the MOP. For that reason, a proxy (broader)
social benefit income category has been used to assess the coverage and targeting o f the MOP, and the data should
be treated with some caution.
7
  In 2009, for example, a two-member household i s receiving 1.37 o f the MOP amount for a single-member
household; three-member household - 1.75; four-member household - 1.87 and any household with five and more
members - 2 times the MOP amount for a single-member household. The equivalence scales applied in the OECD
allow increasing the benefit amount with 50% to 70% for every adult and with 30% to 50% for every child in the
family.

79.      While the Government is exploring options to limit spending under other social assistance
programs. There are for instance plans to harmonize wage compensation during maternity leave with the
prevalent practices in the EU member states and to enhance the linkage o f the due compensation with the
actual wage of the beneficiary by lowering the ceiling o f the benefit, cutting the duration to twelve
months, and increasing the wage reference period for calculation o f the wage compensation. Currently, it
i s estimated that most o f the benefits from the maternity leave scheme accrue to higher income
households.

80.      The Government i s also strengthening crisis monitoring. A system of social indicators o f the
crisis has been developed and enables monitoring o f the impact o f the crisis, with social protection
indicators and tracking of the demand for social assistance. Trends in social assistance beneficiary
numbers and spending are monitored on a monthly basis. Data on all applications (approved and rejected)
and on the reasons for rejection i s collected and summarized once a year for annual reporting purposes.
Discussions are underway to put in place implementation arrangements which will enable regular and
more frequent reporting on the demand for social assistance, the reasons for this demand and the obstacles
for receiving it, thus promoting evidence-based policy making during the crisis and in the longer run. In
the medium term, social assistance monitoring could be further strengthened by improving the registries
o f safety net program beneficiaries and establishing links across different registries.


             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

                                        A.       LINKTOCPS

81.     At the request of the Government the original CPS allocation has been increased by an
additional US$300 million. The FY08-FY 11 CPS for Serbia discussed by the Board on December 13,
2007 included provision for one DPL series focusing on private sector. As outlined in the Serbia CPS
Progress Report accompanying this operation, the GOS requested that the Bank adjust its lending
program to include a second DPL series focusing on public expenditure. This would help meet Serbia's
medium term financing needs and complement support under a coordinated donor assistance package
comprising EU assistance and the IMF SBA.

82.     The proposed Operation will provide support towards the accomplishment o f the objectives            ,

o f CPS Pillar I1 - providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth. While
navigating carefully through the current crisis, the Government i s moving forward with fundamental
reforms to promote systems of public expenditure planning and management that respond to the longer
term development needs o f the country. The expected overall outcome o f the Operation i s an
improvement in the quality, efficiency and accountability o f Government spending, which will assist the
Government in bringing about the necessary reduction in aggregate public spending levels and improving
current levels of service delivery. The proposed PE DPL series i s complemented by a PFDPL series
targeted at facilitating financial and private sector development.

               B.      COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

83.     The Bank maintains close working contacts with the IMF and other donors assisting the
GOS for the purposes of harmonizing policy recommendations, seeking synergies among the
respective operations, and avoiding overlaps. Coordinated efforts are in place to provide budgetary
support under the general fiscal framework o f the IMF SBA and including the conversion o f EC P A
funds. Cofinancing of Corridor X helps to provide the appropriate aggregate blend o f investment and fast
disbursing funds in the context o f global crisis.




                                                   25
84.      While the I M F ' s primary concern i s shorter term vulnerabilities and financing constraints,
and the Bank's i s medium term and structural reforms, a high degree o f coordination i s in place.
There has been close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF on key fiscal issues. For instance, the
Bank conducted an extensive dialogue with the authorities on pension reform including a pension round
table in which the Fund participated. Similarly on the Budget Systems Law as well as on public sector
wages and employment the Bank and the Fund consulted frequently during the preparation of the SBA
and the PE DPLl in order to avoid conflicting or inconsistent policy recommendations in their respective
programs. I t i s expected that this cooperation will be actively continued through the rest o f the PE DPL
series and the IMF SBA period.

85.       M o r e widely, the Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community in
Serbia in order to avoid duplication o f efforts and leverage support for the GOS reforms in the area
o f public expenditure systems. The Bank's coordination and cooperation with the European Union,
Serbia's most important development partner, i s deepening since practically all World Bank assistance i s
aimed at helping Serbia in the process o f convergence with the European Union. As detailed in section V
o f this Document, technical assistance by bilateral donors i s also providing support in a number o f policy
areas covered by this Operation. In particular, important relations were established with British DFID and
Swedish SIDA. The Bank also hosts and coordinates a recently established donor group comprising
donors engaged in PFM reforms.

                     C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

86.     This Operation i s one of a pair o f three-operation DPL programmatic series that are
proceeding on roughly parallel time tracks. The PE DPL series targets public expenditures while the
other, the Private and Financial Sector DPL (PFDPL) series, focuses on enhancing the business
environment, strengthening financial discipline and building a more efficient and stable financial sector.
The two series reinforce each other in a number o f important areas. For instance, the PFDPL benchmark
on financial discipline of socially owned enterprises should serve to limit quasi fiscal deficits with
positive spillovers for public expenditure management. Similarly, the PE DPL benchmark relating to
public debt management will help the development o f private capital markets and thus support the
objectives of the PFDPL. In fact the teams plan to use TA resources under the PFDPL to support the
public debt management strengthening process.

87.      The proposed PE DPL program i s supported by several complementary World Bank
Operations, including in pensions, health and education. Complementary to the proposed PE DPL
series, the objective o f the Delivery o f Improved Local Services (DILS) project i s to improve access to
and the efficiency, equity and quality o f local delivery o f health, education and social protection services.
Under both the DILS project and the additional financing to the Serbia health project, the World Bank
will continue to partner with the MOH and develop an evaluation plan to monitor and analyze progress
made under reforms with respect to hospital productivity, cost drivers, and insurance solvency and
effectiveness. In addition, two World Bank projects are being prepared to partner with the Government in
payment and management reforms in hospitals and outpatient centers, and to invest in data collection and
analysis in the HIF and health facilities. Technical assistance i s provided in the pension area with aim to
support the Government's effort to prepare the strategy for reforms of the pension insurance system. To
large extent dialogue in this field benefits from the work under the project Consolidated Collection and
Pension Administration Project.

                                      D.       LESSONS LEARNED

88.     The World Bank has been using Development Policy Lending as the primary tool to assist
the Government of Serbia with the design and implementation o f important structural reforms
since 2000.

89.      The Bank's experience with Development Policy lending in Serbia since 2000 has
highlighted the need for and benefit of maximum flexibility including in terms of policy areas to be
supported.8 Within Serbia's complex political economy, and against a particularly volatile political
background, past development policy credits have proved effective in supporting the Government to
undertake difficult policy reforms, in part because they served as basis for reaching political consensus
within the Government and allowed for significant flexibility in terms o f the time as well as policy areas
to be supported. In the past there were two Structural Adjustment Credits (mainly focusing on the public
sector reforms), two Private and Financial Sector Structural Adjustment Credits and one Social Sector
Structural Adjustment Credit. More recently a new series o f Private and Financial Sector DPLs started
with the first Operation being approved by the WB Board in early 2009 (see also the previous section).
With the support of these credits, Serbia has developed medium to long-term reform strategies that guide
sector reforms, revamped its legislative frameworks in many areas, and embarked on the long road of
institutional development.

90.     There is a high payoff to having an appropriate focus for a development policy loan and
avoiding too wide a purview. Successful reform implementation i s heavily dependent upon an effective
champion, and the presence o f such champions can be important in selecting the key focus areas for the
Bank's policy dialogue. While there can be no guarantees of tenure o f political appointments such as
ministers, it i s important to have as clear a picture as possible of any potential problems. Moreover,
having separate series for improving public expenditure performance and growth and private sector
development issues appears to have worked well in the Serbian context, and has allowed for better
                                                                                    s
management o f the reform agenda, both in terms of Bank assistance as well a implementation by the
Republic o f Serbia.' This division o f labor also lowered the probability o f unforeseen problems and lags
in implementation which could have in turn led to delayed disbursements.

91.     A strong analytical basis i s needed to design effective Operations. Analytical work can play
an important role to crystallize clearly the areas to be supported under development policy lending,
ensuring at the same time a strong Government buy-in at the preparation stage and a strong commitment
during implementation. In the case o f the current Operation, set against the background of a quickly
evolving international finance crisis, the Public Expenditure Review titled Addressing the Fiscal Crisis by
Increasing Public Sector Productivity i s informing the dialogue with the Government and other donors,
and anchoring the scope and substance of the proposed DPL.

                               E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

92.      I n recent years, the Bank has undertaken extensive economic and sector work in areas
covered by the proposed Operation. In addition to the work outlined in Table 7, analytical activities
also include a set of round-tables with the Government and local academia on the broad spectrum o f
policy issues including pensions, education, transport etc. as well as other one-off activities including

                            Pensions: In the short term, a pension freeze i s the most important
                           policy measure to improve the system's sustainability. Over the
                            medium term, the system's sustainability can be improved by a more
                            comprehensive reform including raising the retirement age for
                            women, and reducing pensions for early retirees.
                            Health: International experience shows that adopting a capitation
                            based payment system in primary care and an output-based system in
                            hospital care can generate substantial savings. But reforms need to be
                            carefully designed to prevent fraud.
                            Education: the efficiency o f spending can be improved by
                            consolidating under-enrolledclasses

                            small and with inadequate coverage.

                            In public procurement, there i s a need to improve enforcement of

                       DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

                A.       OPERATION DESCRIPTION, SEQUENCING AND SCOPE

93.     The PE D P L l i s the first of three development policy lending Operations to be executed
                     -
sequentially 2009 2011. The PE DPL series will support concrete Government reforms in (i)    public
expenditure and debt management reforms; (ii)public expenditure allocation reforms; and (iii)social
assistance and protection of the most vulnerable.

94.     T o maximize impact and not to overburden the dialogue, the programmatic DPL series i s
carefully focused and sequenced. The first Operation (PE DPL1) focuses on the support of public
expenditure and debt management reforms and i s anchored in the passage of the new Budget Systems
Law which outlines the public financial management strategy going forward. Among other things, this
will help to reduce fiduciary risks associated with budget support by the Bank and other donors.
Following a deterioration in the proportion o f public contracts awarded under competitive tenders in
recent years, a new public procurement law has been adopted, also supported by the Bank and PE DPL 1.

95.     Later Operations in the series would have an increasing focus on expenditure allocation
reforms in the large spending areas. The focus under PE DPL2 will be on reforms in pensions and
public sector pay, where short-term IMF supported and crisis-related freezes are in place. The
dialogue on medium-term reforms in these sector i s underway (although more advanced in pensions than
in public sector pay) and focuses on (i)
                                       putting in place more systemic and sustainable approach to public
employment and (ii)making the pension system fiscally sustainable through a package of parametric
reforms.

96.     PE DPL3 will also support reforms in the health and education sectors. Given the size o f
these sectors, and the potential for improved efficiency, it i s proposed that the sectoral coverage of public
expenditure allocation reforms would be extended to include the health and education sectors as the
program moves forward. W h i l e the dialogue in the health and education sectors i s currently taken forward
under the DILS project, the additional financing to the Serbia health project and the education TA, prior
actions would be included in the health and education sectors by PE DPL3.

                                        B.       POLICY AREAS

Pillar 1: Public expenditure manapement reforms.

97.    Objective l a : Putting in place a more comprehensive, integrated medium-term planning and
budgeting framework.

         Challenge: The budget could be more strategic, tightening the link between policy and spending
         and including medium-term planning. This would include introducing a national investment
         planning and coordination framework. Making the budget more comprehensive will also provide
         a better basis for fiscal policy making.

         PE D P L l Prior Action: The Budget System Law has been enacted, providing, inter alia, for:
         (a) a clearly defined scope o f said Law covering Serbia's General Government sector; (b)
         budget coverage including revenue from all sources and associated expenditures including
         investments made; (c) a comprehensive and integrated medium-term planning and
         budgeting framework for central government budget organizations including explicit




                                                     29
       expenditure ceilings; and (d) measures to ensure transparency o f fiscal risks including
       contingent liabilities.

               This will lay the legislative framework by (i)
                                                            increasing the scope o f the Budget Law to
               include the general government sector, (ii)introducing medium-term planning and
               budgeting for central Government budget organizations within explicit expenditure
               ceilings; and (iii) introducing a national investment planning and coordination
               framework. (see also Box 2)

       PE DPL2 trigger: Budget Memorandum includes: all General Government Sector revenue and
       expenditure (as used by IMF); identification o f fiscal risks, including contingent liabilities;
       medium term estimates for three years by direct budget beneficiary; and identification o f national
       investment priorities in line with the decision o f the National Council for Infrastructure..

               This will ensure that implementation o f the new Budget Systems Law starts in earnest
               with the Budget Memorandum o f Spring 20 10.

       PE DPL3 trigger: Budget approved by the National Assembly i s the first year o f the medium
       term budget estimates for direct budget beneficiaries.

               Full implementationo f the BSL and more strategic priority setting and spending.

       Expected results: Improvement in the PEFA Indicator # 12 (multi-year perspective in fiscal
       planning, expenditure policy and budgeting) from an estimated C in 2008 to-B or higher (by
       201 1).

98.     Objective 1b: Improving public expenditure monitoring and control - budget execution, internal
control and internal audit

       Challenge: Strengthening internal audit and control arrangements and establishing common
       practices for accounting and reporting using international standards.

       PE D P L l Prior Action: The Budget System Law has been enacted, providing, inter alia, for:
       (a) the use o f international standards for public expenditure accounting and reporting
       purposes; and (b) the establishment o f adequate internal financial control and budget
       inspection mechanisms and defining roles and responsibilities of the Borrower's
       administrative units involved in internal control, internal audit and inspection.

           0   This will lay the legislative framework for introducing new provisions establishingpublic
               internal financial control and internal audit arrangements. (see also Box 2)

       PE DPL3 benchmark: Internal control and audit units functioning in all line ministries and all
       producing reports for management and annual reporting to the Central HarmonizationUnit.

       Expected results: (i)Internal control and audit units functioning in all line ministries and
       producing reports; (ii)

       B or higher by 201 1.

99.    Objective 1b: Improving public expenditure monitoring and control - public procurement

       Challenge: To improve tender performance and efficiency o f public spending

       PE D P L l Prior Action: Serbia has enacted the Public Procurement Law, setting forth
       public procurement arrangements providing for improved procurement management,
       oversight, transparency and accountability.

               This lays the legislative basis for the envisaged improvements and includes a
               simplification o f administrative procedures, a professionalization and certification of
               public procurement officers, and improved monitoring o f the application of the law.

       PE DPL2 benchmarks: Completion o f public procurement regulations for implementing new
       law, including: tendering arrangements; Ordinance on Public Procurement Committees;
       Certification o f the Public Procurement Officers; and Standard bidding documents approved by
       the Government. Baseline o f Strategy for Upgrading Public Procurement in Serbia updated and
       adopted; concept for establishment of well-functioning e-GP system prepared

       PE DPL3 Prior Action: Public Procurement Office and Commission for the Protection of
       Tenderers' Rights properly functioning in accordance with the new PPL. Implementation of the
       e-GP system commenced.

               Full implementation o f the PPL.

       Expected results: Improvement in tender performance and in efficiency o f public funds spending

100.   Objective 1b: Improving public expenditure monitoring and control - external audit

       Challenge: No externally audited accounts o f the budget have been produced in recent years.

       PE D P L l Prior Action: The external audit o f the 2008 financial statements for the Republic
       o f Serbia has been initiated, in a scope and manner satisfactory to the Bank.

               Following the adoption of the Law on the State Audit Institution, a number of staff have
               been hired, premises have been secured and the audit of the 2008 financial statements i s
               underway.

       PE DPL3 Prior Action: Completion and provision to the National Assembly o f the external
       audit o f 2008 financial statements for the Republic of Serbia and at least 10 other external audits
       by the State Audit Institution (to include National Bank o f Serbia component related to the RoS
       Budget, three national mandatory social insurance funds, and at least two each of local self-
       governments and national public enterprises)

           0   The SA1 i s fully functional producing timely audits across all areas of responsibility
               defined in the Law.

       Expected results: Improvement in the PEFA indicator #26 (scope nature and follow-up o f
       external audit) from an estimated D in 2008 to C or higher by 20 11,


                                                   31
101.   Objective IC:
                  Strengthening public debt management

       Challenge: Until recently practically all deficit financing was covered by drawing .funds from
       Government deposits and there was almost no local currency debt outstanding.

       PE D P L l Prior Action: Measures have been taken for the establishment o f the Public Debt
       Management Administration (PDMA) provided in Public Debt Law dated July 15, 2005
       (Official Gazette 61/05), including adequate budget allocation for the functioning o f said
       administration, the adoption o f an organizational chart and the appointment of staff.

           0   Legal provision has been made for the establishment o f the PDMA.


       PE DPL2 Prior Action: The PDMA i s fully staffed and has completed the following activities:
       (i)Establishment of a comprehensive debt database; (ii)
                                                             Preparation o f a comprehensive medium-
       term debt management strategy; (iii)Description and a qualitative risk assessment o f all
       outstanding Government guarantees; and (iv) Preparation of procedures manuals for the main
       debt management activities.

       PE DPL3 Prior Action: The PDMA i s fully functional, and: (i)    Based on the strategy for 20 1 1,
       an annual borrowing plan has been prepared; (ii)   The medium-term debt management strategy
       has been updated by the PDMA, and the strategy includes sensitivity analyses and a yield-curve
       building plan for the next three years; and (iii)
                                                       The yearly assessment of outstanding guarantees
       includes a quantification o f the risks.

       Expected results: Government debt management has improved in at least the following ways: (i)
       The debt management strategy i s updated annually, based on sound cost/risk analyses under
       different scenarios, (ii) Government securities yield curve in the domestic debt market i s built
                                A
       up; and (iii)The risks embedded in guarantees are properly assessed and quantified on an annual
       basis.

Pillar 2: Public expenditure allocation reforms

102. Objective 2a: Containing the public sector wage bill and improving the efficiency o f public
administration

       Challenge: Reassessment o f pay and grading scales and staffing needs.

       PE D P L l benchmark: Nominal wage freeze for public employees, at all levels of Government.

               This i s part of the IMF-supported program, and i s a short-term crisis measure (there are
               indications that on aggregate Serbian public employees are relatively higher paid than in
               surrounding countries).

       PE DPL2 trigger: Enactment o f new Law on pay and grading for public service employees

               The pay and grading structure o f public service employees i s currently regulated by a
               variety of laws and decrees which result in a lack o f transparency and considerable
               variation in pay for similar jobs. A Working Group for drafting the new law has been
               established (PE DPL 1 benchmark)


                                                  32
       PE DPL3 trigger: Pay and grading system for public service employees implemented in selected
       ministries. Redundant positions phased out.

       Expected results: A reduction in the salary coefficients for public service employees from 550 to
       100.

103.   Objective 2b: Making the pension system fiscally sustainable

       Challenge: Pensions are the single largest spending program in Serbia, and the current pension
       system i s unaffordable (with a high level of benefits and a large number of beneficiaries)

       PE DPLl benchmark: Nominal pension freeze

               This i s part o f the IMF-supported program, and i s the key short-term measure to address
               the financial problems of the pension system. Pension benefits in Serbia have been at
               unsustainably high levels. On the back of two extraordinary pension hikes in 2008, the
               IMF-supportedfreeze in 2009 should help bring pensions to more sustainable levels.

       PE DPLZ trigger: Enactment of Law to address fundamental problems in the pension system
       with parametric measures to reform the first pillar (mandatory, contributions funded pillar of the
       pension system).

               This Law will help the address the structural problems o f the system and i t s sustainability
               over the medium term. Preparations for the long-run pension reform strategy have started.
               (PE DPLl benchmark)

       Expected results: Pension spending as a share of GDP declines between 2008 and 201 1; as does
       the implicit pension debt.

Pillar 3: StrenvtheninP social assistance and Drotectinv the most vulnerable.

104. Objective 3a: Improving tracking of the demand for social assistance and social program
performance and impact.

       Challenge: strengtheningcrisis monitoring.

       PE DPLl benchmark: Develop a system of social indicators for crisis, early warning and
       monitoring of the social impact of the crisis. Collect the baselines for the identified indicators.

       PE DPLZ benchmark: Institutionalize crisis monitoring.

       Expected results: Monitoring framework developed and baseline data collected and updated
       regularly.

105.    Objective 3b: Promoting access to more adequate means-tested cash benefits and to social
services.

       Challenge: extending coverage and adequacy o f means-tested social assistance payments.




                                                   33
        PE D P L l prior action: Social assistance spending in the May 2009 supplementary budget
        has been maintained at least at the level provided in the original 2009 budget.

                  In the immediate term, the Government i s ensuring that social assistance transfers are not
                  affected by the fiscal spending cuts necessitated by the crisis.

        PE DPL2 trigger: Enactment o f legislation to improve the access o f vulnerable groups by
        applying the equivalence scales for MOP in accordance with the prevalent EU and OECD
        practices and adjust the spending on MOP accordingly.
              0   This law will lay the institutional basis for increasing coverage and improving the design
                  o f the best targeted social assistance program, the MOP, with a particular focus on larger
                  households.

        PE DPL2 benchmark: Harmonize the wage compensation during maternity with the prevalent
        practices in the EU member states and enhance the linkage o f the due compensation with the
        actual wage o f the individual beneficiary by: (i)lowering the ceiling / cap to the benefit; (ii)
        cutting the duration to 12 months; (iii)increasing the wage reference period for calculation o f the
        wage compensation.

         Expected results: Increase in coverage and adequacy o f MOP transfer


                              VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

106.     The poverty and social impact of the prior action on macroeconomic sustainability i s likely
to be positive. The emphasis on maintaining fiscal sustainability has important benefits for the poor,
especially as it serves to curb inflationary pressures. However, this being said, from the perspective o f
protecting the poor and vulnerable groups, the composition o f the fiscal consolidation i s another
important aspect. To ensure that the distributional impact o f fiscal consolidation i s not regressive, i t will
be critical for the Government to continue to protect targeted social assistance spending and to improve
the effectiveness of service delivery in health and education.

 107.     The freeze in civil service wages under PE D P L l i s not expected to have much if any impact
on poverty because civil servants are far from the poverty line. The average wage in the public
sector" was estimated to be 407 percent o f the poverty line in 2008 (and 378 percent in 2009) (although
this i s only a rough estimate since the data do not distinguish between civil service and other public sector
workers).

 108. Preliminary simulations based on the 2008 HBS show that the effect of prolonging the
freeze in pensions to the end o f 2010 could add 1.6 percentage points to poverty incidence, with a
roughly equal impact in urban and rural areas." As a result, the poverty rate among households with
pensioners i s projected to go from 5.7 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2009 and 10.8 percent in 2010. In
the context o f a proposed PE DPL2, and following further analysis, the Bank will discuss with the

loNote that  in the data we cannot distinguish civil servants from other members o f the public sector.
'I                                                                                n
   Assuming the full translation o f the income shock into a consumption shock, a assumption which appears closer
to reality as the crisis becomes more protracted and the asset base o f the most vulnerable i s eroded. This impact
would be additional to the 1.2 percentage points (increase equivalent to 88,807 people) that i s expected to be caused
by the current freeze in pensions by the end o f this calendar year.


                                                         34
Authorities measures to mitigate these effects, including strengthening of the social assistance (MOP)
scheme supported by the proposed Operation.

 109.    Continuation o f the pension freeze under PE DPL 2 could have significant distributional
impact.'2 In the HBS 2008 25 percent of the population i s recorded as a recipient o f "pensions and
disability insurance receipts (old-age, disablement and family pensions, protection contributions and
other contributions)." As the minimum pensions after the adjustments in October 2008 reached a level
equivalent to 150 percent of the poverty line for 2008 (139 as of June 2009) and the share of minimum
pension recipients i s limitedI3 one would expect those effects to be contained, especially under PE
DPLl .I4 There are serious concerns, however, that certain groups of households might be particularly
affected, such as those whose members do not have access to other major income sources*5        and farmers,
the latter as they have a separate if small pension fund and receive lower benefits than retired employees
and self-employed. Farmers' minimum benefits were equivalent to 113 percent of the poverty line in
October 2008, and had already eroded to 105 percent by the first quarter of 2009. Strengthening of the
social assistance programs, as supported by this Operation, should help mitigate risks in this regard.

 110.    The social assistance reforms proposed under this Operation are expected to lower poverty.
The proposed reforms are expected to protect and increase access to means-tested programs. At present,
these programs reach a fraction o f the poor (about 10.9 percentI6), are small relative to other programs
(0.4 percent of GDP), and are inadequate in the sense that the average benefits are only 7.917percent of
the poor's consumption. The proposed reforms will enhance the adequacy o f the MOP and i t s coverage of
households with three and more family members (that is, mainly families with children) through a more
favorable equivalence scale, including waiving the limit for MOP recipients to five per family. The
proposed reforms also address some of the major causes of the low uptake of these programs, namely lack
o f awareness by potential beneficiaries and administrative hurdles to participation. By focusing on
outreach, especially to the poorest population groups such as the Roma, identifying and removing barriers
to participation, and increasing benefit levels, the reforms should protect existing poor and draw in some
of those who have been left out. However, how much poverty reduction will take place depends on the
success o f the outreach effort, elimination of administrative barriers, and size of benefit increase. As part
o f a proposed PE DPL2, the wage compensation during maternity will be harmonized. Although this
reform may lead to losses of the benefit for some working mothers, these losses will disproportionately
affect higher paid beneficiaries, and there will be no negative effects for non-working mothers.




l2The distributive impact o f other elements o f the DPL related to increasing to improving the efficiency o f public
expenditure management, cannot be easily assessed. The nature o f the reforms suggested in the area o f public
expenditure management, however, i s such that it seems unlikely that they would lead to any adverse distributional
shift.
I3 According to the latest data available (for 2007) less than 5 percent o f the recipients from the employee find (the
main o f three finds) received the minimum pension or less.
l4In addition, on average households that receive pensions have a rather diversified income portfolio, with pensions
income only equivalent to slightly more than 60 percent o f household per capita consumption.
15
   22 percent o f households with pensions recipients (equivalent to I O percent o f all households) have members who
only depend on pension receipt (including disability pensions).

                B.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

1 1 1.  The M O F will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed Operation and for
reporting process and coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. The
Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation o f the proposed Operation, as well
as the subsequent actions o f the GOS program by using the short term and overall program outcomes
outlined in the Policy Matrix.

 112.    At the same time, the overall status of the GOS program will be monitored during
supervision to determine whether the specific conditions o f the proposed Operation have changed.
In addition, supervision missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the policy dialogue with the
institutions involved in the implementation o f the program o f reform, but will also ensure synergies with
other donors to avoid conflicting advice to the Government in the policy and technical areas involved in
the reforms.

                                    C.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

113.   This fiduciary information section and the set o f fiduciary measures included below for the
Operation are based on the findings and recommendations o f the Public Financial Management
Assessment (PFMA) and more recent assessments by the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department in
December 2008 and IMF Staff Reports published in 2008 and 2009. Disbursement and auditing
arrangements have been determined based on the prevailing fiduciary environment.

114. Public financial management (PFM) system: The 2007 PFMA concluded that despite the
improved public disclosure o f basic fiscal and budget execution data, the lack o f transparency and
operating checks and balances in public finance still appear to be an overarching problem in Serbia. This
i s reflected in the relative poor performance on several PFM performance indicators. Significant steps
have been taken towards strengthening PFM, such as modernization of the central treasury system, the
establishment o f arrangements for internal audit across central Government and the establishment of the
State Audit Institution Council in September 2007. While these efforts are encouraging, the IMF
concluded in its December 2008 report that much remains to be done to strengthen transparency and
accountability in PFM in Serbia. Strong Government leadership o f the ongoing reforms will be required
to bring Serbia at par with other EU-aspiring countries in the region.

1 15.    The independent assessments o f public financial management performance suggest that the
fiduciary risks associated with the PFM system in Serbia are high. The IMF concluded that important
areas o f budget coverage, preparation and execution, accounting and fiscal reporting, internal controls,
external audit and debt and cash management require improvement, although several key areas o f the
PFM system work well.

 1 16. Mitigating fiduciary risks will require strong and sustained commitment towards
transparency and accountability in budget management. The Government has taken steps to
strengthen budget execution and reporting arrangements and i s developing improved arrangements for
public internal financial control and audit as part o f i t s pre-accession program. The European Commission
i s providing significant support to strengthen financial management systems and internal audit and control
arrangements amongst other PFM reform initiatives. This assistance has resulted in considerable
improvement in the quality and timeliness o f financial information and provided the foundation for
effective internal control. Establishment o f the SA1 Council and provision o f separate budget allocations
in 2008 and 2009 were positive steps, but not sufficient to provide an effective external audit function to
date.




                                                    36
 117.   The corrective actions taken by the National Bank o f Serbia to safeguard funds in the
foreign exchange account are deemed adequate. An updated IMF Safeguards Assessment, conducted
in March 2009, found that the NBS's safeguards framework had been considerably strengthened and the
quality of financial statements and internal audit had improved markedly since the initial assessment in
200 1. Key recommendations include strengthening external oversight of NBS operations and amending
the NBS law to increase operational and financial independence.

118.   The Operation has a major focus on further actions required to attain acceptable fiduciary
arrangements through strengthening o f the Budget Systems L a w . in key areas of
comprehensiveness, transparency, planning and budgeting, debt management, fiscal and budget
reporting, and internal audit and control. The benchmarks also include achievement of progress on
external auditing of RoS financial statements.

                                 D.       DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

119.    Disbursement and auditing arrangements reflect the high risk in Serbia.

120. Borrower and Loan Amount: The Borrower i s the Republic of Serbia. This Operation i s a single-
tranche loan. The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the effectiveness of the
Loan Agreement between the Bank and Serbia.

 121, Disbursement: The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank of the effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement between the Bank and Republic of Serbia, the Borrower will submit a withdrawal
application to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The IBRD will
deposit the proceeds of the loan into a foreign currency deposit account designated by the Borrower to be
held at the NBS. This account will be managed by and subject to control of the MOF. The Borrower shall
ensure that upon the deposit of the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in local
currency to the Single Treasury Account also kept in NBS and that i s available to finance budgeted
expenditures. The Closing Date i s December 3 1,20 10.

                                   E.        ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 122. The major pillars o f the PE DPL series have been assessed for any significant effects on the
environment, forests and natural resources under the requirements of the World Bank's OP 8.60.
The specific country policies supported by the Operation are not likely to have significant effects on
Serbia's environment and natural resources. The measures contemplated under the loan are primarily
geared towards supporting the increased efficiency and sustainability o f public expenditures. This will
cover public expenditure management reforms, public expenditure allocation, and social protection. None
of the sectors included in the Operation are expected to have any direct significant links to the
environment. It i s also not possible to tell how the new Budget Systems Law supported by Pillar Iof the
Operation will affect environmental capacity, as the Law does not focus on expenditure allocation issues,
but any impact should be marginal. However there might be indirect positive impact on environment due
to reforms in social protection if the targeting and allocation for social assistance leads to improvements
that might prevent the poor and most vulnerable from the use of trees for heating during the winters.I8
Increased transparency of the use of public finances and access to information, supported by Pillar I f the
                                                                                                      o
proposed Operation, could also have a positive environmental impact.




  Serbia does not have any fuel subsidies, which could directly affect the use o f trees for heating during the winter.


                                                          37
123. The legal framework for environmental management in Serbia has undergone significant
reforms along the lines of the EU acquis, although enforcement and implementation still need
further strengthening. Four key environmental laws were adopted in recent years: Law on
Environmental Protection, Law on Environmental Impact Assessment, Law on Strategic Environmental
Assessment, and Law on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control. Further, a new Law on waste
management has also been adopted in May this year, together with several other new pieces of legislation
including: Law on Prevention o f Air Pollution, Law on Protection o f Natural Resources etc. Serbia has
also signed the South Eastern European Energy Community Treaty which subjects it to key pieces o f the
acquis, notably the Large Combustion Plants Directive. This directive places restrictions on local
pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter). Serbia has also recently
ratified the Kyoto Protocol including the Protocol B. The Government o f Serbia has also introduced the
use of pollution charges for S02, NOx and particulate matter which also apply to thermal power plants.

124.     Environmental oversight in Serbia i s shared among the Ministry o f Environment and
Spatial Planning (MoESP), the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and municipalities. The mandate
o f the nascent Serbian Environmental Protection Agency i s limited to data collection and reporting.
Recent years have also witnessed delegation of environmental oversight functions, such as some o f E M
and permitting, to local government agencies. However, variation of capacity in local government
agencies and lack o f secondary legislation related to the new laws lead to delays and variations in the
interpretation and application of laws. Such delays and inconsistencies are detrimental to the business
climate and warrant inclusion in the regulatory review. The MoESP i s currently discussing twinning
arrangements with an EU country, which will help strengthen i t s capacity. The Bank has assisted in
strengthening the capacity of the Department for Environmental Impact Assessment, through training of
the ministry staff during preparation o f Bor Regional Development Project. The Bank will also 'be
strengthening the ministry's capacities by creation of a local implementation unit, a part of the
                                                                                         s
environmental remediation component o f Bor Regional Development Project.

                                       F.       CONSULTATIONS

125. The Rulebook of Government of SerbiaIg requires that all legislative changes which
significantly change existing system and ways of operations (as assessed by the relevant Council of
the Serbian Parliament) need to go through public consultations. Only following the public
discussion andor further inter-ministerial harmonization process the proposed drafts become official
proposals which are then submitted for the Parliament's consideration. Further, the practice has been that
all new laws are in fact subject to public hearings where relevant stakeholders, including private sector
representatives and NGOs, are able to provide their comments to offered solutions. This i s also the case
with legislative reforms supported by this series o f DPLs, such as Public Procurement, Budget System
and Social protection laws. Finally, the bank team working on this Operation chairs the donors' meetings
on the issues o f the reform o f public financial management.

126. With respect to more specific impact analysis, GOS has fiscal impact analysis, regulatory
impact analysis and environmental impact analysis. Fiscal impact analysis i s done for each new
piece of legislation by the MOF. I t i s important to stress that fiscal impact analysis i s still in the early
phase o f development though it i s a major improvement in full costing of some reforms. Regulatory
impact assessment i s done by the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development to check the impact o f
any new legislation on the business environment. Finally, for regulations that explicitly or implicitly deal
with environmental issues several checks will be in place. First, the Regulatory Review Unit will check
a l l such regulations and screen them for potential impact on the environment. Second, the Ministry in

proposals will have to comply with recently passed package of environmental laws.

127. Consultations and discussions o f Bank analytical work have played a catalytic role in
designing policy options and mobilizing stakeholders. For instance, the findings o f the 2009 Public
Expenditure Review, serving as the analytical underpinning for many o f the reforms in the proposed
Operation, have been discussed by the Government and the Bank with a wide range of stakeholders in the
country (including the Parliament), and have been the subject of extensive press coverage.    ,




                               G.      R I S K S AND RISK M I T I G A T I O N

 128. There are substantial macroeconomic risks. Given the unfolding economic crisis, significant
uncertainties remain related to economic prospects in Serbia and other countries in Southeast Europe. The
risk of further shocks relating to the global economic environment that could affect the economy
negatively remains and include a prolonged recession in the EU and a lower demand for exports than
currently envisaged as well as lower private sector debt roll-over. Although solvency indicators do not
point to significant risks o f unsustainable debt, liquidity indicators give reason for policy makers to be
cautious. Debt amortization i s expected to rise very significantly over the next few years. Moreover, the
sustainability of Serbia's external debt i s also affected by exchange rate depreciation and real growth o f
the economy.

129. Serbia i s taking determined actions to mitigate these risks, including pursuing a robust
agenda of policy reform (and this Operation i s considered key in moving this agenda forward),
maintaining a strong commitment to EU integration, and seeking a coordinated package o f international
financial support. Foreign banks in Serbia have also provided voluntary assurances to broadly maintain
their commitment to Serbia and keep their subsidiaries well-capitalized; so far exposures of foreign banks
to Serbia have indeed been maintained. The Bank and the IMF will closely monitor the performance
under the government's macroeconomic program. Moreover, the potential of resources coming through
EC macro support operations dependent on continued adherence to the Bank-Fund program targets
improves success likelihood.

130.     The current capacity o f some public sector institutions to implement an ambitious reform
agenda, while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively weak. Relatively weak
institutional capacity including for fiduciary management raises concerns including on internal controls.
Improving the public expenditure management system i s an important component of the Operation, but
institutional change comes slowly. Other potential risks relate to specific actions o f the reform program
including delays in the implementation process of the overall program. The execution risks will be
mitigated through utilization o f continued technical assistance facilities and active coordination o f bi-
lateral donor funded technical assistance. Another potential risk may include delays in the Parliamentary
approval of a package o f laws.

 13 1. Political risks, while moderate, remain. The speed o f program implementationcould be slowed
down by the existence o f a broad-based coalition Government; although at the same time the coalition
Government helps to ensure sustainability of the reform effort. The programmatic design with a series of
three DPLs i s intended to leave some flexibility as to the pace, scope and content of reform program.
Risks are also mitigated by the economic crisis which has highlighted the necessity and urgency o f
reform.

Public sector wage bill. Containing the public sector wage bill and improving public
administration is one of the top priorities of our government. Under fiscal pressure and due lo the
fact that spending on public administration wages accounts for about one quarter o f our total
expmditures the Government adopted in July 2009 the new Action Plan for Public
Administration Refom. Given the urgent need to craw fiscal savings, and in the context o f the
Stnnd-by Agreement with the IMF, we introduced a nominal freeze in wages o f all public
employees through end-2009, with outright cuts in the nominal wage of higher-earning staff,
and a free* on new employment. We are aware that these measures, while essential in the light
of the fiscal crisis, are not sustainable and in t b coming period a more systematic and
sustainable approach to public employment i s needed, affwting both civil servants and the wider
public sector. A long term free2e on salaries will make i t difficult to attract and tetnin competent
staff. Hiring freezes, by the same token, run the risk of generating skill gaps, as key staff retire:
and are not replaced. Therefore we developed the mentioned Action plan for pubtic
administration reform which represents detailed and comprehensive plan of actions needed to
ensure the improved eficiency o f &e public sector over the medium term in sustainable manner.

One o f our priorities wit1 be to extend the reformed legislation to the wider public sector since
the majarity o f the slaff are employed there, ' h e pay and grdding structure a f public sector
employees is now regulated by a variety o f laws and decrees which result in a lack o f
transparency and considerable variation in pay for similar jobs. The Government, under the
Ministry far Public Administration and Local Sel f-Government are now restarting the process of
public administration reform as marked by recent adoption of the Public Administration Reform
Action Plan (to cover the period 2009-2012). As i t will involve roughly ten times the number of
positions affected by the civil service pay and grading reform, it will require considerable
technical (as well as political) support, therefore the WB, as well as o f other donors' engagement
and support is very much welcomed. 'I'he multi-sectoral working group which will be in charge
of drafting this legislation has been already established and we expect in the corning months the
first draft ofthe legislation lo be publicly available.

Reforms that we are planning will include also the review of staffing needs as there i s evidence
o f overstaffing E some particularly important and large sectors like primary education (due to
                   n
falling levels o f enrollment) and among non-medicalstadin the health xctor. The Government's
new PAR action plan calls, in& alia, for functional reviews o f several ministries which may
identify redundant positions. The idea o f introduction o f capitation based financing in the
education and health sectors should also help us to ensure reductiola in the number o f staff in
these twa sectors.



Pensions, We arc aware that without significant reforms o f thc pension system our public
finances will not be sustainable going forward. We inherited a generous pension system from the
former Yugoslavia, with low retimment ages for men and even lower retirement ages for women,

            Annex 3: Republic of Serbia Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                   September 14,2009

This note provides the IMF staff's assessment o Serbia's recent macroeconomic developments,
                                               f
revised outlook, andpolicies. The assessment is based mainly on information gathered by an IMF
mission that visited Belgrade during August 24-September 2 to conduct the second review under the
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)."

Recent Developments and Outlook

1.      Immediate financial tensions have eased; the banking system seems to have weathered
the adverse spillovers from the global financial crisis. In line with their commitments under the
National Bank of Serbia's (NBS) Financial Sector Support Program, foreign banks have largely rolled
over their external exposures vis-&vis Serbia. At the same time, the large current account deficit has
been shrinking fast, reducing external financing requirements. Reflectingthese developments, since
the end of February the NBS has not intervened in the foreign exchange (FX) market. Meanwhile, as
elsewhere in the region, sovereign spreads have narrowed substantially. Bank liquidity has improved
as households have begun to return FX deposits to banks. Nevertheless, overall credit growth i s
subdued, notwithstandinggovernment efforts to support lending through subsidies and guarantees.
Moreover, nonperformingloans have risen fast to 9.7 percent in June 2009, compared to 4.3 percent
in September 2008.

2.     The output slump i s projected to bottom out in 2009, with stronger-than-projected
external adjustment, while relatively high inflation is receding only slowly:

        0    Real GDP i s now expected to fall by 4 percent in 2009, compared with a 2 percent decline
             in the first program review. The Statistical Office estimates that real GDP declined by 4%
             percent during the first half of 2009 (y-0-y), and the full-year forecast assumes that the
             slump will level out during the second half of 2009.

        0    With the economy's overall spending shrinking faster than income, the external current
             account deficit is projected at 9 percent of GDP in 2009, down from about 17 percent of
             GDP in 2008. Capital inflows have remained low but stable over the last few months; as a
             consequence, external financing pressures are abating.

        0    CPI inflation declined to 8.5 percent in July, well inside the NBS's 6-10 percent target
             band. Alongside, the NBS has continued its policy of gradual easing, reducing i t s policy
             rate to 12 percent in July, down froml7% percent in January. Nevertheless, sharp
             regulated price increases, in part reflecting cuts in subsidies to utility providers, have
             added to inflation pressures, while the slump in activity has had so far only a muted
             impact on high entrenched inflation expectations.

3.        A modest economic recovery is expected in 2010, and the economy i s assumed to
rebalance gradually over the medium term. Real GDP i s projected to grow by 1% percent next
year, with economic activity anticipated to regain strength only toward end-20 10; external adjustment
i s projected to slow to a more gradual pace in 2010. The return to robust and more balanced growth
over the medium term i s predicated on a turnaround in global growth, but also on structural reforms

                                             htm.

leading to significant improvements in the business climate. Inflation i s expected to decline further to
more moderate levels, supported by prudent monetary and fiscal policies, particularly continued wage
restraint in the public sector. While the high external debt level i s projected to moderate over the
medium term, the external debt sustainability analysis continues to point to significant risks.

Program Implementation

4.        Performance under the program has been broadly on track, with the notable exception
o f the fiscal area. All end-June 2009 performance criteria, apart from the ceiling on the general
government deficit, were met. In particular, the fiscal deficit for the first half of 2009 exceeded the
ceiling by 1 percent of annual GDP, both because of revenue shortfalls owing to a weaker-than-
expected economy, and, but to a lesser extent, only partial implementationof agreed fiscal measures.
Most actions in the structural reform area were implemented as planned. Moreover, preliminary
results o f a diagnostic study of the twelve largest banks suggest that the banking system would remain
adequately capitalized and liquid under a downside scenario for 2009-1 0.

Policy Requirements

5.       The shift o f the Serbian economy from boom to bust, triggered by the global financial
crisis, has unmasked a vulnerable fiscal position. Revenues during the boom were boosted by
unsustainable growth heavily tilted toward the productionof nontradables and high demand for
imports, as reflected by high external current account deficik2l In the short term, allowing the
temporary effects of automatic fiscal stabilizers to increase fiscal deficits i s justified given the severe
economic contraction and the much faster-than-projectedexternal adjustment, as long as
noninflationary sources of budget financing are available. At the same time, fiscal sustainability in the
medium term will need to be restored through front-loaded reforms of recurrent spending, particularly
in public administration, and the pension, health, and education systems, with the World Bank playing
a key advisory role in these reform areas.

6.       Consequently, developing a sound and credible fiscal strategy i s the key policy
challenge. Reforms will need to be calibrated to provide compensating savings for a declining tax-
GDP ratio over the medium term, higher interest payments, and increased capital spending to improve
Serbia's deteriorated public infrastructure.However, many of the spending reforms will take years to
yield sizeable spending reductions, thus requiring a credible political commitment to reforms and their
steadfast implementation.

7.        I t was agreed to not conclude discussions for the second review under the SBA to give
the authorities more time to firm up political consensus on credible spending reforms. For 2009,
there was agreement that raising the fiscal deficit target from 3 to 4% percent o f GDP would be
appropriate given the weaker-than-projected economy and the availability o f financing. However,
there i s also a need to address potential sizable budget deficits going forward that could be
inconsistent with sustainable public finances. There was broad consensus to target a fiscal deficit of
about 3% percent of GDP in 2010. There was also agreement that achieving this target would require
additional fiscal measures of about 2 percentage point of GDP. The authorities considered tax

''IMF staff estimates that, assuming Serbia's external current account deficit normalizesto a medium-term
level of about 6 percent o f GDP, the tax-GDP ratio could fall durably by about 4 percent o f GDP relative to its
level in 2008. This estimate reflects mainly durably lower VAT collections (as consumption i s projected to fall
relative to GDP) and lower customs revenue (in part reflecting the Stabilization and Association Agreement
(SAA) with the EU).



                                                        54
increases as less desirable owing to the weak state of economy and concerns that this would
undermine the momentum for spending reforms; they instead proposed to emphasize a comprehensive
strategy o f multi-year spending reforms. If spending measures prove insufficient, there could s t i l l be a
need to make tax increases part of a credible adjustment package.

8.       As regards monetary policy, exchange rate flexibility and focus on inflation should
continue to serve Serbia well. Further monetary easing should proceed with caution. While low
aggregate demand will ease inflation pressures, high inflation expectations have yet to moderate in
line with the NBS's inflation targets.

9.       I n the financial sector, with non-performing loans rising, developing an effective
strategy for corporate and household debt restructuring will be key. An FSAP Update mission
scheduled for October will review the status quo legal and institutional mechanisms for debt
restructuring, laying the basis for recommendations in this area.

Relations with the Fund

10.      Serbia currently has a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with exceptional access. In May
2009, the Board increased the original 15-month, SDR 350.8 million SBA approved on January 16,
2009 to SDR 2.62 billion (about 2.942 billion, or about US$4 billion), equivalent to 560 percent o f
Serbia's quota or close to 10 percent of its GDP, and extended the SBA by one year to mid-April
201 1. These decisions enabled the immediate release of SDR 701.55 million (about 788 million).

11.      I t i s now planned to combine the 2nd and 3rd reviews, with a mission likely to take place
in late October and a board date in early December.
