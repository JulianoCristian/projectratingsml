are to assist in preserving the Armenian road network,\n            thereby avoiding costly rehabilitation or reconstruction at\n            a later date, and to improve the efficiency of\n            Armenia's road maintenance operations for the future.\n            The specific objectives are to: 1) help preserve the\n            Armenian national road network and reduce transport\n            operating costs by expanding maintenance operations,\n            including bridge and tunnel rehabilitation; 2) help develop\n            an institutional framework adapted to the requirements of\n            the road sector of a market economy; 3) expand the resource\n            base for road maintenance by encouraging appropriate road\n            user charges; and 4) assist in developing an effective\n            private road construction and engineering industry; and 5)\n            improve road safety. The project components are: 1) periodic\n            highway maintenance; 2) bridges and tunnels; 3) materials\n            for routine maintenance; 4) equipment and spare parts; 5)\n            institutional strengthening and technical upgrading; and 6)\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1995-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
