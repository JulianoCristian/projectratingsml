SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
A. Introduction
1.    The proposed supplemental financing would increase the IDA support for the ongoing
Armenia Highway Project, which would remain as described in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
No. 14301-AM dated August 22,1995, except for the substitution of IDA financing in place of
the Kuwait Fund cofinancing of US$15 million. Therefore, this Technical Annex will only
describe those aspects of the project that are needed to reflect the changes from the situation that
is described in the SAR for the original project.
B. Progress to Date Under IDA Credit Number 27760-AM
2.    As described in the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (MOP), progress
under the existing project has been excellent. ARD moved quickly to set up an effective Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), and staffed it with well qualified staff with the intention that it will
be retained after the completion of the project and merged into the regular ARD structure. The
PIU staff have become familiar with and can perform cost benefit analysis using the World Bank
HDM computer program to determine priorities for road maintenance decisions. The PIU has
carried out competitive bidding successfully in 1996 under National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures for the civil works component of the project, and has now completed the preparation
of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) documents for the bidding in 1997. Accounts have
been established and an auditor has been engaged. The equipment financed from the IDA Credit
has been purchased and delivered, and a Plant Pool has been established to manage and maintain
it.
3.    12 civil works contracts for repaving were awarded in 1996 for a total value of about
US$6 million. A delay in the receipt of the bitumen from a foreign supplier led to some delay,
and some contracts were not able to be completed in the 1996 construction season. However,
this work will be completed early in 1997 at no additional cost to ARD. Training in the
application of surface dressings was carried out by ARD, but two contractors nevertheless had
some problems in obtaining acceptable surfaces on a portion of their work and had to make
repairs in order to make the work acceptable. Additional training will be provided in 1997 to
try to avoid similar problems this year. Also, good progress has been made by the local design
institute, which has carried out the design and preparation of the bidding documents and has
supervised the civil works contracts with the assistance of a foreign consultant. Local contractors
have benefitted from training and the experience of carrying out the first civil works contracts
under competitive bidding procedures, which is an important start to the development of an
effective road construction industry.



2
4.    As described in the MOP, the Government's difficulties in providing the counterpart
funding and support for ARD's budget as required by the provisions of the Credit Agreement
have been the most serious problem for the project in its first year and one half. Payments are
current at present, and the enactment of the proposed excise tax on vehicle fuel will help to
reduce the problem in the future. However, the longer run ability of the Government to be able
to provide financing at a level required to maintain the entire network will depend on the overall
rate of economic recovery and development that takes place in Armenia as well as what decisions
the Government makes regarding road user charges.
5.    The project is being implemented in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the
Credit Agreement. A modest schedule of road user charges was put into effect as a condition of
effectiveness under the previously approved Credit.  While this schedule of charges was
appropriate based on the economic conditions at that time, a more adequate level of charges is
needed over the longer run. There was some delay in the preparation of a study of the required
level of financing needed to maintain the road network and possible financing and collection
mechanisms for obtaining it, as described in para. 16 of the MOP, but this study has now been
completed and can serve as a basis for further consideration of this issue. In view of the
difficulties in obtaining payments of counterpart funds and support for ARD's budget, an agreed
schedule of road user charges and a timetable for its implementation will be a condition of
effectiveness.
C. Uses of the Supplemental Financing
6.    The allocation of project costs will remain the same as for the original project, as shown
on Page 1 of Appendix 1. Within the Periodic Road Maintenance category, however, the portion
of surface dressings has declined and the amount of overlays has increased in view of the
additional deterioration of the road network since the survey was carried out, as anticipated in
para. 4.5 of the original SAR. Generally, the supplemental financing would finance the
components that are indicated for Kuwait Fund financing in the original SAR. This includes
repaving of portions of the Interstate Road Network, rehabilitation of a tunnel on an important
road link to Georgia, the purchase of materials (mainly bitumen and fuel) for routine and winter
maintenance, equipment (see Annex C of the SAR for an illustrative list of equipment to be
purchased under the project), and an additional year of project administrative expenses. A revised
Detailed Financing Plan is presented on Page 2 of Appendix 1.
D. Implementation
7.   Implementation would continue on the same basis as the present project, as described in
the original SAR. The project would, however, be extended for one year because of the delay
in identifying all of the financing, and would now be expected to be completed by June 30, 2000.
The Closing Date would be December 31, 2000.

8.    The supervision of the project would also be extended by one year. Three Bank
supervision missions would be carried out each year, staffed by a senior highway engineer and
such specialists as may be appropriate for each aspect of the project (such as procurement,
training, traffic safety, and financial analysis), each of about one week duration. Missions would
review physical progress and would assist in coordinating the cofinanced elements of the project.
Cofinanciers would be invited to participate in all supervision missions. A revised Supervision
Plan is included as Appendix 2 and revised Project Monitoring Indicators are shown in Appendix
3.
E. Procurement
9.    The procurement arrangements and the Procurement Plan and Schedule, which combine
the original IDA Credit funding with the proposed supplemental financing, are shown in
Appendices 4 and 5, with the proposed supplemental financing shown in bold. A revised
Summary of Proposed Procurement Arrangements is attached to the MOP as Schedule B.
10.   The procurement provisions and limitations described in the original SAR and included
in the Credit Agreement for the original IDA Credit would apply to the supplementary financing
without change. All of the equipment procured with supplemental financing would be purchased
under one ICB tender, and the bitumen for routine maintenance would be purchased under two
ICB tenders (one in each of two years). The periodic maintenance work would be procured
under four ICB tenders (two in each of two years) and the tunnel rehabilitation would be
procured under one ICB tender.
F. Disbursements
11.   The proceeds of the supplementary financing would be distributed as shown in Schedule
B of the MOP. These amounts would be added to the amounts in the existing IDA Credit.
Disbursements of the supplementary financing are expected to be completed within a three year
period, as shown in the Disbursement Schedule in Appendix 6.
G. Economic Benefits
12.   The Estimated Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for the periodic maintenance
component on the main road network, which accounts for 57 percent of the total project costs,
was calculated to be 38 percent in an analysis prepared by the consulting firm TecnEcon and
published as "The Armenia Highway Survey" dated September 1994. The analysis used the
World Bank Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM.-.III) to calculate the benefits. This
alialysis is still valid, since the costs used in the analysis have been confirmed as realistic based
on the results of the first year's actual prices, and the traffic volume growth estimates used in the
analysis have been reached or exceeded. The analysis also found that the results of the study
were relatively insensitive to quite large variations in assumed traffic growth, with most variations
making no more than a two percent difference in the EIRR compared to the medium traffic
growth estimate. The consultant who prepared the economic analysis for the original project did



4
not calculate the Net Present Value of the periodic maintenance component, but the high level
of economic return indicates that the Net Present Value would also be acceptably high.
13.   The tunnel rehabilitation, which accounts for 8.6 percent of total project costs, would
be included in the supplemental financing. It is urgently needed since it is on a major route to
Georgia, is in very poor condition with the concrete ceiling beginning to collapse, and the road
bed is deteriorating due to water flows that are not controlled by the present structure. The EIRR
for this work has been calculated as 50 percent based on traffic growth of 2 percent per year.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that traffic growth of 0 and a 20 percent increase in cost for the
reconstruction combined reduce the EIRR to a still very acceptable 42 percent.
14.   A portion of the routine maintenance component, which accounts for 8 percent of the
total project costs, would also be included in the supplemental financing. The EIRR for the
increase in investment in routine maintenance is calculated to be 65 percent based on an assumed
saving in vehicle operating costs related to a reduction in roughness. If traffic growth were 0
compared to the 2 percent per year assumed in the base care and if the cost of the routine
maintenance were 20 percent higher, the EIRR would be reduced to 46 percent.
15.  In summary, the overall EIRR for the components included in the supplemental financing
would be as follows:
Table 1.1 Summary of the Economic Analysis

*Represents 83 percent of the total cost of the components included in the supplementa
financing package. See Appendix 7 for additional supporting information regarding the tunnel
and routine maintenance.
H. Financial Impact
16.   ARD is financed entirely from the Government's central budget, and project counterpart
funds are taken into account as an addition to ARD's regular budget when budget allocations are
made. Loan interest charges and principle repayments are funded by the Ministry of Finance
separately from ARD's budget, and therefore do not have a direct impact on ARD finances. The
road user charges that are now being collected, as well as those under discussion in the



5
Parliament, would assist the Ministry of Finance to have the means to provide resources to ARD,
but would accrue to the Ministry and not to ARD. Therefore, there would not be a direct
financial impact from the project other than to provide ARD with more resources in the near term
fur maintaining the roads.
I. Other Project Benefits and Risks
17.   Project benefits and risks are as spelled out in the MOP. Two risks identified in the
original project have not been mentioned in the MOP, namely whether ARD has the ability to
establish an effective road maintenance organization capable of carrying out the project activities
and the ability of ARD to use contracting techniques effectively, since ARD has demonstrated
the ability to do these things during the first year and one half of project activity.
J. Agreements Reached
18.   The covenants in the original Credit Agreement would apply in full to the supplemental
financing. A condition of effectiveness would be the submission of a schedule of road user
charges and a timetable for its implementation acceptable to IDA.
