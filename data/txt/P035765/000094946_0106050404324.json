appropriateness of resources\n            allocation - and, a satisfactory performance by the Borrower\n            in light of its timely, and cooperative manner. Lessons\n            emphasize the importance of strong counterparts to achieve\n            success, exemplified by the Armenia Road Directorate's\n            leadership, and excellent judgment in selecting experienced\n            staff in road technology, well prepared, and qualified to\n            assimilate Bank guidelines, and operational methods. Thus,\n            the selection, and training of new staff will be critical to\n            the following transport operation. Moreover, the conscious\n            efforts in minimizing costs, through the use of economic\n            analysis, competitive bidding, and improved road maintenance\n            technology, led to an overall road costs reduction of fifty\n            percent compared to the last years of the Soviet period, a\n            factor worthy of mention when considering restructuring, and\n            revision of roads administration, and operations. However,\n            the persistent inadequacy of funding for road maintenance\n            within the budgetary process - even when road user charges\n            generate adequate income - suggests the Bank should review\n            the institutional, legal, public acceptance, and planning\n            issues, to determine, if a road tariff could replace the\n            road user charge part of the excise tax on fuel, for such a\n            tariff could establish a level playing field, to ensure\n            predictable road budgets."}, "docdt": "2001-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
