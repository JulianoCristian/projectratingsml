"Ratings for the Third Ozone Depleting\n            Substances (ODS) Phase Out Project for China were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to global\n            environment outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory.  There are six main lessons learned\n            from the project: (a) the lack of an adequate policy and\n            regulatory framework made the transition away from ODS into\n            substitutes more difficult and prolonged; (b) the lack of\n            public awareness of the ODS phase-out objective during early\n            project years also made the transition away from ODS into\n            substitutes more difficult; (c) the project will have\n            benefited from increased involvement of provincial and local\n            governments; (d) the way in which project beneficiaries and\n            enterprises were selected was too mechanical; (e) the\n            process of technology transfer is not completely under the\n            control of the project and therefore introduces\n            uncertainties; and (f) the quality and continuity of key\n            personnel benefited the project immensely."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
