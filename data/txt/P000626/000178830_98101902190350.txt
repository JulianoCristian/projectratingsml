INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE EAST AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
WITH THE JOINT AND SEVERAL GUARANTEES OF
KENYA, TANZANIA AND UGANDA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the East African Development Bank (EADB) to be jointly
and severally guaranteed by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, for the equi-
valent of $8 million to help finance industrial projects in the East
African Commanity. The interest on the loan would be 7¼ percent per
annum. Amortization will conform substantially to the aggregate of the
amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment projects
financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
PART I - THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY
Background
2.        The links between Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were forged
during the colonial administration and extend back for well over 40
years. Free trade between Uganda and Kenya was established in 1917.
After the establishment of a British mandate over Tanganyika, the customs
union was extended to include all three countries in 1923. Common ser-
vices developed gradually over this period, first between Kenya and
Uganda and after World War I with Tanganyika, though until 1963 the port-
rail system serving Kenya and Uganda was linked only indirectly with
that of Tanganyika by means of shipping services on Lake Victoria.
3.        The East African Common Market and Services were not given
any overall institutional organization until 1948 when the East Africa
High Commission consisting of the governors of the three territories was
established and complemented by an executive and advisory staff as well
as a central legislative assembly. In December 1961, with Tanzania's
independence, the High Commission was replaced by the East African Com-
mon Services Organization (EACSO). A Common Services Authority, con-
sisting of the prime ministers of the three countries, was established
as its supreme organ and was assisted by a number of ministerial committees.
4.        Both the Common Services and the Common Market helped to knit
the three East African countries more closely together. Until 19614,
there were no quantitative restrictions on trade among the three coun-
tries, although marketing and price controls maintained by a few boards
did inhibit free trade in some agricultural products, principally maize.



There was a common external tariff which, with minor exceptions, applied
uniform rates to imports from outside the Common Market. There was a
similar uniformity in excise duties and, in practice, also in company
tax rates. Within the Common Market, the free movement of funds and
goods was facilitated by the fact that most of the commercial banks op-
erated in all three countries and that, until mid-1966, there was a com-
mon East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board.
5.        As the three countries achieved independence it was inevitable
that each of them should review the balance of advantages and disad-
vantages of these common arrangements established during the colonial era.
Uganda and particularly Tanzania were critical of the disproportionate
advantages which had accrued to Kenya. Aside from a large and growing
export surplus, Kenya has also had considerable net earnings on service
account with its Common Market partners. In addition, the headquarters
of the Common Services were all located in Nairobi. Hence the early
1960's witnessed a temporary reversal of the process of economic inte-
gration as each country concentrated on establishing a strong national
identity. Separate currencies and central banks were created, while
trade restrictions, diverging tax policies and administrative barriers
partially eroded the Common Market.
The Treaty for East African Cooperation
6.        In 1965, concerned at this divisive trend and deterioration
of the Common Market and Common Services, the three Governments appointed
a Commission on East African Cooperation to review the existing arrange-
ment and recommend improvements. The Commiision provided a forum in
which the three East African Governments were able for the first time
to consider systematically as independent sovereign states all the is-
sues regarding the continuation of the Common Market and Services. The
recommendations of this Commission formed the basis of the Treaty for
East African Cooperation (The Treaty), which was signed in June 1967.
7.        The Treaty, under which the East African Community between
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda came into being, continued the essence of the
Common Market and the Common Services, although with some modifications
and in a somewhat altered form. The changes made by the Treaty were for
the most part designed to enable Tanzania and Uganda to share more largely
in the benefits of the operation of common services and to promote a more
balanced industrial development as between Kenya and the other two coun-
tries. The first of these objectives was to be achieved by certain mea-
sures reorganizing, relocating and decentralizing the Common Services.
The second was to be ensured through limited facilities for the imposi-
tion of duties on inter-country trade (transfer taxes) and through the
establishment of a new East African Development Bank whose resources
would be distributed so as to favor Tanzania and Uganda vis-a-vis Kenya.



-3-
The Common Services
8.        As provided under the Treaty, the self-contained services -
the airways, railways, harbors, posts and telecommunications - have been
organized as statutory corporations and their headquarters distributed
between the three Partner States. These corporations have been carrying
out a continuing program of expansion and improvement of their facili-
ties and services in which the Bank has assisted with substantial lending
(Part II - Bank Group Lending). The other common services - the Customs
and Excise Department, the Income Tax Department, the Meteorological
Department and the Directorate of Civil Aviation - have been decentralized,
as far as practicable, to the national level.
The Common Market
9.        The transfer tax mechanism provided under the Treaty permits
a country whose balance of trade'in manufactured goods with another
Partner State is in deficit to impose a temporary levy of up to 50 per-
cent of the common external import duty on manufactures that are or will
be locally produced in that country. Both Tanzania and Uganda have made
extensive use of the transfer tax facility, but so far without much im-
pact on their industrial development. Discouragement of private enter-
prise in Tanzania and political uncertainty in Uganda have partially
counterbalanced incentives provided by transfer tax protection. Intra-
community trade, however, has 'been rapidly increasing with the exception
of trade between Tanzania and Uganda which almost came to a standstill
following the military coup in Uganda (January 1971) and Tanzania's refusal
to recognize the new Government. Trade between the two countries has
now been resumed. Kenya remains the dominant trading partner in the Com-
munity, accounting for about 62 percent of total intra-community exports
and more than 75 percent of the trade in manufactured goods. This situ-
ation is unlikely to change significantly during the next few years.
10.       While permitting transfer taxes, the Treaty prohibits quanti-
tative restrictions on intra-community trade except in certain special
circumstances. The Treaty further calls for a wide measure of freedom
in the movement of funds within the Common Market both on current and
capital accounts.
11.       The Treaty for East African Cooperation recognizes that some
coordination of economic policy and development planning is essential to
the success of the Common Market. Plans for the various common services
operated by the Community are the subject of consultations and approval
of Partner States through the appropriate Councils of the Community.
National development plans and policies, however, continue to be formu-
lated without much regard to broader Commuity interests. The Community's
principal instrument for coordinating national policies, the Economic
Consultative and Planning Counoil (comprising the three Community Minis-
ters and three Ministers from the national Governments) has not been very



-14-
effective so far. Several studies on the harmonization of agricultural
policy and fiscal policy, establishment of multinational industries and
tourism promotion have been or are being initiated under Community
auspices and might lead to better coordination in future.
12.       Despite the numerous practical difficulties of international
economic cooperation, the three Partner States are firmly comidtted to
the Community's success and in recent years the Community has certainly
displayed a strong capacity for survival. In spite of the dispute be-
tween Tanzania and Uganda, both countries showed a willingness to seek
pragmatic ways to continue the day-to-day business of the Community and
the Jointly owned Corporations.  However, the Community's highest organ,
the East African Authority, comprising the three Heads of State, has not
met since January 1971, but this in itself need not be an impediment to
the smooth functioning of the Community as long as the three Heads of
State act in concert on matters requiring their approval.
The Economy of Kenya
13.       The report of a Bank economic mission which had visited Kenya
in September 1971 to review progress made under the current 1970-74
Development Plan, entitled "Economic Progress and Prospects in Kenya"
(Report No. AE-22 of March 3, 1972), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 17, 1972. The report revealed that, since the Bank's
previous economic report was made in 1969, the Kenya economy had con-
tinued to expand rapidly, very much in line with targets set by the 1970-74
Plan. While imbalances had arisen in the pattern of growth and benefits
of growth had been rather unevenly distributed, the report concluded that
Kenya's economic performance had been generally very good. The rapid
rate of expansion, and especially the high rate of investment achieved
since 1970, had resulted in a sharp deterioration in the balance of pay-
ments, a much tighter budgetary position and some signs of inflation in
the domestic market. The report concluded that if the rapid rate of
growth was to be sustained an increased flow of external capital would
be necessary to cover Kenya's resource gap which was expected to grow
rather quickly during the remainder of the Plan period.
14.       These conclusions were put before the Consultative Group for
East Africa which met in Paris on April 20 and 21, 1972 to discuss Kenya's
economic prospects* The meeting concluded that the economic performance
and prospects of Kenya justified continued technical assistance and in-
creased financial aid from the members of the Group and that having regard
to the growing requirements for external assistance, a substantial part
of the financial aid should be on concessionary terms.
The Economy of Tanzania
15        The report of a Bank economic mission which had visited Tan-
zania in September 1971 to review progress made under the current 1969-74
Development Plan, entitled "The Economic Development and Prospects of



-5 -
Tanzania" (Report No. AE-26 of May 22, 1972), was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 6, 1972. The report concluded that the
Government's proposed economic policies and investment priorities were
generally sound, but that in view of the emergence of increased finan-
cial pressures in Tanzani& and the relatively limited prospects for the
principal export crops, foreign donors should be prepared to increase
their share in the financing of total investment. In practice, this
meant increased local expenditure financing of projects that were suit-
able for external financial assistance. If such increased external
financing were forthcoming, Tanzania should be able to maintain a rea-
sonable investment rate and an average annual growth rate of around
5 percent.
The Economy of Uganda
16.       The Thlird Five Year Plan for the period 1971-76, preparation
of which was delayed because of policy changes following the military
coup in January 1971, was published in January 1972. The prospects for
carrying out the Plan are complicated by the increasingly serious finan-
cial situation facing Uganda. In 1970/71 there was a large budget def-
icit caused mainly by expenditure on certain prestige projects started
by the previous Government, by compensation payments arising from the
nationalizations announced in May 1970 and by increased military spending
by the new Government.
17.       Growing trade deficits, and private capital flight, resulted
in pressure on the balance of payments and a sharp decline in the coun-
try's external reserves. To alleviate the situation, Uganda concluded
a standby agreement with the IMF for $10 million in July 197n and with-
drew the whole amount in October 1971. The agreement with the IMF was
based on an understanding that the budget for 1971/72 woild restore the
Government's financial position. However, the expenditure estimates in
the 1971/72 budget were not followed. Military and other "non-develop-
ment" spending continued at a high level. The deficit for the current
financial year, ending June 30, 1972, is expected to be considerably
higher than the Sh 600 million ($84 million) recorded in 1970/71. The
pressure on the balance. of payments has been particularly severe since
a large proportion of the increasing expenditure was for external pro-
curement. The Bank of Uganda introduced measures to reduce the outflow
of foreign exchange at the end of 1971. The situation is undeniably dif-
ficult. The Pank has indicated its concern about it to the Government
and intends to keep in close touch with developments. Uganda has applied
for a further IMF standby and a mission is now in Uganda to discuss the
application and the Government's associated proposals for financial
stabilisation.
18.       Although Uganda has incurred considerable short-term external
debt in the recent past, the debt service burden, while high, is still



-6-
manageable and will remain so provided further supplier credits are
avoided and most new borrowing is on concessionary terms0 Basic Data
on Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are provided in Annex II.
Creditworthiness of Community Organizations
19.       The creditworthiness of East African Community organizations,
including EADB, is determined by the creditworthiness of each of the
three Partner States, which jointly and severally guarantee all exter-
nal Community debts. At the end of 1969, the outstanding disbursed debt
of the Community organizations was about $171 million. At the end of
1971, the Kenya Government's own debt is estimated to have been about'
$334 million, the Tanzania Government's debt stood at $262 million,
while Uganda's debt amounted to $152 million. If a notional one-third
of the estimated cost of servicing the Community's debt is included for
each of the Partner States, the debt service ratios of all three coun-
tries were in the range of 6 - 8 percent in 1971. While these ratios
will increase in the future, there is still scope left for the Community
institutions to borrow on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO THE COMMUNITY
20.       Starting in 1955 with a loan to the then East Africa High
Commission for the development of East'African Railways, the Bank has
to date made six'loans to the vario'us common services organizations of
the Community for railways, harbors and telecommunications. In addition,
the Bank Group has extended 41 loans and credits to the three Partner
States for projects in agriculture, education, forestry, power, trans-
portation and water supply. Summary statements of Bank loans/IDA credits
to the EAC common services organizations and comments on the progress
made in execution of projects are in Annex I. Summary Statements of
Bank Loans and IDA Credits to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are also pro-
vided in Annex I.
21.       A project covering the 1972-76 Development Program of the East
African Harbours Corporation has been appraised recently and the East
African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is preparing its program
for 1973-79, for which some financial assistance from the Bank will be
required.
22.       The IFC has three investments in Kenya; $12.9 million in the
Pan-African Paper Mills, Ltd., $3.2 million in Kenya Hotel Property Co.,
$204 million in Tourist Promotion Services (Kenya) Ltd.; and one invest-
ment in Uganda; $1.2 million in Tourist Promotion Services (Uganda) Ltd.



PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
23.       East Africa is still in the initial stages of industrializa-
tion. Manufacturing accounts for about 10 percent of the combined GDP
of the three countries and employs about 160,000 people out of a popu-
lation of about 34 million. Kenya, which produces about half of the
value of the region's manufactured goods, is undoubtedly far ahead of
Tanzania and Uganda, which each produce about one quarter of the total.
Manufactured products account for about 60 percent of the total trade
within the Community, and Kenya has consistently had a favorable balance
of trade within the Community. During the 1960's, manufacturing output
increased by between 6 and 7 percent in Uganda and Kenya and over 12 per-
cent in Tanzania, which had to build on the smallest base. Table 1 below
provides an indication of differences in industrial development between
the three Partner States.

24.       Industries in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are protected by a
common external tariff, In Tanzania and Uganda a number of industries
enjoy the additional protection of transfer taxes on imports from Kenya.
Although the rates of the common external tariff are moderate, the ef-
fective protection afforded is higher because of the relatively low value
added locally. The external tariff protection is reinforced by import
licencing and quota restrictions in all three Partner States. The pro-
tection against imports from outside the Community has encouraged the
growth of import substitution industries which are generally capital in-
tensive and are likely to remain dependent on imported inputs for some
time. With the expected shift of emphasis in all three countries towards
export oriented and labor intensive small-scale and rural industries,
different incentives, such as infusion of technical assistance and local
credit, will be required.



- 8 -
25.       The climate for private industrial investment continues to be
good in Kenya but is somewhat uncertain in Uganda; in Tanzania the Govern-
ment has taken over most medium- and large-scale industrial projects,
although private entrepreneurs are still active in small-scale manufac-
turing. In recent years, all three Partner States have taken measures
to increase the role of the State in the industriai sector. The process
has gone furthest in Tanzania, where since 1967 Government policy has.
required majority State ownership of all industries considered basic to
the economy. In Kenya, on the other hand, the Government still looks to
the private sector as the mainspring of development in industry, although
in the past two years it too has moved cautiously to extend public par-
ticipation in certain key industries. In Uganda, under the Obote Govern-
ment, legislation to-extend State participation in all key sectors was
promulgated but not fully implemented. Under the new Government these
measures have been substantially modified, and it is now intended that
the Government will participate, usually on a minority basis, in certain
key sectors such as banking, petroleum refining and sugar production.
26.       East Africa has a substantial potential for future industrial
growth.  The rate of growth in the past, though not spectacular, has
been steady, with the main impetus coming from import substitution. The
scope for further import substitution is now more limited, particularly
in the more advanced Kenya industry, and future growth will depend more
on the growth in domestic demand and on export markets. The future growth
of industry will therefore be tied more closely to the expansion of agri-
cultural production and the promotion of new export markets in Africa and
overseas. The scope for multinational industries which cater for the
regional market is still unclear, but the Community has commissioned fea-
sibility studies of the three most promising prospects for multinational
industries. It will, of course, be necessary to reach agreements between
the Partner States before such industries can be established.
PART IV - THE PROJBCT
27.       As stated earlier (paragraph 7), a central tenet of the Treaty
for East African Cooperation establishing the Community, was to redress
imbalances in industrialization within the three Partner States. The
system of sharing a part of the income tax collected from manufacturing
and financial enterprises operating in the region, the system of trans-
fer taxes between Partner States, and the harmonization of fiscal incen-
tives were three measures designed to achieve this purpose. The fourth
and most direct measure was the creation of the East African Development
Bank as a vehicle for financing and promoting industrial development within
the Community, with a mandate requiring it to favor the relatively less
-industrialized states,



-9-
28.       The EADB, established under the Treaty in 1967, commenced
operation in July 1968 and entered into its first comnitment in 1969.
The Bank's contacts with the EADB date back to its inception and
Bank staff have from time to time, on invitation, given advice on its
organization, staffing and operating policies. In late 1970 the EADB
approached the Bank for a loan and an appraisal mission visited East
Africa in August 1971. A report entitled "Appraisal Report - The East
African Development Bank" (No. DB-87a dated June 6, 1972) is being
circulated separately. A Loan and Project Summary is provided in An-
nex III. The proposed loan constitutes the Bank's first involvement
in industrial financing in East Africa.
29.       Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
in March 1972. The EADB was represented by Mr. Iddi Simba, Director
General; Mr. I. Baruti, Manager, Project Supervision; and Mr. D. Mulira,
Legal Officer; Kenya was represented by Mr. Laxman Bhandari, Deputy
Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning; Tanzania was represented
by Mr. R. Korosso, Assistant Director, External Finance Department,
Ministry of Finance; and Mr. Leopold Kalunga, State Attorney; and Uganda
was represented by Mr. C.S. Nakabale, Chief Finance Officer, Ministry
of Finance.
The Institution
30.       EADB's Charter stipulates that the three Partner States will
hold equal shares of EADB's capital and that their joint ownership will
be at least 51 percent.  The Partner States now own 94 percent of paid-
in capital; the balance is held by various foreign banks. The largest
non-government shareholder is the African Development Bank which holds
3.5 percent.
31.       The Board of Directors is EADB's highest authority on all
operational matters. Unlike other Community organizations, EADB does
not come within the purview of any of the Community's Councils or minis-
ters. Certain major decisions, such as amendment of the Charter, ap-
pointment of the Director General, acceptance of new shareholders, etc.,
require the approval of the Community Authority (the three Heads of
State). The present Board is composed of three directors; each appointed
by a Partner State.
32.       The Director General;, who is the Chairman of the Board, but
without a vote, is appointed by the Authority for a term of five years.
He is the Chief Executive of the Bank. The incumbent, a Tanzanian, was
a senior civil servant before his appointment as Director General. He
also served as an Alternate Executive Director of the Bank Group. During
the four years of his tenure he has assembled an able staff of 29 profes-
sionals. The bulk of these are nationals of the three Partner States,
and, though they are well qualified, their relative inexperience has re-
quired employment of six expatriates to fill certain key positions,



- 10 -
including that of the Chief of Operations, who is respoiisible for all
of EADB's term investment activities. The present Chief of Operations
is to retire in July this year and a replacement has been selected.
His qualifications and experience appear to be satisfactory.
Objectives and Operating Policies
33.       EADB's main objectives, as laid down in the Charter, is to
promote industrial development (excluding building, transport and tour-
ist industries) in the three Partner States by providing technical and
financial assistance. In so doing, EADB's Charter requires it to con-
duct its business according to sound banking principles and to finance
only economically sound, technically feasible and properly appraised
projects. The Charter further stipulates that EA.DB's investments in
projects which satisfy these criteria be distributed among the three
Partner States to achieve the following distribution: 38.75 percent
each in Tanzania and Uganda and the balance of 22.5 percent in Kenya.
The purpose of this differential formula is to promote faster industrial
development in the relatively less industrially developed Partner States.
This differential formula is subject to review by the Authority after
the EADB has been in operation for 10 years.
34.       In fulfilling its objectives, EADB is expected to complement
the activities of national development agencies and other development
organizations.- As the only regional financial institution in East Africa)
EADB can also make a valuable contribution: through its knowledge of
regional markets, and in cooperation with regional authorities, it can
select and support projects so as to minimize duplication of industrial
plants, and try to convince its clients to complement rather than compete
with manufacturers in other Partner States.
35.       In addition to the general guidelines for the conduct of EADB's
business, the Charter contains some specific limitations, including
prohibition from engaging in refinancing operations, which are designed
to safeguard its financial viability; these limitations are reasonable
and prudent. They have been complemented and elaborated upon in a State-
ment of Policy adopted by EADB's Board which limits EADB's exposure in
any single enterprise and provides for an annual review of the invest-
ment portfolio by EADB's management and auditors.
36.       EADB staff undertakes appraisal of projects covering the mar-
keting, technical, financial and economic aspects of each project0 Ap-
praisals have been generally carefully prepared and adequate in their
examination of the major issues. The techniques for undertaking an
economic analysis have been rather elaborate and the EADB is in the
process of refining them to arrive at simpler means of, evaluating the
economic impact of projects, Each draft appraisal report is reviewed
by a Staff Committee and a Management Committee before submission to
the Board.



37.       A Supervision Division has been set up recently and follow-up
procedures have been drawn up. These procedures, along with periodic
reports from the borrowers, appear adequate. Disbursement procedures
are specifically set forth, and borrowers are obliged to submit to EADB
evidence that approved investments are actually being made.
Resources and Operations
38.       Of EADB's authorized capital of $56 million equivalent, $36.3
million equivalent have been subscribed and of this $18 million equi-
valent have been paid up. Half of the paid-up capital has been provided
in foreign currency and the balance in local currency funds. To date
EADB has obtained two loans; a loan from the African Development Bank
for $2 million equivalent and a loan from the Kingdom of Sweden for ap-
proximately $5 million equivalent.
39.       Total investments approved by EADB, bulk of which are in the
form of loans, have evolved satisfactorily over the three years of its
operations and at the end of 1971 totalled $17.2 million. The regional
distribution of the approved investments is Kenya 29 percent, Tanzania
33 percent and Uganda 38 percent. This distribution in terms of approv-
als is reasonably close to the differential formula which specifies ap-
proximately 22 percent for Kenya and approximately 39 percent each for
Tanzania and Uganda. Commitments have lagged, especially in Uganda,
and totalled about 61 percent of the approvals at the end of 1971. Of
the total commitments, 46 percent have gone to Kenya, 33 percent to Tan-
zania and 21 percent to Uganda. A significant proportion (40 percent)
of EADB's commitments are to Government-owned enterprises. None of
EADB's loans to clients have yet become due, and it is too early to make
a definitive judgment on the quality of its portfolio.
4o.       In projecting EADB's activity for the next two years, account
has been taken of the differential formula. EADB's ability to invest
in Kenya and Tanzania will be constrained to the extent that the invest-
ment potential in Uganda proves to be a limiting factor. This in turn
will call for greater promotional activity in Uganda and to an extent
in Tanzania.
41.       It has been estimated that EADB's commitments in 1972 for
Uganda and Tanzania would be about $3.8 million each and for Kenya $2.2
million, giving a regional total of $9.8 million. It is projected that
the total commitments would rise to $12.6 million in 1973. On the basis



- 12 -
of these projections, and assuming that 70 percent of these commitments
will be for financing the imported component of projects, EADB would
require about $15.7 million equivalent during the period up to December
1973. The loan from ADB ($2 million) and the proposed loan ($5 million)
from Sweden will leave a gap of about $8 million which it is proposed.
that the Bank should cover.
42.       The proposed Bank loan would be on terms similar to those for
other development finance companies. Since EADB has been in operation
for only a comparatively short period of time and has not had a chance
to build up its portfolio and reach a suitable level of profitability,
it is proposed that the Bank's commitment charge accrue only from the
respective dates on which- various sub-projects are authorized by the
Bank.
430       Prior Bank approval would be necessary for each sub-project
requiring Bank funds in excess of $300,000 and the aggregate free limit
would be $2.4 million. The foreign exchange risk will be passed on by
EADB to its borrowers. Since EADB's portfolio is unseasoned, the debt/
equity limit will be 3:1, a limit which EADB is not expected to approach
until the late 1970's. The proposed loan would be restricted to financing
the cost of imported goods and services needed for investments supporited
by EADB.
PART V - LEaAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the East African
Development Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreements between the Republic
of Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Republic of Uganda, re-
spectively, and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       The legal structure of the loan documents follows the similar
pattern used for the Bank's loans for projects in the East African
Community.
46.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions normally used for
development finance company projects. A number of modifications have
been made in the Bank's General Conditions to adapt them for three guar-
antors (see Schedule 2 to the draft Loan Agreement). The draft Guarantee
Agreements are substantially similar to each other. Section 2.01 of each
of these Agreements provides for the joint and several guarantee of the
three guarantors. In addition, since under the provisions of the Treaty



- 13 -
for East African Cooperation any debt incurred by the Commmmity would
be charged against certain tax revenues of the three member Govern-
ments, a limited exception to the negative pledge is made in Section 3.01
of each of these Agreements.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
The performance of the three Community Corporations under our
projects has been generally satisfactory0 The East African Railways
Corporation's (EARC) 1969-72 Development Program, which is being financed
under Loan No. 674 EA, is behind schedule and is likely to require some
rephasing. This in turn will result in a postponement of the next phase
of its development plans. These delays were largely due to the Cor-
poration's inability to get necessary authorizations from its Board of
Directors, which did not function during the Tanzania/Uganda dispute
which affected the appointment and acceptance of the Ugandan nominee
for Chairman.
