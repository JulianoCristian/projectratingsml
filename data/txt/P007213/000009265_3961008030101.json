strengthen the financial\n            management capacity of the Government and to help restore\n            confidence in public sector integrity and competence. The\n            project will have two specific objectives. The first will be\n            to improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency\n            of the financial management functions of the public sector\n            through implementation of an Integrated Financial Management\n            System (SIAF) centered in the Ministry of Finance and a\n            modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the\n            Comptroller General's Office. The second objective will\n            be to improve the delivery of public services by supporting\n            decentralization to line ministries of primary\n            responsibility for management of their financial resources.\n            The project comprises three major components: 1) reform of\n            financial management policies and procedures supported by\n            outside technical assistance; 2) investment in information\n            systems involving the purchase and installation of computer\n            hardware and software systems; and 3) a training component."}, "docdt": "1995-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
