Guatemala: Streamlining the Financial Management System                                                 July 1, 2002
                      In Guatemala, a creaking budgetary accounting and payments system meant delays and frustrations for
                      contractors waiting to be paid. Officials and the public were kept in the dark about how their budgets
                      were spent. Since 1995, two World Bank loans [1], [2] worth $25.1 million have helped Guatemala’s
                      government replace this unreliable system.

                      Using a Guatemalan-developed computer and management system, the World Bank-supported reform
                      slashed payment time to three days. The new technology, combined with better, decentralized
                      management, helped the Guatemalan government present its annual budget to the country’s legislators
on time, and deliver on promises to decentralize health and education services so that they reach the rural poor.

The project has also enabled government ministries to plan and execute their own respective budgets. Transactions are
registered in an electronic database that can be viewed by each ministry, as well as the finance ministry, and the Comptroller
General’s Office. Arrears have been eliminated, prices charged by suppliers reduced by a wide margin, and the budget is
managed more effectively.
