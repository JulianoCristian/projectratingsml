Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated January 22, 1996 entered into between

In response to your February 24 and March 20, 1997 requests to: (a) increase the 
percentage to be financed under the Loan for training activities under Category (3) as 
set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement; (b) create 
a new disbursement category to finance Operating Costs by reallocating $200,000 
equivalent allocated to the new Category (5) as set forth in the table in paragraph 1 
of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement; and (c) continue the financing of information 
systems under Part B of the Project by reallocating $1,500,000 equivalent from 
Category (2) to Category (1) as set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to 
the Loan Agreement, the Bank hereby proposes to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
1.
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 is amended to read as set forth in the 
Annex to this Amendment Letter.
2.
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 is hereby amended by: (a) deleting the word “and” at 
the end of subparagraph (b); (b) replacing the “period” at the end of subparagraph (c) 
by a “semi-colon” and the word “and”; and (c) adding a new subparagraph “(d)” which 
shall read as follows:
“(d) the term ‘Operating Costs’ means the expenditures
incurred in connection with the acquisition and utilization of office
supplies, including photocopying, telephone, mailing and power supply
services, office rent and maintenance of the vehicle, all for the 
administration of the Project.”.
This Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall 
be an original, and shall become effective on the date of this Amendment Letter once 
the Bank has received one fully executed original of this Amendment Letter. Please 
confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating the two
