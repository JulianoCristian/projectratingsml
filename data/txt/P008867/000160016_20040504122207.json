PREPARATION AND SUPERVISION OF PROJE", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4171;P312", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project ratings are as follows:\n            project outcome is unsatisfactory; project sustainability is\n            highly unlikely; institutional development impact is\n            negligible; and both the performances of the Bank and the\n            Borrower are unsatisfactory. Some of the principle lessons\n            learned include the following: Properly assess the\n            government's commitment to reform during the appraisal\n            phase of the project (In this project, the Government's\n            lack of commitment to reform was not clearly identified, and\n            led to failure to effect critical changes that contributed\n            to the negative outcome of the project). Where institutional\n            capacity and/or knowledge of Bank operational procedures is\n            weak, should have simple objectives that focus on addressing\n            the most critical problem, rather than trying to address all\n            of the sectoral problems in one operation.  The Bank needs\n            to maintain a close dialogue with the Borrower, to ensure\n            that the Bank and the Government's priorities for\n            sector and project development and their implications are\n            fully understood and reconciled by all parties before\n            embarking on major operations. Technical Assistance\n            components of a project are often perceived as being of\n            little value, especially when not accompanied by\n            investments. Although Government priorities for sector\n            development at the time also focused on, among other things,\n            restructuring the sector institutions, the increasing\n            frustration with lack of tangible investments on the ground\n            contributed to the deterioration in the attitude towards the\n            project.  During project preparation, local requirements and\n            policy with regard to key project activities such as\n            procurement should be properly assessed and discussed\n            exhaustively with the Borrower especially with reference to\n            Bank procurement procedures, because they can be a source of\n            confusion and impede progress during implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
