The present assessment\n            evaluated users' satisfaction in four women's\n            centers with positive results. Several evaluations of\n            women's centers carried out between 2001-2003\n            corroborate the reduction of maternal and child mortality\n            rates and high cost-effectiveness. The creation of 90 new\n            women's centers is part of the National Health Plan for\n            Nicaragua. Prinzapolka is the poorest municipality in the\n            country and 95 percent of its population corresponds to\n            Miskito Indians. It is the only municipality, however,\n            without a Municipal Health Delegation on the Atlantic Coast.\n            At present it depends administratively on both Puerto\n            Cabezas and Siuna. The Regional Health Plans recommend the\n            creation of a Municipal Health Delegation and Council to\n            attend the needs of Prinzapolka."}, "docdt": "2005-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
