F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The overall Adaptable Programmatic Loan (APL) program development objective, as
defined in the 1998 Board document, was to improve health outcomes in Nicaragua,
particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and
sustainability of the Nicaraguan health system. In this second phase of the APL, IDA
financing was to contribute, alongside funds from the MOH and other SWAp partners, to
improve maternal and child health in the poorest municipalities of Nicaragua,

                                             iv
concentrating on roughly half of the country’s poor. By improving the health status of
this segment of the population, health inequities were expected to decrease, as shown by
disparities in maternal and infant mortality indicators across geographical areas and
income groups. These goals would be achieved through the support of three objectives, as
set up in the sector Five-Year Implementation Plan, namely: (i) the extension of coverage
of a basic package of health and nutrition services to the poorest areas of the country, via
the new integrated model of health care; (ii) the physical and functional strengthening of
the health service facilities network, focusing on maternal-infant care, so as to provide a
seamless path of essential services in the target areas; and (iii) institutional strengthening
and capacity-building, concentrated specifically on developing the purchasing,
monitoring and evaluation capacities of the MOH, its leadership role to enhance donors’
alignment and harmonization, and the management capacity of MOH decentralized units
and Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast.

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.    By the early 2000s, Nicaragua confronted many traditional health challenges similar
to a country in the early phases of an epidemiological transition. Infectious diseases,
prenatal illnesses, malnutrition, acute respiratory diseases and diarrhea dominated the public
health agenda. While advances had been made in maternal and infant mortality outcomes, it
seemed unlikely that Nicaragua would achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

2.   Inequality in access to health services persisted across socio-economic groups and
there was wide variation in the quality of services across regions. These inequalities were
compounded by relatively low coverage of health insurance under the Nicaraguan Social
Security Institute (lNSS). In 2003, the IHSS covered only 9 percent of the population, but almost
70 percent of its beneficiaries belonged to the wealthiest 40 percent of the population. The poor
were forced to rely overwhelmingly on services from the Ministry of Health (MOH). Out-of-
pocket purchases of medicines were also high at the time of appraisal, constituting about 49
percent of all health expenditures. Many of Nicaragua's poor often relied often on self-treatment.

3.    MOH fmancing was heavily dependent upon external financing, which contributed to
a fragmentation in the delivery of health services. Between 1999 and 2003, external financing
grew from 18 percent as a share of total MOH expenditures to 24 percent. While the increase in
external funding was important for continuing services, it led to fragmentation. In 2003, the
MOH reported that there were 36 distinct internationally funded projects in the health sector
which supported 14 distinct primary health care models. Some of these projects were targeted to
specific departments. These challenges stressed the need for the MOH to achieve a sustainable
form of fmaucing, to define a sector-wide program that would be supported by all donors and
multilaterals, and address the inequalities in health expenditures.

4.   Recognizing these challenges, the Government agreed with the International
Development Association (herein referred to as IDA) and other donors supporting the
sector to coordinate official development aid by adopting a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp)
model. Nicaragua had been assertively advocating for improved coordination among donors and
more predictable development assistance. The country became a pilot for a number of
harmonization initiatives for the Organization for Economic Development - Development
Assistance Committee (OECD-D1\.C) and prepared, jointly with donor partners a National Plan
for Harmonization and Alignment with a country-specific indicators and a monitoring
mechanism embedded in locai processes. In line with this, development partners agreed to
support a single strategic framework and set of objectives for the health sector.

5.     A Five-Year Implementation Plan for the MOH's 2004-2015 National Health Plan
(NHP) served as the strategic framework to align donor support. The three strategic
objectives of the Implementation Plan included: (i) .the extension of coverage of a bask package
of health services (BPHS) to the poorest areas of the country via the new Integrated Health Care
Model; (ii) the improvement in the physical and operational capacities of the health service
facilities netWork with a focus on maternal-infant care; and (iii) institutional strengthening and
capacity-building at the ,central and regional level with specific emphasis on fiduciary


                                                1
management, monitoring and evaluation, and the standardization of services.

6.    Initially, development partners intended to pool funds in support of the
Implementation Plan. At the time of appraisal, many of the development partners including
Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, the IDB and IDA agreed to pool their funds with counterpart
funds to create a single fund to support the implementation of the Implementation Plan in
defined areas of the country for a total of US$82.2 million (Table 1). Subsequently, this group
constituted themselves into FONSALUD, which is described later in the ICR. Pooling of IDA
funds was later found not to be legally feasible, given the difference in fiduciary procedures
between the Association and other development donors. Instead, IDA and the IDB (which faced
a similar situation) agreed that their projects would have identical objectives to the
Implementation Plan. The Japanese and the United States Agency for International Development
also agreed to participate in SWAp related activities, but decided early on not to pool their funds.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the United Nations Population Fund
(UNDP) participated as observers.

7"     Given that the Bank had already committed to an Adaptable Programmatic Loan
(APL) for the Health Services Extension and Modernization Program, its involvement in
the SWAp was through the second phase of the APL. Since 1998, IDA had been supporting
the first phase of a two-phase APL. The first phase was a US$32 million health sector credit that
was co-financed by the Norwegian Agency for Development and Cooperation. The first phase of
the APL aimed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of the health system by: (i)
strengthening first level care and nutrition; (ii) modernizing the hospital network; (iii) developing
the institutional capacity of the ministry of health; and (iv) supporting social security reform.
Through APL I, the MOH developed mechanisms and regulations to improve the Ministry's
regulatory and management tools. For the implementation and execution of the funds of APL 2,
APL 1 achieved specific triggers which are included in Annex 11.

8.    The objectives the second phase of the APL were in line with Nicaragua's 2001
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (Report No. 22627-NI) and the sector reforms
and actions ofthe World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 25043-NI)
discussed by the Executive Directors on December 18, 2002. The 2002 CAS outlined a
framework for assistance during FY03-FY05 around the objectives and targets set out in the
2001 PRSP; the second phase of the APL was included in support of two of its pillars
(investment in human capital and better protection of vulnerable groups).

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators



                                                  2
9.    The overall APL supported improvements in health outcomes in Nicaragua,
particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and
sustainability of the Nicaraguan health system. The objective of the Project, the second phase
of the APL, was to improve maternal and child health in Nicaragua's poorest municipalities by:
(a) ensuring that Participating Communities (PCs) have access to a package of basic health and
nutrition services; (b) strengthening the Government's health services facilities network; and (c)
providing institutional strengthening and capacity-building to the MOH.

10. The Project's Development Objective (PDO) Indicators were based on the common
set of indicators proposed under the FYIP and agreed on by all development partners
supporting the SWAp. These consisted of a set of five indicators aimed at capturing the longer-
term program impact on key MDGs. Additionally, fourteen Intermediate Outcome Indicators
were defmed to measure performance on: (i) improved access to maternal and child services, (ii)
strengthening of health services networks, and (iii) improved stewardship and institutional
strengthening. These indicators are described in greater detail under S~ction 3 of the main text
and Annex 2.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.       The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised during project implementation.

1.4         Main Beneficiaries

12. The Project's main beneficiaries were vulnerable rural and indigenous communities
living in underserved areas of the country. The target population comprised poor and
extremely poor families, in particular mothers, children and infants, in 79 municipalities in 10
departments and two indigenous territories. The Project supported various forms of training,
improvements in technology and,health facilities, and changes in management structures, which
benefitted health providers, administrators and hospital management staff.

1.5         Original Components

13. Original components were designed in line with strategic objectives set for the health
sector as a whole. Within this context, the Project components, as stated in the Credit
Agreement, were set up in terms of the ~ame strategic objectives as the FYIP. The three
components I are described below:

14. Component 1: Delivery of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS). The objective
of this component was to (i) pay capitation transfers to SILAIS administrative. units to deliver the
basic package of health services to participating communities and (ii) provide technical
assistance to develop institutional capacity in the SILAIS and municipios that will implement the
delivery of the basic package of health services. The basic package of services had a strong focus
on maternal and child health care. It included monitoring and promotion of growth and



1 In   the Project Appraisal Document these are stated as strategic objectives.


                                                             3
    development of children under-5 years of age, integrated care for women of reproductive age and
    detection and care of prevalent diseases (See Box 1 in Annex 2). For the delivery of services, the
    MOH entered into management agreements with the Local Systems of Integrated-Health Care
    (Sistema Local de AtenCion Integral de Salud- SILAIS) Administrative Unit. The MOH
    transferred the capitation payments to the SILAIS for the purchase of services from public, local
    providers (muiCipios) and/or qualified, private providers (mainly NGOs).

 15. Component 2. Strengthening the Health Services Facilities- Network. The objective of
this Component was to strengthen the MOH's health services facilities network through
reinforcing physically and functionally the primary and secondary care facilities of the MOH to
enable them to deliver the basic package of services through (i) rehabilitating and providing
medical and hospital support equipment for the operation of the hospitals and health care centers
in the municipalities covered by SILAIS and strengthening their managerial capacity; and (ii)
expanding the Casas Maternas (Maternal Homes) network by (a) building or rehabilitating
approximately 30 Casas Maternas and acquiring eqUipment-and furniture for all Casas Maternas
in the network and funding their recurrent costs; and (b) strengthening the provision of family
planning services. The rehabilitation of primary health care (PHC) centers and hospitals and the
purchase of medical equipment were focused in the municipalities~d SILAIS targeted under
the Project. All minor works and goods purchased under this component were aimed at
increasing the functionality of the PHC centers and hospitals. Furthermore, for the hospitals, it
aimed to improve their overall management including information, procurement and fmancial
management systems.

 16. Component 3. Stewardship, Institutional Development and Decentralization. To carry
out the National Health Plan and effectively lead the SWAp, the MOH needed to undertake a
variety of institutional reforms. This Component supported the MOH to (i) develop its leadership
capacity and accountability by: (a) developing capacity to evaluate the performance of the
national health system; (b) providing technical assistance to coordinate and monitor
implementation of the population policr; (c) providing capacity building and awareness raising
activities to encourage municipal Governments to take on their responsibilities regarding public
health; and (d) strengthening its ability to coordinate and harmonize foreign -aid in the health
sector by, inter alia, fmancing the operational costs of the entity that will be coordinating the
FYIP with the Government, the Ass()ciationand the donors; (ii) strengthen the institutional
capacity to improve health service delivery and equity by: (a) developing the MOH's purchasing
function; (b) providing technical assistance, training, and information technology systems
development to improve its fiduciary capacity; and (iii) further the MOH's decentralization
agenda by: (a) transferring human and fmancial resources to SILAIS Administrative Units and
local health care service providers; and (b) providing technical assistance, training and
information technology systems for the two autonomous regions of the Atlantic Coast.

1.6        Revised Components

17.      The project components were not revised during implementation.




2   This refers to the Government's policy on reducing the fertility rate.


                                                             4
1.7    Other significant changes

18. The closing date was extended by seven months from November 30, 2009 untH June
30, 2010 to enable the completion of minor rehabilitation works for health facilities, finalize
procurement of medical equipment for indigenous communities and to complete the financial
management assessment of the capitation transfers.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19. The Project design benefitted from a well-defined Five-Year Implementation Plan,
which drew on successful models of primary health care delivery and the financing and
management of service delivery. The Integrated Health Care Model (MAIS) was developed
using inputs from a comprehensive evaluation of the 14 primary health care delivery projectsthat
were being implemented in the public sector nationwide in 2004.' The main strategy of the MAIS
was to establish one basiC package of health services that would be adjusted to the needs of the
target population. The model also dermed the technical framework or key instruments for the
organization and delivery of quality health services (health team's organization and functions,
clinical protocols and service standards, contracting mechanisms and performance-based
payments). The Project design benefitted from some of the best practices in the country and the
region including the use of performance agreements with service providers and the use of
capitation payments.

20. The design of the Project also took into account the lessons'learned from the first
phase of the APL. This included the successful experience of the Maternal Homes (Casas
Maternas), introduced as a pilot intervention under APL I. These Maternal Homes are low-cost,
assisted-living homes where women, mainly from remote, rural areas, can stay in the days
leading up to giving birth and shortly thereafter, to ensure that women have ready access to an
institutional facility when they go into labor. Evaluations showed that both the community and
the women found the services important. Another important lesson was that the decentralization
of administrative responsibilities to the SILAIS and the provision of services by local providers
proved to be an effective way to expand coverage of services. However, the Implementation
Completion Report for APL I also noted that it was necessary to improve the MOH's regional
capacity and ability to monitor and evaluate ,performance.

21. Another innovative feature of, the Project was the use of the sector wide approach,
leading to coordinated donor support for a standard package of health services and
f"mancing and delivery model. This reduced the duplication and fragmentation of donor
support in the health sector.

22. Nonetheless, although the SWAp aligned donor support around common sector
objectives and strategies, efforts to pool all donor and counterpart funds did not succeed.
During appraisal, many of the development partners, including IDA, agreed to pool their funds in
support of the Government's Implementation Plan. The MOH created a group, the Nicaraguan
Health Sector Support Fund (FONSALUD), which would pool all the funds and follow identical
financial and procurement processes. At appraisal, the IDA project preparation team included


                                               5
  this as part oftne Project's design and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the
, donors to this effect. It was only after the Project became effective that it became clear that IDA
  wOj.il.ld not be able to pool its funds with the other donors due to differences in fiduciary rules and
  processes. As a result, the IDAteam continued to participate in the meetings of FONSALUD,
  butthe Project continued to use a dedicated account, dedicated accounting, reporting and audits.

 23. Anothe:r limitation         the Project design was the selection and measurement of the
 PDO Indicators. These indicators were agreed upon collectively by the Government and the
 development partners for the Government's overall program. As part of the SWAp, the IDA
 team used these indicators to measure progress towards the PDO, although it was unlikely that
 the Project alone could have led to an improvement in these indicators (the maternal mortality
 rate, infant mortality rate, under-5 mortality rate, and childhood malnutrition rate). Furthermore,
 the indicators were measured at the national level, although the Project operated only in the
 poorest municipalities. The adoption of these PDO Indicators was in line with the intended
 objective of the development partners to measure national progress towards the MDGs. In order
 to do this, the donors agreed on using the Nicaraguan Demographic and Bealth Survey
 (ENDESA), which is carried out every five years. This created a problem of defining both an
 appropriate baseline and targets. In effect, the baseline values of the indicator were drawn from
 the 2001 ENDESA, though in fact, it would have been more appropriate to use the 2006
 ENDESA indicators as baseline values,as the Project became effective in 2006. There was no
 means by which to measure the progress at the end of the Project (originally scheduled in 2009),
 as the next survey was scheduled for 2011. In the absence of a strong vital statistics information
 system, it was not possible to use other MOB administrative sources of information to measure
 changes in these development indicators. The lack of fmancing to strengthen the information
 system was a shortcoming of the design of the Project.

 24; Despite issues with the PD~ Indicators, most of the Project's Intermediate Outcome
 Indicators were appropriate and aimed at capturing measuring progress towards the
 project development objectives. The Project's Intermediate Outcome Indicators were primarily
 targeted at monitoring changes in access and use of PBe services, compliance with performance
 agreements, and the mitigation of key risk factQrs may contribute to increases in mortality
 (prenatal controls, postpartum visit, immunization coverage, and institutional deliveries). They
 also aimed to measure improvements in the MOB's capacity through improvements in the
 managing of capitation payments and compliance with management agreement targets.

 25.  The MOB was responsible for the overall strategy while local SILAIS were
accountable fo:r managing health service contracts with private and public providers and
supervising performance agreements with public providers. Overall, the MoB Board of
Directors, composed of the Minister, Vice-Minister and Directors Generals was responsible for
planning and implementing the sector's overall strategy. Within that group, the General Division
of Planning and Development (DGPD) was responsible for coordinating the Project. TheMoH
also created a formal Purchasing Unit, which was responsible for the administration and
execution of the capitation transfers. For the delivery of services, the MoB entered into
management agreements (convenios de gesti6n) with the SILAIS for the transfer of per capita
transfers and the delineation of management roles. Under these agreements, the SILAIS were
responsible for contracting the primary care health services, qualifying service providers,
supervising service contracts between the SILAIS and service providers and providing assistance


                                                   6
in the monitoring and evaluation of performance. Service contracts between the SILAIS and
private service providers (NGOs, among others) ensured that the SILAIS, using the capitation
transfers, could purchase the basic package of health services from the providers. SILAIS also
established performance agreements with institutional MOH public providers (municipios and
hospitals) to enforce the delivery of the basic package of services.

26. Placing project coordination and implementation under the DGPD was a notable
change from the arrangements under API. I. When designing the second phase of the APL,
the Government decided to abolish the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that had been used
under the fIrst phaseofthe APL and place the coordinator at the Director of the DGPD. The PIU
was dissolved and its staff, who were already familiar with the Bank's policies and processes,
were absorbed under the various technical divisions ofthe MOH. This proved to     important for
purposes of continuing the momentum from APL I and for promoting sustainable capacity in the
MOH. While Project coordination and implementation responsibilities remained under the
DGPD for the remainder of the Project,one of the challenges with this change was retaining
highly qualified fiduciary staff at lower salaries.

27. Finally, the Project's risk matrix accurately assessed Project risks and related
mitigation actions. The main risks identifIed included: (0 lack of continuity
commitment with the project's policies and strategies; (ii) lack of capacity
manage the complexity of a multi-donor program; (iii) mismanagement and comlption issues;
(iv) lack of understanding and agreement among donor agencies and Government in planning,
monitoring and evaluating the program; and (v) insufficient funds. Risks (Ii),        (v) were
mitigated through the development of the SWAp over the five years,                     ensured
sufficient funds for the Implementation Plan. Furthermore, even with a change in administration
in 2007 and the changes that took place in the health sector (see paragraphs 34~36), the
Government, in general, remained committed to the Project's overall strategies of supporting a
single model of health care (although the model changed), .a standard set of basic health and
nutrition services (with greater emphasis on prevention) and the decentralization of budget
management to the SILAIS ..

28. Readiness conditions. The Project had two effectiveness conditions, which were met by
April 2006.

29.   No formal QAG review was undertaken for this project.

2.2    Implementation

30. The Project was implemented over five and a half years. The US$11 million credit
(SDR 7.21p.illion) for phase two of the APL was approved by the Bank's Board on AprilS, 2005
and signed on June 7, 2005. The Project became effective on April 11,2006 and closed on June
30,2010, after one extension of the Closing Date.

31. Although the members ofFONSALUD could not pool their funds or use common
operational features, such as single accounts and financial reporting and audits, the group
became a highly effective mechanism for donor coordination. In the fIrst two years of Project
implementation, both the Bank and IDB were strongly criticized for not using country financial


                                              7
and procurement procedures, as other donors had agreed to use under the Memorandum of
Understanding. Over time, though, members of FONSALUD' w,eIcomed IDA's. strong
commitment to meet regularly with donors, to coordinate actions,' to discuss and receive
feedback on activities directly related to aspects financed under the Credit, and to.follow·up on
agreed common indicators.                                               ;
                                                                       ,   ,
32. The change in administration, one year after the Project's' effectiveness, also led to
some changes in the health sector and service delivery; however,' Dlany of these changes
built on the policies and strategies in place and therefore there: was no impact on the
Project's objectives. In 2008, the MOH presented a new National Health Plan which was based
on the previous model (MAIS) and aimed to address the equity, efficiency, and access gaps in
the Nicaraguan health sector through the implementation of a new Community and Family
Health Model (Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario, or MOSAFC). The MOSAFC was
heavily based on the MAIS, with a focus on providing universal and :free access to basic health
and nutrition services and hospital services; it varied from the MAIS in that the MOSAFC
package of services placed more emphasis on health promotion and: disease prevention and on
collaboration with local community organizations. It also sought to phange the past health care
paradigm in which the MOH's institutions passively waited for patients to demand medical
attention before providing services, and involve the family and the c<;lmmunity as key partners in
health promotion and prevention.

33. The new national health plan also had a greater emphasis on payment for results,
rather than services. Under the first years of the Project, the practiceoftransferring a portion of
the MOH budget to hospitals and maternal clinics based on a system of services rendered was
still common. By early 2008, though, with the change in administrations, this practice was
discontinued. This was replaced with budget transfers linked to perfhnnance agreements between
the SILAIS and services providers. With this change, one of the Project's Intennediate Outcome
Indicators, percentage of total budget transferred to the targeted SILAIS as purchasing of
services, was no longer monitored.                                   ' '

34. Finally, the MOB decided that only MOB public health facilities would provide basic
health and nutrition services, rather than NGOs or other private providers. The Project
design anticipated service provision would be done either thrqugh MOH public institutions
and/or private institutions (primarily NGOs). With the change in administration however, the
Government moved completely away from the delivery of serylc~sthrough NGOs to service
provision only through MOH public institutions (hospitals and health centers). Where facilities
did not exist, they sought to build them. This change was made: in an attempt to strengthen the
MOH's institutional capacity and access of services at the local level, which was in line with the
Project's objectives.

35. The establishment of the Project coordination under DGPD proved to be important
for promoting the Project's sustain ability. Throughout the. lifetime of the Project, there was
only one change in the Director of the DGPD (project coordinator). This occurred at the time of
the change in administrations.

2.2    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Impleme~tation and Utilization



                                                8
36. The overall responsibility for managing the M&E system was given to the DGPD at
the central level. The DGPD was responsible for coordinating M&E efforts with the SILAIS
teams at the regional level. The SILAIS were responsible for monitoring progress at the local
level, which was then reported to the central level. Monthly and quarterly reports were designed
to keep adequate control on progress towards meeting results established under the Project. In
general, these reports were received in a timely manner.

37. In 2008, due to the shortcomings in the PDO Indicators and the data mentioned
earlier, the Project and the IDB began financing the implementation of an annual technical
audit to validate and verify information collected. During 2008, an external auditing firm was
contracted to assess the technical outcomes of the SWAp. The technical auditor conducted a
thorough review of raw data generated at the SILAIS and municipal level, the processes used for
validating and consolidating the indicators produced and verification of reported results. The
quality of results was evaluated based on a sample of municipalities. Overall, the last auditor's
report found that infonnation related to the Intennediate Outcome Indicators provided an
acceptable basis for detennining achievement of results. However, it was not able to audit the
PD~ indicators because the'systems to monitor these indicators were not in place. Furthennore,
improvements were needed at the primary health care centers regarding accuracy and
completeness of basic data gathered by them.

38. Overall, the M&E system was implemented well. Although it took some time to produce
reports on a regular basis, by the end of the second year of implementation the system was
working satisfactorily.

2.3    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39. Given the presence of Indigenous Peoples in the Project area, an Indigenous Peoples
Plan (IPP) was prepared; however, achievements on complying with the IPP were modest.
The IPP provided recommendations on how to provide the basic package of health services
considering traditional medicine, strengthen local networks of midwives, and provide social
control mechanisms. An assessment (2008) of the plan's implementation; however, found that
little progress was made on reaching remote areas, establishing new sub-regional health centers,
training of additional doctors and midwives, and strengthening social control mechanisms and
that funds had primarily gone toward purchasing medicines and medical equipment and
expanding the number of Casas Maternas in the Atlantic Regions. This was largely due to the
exclusion of key stakeholders from the central MOH during supervision in the dialogue with
representatives from the two autonomous regions, which lead to tension between the two parties.
As a result, the IPP rating was reduced to moderately unsatisfactory for nearly two years during
implementation. Based on these findings, the GON prepared and presented an action plan in mid-
2009 to address the deficiencies and implement corrective actions. Subsequently, the MOH has
adapted the new MOSAFC and the delivery of services to meet the needs and different demands
of indigenous communities and ethnic populations. By the end of implementation, the final
safeguard rating was changed to moderately satisfactory.

40. The Project complied satisfactorily with the environmental safeguards. In general,
practices for handling hospital waste management were improved. The environmental
assessment conducted during Project appraisal was focused on setting up a program for


                                               9
 completing preparation of guidelines on hospital waste management and established mechanisms
 to enforce its application. During implementation, most hospital rehabilitation programs included
 the redesign of waste management facilities and revised practices were established.

  41. The Project's rmancial management performance was moderately satisfactory. The
  main issues during implementation were related to overdue Interim Financial Reports, fixed
  assets controls, overdue audits, and the MOH's weak follow-up of the audit and supervision
  recommendations. In 2008, an audit identified some questionable costs related to the capitation
, transfers· to the SILAIS and health centers. As a result, a fmancial management assessment was
  completed shortly thereafter and concluded that for the period under review, the correct
  accounting and internal controls were in place and the capitation transfers were well managed. It
  also confirmed that these funds (vis-a-vis the capitation payments) provided the flexibility and
  immediate availability needed for the operation of the SILAIS and the health units. Overall, the
  MOH complied with the financial covenants of the Credit, and presented the Project's annual
  fmancial and external audit reports with no significant delays.

 42. Likewise, Project procurement was moderately satisfactory through much of the
 second half of the implementation period, and at one point, it was rated unsatisfactory. First,
 there was frequent turnover of procurement staff. The MOH had a difficult time keeping highly
 qualified procurement staff in its Procurement Division that were knowledgeable of the Bank's
.procurement guidelines and procedures. This was in large part because the salaries of individuals
 in the unit were not high enough to keep them there. Toward the end of the Project, the Bank
 agreed to finance two procurement staff under the Procurement Division of the MOH to avoid
 this type of turnover in the future. The second reason is because of the declaration of
 misprocurement for two contracts. In· 2009, the Bank;s Guidelines were not followed in two
 contracts. In one case, national bidding procedures were used instead of international. And in the
 other, only two proposals were requested under local shopping procedure, rather than of the
 standard three, as stated in the Association's guidelines. Consequently, in August 2010, the Bank
 declared misprocurement and cancelled US$714,762.08 of the health credit which corresponded
 to disbursements made in two contracts in 2006 and 2008. 3 In response, the Government
 communicated to the Bank, in a letter on August 6, 2009, that these amounts would be repaid
 after the National Budget Adjustment was approved by the National Assembly in October 2009.
 On November 10, 2009, the Bank received the full amount related to the cancellation.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43. The Bank is supporting the implementation of the MOSAFC Model that the
Government implemented in 2008 through a follow-up operation, the Improving
Community and Family Health Care Services Project (Report No: 56262-NI, approved by
the Board on December 7, 2010), which draws on lessons from the SWAp and the APL.
The objectives of the Project are to: (i) improve the access to, and the quality of, preventive and
promotion health and nutrition services among poor and vulnerable populations in Nicaragua; (ii)
strengthen the operational capacity of the MOH through the rehabilitation of health centers; and



3 The referred contracts are the following: (i) No CP-MlNSA-BM-7-2006 (PROCOSAM), US$2I,2I5; and (ii) PN-
BM-25-4-2008 (works for a Health Center, San Juan de Rio Coco, phase-I), US$682,977.85.


                                                   10
(iii) ensure fmancial support in case of a public health emergency. The new project will finance
capitation transfers for the purchase of a portion of the set of basic health services (conjuntode
prestaciones) defmedunder the MOSAFC in the 32 municipal health networks currently lacking
resources for implementation of the complete set of services.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44. The Project supported the standardization and effective delivery of the basic package
of health and nutrition services in poor and vulnerable communities, which continues to
resonate today. In an effort to reduce the cost of health care expenditures and to rapidly expand
access to services, the. Government focused establishing and expanding a standard package of
health and nutrition services vis-a-vie capitation transfers. This proved to be an effective way to
introduce incentives for providers to enroll beneficiaries and deliver services. The MOH still
uses this mechanism to deliver health promotion and prevention services today, as evident by the
design under the new Bank financed operation (Report No: 56262-NI).

45. The Memorandum of Understanding with FONSALUD remains important for
Government-donor relations. While the Bank quickly learned that it was not going to be able
to pool its funds with the other donors because of the different fiduciary rules and regulations,
FONSALUD became an important tool for harmonizing donors' support for policies and
programs within the sector. This prevented overlap and duplication of services in the same
municipalities and localities .. Most recently, the current donors that make up FONSALUD,
including the World Bank, agreed to support a common set of indicators and goals proposed by
the MOH.

46. The Project objectives continue to be in line with the Government's current health
strategy, the National Human Development Plan (NHDP) 2009-2011 and the MDGs. The
GON has acknowledged that the Project's objectives remain relevant to the current NHDP 2009-
20ll. The updated NHDP takes into account Nicaragua's domestic environment in a recovering
global economy. Priorities of the health sector emphasize preventive health care and the
availability of comprehensive services,· particularly for vulnerable populations. The Project's
objectives support several policy objectives articulated in the NHDP, including health
promotion, fighting against maternal and child mortality, increasing services to the poor and
closing access gaps, adapting appropriate care for indigenous groups, and making better use of
existing resources. 4 Finally, while Nicaragua has only achieved one of eight MDGs to date, the
Projects' objectives continue to be relevant in achieving these goals including MDGs 4 (Reduce
Child Mortality), 5 (Improve Maternal Health, currently categorized as "off track"), and 6
(Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases).

47. Significant progress was made in maternal and infant care. During the project life, the
maternal, infant and under five mortality rates decreased significantly nationwide. Furthermore,
in the targeted municipalities, the MOH successfully extended the basic package of health and
nutrition services from 129,700 individuals to 529,300 individuals. The Project also supported
increases in maternal and infant care as evidenced by an increase in institutional deliveries from
36.2 percent to 64.4 percent and a rise in the percentage of pregnancies with full (four controls)
prenatal care from 49.5 percent to 5S.4 percent.· The Project also increased the use of services,
particularly maternal homes (Casas Maternas), and increased hospital discharge rates in targeted
hospitals.

4S. Despite the change in Government in 2007 and modifications in the MOH's service
delivery model, important progress was also made in terms of strengthening health service
networks and improving the institutional capacity of the MOH. The Project supported
improvements in infrastructure and renovated existing primary health care centers allowing for
the MOH to extend access of a standard package of basic health and nutrition services to rural
and remote communities. Important progress was also made in the decentralization of budget
management and monitoring to the SILAIS. After the misprocurement, the implementation of an
action plan contributed to improve procurement capacity. However, the management and
institutional capacity of the SILAIS at the departmental level still needs much improvement.
Toward the conclusion of the Project, the Government began to evaluate the capacity of the
SILAIS and identify areas for improvement.

49. Progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives is mixed. As shown
below, while some of the indicators' targets were exceeded or met, others were only partially
met or not met at all. Data for two of the Intermediate Outcome Indicators, under the institutional
strengthening objective, are not available. One of the indicators, "percentage of total budget
transferred to the targeted SILAIS as purchasing of services" was dropped halfway through the
Project and another indicator, "per capita expenditure allocated to target SILAIS" was never a
part of the M&E system and therefore was never monitored.

50. Below is an evaluation of each of the key PDO Indicators and Intermediate Outcome
Indicators. PD~ Indicators were aimed at capturing, the longer-term program impact on key
MDGs and therefore data represent national averages. Measured impact cannot be directly
attributed to the Project. Data on Intermediate Outcome Indicators was collected for all 79
municipalities that were supported with IDA funds and funds from other donors. Annex 2
provides a more in-depth description of these indicators.

PDO Indicators

51. Of the four PDO Indicator targets, three were achieved and one was not achieved. During
the lifetime of the Project, the maternal mortality rate nationwide fell from 96 per 100,000 live
births registered in 2005 to 61 per 100,000 in 2009, exceeding the target of 65 for 2009. In the
period 2001-200S, the infant mortality rate fell from 31 per 1,000 live births to 23 per 1,000 live
births and the under-5 mortality rate fell from 41 per 1,000 live births to 27 per 1,000 live births
nationwide. The percentage of population with chronic malnutrition fell from 17.S percent in
2001 to 16.9 percent in 2006, which falls short of the 2009 target of 12.8 percent. Under the
project, chronic malnutrition was measured for the entire population; for the under-5 population,


                                                12
chronic malnutrition decreased from 25.8 to 21.7 percent from 2001 to 2006.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

52. Improved coverage and access to the basic package of health and nutrition services for
targeted population. Overall, the use of the capitation transfers for the extension of the basic
package of health and nutrition services proved to be an important mechanism for improving
maternal and infant health care. The six targets related to improved access and coverage of the
basic package of he~lth and nutrition services were all achieved. The Basic Package of Health
Services was extended to 529,652 beneficiaries in 2009, exceeding its target of 470,000
beneficiaries. MOH administrative data also showed notable results in maternal and infant health
care between 2005 and 2009, including an increase in institutional deliveries in the targeted
SILAIS from 36.2 percent to 78.7 percent; an increase in immunization coverage in infants under
1 from 78 percent) to 98.3 percent; an increase in early prenatal controls from 34.4 percent to
48.1 percent; and ~ increase in pregnancies with full prenatal care (four visits) from 49.5
percent to 58.4 percent. There was also an increase in the family planning methods utilization
rates in fertile women between 64.1 percent in 2001 and 72 percent in2006.

53. Strengthening Health Services networks in targeted area. Of the five targets proposed
under this second strategic objective, two targets were fully achieved and three targets were not
achieved. The two targets that were achieved were an increase in utilization of Maternal Homes
(Casas MaternasJas measured by the number of discharges, with 2,400 in 2005 and 9,749 in
2009 and an increase in the hospital discharge rate from 4.02 in 2005 to 6.3 in 2009. The three
indicators not met include the number of hospitals with a critical path complying with MOH
certification standards, the percentage of public health provider complying satisfactorily with
management agreement targets, and the percentage of maternal deaths audited. There was some
progress made on the last two indicators. Qualitative evidence also shows that the management
agreements proved to be important instruments for holding the SILAIS accountable for
purchasing the services. SILAIS were required to meet the requirements set out in the agreement,
particularly the adequate management of capitation transfers and the monitoring of the provision
of health services. During implementation, these agreements also served as a tool to increase the
operational and administrative capacity of the staff in the SILAIS.

54. ImprovedSector Stewardship and Institutional Strengthening. Of the three results aimed
at capturing th~ impact of this strategic objective, only one was achieved, while the other two
indicators wetenot monitored throughout much of the Project. For this third strategic objective,
only the percentage of MOH budget in Indigenous territories administered by the RAAN and
RAAS Governments was monitored and achieved, with 100 percent of the MOH budget for
Indigenous temtories going to indigenous territories. Of the other two indicators, the one
measuring the percentage of total MOH budget transferred to target SILAIS that is going toward
the purchase of services was dropped when the new administration decided to discontinue the
fee-for-servic~ practice; the other indicator, per capita public health expenditure allocated to
targeted BILAIS, was not included in the M&E system nor was· it monitored throughout the
lifetime of th~ Project. Project restructuring to add new indicators was never considered given
the lack of interest of donors to change the common set. of indicators and a greater emphasis
placed on other Intermediate Outcome Indicators.



                                               13
 3.3    Efficiency

55. The cost benefit analysis of the SWAp revealed considerable net benefits. A cost-
benefit analysis was carried out at appraisal, for the sectoral program as a whole, which included
contributions from members of FONSALUD other bilateral donors including USAID and Japan.
No estimates were made of net benefits accruing only from the IDA project. It was expectedthat
the Program would produce the following direct benefits: (i) reductions in hospital admissions of
children under-5 years of age;· (ii) a reduction in hospital bed-days due to efficiency
improvements; and (iii) improvements in the efficiency of the MOH oWing to advances in the
process of decentralization. It was further assessed thatthe Program would also produce indirect
benefits in the form of potential years of life that would be saved as a result. of nutrition
interventions, together with the lives saved from reducing child and maternal mortality rates in
the targeted areas. The present value of net benefits, over a 10...year plaflning horizon, was
estimated. at US$66.7 million, with an internal rate of return of 54 percent. .

56. Due to the scope of the sector-wide program, it was difficult to attribute the net
benefits of the program to anyone donor's investment. During implementation, some of the
investments covered sector needs beyond the original scope set for the five-year plan in the 79
municipalities in the 12 targeted SILAIS. Additionally, other sector investments not channeled
through FONSALUD also reached the target areas and therefore the impact of single· donor-
supported intervention was difficult to capture. The consequence was a difilassociation between
overall investment costs financed by MOH, through FONSALUD, IDA the IDB,and other
donors and the benefits foreseen under the original· scope of the SWAp scheme. For this reason,
it Was not possible to replicate the methodology used in the PAD to assess net benefits.

57. After the closing of the Project, the net benefits were re-assessed only considering the
return on the investment of the Project and found to be marginal (Annex 3) Conservatively,
it was assumed that benefits directly associated with the Project's investment could be in a range
between 30 and 40 percent of the total benefits. The assessment concluded that when benefits
were estimated to be closer to 30 percent, the rate of return was slightly negative. In tum, when
benefits were calculate to be closer to 40 percent, the rate of return can be estimated at close to 6
percent. Benefits were associated with the population in the 79 municipalities and estimated as
follows: (i) a reduction of maternal and infant mortality, (ii) a reduction in chronic malnutrition,
(iii) institutional and private cost gains resulting from improved practices,and (iv) savings
generated due to improved efficiency of MOH management processes from decentralization
scheme.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58. The Project's Overall Outcome Rating is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the
Project had satisfactory results and represented a good experience of harmonization between the
Government and several development donors. The main achievements include: (i) supporting the
achievement of 3 of the 4 PD~ Indicators and achievement of 10 of the 14 Intermediate
Outcome Indicators, and; (ii) an increase in prenatal care and institutional deliveries; (iii) the
defmition and provision of a basic package of care through primary health care services; (iv) the
use of an innovative mechanism (capitation payments) and performance agreements to improve


                                                 14
results; (v) improvements in the Ministry of Health's managerial and operational capacity; (vi)
an agreement among development donors to support the same primary health care model; and
(vii) donor harmonization.

59. Nonetheless, there were implementation challenges. Some of the main weaknesses and
challenges include: (i) the dropping of two of the PD~ Indicators; (ii) the challenge of measuring
some of the PD~ Indicators with a national focus, when the Project was targeted to specific
areas; (iii) the need to invest in surveillance and monitoring and evaluation systems; (iv) the need
to fme-tune the institutional and fiduciary arrangements; (v) the inability to pool donor funds, as
subscribed under a Memorandum of Understanding; (vi) the dropping of all NGO contracting;
and (vii) the need to continue to strengthen the MOH's capacity, partiCUlarly at the regional level,
to manage the capitation payments and monitor service delivery.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60. In general, the Project did have a direct impact on many of the communities living in
extreme poverty. The Project's interventions reached municipalities with the highest
vulnerability, with an explicit focus on maternal and infant care. The Project's activities targeted
improvements in access to health services in rural areas where the concentration of poverty is
extremely high. At the same time, it focused on indigenous populations living in the same rural
areas. Efforts were also made to adjust he~lth services procedures to the characteristics and the
socio-cultural needs of the different districts and communities with indigenous population. In
particular, the Project supported training of traditional midwives in order to provide institutional
deliveries in indigenous communities.

(b) Institutional· Change/Strengthening

61. The role of the MOH as the leader of the SWAp 'proved to be important in the
harmonization of donor support. The SWAp not only proved to be an important instrument to
pool some of the donors' funds (through FONSALUD), but it also became an instrument for the
MOH to bring together all donors and to harmonize technical and financial support. It also
provided an avenue for the MOR to support a single integrated model of health services and to
provide a standard basic package of health and nutrition services. This proved to be an important
institutional change for the MOR who had formally had to qeal with fragmented and sometimes
duplicative support from donors.

62. The decentralization of budget allocations and monitoring to the SILAIS also proved
to be an important for the delivery of services. While the MOR was responsible for overall
coordination of the health strategy, supervision, and management /administration of capitation
transfers, the SILAIS received capitation transfers and monitored progress at the local levels.
These agreements held the SILAIS accountable for achieving results framework in the
Government's FYIP. Today, their role remains critical in the provision of health services at the
departmental and municipal levels. While there is still a need to strengthen the SILAIS'
institutional and operational capacity, the MOR continues to support this institutional change and
has found these agreements to be valuable management tools.


                                                15
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

63.   No other unintended outcomes and impacts are worth noting.

3.6     Summary of Findings of BeJleficiary Survey andlor Stakeholder Workshops

64. Two beneficiary surveys were carried out in 2009a\nd 2010 aiming at obtaining
information about the perception that beneficiaries had. about the quality of services
provided in primary care health .centers. "Beneficiaries were women seeking service attention
for themselves or their children less than 5 years. The specific objective was to evaluate access to
health services and users satisfaction. A sample of 549 beneficiaries was selected for interviews
that took place as they were exiting a health service facility. Nearly 80 percent of beneficiaries
interviewed were women living in rural areas. Overall, 77 percent of the beneficiaries had a
positive perception of the quality of the services. The vast majority of beneficiaries, however,
complained that they were not treated well and that there needed to be considerable improvement
in the cleanliness ofhealth facilities. Additional findings are summarized in Annex 5.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

65. The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Moderate. The Project's main
contributions were in expanding coverage of a standard basic package of health and nutrition
services as part of a single integrated health care model and improving maternal and infant health
care services. Changes in the institutional management of the provision of health services were
also notable. That said, .there are three risks that· could potentially threaten development
outcomes.

66. The first risk is that Nicaragua is highly prone to external shocks, which could. affect
important gains made in the health sector. Over the past couple of years, Nicaragua has
endured multiple crises, including hurricanes (Felix and Ida), recurrent droughts ("el Niiio"
induced) and floods and the epidemiological emergencies such as the AlHINI flu pandemic and
the dengue epidemic. In June 2009, the first case of the AlHINl human influenza virus was
confirmed in Nicaragua. As of November 2009, the virus had spread to 101 ofthe country's 153
municipalities, requiring the health sector to provide nearly 16,000 treatments for AlHINI
patients and their contacts. The combination of these shocks considerably strained the
Government of Nicaragua's (GoN) financial and institutional resources. If these shocks continue
to occur, they are likely to threaten existing gains in poverty reduction and other social indicators
including those in the health sector.

67.   The second risk is the potential shut down of the health sector, as was the case in 2006.
In 2006, the entire Nicaraguan health sector went on strike, demanding an increase in salary
(Nicaraguan doctors and nurses were receiving the lowest paying salary.in the region). Hospitals
and health clinics shut down for more than six months, contributing to increases in maternal and
infant mortality, missed appointments· and a decrease in pre-natal controls. If a strike of this
magnitude were to occur again, achievements supported by the Project could easily be reversed.

68. The third risk is that external funding for the health sector is reduced having a direct
impact on access and services coverage. Recently, some development partners have reduced or


                                                 16
withdrawn their support to the Nicaraguan health sector. Given the sector's traditionally high
inflows of assistance, a significant reduction could affect the number of individuals, families, and
communities receiving basic health and nutrition services throughout the country that had
previously been supported under the Project. While the GON is currently reaching out to other
donors to maintain the level of funding, fewer resources would require the MOH to be more
efficient with the management and use of funds.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory
based on the following factors: In general, the technical design of the Project at entry was both
relevant for the health sector and considered the lessons learned under the first phase of the APL.
Nonetheless, the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding without a detailed assessment of
the Bank's fiduciary restrictions proved to be a challenge for project implementation in the
beginning. Finally, achievement of the PD~ indicators was difficult to follow given that data
from the ENDESA survey were only collected every 5 years.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70. The Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Despite challenges at entry,
the supervision of the Project was moderately satisfactory. While the Bank was not able to pool
its funds with the rest of the donors from FONSALUD, it played a key role in helping to
coordinate donor support througholl;t the lifespan of the Project. Bank supervision also relied
heavily on the local Bank office procurement and financial management staff and the human
development operations officer for frequent monitoring and follow-up with the MOH. The
addition of annual technical audits proved to be an effective tool to hold the Government
accountable for results. However, there were shortcomings in the monitoring of key PD~
Indicators, primarily due to the absence of a strong monitoring and surveillance system and
partly because some of the intermediate indicators became irrelevant during the Project. The
Project was never restructured, though, in part because the donors were not keen on re-defining
the indicators halfway through the SWAp and because there was greater emphasis placed on the
results from other Intermediate Outcome Indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71. Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This is based on a
Moderately Satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry and a Moderately Satisfactory rating for
Supervision.

5.2    Borrower Performance



                                                 17
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

72. The Government Performance is rated Satisfactory. Government performance is
interpreted as the broader Government, i.e., the MOF, the Ministry of the Presidency and other
central Government institutions. The GON showed ownership and commitment for the timely
implementation of the five-year implementation plan and provided strong leadership and
commitment through the change in administrations. Project objectives were closely aligned with
both administrations' health sector agendas and therefore notable outcomes in the provision of
maternal and infant health services were achieved. Finally, the Government was extremely
supportive in the design and development of the recently approved health sector operation
(Improving Community and Family Health Services Project; Report No: 56262-NI, which builds
on the successes ofthis Project).

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73. Overall, the Implementing Agency's performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory in
view of the differing levels of capacity and frequent turnover of critical fiduciary staff. The
MOR, as the implementing agency, was highly committed to achieving the results established
under the Project. It supported implementation of a decentralized scheme, strengthening SILAIS
and establishing new budgetary processes more in line with modem management schemes.
Furthermore, the MOR gained important ground as the leader of the sector-wide program and the
FONSALUD group. Nonetheless, frequent turnover of key fiduciary staff led to problems in
procurement and financial management. The MOR also struggled to comply with the poorly
defined IPP covenants.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74. Overall, the Recipient's Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory given that more
emphasis is placed on the performance of the implementation agency in palticular.

6.     Lessons Learned

75. The importance of surveillance and. monitoring and evaluation should not be
underestimated. Given the challenges associated with availability of data to monitor PD~
indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators, the Project could have had a stronger focus,
including dedicated financial resources, to strengthen surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.
Faced with these challenges, a project restructuring may have been helpful in addressing these
issues.

76. The use of national outcome indicators as PDO indicators was problematic given that
the Project had a targeted approach. While the use of common national targets for all donors
was helpful in terms of donor coordination and harmonization, it was not appropriate to measure
the success of this project which featured interventions in targeted areas. This affected the
economic analysis of the Project, and raised additional issues of attribution.



                                              18
77. Notwithstanding the issues in monitoring and evaluation, the Project also
demonstrated that the expansion of Maternal Homes (Casas Maternas) made a critical
contribution to improving institutional deliveries. It is estimated that 12 percent of
institutional deliveries during 2009, in municipalities covered by the Project, can be explained by
the increase in attendance to Women's Homes, with respect to the base year. In addition, the
number of pregnant women who came from rural areas to Women's Homes in urban areas
increased fourfold between 2005 and 2009. Coordinated action by these homes and community
health networks has also increased involvement in family planning programs. Building on this
success, further areas for improvement were identified during project implementation, including
the importance of: (i) harmonizing reproductive health training programs run by different
Government agencies, donors and NGOs; (ii) setting service standards and creating a Federation
of Women's Homes; and (iii) building capacity in additional communities.

78. More generally, the Project demonstrated that a Primary Health Care model based
on a basic package of services works in Nicaragua. The Bank will continue to support this
approach in the subsequent health project.

79. Performance Agreements became a very useful tool to establish a results-oriented
culture. This was a powerful tool that had a positive impact for managing decentralized health
programs. However, the system still needs further improvements for evaluating achievements on
a regular basis. Auditing the M&E system also helped to monitor the implementation of
performance agreements using a consistent methodology to enable corrective actions to be taken
in a timely manner. This was a highly positive contribution introduced by the Project that
enhanced the use of existing systems to produce reliable information on the PDO and
Intermediate Outcome Indicators used to assess achievements of results. Overall, it confirmed
that the information produced by the M&E system was reliable.

80. The Project also proved that it is possible to move from a situation of many models
and sources of financing to a coordinated sector approach. In fact, the sector wide approach
in the health sector proved to be a highly effective mechanism for coordinating donors' support,
and it may be possible to replicate this model in other sectors.

81. One final lesson, however, is that pooling funds is very difficult. The necessary
conditions to allow for pooling of funds are challenging, and in hindsight it may have been
overly optimistic given the country's capacity constraints and fiduciary systems to expect that
this could have been possible from the start. However, despite the fact IDA and the IDB were not
able to channel their financial resources through FONSALUD, their involvement helped to
strengthen coordination on the health sector investment programs and ensure that key priorities
were shared. Similarly, other donors who opted not to channel resources through this mechanism,
notably USAID and Japan, maintained active participation at critical meetings and a coordinated
approach in the sector.

1.      Component 1 - Extension of the Basic Package of Health Services. The objective of
this component was to (i) pay capitation transfers to SILAIS administrative units to deliver the
basic package of health services to participating communities and (ii) provide technical
assistance to develop institutional capacity in the SILAIS and municipios that will implement the
delivery of the basic package of health services. In general, the results from this component were
positive. The basic package of services had a strong focus on maternal and child health care. It
included monitoring and promotion of growth and development of children under-5 years of age,
integrated care for women of reproductive age and detection and care of prevalent diseases (See
Box 1).

             .. Early detection and treatment ofh ertension and diabetes mellitus.

2.     For the delivery of services, the MoB entered into management agreements
(convenios de gestiOn) with the SILAIS for the transfer of per capita transfers and the
delineation of management roles. Unde:· these agreements, the SILAIS were responsible for
contracting the primary care health services, qualifying service providers, supervising service
contracts between the SILAIS and service providers and providing assistance in the monitoring
and evaluation of perfonnance. Service contracts between the SILAIS and private service
providers ensured that the SILAIS, using the capitation transfers, could purchase the basic
package of health services from the providers. SILAIS also established performance agreements
with institutional public providers (municipios and hospitals) to enforce the delivery of the basic
package of health services.

3.      Capitation transfers were analogous to health insurance premiums for purchasing
coverage and were calculated on the basis of the average unit costs of ensuring access to the
defined package of health services to the target population. For the purchase of services, the
SILAIS entered into perfonnance agreements with public providers and services contracts with
private providers to ensure that the services were delivered in a timely manner. The transfers
were made monthly and adjusted annually to account for changes in population.

4.     This component contributed to the financing of capitation transfers to selected
SILAIS. The basic package of health services aimed at (i) monitoring promotion of growth and
development for children under-5 years, (ii) providing integrated care for women of reproductive
age, and (iii) providing care for common diseases, including sexually transmitted diseases,

5.     Improved coverage and access to the basic package of health and nutrition services for
targeted population. Of the six Intermediate Outcome Indicators set up to monitor· improved
access and coverage of the basic package of health and nutrition services, all six targets were
fully met.

   •   Beneficiaries to whom the package of Basic Health Services has been extended. The
       Project set a target of adding 470,000 new beneficiaries with access to the basic package
       of health services. At the time the Project was appraised, 129,698 individuals were
       benefitting from the basic package. By 2009,529,652 beneficiaries were benefitting from
       the basic package of health and nutrition services, exceeding the baseline by 12 percent.

   •   Institutional Deliveries. In 2005, only 36.2 percent of all women in the targeted
       municipalities had an institutional birth. Only a very modest increase was expected: the
       target was 37.9 percent. By Project closing, institutional deliveries had increased by 40.8
       percentage points, to 78.7 percent, exceeding the target.                      .

   •   Immunization coverage (pentavalent vaccine) in infants under 1 year of age. At the
       time of appraisal, immunization coverage was at 78 percent for infants under 1 year of
       age. The Project set the target at 97.5 of all infants under the age of 1. The Project target
       was exceeded, with 98.3 percent of children under-l receiving their immunization.

   •   Early prenatal control (fIrst trimester) in targeted municipalities. Notable
       improvements were made in terms of increasing prenatal controls for pregnant women. In
       2005, 34.4 percent of pregnant women were receiving prenatal controls. The percentage
       of women attending their prenatal control increased to 48.1 percent by the end of 2009,


                                                24
        exceeding the target 37.3 percent. This was an important advance for the Project.

    •   Pregnancies with full (four visits) prenatal care in targeted municipalities. The
        baseline was 49.5 percent of pregnant women in the targeted municipalities had
        pregnancies with ibll prenatal care and the target was 55 percent. By the Project closing,
        58.4 percent of pregnant women in the 79 targeted municipalities had received full
        prenatal care. Many of the pregnant women not completing their controls reside in the
        indigenous territories or communities. For many of them, the examination performed by a
        male doctor presented numerous cultural barriers.

    •   Utilization of family planning methods among fertile-aged women. In 2001, the
        ENDESA survey reported that 64.1 percent of fertile-aged women were using some sort
        of family planning method. Under the Project, a target value was set for 2006 at 66
        percent, and in 2006 the ENDESA survey reported that 72 percent of all fertile-aged
        women had used some form of family planning. Although this indicator was not
        measured again at the conclusion of the Project, the outcome value did meet the target
        value.

6.      Component 2 - Strengthening Health Services Networks. The objective of this
Component was to strengthen the MOH's health services facilities network through reinforcing
physically and functionally the primary and secondary care facilities of the MOH to enable them
to deliver the basic package of health services through (i) rehabilitating and providing medical
and hospital support equipment for the operation of the hospitals and health care centers in the
municipalities covered by SILAIS and strengthening their managerial capacity; and (ii)
expanding the Casas Maternas (Maternal Homes) networks in targeted areas.

7.      This component included the rebabilitation of two health posts and three health
centers with a total cost of US$190,OOO. The largest· rehabilitation project fmanced was the
rehabilitation of the critical path in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Estell with a total cost of
US$2.4 million. It also financed supply and installation of medical equipment and emergency
units in 12 hospitals for US$1.01 million, and the supply of US$158,000 in ambulances and
equipment in the Atlantic regions to support implementation of the indigenous people plan.

8.     Strengthening Health Services networks in targeted areas. Of the five Intermediate
Outcome Indicators proposed under this second strategic objective, two targets were fully
achieved and three targets were not achieved.

   •     Utilization of Maternal Homes (Casas Maternas) by pregnant women. One of the
         lessons learned from APL I was the importance of the maternal homes. As a result, the
        Project promoted the use of these ~ervices to reduce mortality and improve maternal and
         infant care. In 2005, the MOH had registered about 2,400 discharges of pregnant women
        from the maternal homes. The Project had projected that by 2009 there would be 6,000
        discharges from increased use. This target was exceeded by 3,749 discharges, reaching a
        total of 9,749 discharges in 2009.

   •    Rate of hospital discharges in 12 targeted hospitals. This efficiency indicator measures


                                               25
        the rate at which hospitals discharged patients, or the number of annual hospital
        discharges per 100 individuals in the areas who had access to or used the services in the
        targeted hospitals. By appraisal, the MOH was reporting an average hospital discharge
        rate of 4.02 percent. By Project closing, the hospital discharge rate had increased to 6.3
        percent, exceeding the target.

   .•   Number. of hospitals whose critical path is in compliance with MOB certification
        standards. By appraisal, none of the hospitals in the targeted departments were certified;
        the target of 9 hospitals. Supervision missions reported that three of the 12 targeted
        hospitals had been visited and that their critical paths were in full operation. It was never
        confirmed, though, that the MOH had certification standards. As a result, this indicator
        was not met.

    •   Percentage of public health providers complying satisfactorily with management
        agreement targets. This indicator aimed to capture if the targets set out in ,the
        management agreements between the MOH (through the SILAIS) and the institutional
        providers (hospitals and municipalities; other agreements were used for NGOs and
        private providers) were satisfactorily met. Some of the elements set out in the
        management agreements included the number of individuals covered, institutional
        capacity improvements, and management of capitation transfers (as defmed in the results
        framework in the GON's Five-Year Implementation Plan. While the target was set at 100
        percent, by Project closing, it was reported that only 60 percent of the public health
        providers had satisfactorily complied with the management agreement targets. As a result,
        this indicator was partially met.

    •   Percentage of maternal deaths audited. A target of 100 percent of maternal deaths
        audited had been set at appraisal. By 2010, only 75 percent of the deaths had been audited.
        As a result, this indicator was only partially met.

9.       Component 3 - Stewardship, Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization. In
order to carry·out the NHP and effectively leading the SWAp, the MOH needed to undertake a
variety of institutional reforms. To do so, this Component supported the MOH to (i) develop its
leadership capacity and accountability; strengthen the institutional capacity to improve health
service delivery and equity; and (iii) further the MOH's decentralization agenda. Some of the
activities included the carrying out of the 2006 ENDESA survey, the strengthening of
procurement and financial activities in MOH, and technical and financial aUditing. It also
included support for improving budget processes in targeted SILAIS, budgetary decentralization
achieved in the Atlantic regions and capitation allocations. It should be noted that improvement
of budgetary processes for purchasing of health services was not implemented, since the Ortega
administration revised the policy of contracting out these services. Consequently, this indicator
became irrelevant.

10.     Improved Sector Stewardship and Institutional Strengthening. Of the three
Intermediate Outcome Indicators aimed at capturing the impact of this strategic objective, only
one of the indicators was achieved, while the other two indicators were not monitored throughout
much of the Project.


                                                26
•   Percentage of total MOB budget transferred to target SILAIS that is going toward
    the purchase of services. During appraisal, the practice of transferring a portIon of the
    MOR budget to hospitals and maternal clinics based on the system of services rendered
    was still common. In late 2007, with the change in administrations, this practice was
    discontinued. As a result, this indicator become irrelevant and was excluded from the
    Monitoring and Evaluation system.

•   Percentage of MOB budget in Indigenous territories administered by the RAAN
    and RAAS Governments. Given the importance placed on extending the basic package
    of health and nutrition services in the two autonomous indigenous territories (RAAN and
    RAAS), this indicator aimed to measure how much of the funds the two territories were
    managing at the conclusion of the Project. The target was set at 100 percent and the
    Project met the target.

•   Per capita public health expenditure allocated to targeted SILAIS. No information
    regarding this indicator was included in the M&E system.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       This annex presents the summary results of the cost-benefit analysis of the second
phase of the APL. A cost-benefit analysis was carried out at appraisal, for the sectoral program
as a whole, which included contributions from members of FONSALUD other bilateral donors
including USAID and Japan. No estimates were made of net benefits accruing only from the IDA
project. It was expected that the Program would produce the following direct benefits: (i)
reductions in hospital admissions of children under-5 years of age; (ii) a reduction in hospital
bed-days due to efficiency improvements; and (iii) improvements in the efficiency of the MOH
owing to advances in the process of decentralization. It was further assessed that the Program
would also produce indirect benefits in the form of potential years of life that would be saved as
a result of nutrition interventions, together with the lives saved from reducing child and maternal
mortality rates in the targeted areas. The present value of net benefits, over a 10-year planning
horizon, was estimated at US$66.7 million, with an internal rate of return of 54 percent.

2.      Due to the scope of the sector-wide program, it was difficult to attribute the net
benefits of the program to anyone donor's investment. During implementation, some of the
investments covered sector needs beyond the original scope set for the five-year plan in the 79
municipalities in the 12 targeted SILAIS. Additionally, other sector investments not channeled
through FONSALUD also reached the target areas and therefore the impact of single donor-
supported intervention was difficult to capture. The consequence was a disassociation between
overall investment costs financed by MOH, through FONSALUD, IDA the IDB, and other
donors and the benefits foreseen under the original scope of the SWAp scheme. For this reason,
it was not possible to replicate the methodology used in the PAD to assess net benefits.

3.      This cost-benefit analysis of the Second phase of the APL is based on several key
assumptions. First, the population covered by the 79 municipalities supported by the Project is
estimated to be about 2 million. The project extended coverage, by the end of 2009, and reached
about 530,000 beneficiaries. Using a discount rate of ten percent, this assessment takes into the
benefits detailed under the original Project Appraisal Document. However, unlike annex 9 of the
original analysis, the benefits deriving from a reduction in patient-days were not taken into
consideration, since no significant gains were observed during project implementation. Key
benefits were estimated as detailed in the paragraphs below.

4.      There was a significant reduction of maternal and infant deaths and chronic
malnutrition. The Project's implementation of prevention and promotion activities during the
pre- and postnatal stages of pregnancy aimed at reducing the number of maternal and infant
deaths. For the purpose of this analysis, it has been assumed that saved lives would produce
economic benefits that can be roughly quantified assuming the individual's future participation
in the labor force. It was conservatively assumed that child mortality (under five years of age)
would continue to be reduced from a level of 35 per thousand live births in 2009 to 28 by 2019.
Similarly, maternal mortality would be further reduced from the present level of 110 per one
hundred thousand live births to 95 by 2019. It was assumed that chronic malnutrition would be
further reduced from the current level of 13 percent to 10 percent by 2019. It was further
assumed that income per capita of an individual in the rural area would remain relatively the



                                               28
same over the evaluation period. Benefits were estimated based on future income flows received
by persons whose lives were saved as they become part of the economic active population and on
the increased income-earning capacity of persons whose nutrition status is improved.

5.      Other benefits accrue from cost gains and private savings resulting from improved
practices. These were estimated based on: (i) the creation of regional mobile maintenance
centers that reduce expenditures in new medical and nonmedical equipment and (ii) the increase
achieved in prevention and promotion health care services imply a reduction in the demand for
medicines and medical supplies and a change in the type of medicines purchased, and (iii)
beneficiaries' savings since now they are purchasing less rounds of expensive antibiotics and
more generic medicines. These savings were estimated at US$1.9 million yearly during the next
five years, representing about 0.8 percent ofMOH annual budget.

6.     The decentralization of management resulted in savings in the MOH budget. This
process resulted in· improved monitoring of performance and supervision of health care services
by the SILAIS. A recent study commissioned under the Project, estimated that savings from
implementation of decentralized management and administration of health care services were
equivalent to nearly 1 percent ofMoH's current budget.

7.      Project costs and benefits associated with the APL II Project resulted in a marginal
rate of return. Although the costs stream can be easily identified from investment costs and
future operating costs, benefits are considerably harder to link with investments financed under
IDA's project. Overall benefits were estimated based on the assumptions mentioned above. But
only a portion of these benefits are associated with direct investments financed under the Project
that, conservatively, can be estimated in the 30 to 40 percent range. When benefits are in the
lower end of the range, the rate ofretum becomes slightly negative, while in the.upper end of the
range the rate of return can be estimated at 6 percent. The following table summarizes total
estimated benefits and costs.

8.     Fiscal impact of the Project is marginal to the recurrent costs of the health sector.
For fiscal year' 2011, the public health budget for the MoH is currently estimated at about


                                               29
US$252 million of which about 59 percent are recurrent expenditures, It should be noted that the
bulk of the investment budget is fmanced with support from multilateral agencies and bilateral
donors. Overall, it represents about 3.4 percent of GDP and 11.5 percent of GON budget.
Assuming that the MoH's budget and spending remain roughly the same relative to GDP over
the few, years, the Government could easily absorb not only recurrent costs associated with the
Project but with the larger program supported by the medium-term three-year program.

9.       Overall, the Consolidated Public Sector deficit is estimated to have increased from
1.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 3.9 percent in 2009 (well below the program target of 4.6
percent of GDP). The authorities are currently planning to start reducing the fiscal deficit. To
this end, they have recently adopted the following measures: (i) a revenue-enhancing tax reform;
(ii) an austere budget (that keeps nominal spending unchanged relative to budgeted 2009 levels);
and (iii) a one percentage-point increase in the pension contribution rate. These measures are not
expected to affect MOH's recurrent budget, although some reduction.in the investment level can
be expected, because some donors have announced a decrease in their contributions for the next
few years.

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      Two beneficiary surveys were carried out in ZOO9 and 2010 aiming .at obtaining
informatIoo about the perception that beneficiaries have about the quality of services
provided in health centers. Beneficiaries were women seeking service attention for themselves
or their chilw-en less than 5 years. The specific objective was to evaluate access to health
services and users satisfaction. A sample of 549 beneficiaries was selected for interviews that
took place as they were exiting a health service facility. Nearly 80 percent of beneficiaries
interviewed were women living in rural areas. Main fmdings are summarized below.

2.     Over 50 percent of beneficiaries walked to health centers and about 80% said that
they had obtained service. However, nearly all participants highlighted that waiting times were
too long, which may be due to an increased demand for services combined with lack of
availability of doctors and nurses in certah;l areas.

3.      About 77 percent of beneficiaries had a positivepereeption that the time used by
staffto provide services was adequate. This assessment was fairly constant in both surveys.
Health advice provided, laboratory tests carried out in health facilities and medicines delivered to
patients were other quality factors that also. had' a favorable perception by users. Over 90% of
persons who were prescribed medicines reported that these were supplied to them on a timely.,
manner and 75 percent of these patients received proper instructions from pharmacists....
Cleanliness of health facilities was also mentioned as an aspect that needed considerable
improvement.

4.      In summary, cleanliness of facilities and waiting times were singled out as the most
importaqt issues that needed improvement. Over 50' percent of beneficiaries interviewed
concurred on this matter. Availability of me<ijcines and staff attitude and manners were other
issues raised by an important number of beneficiaries. MOH has acknowledged that these issues
deserve special attention to improve quality of services provided by health facilities.
