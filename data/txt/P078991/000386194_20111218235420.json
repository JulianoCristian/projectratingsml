MODERNIZATION PROJECT (SECOND PHASE OF AN", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Phase Health\n            Services Extension and Modernization Project for Nicaragua\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            importance of surveillance and monitoring and evaluation\n            should not be underestimated. Given the challenges\n            associated with availability of data to monitor Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators and intermediate\n            outcome indicators, the project could have had a stronger\n            focus, including dedicated financial resources, to\n            strengthen surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. The use\n            of national outcome indicators as PDO indicators was\n            problematic given that the project had a targeted approach.\n            While the use of common national targets for all donors was\n            helpful in terms of donor coordination and harmonization, it\n            was not appropriate to measure the success of this project\n            which featured interventions in targeted areas.\n            Notwithstanding the issues in monitoring and evaluation, the\n            project also demonstrated that the expansion of maternal\n            homes (Casas Maternas) made a critical contribution to\n            improving institutional deliveries. More generally, the\n            project demonstrated that a primary health care model based\n            on a basic package of services works in Nicaragua.\n            Performance agreements became a very useful tool to\n            establish a results-oriented culture. This was a powerful\n            tool that had a positive impact for managing decentralized\n            health programs. The project also proved that it is possible\n            to move from a situation of many models and sources of\n            financing to a coordinated sector approach. One final\n            lesson, however, is that pooling funds is very difficult.\n            The necessary conditions to allow for pooling of funds are\n            challenging, and in hindsight it may have been overly\n            optimistic given the country's capacity constraints and\n            fiduciary systems to expect that this could have been\n            possible from the start."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
