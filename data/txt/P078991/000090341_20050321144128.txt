Project development objective Re$ PAD B.2, TechnicalAnnex 3
The overall APL program development objective, as approved by the IDA Boardin 1998, is to
improve health outcomes inNicaragua, particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency,
effectiveness, equity and sustainability o f the Nicaraguanhealth system. Inthis second phase o f
the APL, IDA financing will contribute, alongside funds from the M O H and other SWAP
partners, to improve maternal and child health inthe poorest municipalities o fNicaragua,
concentrating roughly half of the Nicaragua's poor. By improving the health status o f this
population, health inequities should reduce, as shown by disparities inmaternal and infant
mortality indicators across geographical areas and income groups. These goals will be achieved
through the operationalization o f three strategic objectives, as set up inthe sector Five-Year
ImplementationPlan, namely: (i)     the extension o f coverage o f a package o f basic health and
nutritionservices to the poorest areas ofthe country, via the new integrated model ofhealth care;
(ii) physicalandfunctionalstrengtheningofthehealthservicefacilitiesnetwork,focusingon
     the
maternal-infant care, so as to provide a seamless path of essential services inthe target areas; and
(iii) institutional strengtheningand capacity-building, concentrated specifically on developing
the purchasing, monitoring and evaluation capacities o fthe MOH, its leadership role to
enhancing donors? alignment and harmonization, and the management capacity of M O H
decentralized units and Autonomous Governments o f the Atlantic Coast.

Project description [one-sentence summary of each component] Re$ PAD B.3.a, Technical
Annex 4
Strategic Objective 1: Extension o f health care coverage to the poorest population (US$36.5
million. Extension o f the Basic Package of Health Services to vulnerable rural populations at the
community-level.

  Strategic Objective 2: Strengtheningthe network o f services intargeted areas to support the
implementation o f the BPHS (US$27,8 million). This component of the SWAPi s designedto
support the extension o f coverage, andto complement its MCH-related activities. It includes
physical rehabilitation o f health centers and hospitals, expansion o f the Women Center Network

and strengthening management o f public providers.

  Strategic Objective 3: Improving Stewardship, Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization
(US$17,8 million). The M O Hrecognizes that to fulfilthe vision set forthintheNHP and
effectively leadthe SWAp, it will need to undertake a variety o f institutional reforms. These
include: (i)strengthening the Ministry?smanagement capacity necessary for planning,
contracting and supervising the expansion o f the BPHS (e.g., programming and planning,
information and reporting) and the rest o f institutional fiduciary systems (financial accounting,
procurement, auditing) so the SWAP can progressively adopt these national systems instead o f
donors? procedures; (ii)  strengthening the GON?s capacity to monitor and evaluate health sector
performance, efficiency and equity; (iii) supporting the MOH?s coordination role as executor
and overseer o f the GON?s population policy; and (iv) developing a strong purchasing function
at the MOH, including the identification o f beneficiaries for the expansion o f essential services,
adjusting payment mechanisms, overseeing service quality, contract design and monitoring.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

Nicaragua's health profile reflects the country's highprevalence of poverty-in              particular, its
highrate of absolute poverty. Despiteprogress inreducingpoverty over the past decade, with a
per capita income of US$710 Nicaraguaremains one of the poorest countries in Latin America.
Although from 1993 to 2001, poverty declined from 50 to 46 percent, and extreme poverty fell
from 19 to 15 percent, the gains were characterized by significant geographic differences. In
2002, 44 percent o f the population still lived in rural areas where the prevalence of extreme
poverty was 25 percent, more than four times the rate of urban areas. On average, poorer
households have higher fertility rates and larger families, as well as higher maternal, infant and
child mortality. Inaddition, tuberculosis, which remains a persistent public health problem, has
become largely a disease of the poor.

Nicaragua has made considerable progress in improving the health status of its people over the
last decade. Life expectancy has reached 69 years, and since 1990, infant and child maternal
mortality rates have fallen by 29 and 32 percent, respectively.2 A recent study of 165 countries
that predicted life expectancy and infant mortality based on gross domestic product (GDP),
found that health status of Nicaraguans exceeds what one would anticipate, given the country's
per capita income. While Central America as a whole didbetter than predicted on both o f these
two key health indicators, among the Central American republics, Nicaragua had the largest
positive deviations between its actual and predicted life expectancy and inthe case of infant
mortality was second only to Costa Rica.

These recent advances hide, nevertheless, the fact that the poor have benefited much less than the
wealthiest, as the table inAnnex 1shows. Notwithstanding its relatively good recent record of
improving health, Nicaragua continues to confront many of its traditional health challenges. The
disease profile o f Nicaraguai s one of a country inthe early phases of the epidemiological
transition. Infectious diseases remain major health concerns, and perinatal illnesses together with
the illnesses of early childhood-malnutrition,                 acute respiratory diseases and diarrhea in
particular-continue      to dominate the public health agenda. Moreover, unless current trends are
accelerated, it i s unlikely that Nicaragua will achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals
(MDG)of reducingmaternal mortality and the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. Maternaland
child health care, therefore, remain at the top of Nicaragua's human development agenda. In
addition, the overall fertility rate-one          o f the highest inL A C at 3.2-is        a particularly pressing
social problem, and the adolescent pregnancy rate i s second to none in the r e g i ~ n . ~

With respect to healthfinancing, the level, stability and composition of M O Hfinancing are
causes of concern. From 1999 to 2003, Ministry of Health (MOH) expenditures constituted 14
percent o f total national budget expenditures (i.e., national funds plus external financing). While
the,leveland sources of M O H financing were erratic over this period, inreal, absolute terms, its
2002-2003 total financing was 8 percent less than its 1999-2000 total.

The M O H i s heavily dependent upon external financing (both grants and loans). From 1999 to
2003, external financing grew inreal terms from US$22.9 million to US$30.8 million. Although
the level of external financing has fluctuated annually, it has generally grown -from                     18 percent
of total M O H expenditures 1999 to 24 percent in 2003-                      at the same time that the level of real
financing provided by national funds has fallen (by an annual average of 7 percent since 1999).
Ineffect, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) has substitutedexternal funds for national funds
to finance M O H expenditures. The composition of M O H resources i s also a cause of concern as
the allocation of public expenditures by department i s generally inversely related to the severity
and level of poverty (SANIGEST 2004: 90). A critical challenge for Nicaragua and the
international community i s to modify existing patterns of public health expenditures so that they
no longer reinforce, but instead help to address Nicaragua's unequal health and poverty profiles.

Although the coverage of the health program of the NicaraguanSocial Security Institute (INSS)
has expanded by one-third over the past five years, it still provides coverage for only 9 percent of
the population, the lowest proportion of any Central American country. Moreover, 70 percent of
its beneficiaries are from the wealthiest 40 percent of the population. With private health
insurance covering a mere 1percent of Nicaraguans, the poor are forced to rely overwhelmingly

on a combination of Ministry of Health services and self-treatment. Out-of-pocket purchases of
medicines have grown steadily inrecent years and now constitute 49 percent of all health
expenditures.

Insummary, highfertility rates, childmalnutrition, poor health anda low level of financial
protection against illness still prevail for significant groups o f the population. Moreover, these
same factors are important determinants of poverty and together they constitute apoverty trap
from which today's and tomorrow's Nicaraguanpoor will find it difficult to escape. .With
existing patterns of public expenditure mirroring these inequalities, a critical challenge for public
policy will be to reverse these inequities as a principal tool for combating poverty and fostering
human development.

The GON i s well aware of many of the shortcomings of the health sector, and over the course of
the last five years has accelerated the pace of reform. A few years ago it passed the General
Health Law (20021 and the Law's companion piece, the Regulation Decree'(2003), both             .
important steps in the modernization and institutional capacity-building of the MOH. These legal
instruments set up: (i) the organization of a national health system based on two financial
regimes, contributory and non-contributory, their respective benefit plans, institutional
responsibilities and financing mechanisms; (ii)     the principle o f separation o f functions,
reinforcing the M O H stewardship role and the instrumentsto do so (i.e., national health plan,
quality assurance mechanisms and sector planning mechanisms), (iii)        a decentralized model of
governance and management; (iv) the basis for devolution of power to the Autonomous
Governments of the Atlantic Coast; and (iv) the consideration of the special needs andconditions
of the indigenous and afro-descendant population. The Ministry i s now implementing these
reforms and developing its institutional capacity to address the sector challenges, with the
financial support of an IDB loan and the IDA'SAdjustable Programmatic Loan (APL) first-phase
credit (NI-3084).

The other key health care organization in the country, the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute
(INSS), has also made notable advances since 2000. In2002, it separated financing from the
management of its health and pension regimes. Between 2000 and 2004, it expanded the number
of beneficiaries of its health program by 32 percent, and introduced a new Elderly Health
Program (EHP) for its retired affiliates. The INSS, which buys all medical services for its
affiliates from private providers (EMPs), has also devised and implemented a provider
certification system, and has reviewed and formalized the methodology for fixing the capitation
payment paid to the EMPs, with active participation from the EMPs and their trade association.

Looking ahead, the G O N has agreed with a group of significant donors, including IDA, to
increase their effort to coordinate and harmonize official development aid by sponsoring a series
of Sector Wide Approaches (SWAp) in a number o f sectors, including health. Nicaragua has
done a substantial amount of work in health policy reform that serves as a strong foundation for
the proposed SWAp: in October 2004, the GON (Government o f Nicaragua) released an
Operational National Development Plan to update the 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP); in mid-2004 the M O H released the ten-year National Health Policies and its
accompanying 2004-2015 National Health Plan (NHP), outlining how it plans to achieve the
health goals set out in its PRSP; inNovember 2004 the MOHreleased a draft Five-Year



                                                     9

Implementation Plan (FYIP) detailing how it would operationalize the aforementioned NHP.The
fundamental goal set up by the FYIP i s increased access of the poor people of Nicaraguato
effective maternal and child healthcare. This would be achieved by expanding access to a
package of basic health services (PBHS) in the most deprived and rural municipalities of the
country through a combination of performance-based incentives to public providers and
purchasing of services from private providers. InDecember 2004, the M O H convoked an
extraordinary session of the Local Health Care System (SILAIS) and local area health networks
(municipios)to present to them the NHP and national priorities for the FYIP, and to assist each
of them in establishing their own annual operating goals for each year inthe FYIP, and thereby
produce a detailed, bottom-up plan for programming and budgetingthe FYIP.

These national plans have also receivedthe backing of the international financial community. All
of the cooperating partners inthe SWAP have agreed that the FYIPwill serve as the operational
framework for the SWAp, thereby ensuring that the SWAP will be a single unifiedpolicy that
'will be fully aligned with government policy. By its beirlgbased on the product of the still
nascent local annual programming system, it i s hopedthat the SWAPwill help to nurture the
further development of local level planning andprogramming capability, and thereby help to
institutionalize this new approach and with it, the effective decentralization of the MOH.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The primaryrationale of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s to support the GON's
development goals as outlined inthe PRSP. The Adaptable Program Credit (APL) for the health
sector modernizationproject, approved by the Board in 1998,supports three of the four 2001
PRSP pillars: (i)  greater and better investment in the human capital of the poor, (ii)    better
protection for vulnerable populations, and (iii)         good governance. The most significant IDA
support to Nicaragua consists of the poverty reduction support credits (PSAC and PRSCs). These
credits contain health conditionalities that are fully aligned with the PRSP. This proposed new
SWAPwould buildupon the work accomplished under the first phase of the adjustable
programmatic loan (APL), concluded inDecember 2004, and would contribute directly and
synergistically to the goals established inthe PRSP with the PRSCs.

The Bank's involvement in the SWAPbuilds upon its previous work inNicaragua by broadening
the policy dialogue on poverty reduction and promoting further reforms in the modernization of
the Nicaraguan health sector. Since September 2003, the Bank has been working closely with
M O H to develop the NHP and the FYIP. The first phase o f the Bank's APL health sector credit
achieved its development objectives satisfactorily. The MOH-with            the support of the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through the health modernization
project-has    developed sound institutional tools and regulations to improve the Ministry's
regulatory and management roles, as described in the previous section. Extensive evaluations of
most of the first phase interventions supported by the APL, together with cross-evaluations with
other donors' programs and past national health policies, have been carried out over the past two
years. The results of these evaluations have been used to inform new sector policies and have
assistedthe M O H in makingstrategic decisions about how best to harmonize donor contributions
and design the    SWAP.^ The    vast majority o f the SWAp's planned activities consists of efforts to

scale-up activities that were pilot-tested, evaluated, deemed successful, and (generally with some
modifications) worthy of replication and expansion.

While health modernization efforts, have made significant advances, much work still needs to be
done to improve the health status of the population and the country's health system. Inequity
persists and the health reform and decentralization agenda is not yet completed. Inaddition,
there i s a dire need to improve accountability, transparency and governance throughout the
sector.

The Bank's expertise in SWAps, as well as its extensive experience with designing effective pro-
poor health strategies, complements the contribution of the other stakeholders in the SWAp.
Moreover, the Bank has accrued important experience inthe Nicaragua's health sector working
closely with other donors and financiers. The Bank has played a pivotal role encouraging the
M O H to develop a more cohesive sector policy and institutional structure, thereby promoting the
Ministry's institutional effectiveness and enhancing its leadership role in coordinating donors'
aid. The Bank i s also part of the Budget Support Group (BSG) inNicaragua. The BSGand all of
the bilateral donors financing the health SWAp, have agreed to a harmonized set of policy
actions and results (including health) that will serve as key inputs to the SWAp.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

The Government of Nicaragua's 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which i s the
basis of the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nicaragua, emphasizes the
need to improve public sector management and the coordination of foreign aid. The health
SWAP supports three of the PRSP's four pillars by targeting vulnerable populations, focusing on
institutional strengthening and capacity-building and encouraging greater and better human
capital investment in the poor. Inparticular, the SWAPwill primarily seek to improve the
maternal and child health of a significant proportion of the Nicaraguan poor and, thereby, help to
reduce the rural-urban health inequities. More easily accessible and more affordable access to
health, nutrition and family planning counseling and services will, in turn, contribute to reducing
child malnutrition, protecting household income and facilitate women's empowerment. The
SWAPwill also improve the Nicaragua health sector effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability
by improving the MOH's stewardship role, fostering alliances with private (NGOs and others)
and official institutions (TNSS), broadening the capacity of decentralized units to manage
resources and evaluate performance, and improve the targeted use o f external assistance, while
reducing the administrative burden that has historically been associated with it. Each of these
highlevel development objectives are fully aligned with the NHPand its FYIP, as well as IDA'S
APL program development objectives.

APL program: In 1998 the Bank approved a ten-year Health Modernization Program (APL)
consisting of two phases, the first one for an amount o f US$32 million to be implemented
between 1999 and 2003. This first project was co-financed (joint-financing) by the Norwegian

Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD). for an amount of US$3 million equivalent,
and The Nordic Development Fund (NDF),for an amount equivalent to US$3.5 million of
parallel co-financing. The program seeks to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of
the Nicaraguahealth system. The first phase was completed on December 31St,2004 and the
second phase i s expected to commence in the second half of 2005.

The first phase focused on: (i) extension of primary health care (PHC) by strengthening the
                                 the
physical condition and management o f public PHC providers. implementing a community
nutrition and growth program, developing a network of Women's Centers (CasusMuternus) and
piloting the contracting of PHC from NGOs; (ii)   hospital reform, including physical
rehabilitation and equipment and management demonstration projects; (iii)    modernization of
specific MOH capabilities-most      notably reforming the sector regulatory and organizational
framework, strategic planning. financial management, information systems, human resources,
Information, Education and Communication, and procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies; (iv) modernization of the Social Security Institute and 'expansion of health insurance.

The second phase of the APL will continue the same program's objectives, although its
implementation will further focus on the achievement o f maternal and child health results. It will
scale up the first project's activities for expansion of services, learn from lessons accrued and
benefit tremendously from the institutional ownership and capacity gained duringthe first phase.
However, the Bank, together with the rest o f the development community inNicaragua, has
made a commitment to the GON that it will foster broader coordination of foreign aid. To that
end, the Bank has worked with GON and the many donors inthe health sector to develop a
Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp), both to ensure coordination among the many donors in the
health sector and to reduce the transaction costs of managing external assistance for the GON.
The APL second phase will be an integralpart of the SWAp.




                                                                    13

 The massive amount of foreign aid Nicaragua received after natural disasters (inparticular,

 adequate coordination of these projects has bred inefficiencies in the health sector while foisting
 excessive demands on the M O H for project supervision and monitoring. The desire to reduce the
 administrative burdenof external assistance has been a major factor motivating the MOH's
 efforts to promote a health SWAp. The timing of the SWAP i s particularly propitious given that
 IDA, IDB,Finlandand Sweden (two major bilateral donors inthe health sector inNicaragua) are
 all in similar phases of the traditional project cycle and need to define their activities inthe
 health sector for the next four to five years. This constellation of circumstances provides a
 compelling need for, and a unique opportunity to develop, a health SWAPunder the leadership
 of the MOH.

 IDA will contribute US$11 million to the health SWAP though this proposed secondphaseAPL.
 This amount has been reduced from the US$15 million allocated inthe NicaraguaCAS for this
 project, due to current restrictions of IDA-13 funds.                       '


 2. Project development objective and key indicators

 As approved by the IDA Boardin 1998, the overall APL program development objective is to
 improve health outcomes inNicaragua, particularly among the poor, by raising the efficiency,
 effectiveness, equity and sustainability of the Nicaraguan health system. Inthis second phase of
 the APL, IDA financing will contribute, along with funds from the M O H and other SWAP
 partners, to improving maternal and child health inthe poorest municipalities of Nicaragua,
 where roughly half of Nicaragua's poor reside. Improving the health status of this population,
 should reduce health inequities, inparticular, the disparities in maternal and infant mortality
 indicators across geographical areas and income groups. These goals will be achieved through
 the operationalization of three strategic objectives, as set forth in the sector Five-Year
 Implementation Plan, namely: (i) extension of coverage of a package o f basic health services
                                              the
 to the poorest areas of the country, via the new integrated model of health care; (ii)               the physical
 and functional strengthening of the health service facilities network, focusing on maternal-infant
 care, so as to provide a seamless path of essential services in the target areas; and (iii)
 institutional strengthening and capacity-building, concentrated specifically on developing the
 purchasing, monitoring and evaluation capacities of the MOH, its leadership role to enhance
 donors' alignment and harmonization, and the management capacity of M O H decentralized units
 and Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast.

 A common set of results indicators accompanies the FYIP and will be closely monitoredby the
 MOHand the SWAP partners. These indicators, along with its corresponding targets, are fully
 described inAnnex 3 and include the following:

 3. Project components

 The Five-Year Implementation Plan (2005-2009) provides the strategic framework for all SWAP
 partnkrs to join efforts to achieve the stated results. While the'FYIP has a national scope and
 incorporates all M O H activities, it has been agreed with the M O H that the FYIP, and its
 consecutive annual action plans, will clearly identify a subprogram of activities aimed
 specifically at achieving the targets and strategic initiatives set out hereafter. The two first
 strategic objectives within this program are targeted to the 79 municipalities with the greatest
 health needs. If new funds become available or new donor partners join the SWAp, this list of
 municipalities andor the identified priority activities may be increased accordingly. The FYIP
 sets up the strategic actions to achieve the following three strategic objectives:

 Strategic Obiective 1: Extension of health care coverage to the poorest population (US$36.5
 million)

 Extension of the Basic Package of Health Services to vulnerable rural populations at the
 community-level

 A package of basic health care services (PBHS), focusing on maternal and child health, will be
 offered to the most deprived population of Nicaragua. Vulnerable populations and localities for
 the extension of coverage have been identified based on the following criteria: current access to
 health services, level of poverty, and health status. A multiple-tiered targeting process has been
 used. First, the 12 most vulnerable departments have been identified, usingthe targeting criteria
 explained inAnnex 4. Second, 79 municipalities within the 12 most vulnerable departments have
 been selected usingthe same criteria. Intotal, these localities account for 47 percent of the
 poorest Nicaraguans. Third, within these 79 municipalities, the rural and indigenous
 communities (comarucas) will be prioritized. The content o f the PBHS further focuses this
 interventionby targeting specific diseases and health problems, maternal and child health along
 with a few other adult-prevalent diseases that have their greatest impact on the poor. I t i s
 estimated that the PBHS will be extended over the next five years to 470,000 inhabitants living
 inthe most deprived municipalities of the North andAtlantic Coast of Nicaragua.

 The expansion of the PBHS will be based on the implementation o f a new integrated health care
 model (MAIS), developed by the MOH to integrate the multiple, diverse models of health care
 delivery and management that have been implemented over the past years. The M A I S has



                                                                 15

already been drafted b y the M O H and includes all the necessary technical instruments to
implement this strategy. It establishes the delivery model (including consideration of different
delivery modalities according to social and geographical characteristics of the population to
cover), the benefits plan, targeting mechanism, contracting and payment instruments, social
participation strategies and supervision and monitoring arrangements). Itinerant health service
delivery teams will be organized for reaching the poor living inthe most remote areas of the
country. The PBHS will be tailored, incontent and delivery modalities, to the special conditions
of the indigenous and afro-descendant population. These accommodations are currently being
worked out between the M O H and the Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast, where
most o f these groups live.

The delivery of the PBHS will be achieved through a capitation transfer to SILAIS which, in
turn, will purchase services from public, local providers (municipios)and/or qualified, private
providers (mainly NGOs). These capitation transfers constitute a community health financing
scheme. The community health financing scheme will provide uni'versal coverage within targeted
communities of the 79 prioritized municipios. The community health financing scheme will
entitle all persons residing inthe targeted communities (comarcas) to the services included inthe
PBHS. The amount to be transferred to each SILAIS will be determinedby an adjusted
capitation payment. The total value of funds transferred to each SILAIS will be calculated as the
product of the population of the community and a region-specific, average per capita cost of the
PBHS (i.e., the number o f residents inthe community will be multipliedby the region-specific,
average per capita cost). The transfers to the SILAIS will be made monthly and prospectively.
The beneficiary population will be estimated prospectively. The initial population estimates of
the targeted communities will be based on the official 2005 national census that i s currently
being conducted b y the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC). Each year, the
capitation transfers made to the SILAIS on behalf of the targeted communities will be adjusted to
take into account changes inpopulation. These adjustments will be based on the annual,
community-specific, population estimates that INEC routinely prepares duringinter-censal years,
and that constitute the official GON population estimates Additionally, there will be a review,
and (if deemed appropriate) an adjustment of the regionally differentiated capitation rates.

The M O H will enter into management agreements with the SILAIS (Convenios de Gestidn).
These Convenios will be the basis for the capitation transfers o f the community health financing
scheme to the SILAIS. The capitation transfers will finance the delivery of services (mainly
maternal and child care) included in the PBHS, including outreach strategies, necessary
transportation, essential drugs, nutrition advice, IEC activities, reproductive and sexual health
services and limited essential health services for adults. The actual delivery of services and the
expected outcomes of such services will be monitored and verified through a two-pronged
strategy:

-   social audit mechanisms will be devised, by which: (1) the community will certify that the
    local providers render the services included inthe PBHS, and (2) periodic community
    surveys will be carried out to investigate the quality and timeliness of services and members
    of community's general level of satisfaction with the arrangement.
-   Intermediate results linked to the delivery of the PBHS will be closely monitored by the
    SILAIS and the MOH. These intermediate results, as described inthe results framework



                                                  16

      (Annex 3), are: institutional deliveries, child immunization, early prenatal care, full prenatal
      care and discharges from Women Centers. The achievement and verification of these results
      will also be subject to an independent assessment, as agreed in the MOU.

Inthe event that any beneficiary isjudged (by the MOH) to have beendeniedcare for services
included in the PBHS, the M O H will deduct the capitation payment made for that patient and
apply penalties as described in the Operational Manual.

Strengthening planning, accountability and social participationfor the delivery of the PBHS

The SWAp's resources will fund technical assistance necessary to develop institutional capacity
at the SILAIS and local provider levels (municipios)for implementing the expansion of the
PBHS. While local providers will progressively take up broader management responsibilitiesfor
the delivery of services and management of resources, SILAIS will develop a supporting role to
the MOHcentral purchasing unit, helping out in the planning, formulation, m6nitoring and
supervision of annual health plans, service contracts with private providers and performance
agreements with public local providers. This capacity buildingsupport activities will entail
capacity assessment, training, development and implementation of contractual, management and
clinical instruments, and information technology necessary to effectively plan for the expansion
of services, improve and control quality, manage resources at local level, and monitor results.

Both public and private health care providers will work closely with the communities, jointly
identifying the community's health needs, and programming community and health sector
actions to address their health problems. This work will constitute the MOH-community
interface portion of the Ministry's ongoing decentralization efforts. To date, MOH's
decentralization has been exclusively an intra-institutional process. A key element of the process
has been the recent development of local M O H networks' (municipios) annual programming and
budgeting exercise, whereby they develop annual operating plans, which then aggregate up to the
SILAIS level to become the heart o f the SILAIS annual plan. The SWAP will help taking this
process to the next step, and will incorporateprivate sector itinerant health teams and local health
counciles (as well as the MOH's hospitals) into the planning, monitoring and
evaluatiodfeedback cycle. The civil society will play an active role on auditing the actual
delivery and quality of services to the community. A community committee will advise and
ultimately endorse the provider annual working plan and periodically (e.g., quarterly) provide
monitoring feedback to the provider and the supervisory SILAIS.

Strategic Obiective 2: Strengthening the network o f services in targeted areas to support the
implementationof the PBHS (US$27.8 million)

This component of the SWAP is designed to supportthe extension of coverage, and to
complement its MCH-related activities. Activities in this area are aimed at creating an effectively
structured and functioning referral system that will provide a more complete continuum of M C H
care to rural communities, while increasing their access to secondary care and improving the
overall quality of health care.6 Bringingsuch a system to fruition will require improving three

 I t is expected that the extension of primary care through the PBHS will increase the demand for and referrals to
secondary care.


                                                          17

different types of facilities that comprise the M C H delivery system located in the same
geographical areas selected for the expansion of essential services:

 WomenHomes (CasusMaternas)

CasusMaternas (CMs) are low cost, assisted-living arrangements that usually have around 10
beds and are located next to a hospital. The physical facilities are usually contributed by the
community. Communities get also involved inco-financing and managing these homes. The
CMs are designed to lodge pregnant women living in remote villages inthe last few days of their
pregnancy, to ensure that the women have ready access to an institutional facility when labor
work starts. Women usually stay in these facilities for a few days after delivering. Services
provided inthese Casus also expand to provide family planning and child nutrition counseling,
as well as other education activities for empowering women. Selected communities will be
trained and supported to manage and maintain their CMs. It i s envisaged that 30 additional units
will be added to the existing network of CMs. Fundingwillbe provided for the rehabilitation of
existing premises or (on an exceptional basis) the construction of new homes, the acquisition of
basic equipment and furnishings for the homes, time bound (and declining) recurrent costs,
activities aimed at empowering women staying in the homes, and the promotion of family
planning.

Primary Health Care Centers

This part of the program is aimed at improving the infrastructure and renovating existing primary
health care centers in the targeted geographical areas and ensuring they are sufficiently equipped.
The centers will also be stocked with the medical supplies required b y the basic package of
health and nutrition services (PBHS). A needs assessment of physical rehabilitation and
equipment of health centers inthe targeted areas will be prepared as part of the pre-investment
phase of the SWAp.

Hospitals

The 12district hospitals inthe areas targeted for extension of coverage will be rehabilitated and
equipped with medical and industrial equipment necessary to improve the quality and safety of
the maternal and child care critical path. Specifically, investments will revamp emergency
rooms, operating rooms, obstetric and pediatric wards and related ambulatory facilities, as well
as support clinical services (image and lab departments). Other essential general hospital
facilities, including laundry, steam and water, catering and waste management, will also be
improved. It i s expected that although the investment will prioritize the maternal and child care
critical path, it will also have a positive spill over impact on hospital services rendered to other
patients by upgrading these general and support hospital facilities.

Investments inphysical infrastructure (remodeling only) and equipment will be accompanied by
investments to improve the management of those facilities. The SWAP will buildupon the
experiences of the health modernization project (APL first phase) and will extend and replicate
the support given to the first phase pilot hospitals inorder to improve the management capacity
and systems inthe 12targeted hospitals. The management support strategy includes direct



                                                    18

technical support to the hospital directors by itinerant management support teams, under the
supervision of the M O H central Hospital Directorate, training, information technology and
implementation o f institutional management systems (i.e., M O H information, procurement and
financial management systems). Special support will be given to the preparation and
implementation of hospital waste management plans, complying with applicable national
standards and policies acceptable to IDA, control of hospital infectious diseases and
implementation of quality improvement strategies.

Strategic Obiective 3: Improving Stewardship, Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization
(US$17.8 million)

The M O H recognizes that to fulfill the vision set forth in the NHP and effectively lead the
SWAp, it will need to undertake a variety o f institutional reforms. These include: (i)
strengthening the Ministry's management capacity necessary for planning, contracting and
super`vising the expansion of the PBHS (e.g., programming arld planning, information and
reporting) and the rest of institutional fiduciary systems (financial accounting, procurement,
auditing) so the SWAP can progressively adopt these national systems instead of donors'
procedures; (ii)  strengthening the GON's capacity to monitor andevaluate health sector
performance, efficiency and equity; (iii)        supporting the MOH's coordination role as executor and
overseer of the GON's population policy; and (iv) developing a strong purchasing function at the
MOH, including the identification of beneficiaries for the expansion of essential services,
adjusting payment mechanisms, overseeing service quality, contract design and monitoring.

The FYIPalso includes under this objective activities to advance the decentralization policy
established by the National Health Policies. Inparticular, the SWAPwill support
decentralization by: (i)  providing advocacy and technical assistance to municipal government to
undertakepublic healthresponsibilities7; (ii)         supporting the devolution of responsibilities to the
two Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast over the organization and management of
their regional health systems; (iii)    offering technical support to MOHdepartment offices
(SILAIS) to carry out their annual planning and contracting functions; (iii)             decentralizing
management of the M O H human resources function to the SILAIS and hospitals. The over-riding
goal will be to improve the performance of MOH-increasing                 its effectiveness, efficiency and
the degree of equity in access to and expenditures on health care-by                 improving incentives and
accountability.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design

The FYIP supported b y the SWAP scales up the successful programs piloted under the APL first
phase, based on feedback obtained from evaluations of its components. This is particularly
evident in three elements of the strategy. First, the development o f a unified, institutionally
endorsed delivery and management model for primary health care was prompted by the existence
of at least 14different donor-sponsored primary health care programs. The Integrated Healthcare


  A recently passedLaw by the National Assembly requires the central Government to transfer an increasing
proportion of the GON's budget to municipal governments. It is expected that municipal governments will take up
some public health responsibilities nowadays delivered by the MOH. But this assumption of functions requires
raising awarenessand capacity in these institutions to execute those responsibilities.


                                                         19

Model (MAIS) developed by the M O H integrates already piloted successful programs, like the
community nutrition and growth program (PROCOSAN), sexual and reproductive health
services programs and the contracting out of essential services from NGOs for remote
communities. The MAIS has been designed after the results of an evaluation of the mentioned 14
PHC projects and an evaluation of the health modernizationproject's components.

Second, in view of the fact that evaluations of the Casus Muternus show that these facilities have
made a substantial contribution to reducing maternal mortality and improving other reproductive
health indicators', the FYIP seeks to expand the existing network of CMs. Based on findings
from evaluation reports, collaboration between the CMs and local community service
organizations and the integration of the C M network with the formal health care system, which
were found to be successful elements of the strategy, will be pursued.

Third, lessons from the operation of the Safe Maternity and Infancy Fund(FONMAT) highlight
the positive results of usingperformance-based payments to public' providers to increase the
production o f services. Experience inexpanding services inNicaragua, and elsewhere, show that
supply and demand interventions are equally and simultaneously needed. The Nicaragua SWAP
will apply specific incentivesto public and private providers for increasing performance and at
the same time will improve the health services network and community infrastructure, and
mobilize health professionals to work in underserved communities. The key results identified
regarding the implementation of the Health Sector Modernization Program's first phase, as well
as lessons drawn from other relevant evaluation studies undertaken recently are presented in
Annex 1-A.

Furthermore, the SWAP collects the knowledge and expertise of several key bilateral and
multilateral donors with substantial historical experience inthe Nicaraguanhealth sector and
different comparative advantage and expertise. It also builds upon the relationships established
duringIDA'Sprevious collaboration with the IDB,NORAD and NDFinthe supervision and
evaluation of the Health Sector Modernization Project.

5. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

Possible alternatives to the SWAP would have been first, carrying out a second phase of the APL
credit as a standalone project, outside the SWAPcontext. However, as noted above, this would
have been inefficient as it would have promulgatedthe disjointed nature of project-based funding
inthe health sector, without allowing for a coordinatedmulti-donor approach supporting sectoral
priorities. In addition, another reason for selecting the SWAPmodality i s that with limited
resources the Bank i s able to influence a much larger set of policy issues.

A second possibility would have been providing additional IDA fundingto the second PRSC,
attached to additional healthand nutrition priority actions. While the SWAPcomplements and
supports the PRSC's current health and nutritional policies and goals, an investment sector loan
forges stronger M O H ownership, provides earmarked funds to carry out the sector plans, and
offers an excellent avenue to convey the Bank's technical expertise to the MOH.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Partners in the SWAP are Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland, and the IDB.Some bilateral donors
(Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands) will provide unrestrictedbudget support to the MOH.
Sweden will be contributing US$20 million over the next five years. Netherlands will contribute
US$2 million in 2005 and continue inputtingat least similar amounts on an annual basis. Finland
estimates its contribution will be US$6.5 million between 2005 and 2009. The IDB has approved
inDecember 2004 a $30 millionperformance-based credit to be disbursed over five years. The
IDB credit, althoughusingIDBprocurementprocedures, resources the same five-year action
plan, disburses against a subgroup of the SWAp's result targets, relies on the M O H institutional
structure to execute the project, and will bejointly supervised with the rest of the SWAP
partners. USAID, another big player in Nicaragua's health sector, has been pafticipating in all
the SWAP preparation missions and although unable to pool funds with the rest of the donors,
has committed to also support the FYIP, and particularly those activities aimed at institutional
strengthening and sector governance. The total SWAP envelope for the five-year timeframe
amounts to US$ 82.2 million, including (1) IDB and IDA credit proceeds, (2) funds from
Finland, Sweden and The Netherlands and (3) M O H counterpart funds for the IDB and IDA
credits.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

The principles of the SWAp planning, executing, monitoring and coordination mechanisms are
contained in a Code of Conduct that has been agreed between the MOH and the SWAPpartners.
Those principles will be further detailed in a Memorandum of Understanding that the MOH will
agree with the SWAP partners before credit effectiveness. As outlined inthat Code o f Conduct
(already signed by all SWAP partners), and the drafted MOU, the M O H will lead the
implementation and execution of the SWAp. The Mesa Sectorial de Salud (MS), comprised of
all cooperating agencies inthe health sector and all the health-related government agencies, will
be the principal forum for cooperation, information exchange and dialogue for the overall health
sector development. The M O H and all the SWAP partners will constitute a Coordinating
Committee incharge of overseeing the planning and execution of the FYIP and its annual action
plans, and reviewing periodically (at least biannually) the attainment of its targets. Technical
support and internal coordination within the M O H will be provided by a SWAP Technical
Secretariat directly reporting to the Minister o f Health. The director of the Technical Secretariat
will be appointed by the Health Minister, under TORS,employment conditions and appointment
subject to approval by all the SWAP partners.

Initially-until the M O H sets up a dedicated purchasing unit within its formal structure-the
Health Planning and Development General Directorate (DGPD) will be the purchasing entity for
the SWAP-funded expansion of services. This office will purchase the PBHS through the
management agreements with SILAIS on a per capita basis. It i s also the MOH's intent that the
purchasingunit to be created will gradually take over the purchasing of health services
throughout the country usingMOHresources through the annual management agreement signed



                                                   21

with all SILAIS. The DGPDwill also be responsible for the annual planning and budgetingof
the FYP. The Financial Administration General Directoratewill be responsible for budgeting,
accounting and reconciliation matters and providing support to the DGPD on mid- and short-
term financial planning of the SWAp. The DGPD will inturn provide technical support to the
SWAP Technical Secretariat on other SWAPexecution matters.

Flow of Funds

All donors of the Nicaragua health SWAP will contribute their funds to a Health Sector Support
Fund, FONSALUD. Basedon MOF's preference, eachdonor funding FONSALUD will have its
own special deposit account. The M O F (through the Treasurer General) will open and maintain
inthe NicaraguaCentralBank (BCN) a special deposit account for IDA'Scontribution to
FONSALUD,which will be co-managed by M O H and MOF, to be used exclusively for deposits
and withdrawals o f credit proceeds for eligible expenditures. After the conditions of
effectiveness have been met, and the special deposit account has been opened, M O H will submit
the first disbursement request to IDA, together with the credit expenditure forecast for the next
six months. Subsequent to the first disbursement, credit proceeds will be withdrawn on a
quarterly basis under the report-based disbursement method (described in Annex 7).

Program disbursements will be made utilizing MOH's general disbursement procedures. For
major expenditures, upon receipt of a request from MOH, M O F will execute payments out of the
national Single Treasury Account (CUT). For minor expenditures, M O H will execute payments
usingthe revolving fund mechanism.

Payments under Component 1will be made in accordance with the provisions of the
management agreements with the targeted SILAIS (such provisions to be consistent with the
Operational Manual that has to be reviewed and approved b y the SWAPpartners). Every month
the M O H will transfer to each SILAIS a portion of the amount calculated by multiplying the
estimated beneficiary population in the SILAIS by the adjusted capitation payment for that
SILAIS (as explainedinsection B.3).Advance payments could be made to provide working
capital at the beginning of each year, as defined in the Operational Manual, and then
proportionally deducted from the monthly capitation transfers throughout the remainder of the
one-year contract. At the end o f the program, or in the interim inthe event of significant
underperformance, SILAIS will refund any unused balance. The costing mechanism will be
documented in the Operational Manual and reviewed on an annual basis.

Certain minor expenditures under Component 2 will be paid for by the SILAIS under short-term
advances from M O H subject to reconciliation. Other payments will be managed centrally by the
MOH's Finance Department.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomedresults

A common set of results and indicators, as mentionedin section B.2and detailedinAnnex 3, has
been set up by the M O H and agreed by the SWAP partners. Results will be monitored on a
regular basis by M O H at the central, SILAIS and local levels. The SWAP specific results are
consistent with those nationwide results established between the GON and the Budget Support



                                                 22

Group of donors, and both sets of indicators will bejointly monitored at the SWAP supervision
missions. The SWAPCoordinating Committee will meet at least twice a year as specified inthe
Code of Conduct, to monitor progress made on the implementation of the Five-Year
Implementation Plan and the consecutive Annual Operational Plans. Duringthe preparatory
stages of the SWAp, the M O H has demonstrated sufficient capacity for information collection as
well as the flexibility to be able to devise innovative and technically sound approaches that will
contribute to the long term development of institutional capacity to not only monitor the SWAp,
but to better fulfill its role as the rector of the health sector. This capacity will be further
enhanced inthe process of implementing and monitoring the SWAp, including the strengthening
of the M O H Information System (SIMINSA), which i s the main instrument for planning,
managing, reporting and supervising the FYIP.

The Memorandum of Understanding, to be signed by the M O H and the SWAP partners, also
calls for an annual, independent audit of the SWAp's targets fulfillment, that will be carried out
undef TOR'Sacceptable to all the partners. A mid-term evaluhtion will be carried out after two
years of implementation. This mid-term evaluation will seek to take stock o f the accumulated
experience for refining the SWAPtargets, strategies and operational instruments.

4. Sustainability

The M O H has demonstrated its commitment to health sector reform and modernization through
its performance in the first phase of the APL credit and throughout the preparatory phase of the
SWAp.Duringthese stages, the M O Hhas adopted a new regulatory framework, organizational
and functional structure through an incremental process of institutional modernization.

The layout of the health sector strategy for the next ten years has been released and endorsed by
the GON and the SWAP partners, after thorough consultation. Most of the FYIP strategies have
proven successful, though will be continuously adjusted and improved according to experience
accrued with the implementation of the SWAp. In summary, the essential groundwork for the
implementationof the SWAPhas already been completed.

The sustainability of the SWAP relies mainly on the financial capacity o f the M O H to keep up
with the running cost of delivering extended services once the FYIP i s over. This seems feasible,
though, because: first, no major new infrastructure will be undertaken inthe five-year
implementation plan; second, it i s expected that the GON's fiscal situation will improve through
HlPC debt relief, forecasted economic growth, and increased external budget support, making
more likely the GON's injecting o f new funds into the M O H budget. To that end, one o f the
SWAPtarget results requires from the GONat least maintaining the per capita M O H
expenditure, inreal terms, over the SWAP life cycle. Third, through improved M O H purchasing
and stewardship capacity over the health sector, it is expected that allocative efficiency of GON
and external funds for health will improve, therefore makingthe sustainability of increased
access to essential services more affordable for the GON. Finally, there i s an implicit agreement
among external donors that support to the Nicaraguan health sector will continue as long as its
poverty rates remain highand the health sector performance improves over time.

5. Critical risksand possiblecontroversialaspects

There are no controversial aspects inthe SWAP and no major opposition i s envisaged to its
broad goals and objectives. The NHP 2004-2015 has been extensively consulted. However, the
political situation inNicaragua i s currently very polarized, and consequently the approval of the
SWAPby the National Assembly, and the execution of the SWAP could be affected.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

NPV of Net Benefits =US$66.7 million; R R = 54 percent

The economic evaluation considers the SWAp's costs and the direct and indirect economic
benefits expected from the successful implementation of the SWAp. The benefits from the
SWAPare expected to be reaped for many years beyond the 5-year life of the SWAp. A 10-year
planning horizon i s employed in this analysis, together with a 12percent discount rate.

The SWAPwould produce four distinct types of direct benefits: (1) reductions in hospital
discharges for malnutrition, perinatal complications, intestinal infections and acute respiratory



                                                  25

infections; (2) a reduction in hospital bed-days owing to an increase inthe number of ambulatory
surgeries; (3) a reduction inhospital bed-days due to reduction inthe nosocomial infection rate;
and (4) improvements in the efficiency of the M O H owing to advances inthe process of
decentralization. The net present value o f these direct benefits over the 10-year planninghorizon
i s estimated to be US$17.6 million.

The SWAPwould also produce indirect benefits, inthe form of potential years of life that would
be saved as a result of the SWAp's nutrition interventions, together with the lives saved from
reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The valuation of the potential years of life saved i s
calculated as the product of the number of additional years of economically active life per
individual saved, weighted by the real average per capita Nicaraguan GDP. The net present
value of these indirect benefits over the 10-year planning horizon i s US$118.4 million.

The total cost of the SWAP is US$82.2 million. Over the 10-year planning horizon, the net
pres'entvalue o f the net benefits of the SWAPi s US$66.7 million. The internal rate of returnof
the SWAP i s 54 percent. A substantially more than proportionate share of the benefits of the
SWAPwould accrue to the poorest and most vulnerable groups inNicaraguan society.

FiscalAnalysis

Most SWAP activities are investments designed to improve the effectiveness of the functioning
of the health network and to strengthen the management and stewardship of the Ministry. These
activities will generate increased recurrent costs for the M O H inthe form of increased annual
maintenance costs. The SWAPwill also increase the MOH's recurrent costs because the Ministry
will eventually need to pay the annual costs of maintaining the purchasing of NGO services
related to extending the coverage o f the Basic Package of.Health Services. It i s estimated that
these two sources of additional recurrent costs will be roughly equal in size and that upon
completion of the SWAPthey will together total US$5.6 million, 3 percent of the projected total
expenditures of the M O H and roughly 4.5 percent of the Ministry's total recurrent costs.' The
total cost of the SWAP over the entire 10-year planning horizon averages 8 percent of total M O H
expenditures and about 15 percent of its total recurrent costs. As a percent of GDP, the total cost
of the SWAPrepresent a relatively small number, never reaching even 0.5 percent over the 10-
year period. Insummary, based on the analysis of the costs, benefits, and return on investment,
the SWAP i s a viable economic undertaking.

2. Technical

M O Hhas developed the Integrated Health Care Model (MAIS) which will be the framework for
delivering the PBHS.This model i s based on a variety of institutional experiences andjoint
projects, and draws lessons from a 2004 evaluation of these experiences implementedin
Nicaragua over the past five years. The PBHS used to extend coverage o f health services under
the SWAP contains those health prevention, promotion and treatment practices that the
internationalexperience and research support as the more efficient health care interventions. The


  As part of preparation for the SWAp, annual projections of anticipated MOHallocations for the 2005-2009 period
were prepared working with officials from the Ministry of the Treasury, the Central Bank and the Ministry of the
Presidency's Strategic Planning Unit.


                                                        26

criteria used to identify and target departments are sound and reliable measures of where poverty
and health needs tend to concentrate inNicaragua. Component 11will ensure that the existing
health facilities in the targeted departments are upgraded in order to provide the appropriate
quality and safety services necessary to fulfill the health care path of the maternal and child
illnesses included in the PBHS. The project includes the necessary provisions to secure
community and user involvement inthe planning and monitoring o f the delivery of health
services. It also provides for the tailoring of the delivery model to the special needs and wants of
the indigenous people, significant recipients of the SWAP interventions. Finally, Component I11
will support and buildup the M O H institutional strengthening necessary for continuously
evaluating the results of the SWAP and the Nicaraguahealth system as a whole, as well as the
fiduciary systems requiredto jointly operate M O H and external funds.

3. Fiduciary

The basic premise of the NicaraguaHealth financial management (FM) arrangements i s that they
will be based on the Government's public financial management systems and procedures, with
additional safeguards when needed. The FMassessment reviewed MOH's financial
management structure, its experience inmanaging donor-funded projects and its internal
operating performance and procedures (budgeting, accounting, internal control, auditing and
reporting). The assessment concluded that MOH's financial management system meets the
Bank's minimumfinancial management requirements. The FM action plan, supervisionplan and
scope of the audit are designed to manage the risks identified. These provisions are detailed in
Annex 7.

The three main components of the program will require procurement of small civil works,
consulting services and goods. The issues/risks concerning the procurement component for
implementation of the project have been identified and include:

        Inconsistencies between Law 323 and World Bank Guidelines on (i)         registration
        requirements; (ii)  evaluation systems; and (iii)consulting services;
        Inconsistencies between IDB and World Bank Guidelines on: (i)        eligibility; (ii)
        thresholds for prior review; and (iii)consulting services;
        Weaknesses inthe internal and external auditing system;
        Weaknesses in technical specifications, terms of reference, and contract management;
        and
        Need for additional qualified staff to manage project procurement.

The corrective measures agreed upon will be included in a fiduciary memorandum of
understanding and include:

        Review by Pool FundPartners of the annual procurement plan and quarterly updates;
        Outline for the use of ICB and NCP systems;
        A capacity plan funded by the Pool Fundto strengthen procurement procedures, reporting
        and audit, and staff skills; and
        Addition of qualified staff.




                                                  27

With these measuresinplace, the overall project risk for procurement i s average.

4. Social

A social assessmentthat includes consultations, focus groups and interviews with local
communities, NGOs, health services users, traditional authorities, etc. was carried out (October
2004-January 2005) by a local independent firm. The assessment includes indigenous, non-
indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan population living inhighly vulnerable areas with limited access
(geographic, linguistic or cultural) to health services. The assessedareas include the Northern
and Southern Autonomous Atlantic Regions (RAAN, RAAS),Jinotega, Rio San Juan, and
selected municipalities of Nueva Segovia, Matagalpa and Madriz. The objectives o f the
assessment were: (a) to assess the social feasibility of creation of new Women's Centers in 15
remote communities, and to evaluate the utilization of 4 existing Centers (El Rama, Bilwi,
Bluefields, Matagalpa); (b) to assess utilization of public health services (including 4 hospitals:
Bluefields, Bilwi, Juicalpa and Matagalpa) in 15 municipalities; (c) t6 assess the relationship
among the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of health care; and (d) to identify and
systematize the mechanisms of social control and health care surveillance presently in operation
by Councils, Committees, Associations and organized groups or civil society.

Given that 11percent of the population is indigenous peoples, an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP)
has been incorporatedin the project design to ensure the indigenous andAfro-Nicaraguan
peoples benefit from the project in a culturally adequate manner. The IPPderives from
consultations with the Central and Regional Autonomous Government of RAAN and RAAS, and
i s consistent with the National and Regional Health Plans. Some of the activities included by the
IPPunder Component 1are: (a) A consultancy to determine the PBHS for RAANand RAAS;
(b) Contracting of private health care providers servingremote areas; (c) training and equipment
of itinerant health care units serving remote areas; (d) Installation of at least 15 new community-
managed Women's Centers inRAAN, RAAS, Rio San Juan, Jinotega, Madriz, Nueva Segovia
and Chontales; (e) Strengthening the services of 10existing Subsedes and creationof 8 new ones
inselected municipalities; (f)The creation of Municipal HealthDelegation inPrinzapolka.
Under Component 2: (a) Training of 900 midwives and 500 traditional healers; (b) Equipping
midwives and healthpromoters; (c) Workshops with traditional health providers at the Institute
of Traditional Medicine of URACCANto share experiences, and disseminate best practices in
intercultural medicine. Under Component 3: (a) Strengthening technical skills of Regional
Health Councils and Regional Government to administrate health; (b) Strengthening the capacity
of the Coordinating Commission to manage the decentralizationprocess; (c) Strengthening the
social auditing mechanisms by financing workshops, training, with the Regional, Municipal and
Communal Health Commissions.

5. Environment

This operation aims at improving the conditions of the Health Sector inNicaragua, throughout its
expansion and modernization. This operation will lead to an increase of the production of Health
Care Waste (HCW), and a reversible and moderate environmental impact inthe areas where
remodeling activities will take place. This operation i s category B. In order to meet the
requirements of the Bank and, enhance the quality of the operation, the Government of

Nicaragua (GON) has prepared a stand alone Environmental Assessment which at least includes:
a summaryo f the report, a Health Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP), its implementation
strategy, and a set of rules for constructors.


The Health Care Waste ManagementPlan (HCWMP)

The EA presented by the GON contains a general objective, a methodology, a legal framework
and the HCWMP. This plan includes an institutional framework for its implementation, an
overview of the current practices on handling HCW, a strategy and an action plan to improve the
management of H C W on selected facilities, indicators, training materials, environmental
mitigation measures, lessons learned, conclusions, schedule, budget and bibliography.

As reported by the GON, HCW production inNicaragua was estimated in 1,43
kilograms/bed/day and an aggregate of National Daily ProductionLevel 9.6 tons o f which 2.4
tons are biologicalhazardous waste. The legal framework comprehends a series df laws and
decrees, of which the most relevant are: Ley de Municipios N o 40 , 1988,Law 217, Ley General
del Medio ambiente y 10s recursos naturales, and the Ley General de Salud, on its articles 55, 56,
64, 65,66, 67,68, and 69, all addresses the framework for HCWM. Based on the assessment
above the GON, expects to support through this operation on the following institutions: Hospital
Victoria Motta, Jinotega; Hospital Asuncibn, Juigalpa; Hospital Espaiia, Chinandega; Hospital
Dr.Juan A. Brenes, Somoto; HospitalLuis Alfonso MoncadaGuillCn,Ocotal; HospitalNuevo
Amanecer, RAAN; Hospital Gaspar Garcia Laviana, Rivas; Hospital Regional Ernest0 Sequeira,
RAAS;Hospital LuisFelipe Moncada, de San Carlos, Rio San Juan, Hospital Cesar Amador
Molina, Matagalpa; Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Gonzalez, Le6n; Hospital San Juan de Dios,
Esteli; and Hospital JosC Nebrowski, Boaco.


The Ministry of Health (MOH) will implement the guidelines developed in the course of a
Technical Cooperation with the European Union. These guidelines include the following
materials: guidelines for training and management of Health Care Waste (7 modules); a training
video on best practices on HCWM; a manual for technicians and supervisors; manual for
doctors and nurses; manual for General Services Personnel; and a C D which includes all of the
above. A H C W M committee will be established on every health institution. The strategy to be
implemented by M O H focuses on the inclusion in each fiscal year's budget of the required
resources to support the implementation o f H C W M plans, specifically allocate particular funds
to handle HCW; implement a recycling strategy for non-biomedical waste; sign technical
cooperation agreements with the major's offices to manipulate and dispose treated HCW in
specific sites, agreed in advance and under safety conditions, at the sanitary landfills; include
standards for accomplishments o f H C W M plans within the accreditation and certification plans;
all these activities supported by a series o f indicators in order to measure the effectiveness of the
plan. The main indicators are as follows: Health Care Waste Management Committee
implemented, Health Care Waste Management Plan inPlace, Implementation of the HCWMP,
Efficiency on the Segregation Process, Treatment for Biomedical Waste, Training of Hospital
Personnel, Coordination with Municipal Authorities, Consejos Consultivos support the
Implementationof the Plan, Inclusion o f Budget for HCWM every Fiscal Year.

Environmental rules for contractors :

The GONhas presented a report which addresses the needs of the minor construction works
supported by this operation. The guidelines include the following: site selection criteria, heating
needs, ventilation, natural and artificial light energy efficiency, historical and cultural
considerations, and security and handicapped access. Also, floor space (ft2) per bed/ward,
requirements for x-ray rooms, and adequacy of corridors for wheel chairbed access. Also, waste
management, maintenance, stockpiles and borrow pits; site cleanup; safety duringconstruction;
nuisance and dust control; community relations; chance find procedures for culturally significant
artifacts; and Environmental SupervisionDuringConstruction.

Health is a major priority inNicaragua. From 1999 to 2002, Nicaragua spent an annual average
of 7.1% of its GDP on health, and the percent of Central Government expenditures devoted to
the Ministry of Health (MOH) exceeded 14%. These are relatively highproportions compared to
neighboring Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Still, due primarily to its poverty, the
absolute level of health expenditures i s relatively low. In2003, the per capita expenditure level
of the MOH--the primary provider of health care in Nicaragua--was US$24.

In2003, the Ministry of Healthprovided 7.2 million outpatient consultations (an average of 1.3
per capita), 280,000 hospital discharges (52 per 1,000) and accounted for 34% of total health
expenditures. The MOHprovides care through its network of more than 1,000 facilities-
including 32 hospitals, 177 health centers and 872 health posts. It administers this system
through 18 departmental offices (SILAIS).

The Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) i s the second most important actor in the health
sector. It purchases a defined package of services from 48 health maintenance organization-like
entities (EMPs), and provides coverage for 19 percent o f the labor force and 9 percent o f the
national population. In 2003, it provided 2.4 million ambulatory visits (an average o f 4.9 per
beneficiary) and 43,000 hospitalizations (90 per 1,000 beneficiaries), and accounted for 14
percent of total health expenditures. lo

Over the last decade, Nicaragua's health systemhas been undergoing a transition from a socialist
system that was implementedinthe 1980s, to one that i s more pluralistic. The private sector has
grown steadily from the early 1990s, when it accounted for less than 5 percent of outpatient care
and an even smaller share of hospitalizations. According to the 2001 DHS, the private sector
now accounts for 32 percent outpatient visits and 15 percent o f hospitalizations. This growth has
been spawned by the INSS system of purchasing care, but also manifests the process o f
economic development; namely, increasing householdincomes and changing consumer
preferences.

loMost of the organizations from which INSS purchases care are private agents, but they also include 10MOH
facilities acting as either prime contractors providing the full package of services or as sub-contractors providing
hospital services exclusively.

          Sourcesof HealthSector Financing,      Nicaragua's health system provides a relatively
                    Nicaraaua                   Ilow level of financial protection from the direct
                                                 costs of health. From 1997through 2002, nearly
                                                 half of the annual average of 7.0 percent of GDP
                                                 that Nicaragua spent on health was paid out-of-
                                                 pocket by households. The high proportion of out-
                                                 of-pocket financing reflects a combination of
        1997   1998  1999   2000    2001   2002  factors, including: the common perception among
          0MOH 0INSS 0HouseholdsON1Other         Nicaraguans that the quality of care provided by
                                                 the major care provider-MOH-is       unacceptably
low, a long tradition of self-treatment, the relatively highprice of medicines in Nicaragua, and
the lack of access to care of a substantial proportion of the population. Nearly one-fifth (18
percent) of Nicaraguans devote at least 10percent of their total household expenditures to health.
This is the hi'ghest proportion of the population spending at least this amount on health
expenditures in all of Central America, and i s more than double the combined average of
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.

Key Challenges
MOH's WeakInstitutional Capacity

The weak institutional capacity of the Nicaraguan Health Ministry (MOH) is most conspicuously
manifested by: (1) the widely held belief that the quality of care provided i s relatively poor, (2)
M O H weak managerial capacity, and (3) its dependence on external assistance.

MOH's efforts to improve its managerialcapacity-which          began inearnest more than a decade
ago-are   just startingto reach fruition and need to be deepened and institutionalized. One of the
MOH's pivotal institutional weaknesses has been the way in which M O H has traditionally
allocated its resources. Budgetary allocations have been made on a historical basis, based on past
allocation patterns without taking into account variations or changes inhealth needs, health
priorities of local populations, the recurrent costs of providing care, or the performance of system
administrators and managers.'

The M O H initiated a process of devolving managerial responsibility to the SILAIS inthe early
1990s. The decentralization initiative, however, remains only partially implementedbecause the
SILAIS have never been granted adequate autonomy. Most importantly, their financial
autonomy i s limited to about 30 percent of their operating expenditures, as control over the
selection, placement and pay of personnel has remained centralized.

Another impedimentto MOH's effective management of its financial resources i s the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) requirement that the revenues that M O H facilities generate from user fees or
from providing services to social security beneficiaries be transferred to the MOF. The M O F
thendetermines how much of these funds will be returnedto the facilities generating them,
takinginto account the consolidatedfiscal position of M O H and the central government. This

process usually involves a time-lag of one to two months, creating a trade-off of local autonomy
for macro-economic control.

MOHhas traditionally focused on service provision and the management of the hospital and
primarycare network. It has yet to develop adequate institutional capacity to effectively manage
areas for which it has more recently assumed responsibility (as part o f the GON's efforts to
reform the sector), including regulatory, quality control, supervisory and monitoring functions.

Substantial Inequities by Residenceand Region

Nicaragua's national statistics mask substantial inequities in health status and the utilization o f
health care. Both poverty and health indicators vary significantly by place o f residence (rural
versus urban) and by department. Whereas in rural areas, more than two-thirds of the population
i s poor, in urban areas the proportion i s less than one-third. Similarly, more than 25 percent of
those in rural areas are ex`tremely poor versus 6 percent among urban dwellers. Th'ese differences
are reflected in a variety o f health indicators, inpart because they condition access to and use of
health services.

The prevalence of poverty and the absolute number of poor are found disproportionately in the
rural areas of the North and Atlantic Coast. As health problems have become increasingly
concentrated among the poor, they have become increasingly concentrated in these geographic
areas of the country. As a result, the 5 (of 17) departments that have the highest maternal
mortality rates (Jinotega, Chontales, Rio San Juan, RAAN and RAAS), are the same 5
departments with the highest fertility rates, the same 5 with the lowest percentage of births
attended in a medical facility, and they include the 3 departments with the lowest contraceptive
prevalence rates, the 4 departments with the lowest coverage o f prenatal care, the 4 with lowest
proportion of prenatal care initiated duringthe first trimester o f pregnancy, and the 3
departmentswith the highest levels of unmet need for family planning services (DHS 2001).
Among these populations access to services i s hampered by geographical, financial and cultural
barriers.


Inequity and ineflicient allocation of health expenditures

A critical challenge for Nicaragua and the international community is to modify existing patterns
of public health expenditures so that they no longer reinforce, but help address Nicaragua's
unequal health and poverty profiles. When recent advances inhealth are disaggregated b y
household income quintiles, it reveals that the poor have benefited less than proportionately from
the progress. As may be seen in the graph below, there i s a direct relationship between the
amount of improvement that was made between 1998 and 2001 inhousehold income quintile
and the rate of reduction inthe (a) infant mortality rate, (b) the under-5 mortality rate, and (c) the
prevalence of chronic malnutrition among children 12-59 months old. The poorest benefited the
least from the improvement of health indicators, the wealthiest benefited the most. As a result,
these healthproblems have become increasingly concentrated among the poor and the
geographic areas where the poor are concentrated, mainly rural areas o f the North and the
Atlantic Coast.

Another facet of the inequities inexisting public expenditures i s the highproportion of higher
income households that obtain their care (largely free-of-charge) from the MOH. In2001, an
estimated 52 percent of the ambulatory care and 77 percent of the inpatient care consumed by the
two highest household income quintiles was provided by M O H (Rathe & Lora, 2003). M O H
should improve targeting of its resources to the poor.


Imbalances in Doctor-Nurse ratio

Lack of trained health personnel, specifically the scarcity of nurses relative to doctors (although
doctors are also in short supply) i s another significant area of concern. This imbalance became
worse after M O H divested nurses' education to universities. Latest estimates show the ratio of
physicians was 6.2 per 10,000 inhabitants whereas the corresponding estimate of nurses was 3.3.
Developingcountry studies have shown that the density of nursing staff i s positively correlated
to reduced infant mortality rates. Conversely, since under-5 mortality rates in Nicaragua (though
declining) are still the second-highest in Central America, it i s possible that lack of sufficient
nursingpersonnel mightbe a factor accounting for the relatively slow rate of progress.

Lack of afordable pharmaceuticals

Whereas the list of drugs available inNicaragua has expanded from 2,061 to 10,585 between
1993 and 2000, prices of non-generic drugs are prohibitively highmakingthem unaffordable for
the poor. A recent study found the average price of a list of 35 generic medicines inNicaragua
was 10times higher than the price paid by a World Bank project in Argentina (Meerhoff, 2004).
According to M O H estimates, only 45 percent o f the population inneed has access to subsidized
or free drugs provided by CIPS, the public drug and medical supply agency. The average per
capita expenditure on pharmaceuticals amounts to $2 annually, which i s equivalent to roughly
half the total per capita annual expenditure on health.

GovernmentResponse

Over the past four years, the GON has accelerated the pace at which it has been reforming the
health sector. Passage of the General Health Law and its Regulation Decree marked important
steps inthe modernization and institutional capacity-building of MOH, and both are now being
implemented. M O H i s also makingprogress on developing institutional capacity and further
decentralizing health planning and management to the local health systems (SILAIS). It i s
implementing a new financial information system (SIAFI), which will provide the MOH with a
system that i s compatible with the MOF's system (SIGFA) but provides the Ministry with a
more institution-specific and powerful management tool that will support effective
decentralization. This system has enabled a budget management reform that has decentralized
control of all inputs with the exception o f personnel, down to the health department level
(SILAIS). That system, inturn, interfaces with a local programming and budgeting tool (SIPLA)
which the Ministry has developed to structure a bottom-up approach to the development o f
annual opzrating plans by local level public health networks (municipios)and SILAIS. The
M O H has used this tool (in combination with its new initiatives and health priorities, and
estimates of available financing) to begin helping the municipios to identify the specific types
and levels services that they will produce ineach of the next five years. The sum of these plans
will constitute the MOH's Five-Year Implementation Plan 2005-2009 for the Ministry's primary
health care system, and will concurrently provide the wherewithal of management agreements
with the SILAIS directors, and thereby enhance accountability.

At the same time, new procurement mechanisms havebeen first piloted and then
institutionalized, new management models have been introduced in a group o f public hospitals
and service agreements are now entered into with all SILAIS, local primary care providers
(municipalities) and hospitals. New outreach strategies, like Women's Centers (Casus
Maternas), contracting of NGOs for the delivery of essential health services in remote areas and
the community nutrition and growth program, have been successfully implemented, bringing
effective accessible health care to poor communities.

The other key health care organization in the country, the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute
(INSS), has also made notable advances since 2000. In2002, it separated financing from the
management of its health and pension regimes. Between 2000 and 2004, it expandedthe number
of its health program's beneficiaries by 32 percent from 389,100 to 515,400, and reduced its
administrative expenditures from 18 to 9 percent o f total expenditures. In 2003 it introduced a
new Elderly Health Program (EHP) which has already been extended to 32,077 elderly people
(86 percent of the EHPtarget population), and in 2004 it added new services to the EHP's
defined benefit package. In2002, it implemented a new provider certification system for the 51
private companies (EMPs) that INSS pays to provide health care to its affiliates. In2004 it
evaluated this system with the active participation of the EMPs. Forty-eight of the EMPs have
now been certified and the three that were unable to meet the new standards have had their
contracts cancelled. Finally, in 2004, INSS, with the participation of the EMPs, developed a
methodology for fixing and periodically updating the capitation payment paid to the EMPs.

The GON's National Development Plan 2005-2009 which supplements MOH's Five-Year Plan,
sets the following areas as priorities for health and nutrition: (i)
                                                                   increasing coverage and quality
of services to vulnerable populations; (ii) intensifying the institutional reforms already

commenced by MOH; (iii)         preventingchronic malnutrition inchildren under 2 years, improving
nutrition and hygiene practices at the household and community level and; (iv) enhancing inter-
institutional coordination to improve nutritional programs. The table below illustrates the
GON's targets for the reduction of maternal and infant mortality rates and chronic malnutrition.

ProgradComponent  Key Conclusions
Evaluated


 0 Primary Health    There is a vast array of sponsor-driven programs with different strategies and
   Care Programs     kinds of support. In many cases they coincide and compete in the same
                     centers. Integration, mainstreaming and better focalization of all these
                     programs on the most vulnerable population i s urgent.
                     All PHC programs show that availability of essential drugs inone of the
                     principal bottlenecks for providing effective care (only an average of 5 1% o f
                     the population had access to the required drugs inthe 14 PHC programs
                     evaluated).
                     Most programs have increased coverage but measures of technical and
                     perceived quality have not (63% of intervention centers comply with quality
                     standards against 65% of control centers).
                     Availability of reliable and easy-to-accessclinical and management
                     information i s one of the most critical instruments to improve results (as
                     perceived by health professionals and managers).
                     Most programs take at least 2 to 3 years before showing any improvement o f
                     results. The institutional delivery rate shows particularly difficult to improve,
                     suggesting most likely the influence of other social, cultural and economic
                     factors.
                     Unreliable and outdated population data (for constructing denominators) and
                     small number rates have made difficult to evaluate the results of these
                     interventions. Also disease incidence and service production reporting are
                     still not reliable.
                     Per capita-based payments combined with some kind of performance and
                     very specific activity-based incentives have shown the most powerful
                         -  -
                     mechanism for purchasing PHC services and allocating fiscal resources.

 0 FONMAT            This program has achieved significant increases incoverage rates of
                     institutional delivery, prenatal care and child care.
                     FONMAT has developed an innovative model for contracting out services.
                     Contracting processes within FONMAT and the extension of coverage are
                     well developed with goals and objectives clearly linked to the flow of
                     economic resources.
                     Providing incentives to the demand (performance-based payments) together
                     with incentives to the supply o f services (strengthening infrastructure,
                     equipment, basic supplies) has demonstrated most effective in order to
                     achieve results (all the coverage indicators have improved and data also
                     suggest that early neonatal mortality has reduced where FONMAThas been
                     implemented).
                     Local autonomy to use the performance-based payments have been
                     considered instrumental to achieve better results.
                     The direct purchasing of certain hospital services (Le. deliveries) by PHC
                     providers has shown positive results in terms o f hospital responsiveness and
                     continuity of care.
                     The FONMATinformation and reporting system is considered simple and
                     very useful.
                    Also, the differential payments according to zone characteristics implemented
                     by FONMAT have been effective.

                 -  The program was captured by the public providers, and the planned private
                    provision was never implemented.
  PHC            -  Together with FONMAT, the new model has assisted MOH in its reforms,
  Management        chiefly by enabling the separation of its financing and providing functions,
  Model Project     and developing its capacity to contract by introducing new contractual

                 -  arrangements, payment systems and negotiation processes.
                    Key clinical and management instruments (protocols, patient records, patient
                    satisfaction surveys, management table boards and information systems, etc.)
                    have been successfully implemented and are worth-valued by local health
                    professionals.
                 -  A more direct intervention i s needed at the local health centers and posts in
                    terms of organization ,quality assurance, etc. rather than assistance at the

                 -  central and SILAIS level.
                    The role of SILAIS in supporting the contracting, M&Eprocesses needs to be
                    further clarified and strengthened. Contracts are not sufficiently followed-up

                    The lack of sufficient progress in the MOHdecentralization and the reformof

                 -  M O H resource allocation has hampered tfie impact of this model.
                    Unexpected budget cuts, lack of M O H compliance with the financial and
                    supplies commitments established in management agreements, and lack of
                    direct incentives to health staff have also been identified as problematic.
  NGOs           -  Excellent results for increasing coverage in remote areas. All the target

                    Discontinuation of the experience and financial sustainability are its main
                    weaknesses.

                 -  became operational.
                    Coordinated action by CMs and community health networks has increased
                    family planning (intwo CMs located in very poor localities, utilization of

                 -  family planning more than doubled).
                    Areas for improvement identified are: (i)   harmonizing reproductive health
                    training programs ran by different government agencies, donors and NGOs;
                    (ii) servicestandardsandcratingaFederationofCMs;(iii)building
                        setting
                    capacity to operate CMs properly in more communities, particularly where no
I                   solid social base exists.
  PROCOSAN       -  PROCOSAN and other community-based programs have demonstrated
                    important positive impact, but its relationshipand coordination with the

                 -  mainstream health services network requires further effort.
                    The nine services provided by PROCOSAN are generally of superior quality
                    to similar services provided in more institutional clinics. As a result however,
                    PROCOSAN appearsto be diverting demand for these services from these

                 -  clinics, thereby entrenching inefficiencies in mainstream facilities.
                    PROCOSAN has been institutionalized and generally adopted by most NGOs
                    and donors in Nicaragua as the best nutrition and growth development
                    program.
                    A more in-depth evaluation of PROCOSANis currently underway.
  Hospital       -- The methodology usedto establish the management capacity baseline was to

                    rigorous capacity assessment instruments are neededto follow-up hospital
                    modernization.
                 -  The same caveat mentioned for PHC regarding the effect of small numbers
                    and unreliability of information has been detected when trying to evaluate

                  hospital performance improvement.
                  Hospitals have, in general, successfully implemented key management
                  instruments,like management agreements with MOH, internal service
                  agreements, quality programs, information systems, strategic and business
                  plans, consultative councils, etc. Its impact is more difficult to ascertain. In
                  fact, hospital performance ratios are quite unstable and do not show
                  significant improvements. However, hospital maternal and perinatal mortality
                  rates have decreased in most intervention hospitals. Patient satisfaction rates
                  have also improved in all hospitals.
                  Low hospital occupation rates are pervasive and suggest problems on the
                  demand as well as on the supply side, including lack of operational funds.
                  Physical strengthening projects on hospitals are considered positive and
                  necessary, but they have also been evaluated as somehow patchy and non-
                  responding to a coordinated plan.
                  The hiring o f the change agents by the program has been considered
                  instrumental for supporting the implementation o f the new management
                  model. However, a more sustainable strategy would require strengthening the
                  M O H Hospital Directorate with qualified st`aff. On the same realm, hospital
                  directors discontinuity is perceived as excessive and negative for the hospital
                  improvement process.
                  Sustainability of improvements is a major issue given the scarcity of non-
                  personnel operational budgets. Supply of drugs, maintenance of equipment,
                  and running waste management programs are all examples of programs that
                  cannot be continued with the current level of expenditures.
                  "Differentiated services" to private patients in public hospitals and cross-
                  subsidies across patients have remained untouchedby the program.
                  Historical budget allocation pervades and requires urgent reform. Similarly,
                  the decentralization process of management power to hospitals i s considered
                  slow by most hospital managers.
                  Insummary, the reformof hospital management is still incipient and requires
                                                             -
                  further institutionalization.

0Institutional    The goals and objectives set for this component have been fully complied
 Strengthening    with19 1% of the-key performance targets have been fulfilled).~Specifically,
                  the new regulatory framework has been set out, management agreements have
                  been concluded with the 17 existing SILAIS, 32 hospitals and 152 municipal
                  health centers. The new policy framework has also been set out after
                  extensive consultation.
                  M O H has successfully developed and institutionalized a new bottom-up
                  budgeting and planning cycle based on local needs and performance. This has
                  been a major capacity-building exercise for the MOH and a critical tool for
                  planning and implementing the FYIP.
                  Budget execution and intra-unit resource allocation have both improved, but
                  sector-wide resource allocation and territorial financial equity still need to be
                  addressed.
                  M O H has also restructured its financial management system which allows for
                  managing the budget more transparently and effectively, with greater
                  decentralization. However the MOHfinancial system (SIAFI) and the GON's
                  (SIGFA) do not communicate yet.
                  Whereas financial administration functions have been decentralized to a
                  certain extent, there still needs to be greater decentralization of other
                  functions to the executing units (Le. human resources). There is also a need
                  for risk-transfer mechanisms to be strengthened so that local management
                  assumes greater responsibility for the results of their actions.
                  The new MOH information system (SIMINSA) has been devised and
                  partially implemented. However the evaluations show that it needsto be
                  further adjusted, quality of information needs to be assessed, its modules need

                           to be better integrated (SIPLA, SIAFI, production)and accessibility to the
                           system locally needs to be extended. It is particularly hospitalmanagers who
                           complain the most about the usefulness of this tool.
                        -  Similarly, the new planningand management mechanismsset out by the
                           MOH(annualplans and budgets, management agreements, management table
                           boards)needto be articulated and integrated.
                        -  Although the legal framework, the contractinginstruments and the
                           institutionalculture have been established,the institutionalizationof a
                           purchasingunit within the MOH is still required to consolidate and take full
                           responsibilityover the development and strengthening of this function.
                        -  Ownership of the HealthSector ModernizationProgram and Coordination
                           betweenthe program and the MOHline Directorateshas increased
                           progressively over the years and it is consideredessential for the program's
                           success.
                        -  Institutionalmodernization activitieswere dispersed in too many areas and
                           coordinationwith the other components was not always evident.

Monitoringarrangements

Results will be monitored on a regular basis by the M O H at the central and SILAIS levels. The
SWAP Coordinating Committee will meet at least twice a year to monitor progress made on the
implementation of the Five-Year Implementation Plan and the Annual Operational Plan for the
health sector. The Directorate General of Health Planning and Development (DGPD) will have
overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation at the central level. The DGPDwill
collaborate with the SILAIS to develop a standardized monthly report that will track M&E actual
versus plannedperformance indicators.

At the local level, municipalities will collate information on programoutputs generated by health
clinics and health centers. At the SILAIS level, it will be necessary to develop M&E teams.
These M&Eteams will be headed by the deputy manager of the SILAIS, and will be trained and
supported to carry out the routine oversight of the public and private providers' performance on
an on-'going basis. These teams will be responsible for coordinating and compiling information,
including information generated by hospitals, using the Health Management Information System
(SIMINSA).14 The SIMINSA, through its different modules, will be the main instrument for
formulating the annual action plans and budgets, and for monitoring the SWAp's final and
intermediate targets.

The SILAIS M&Eteams will submit monthly reports to the DGPD that will use them as input to
produce quarterly monitoring reports of the SWAp, as well as SILAIS-specific quarterly
management reports. These quarterly reports will provide timely input for improving M O H
results-based management decision-making by focusing attention and requiring explanations
about variations in actual versus planned levels of a specific set of performance indicators. The
review and discussion of these reports will serve as the agenda for quarterly, national M&E
meetings of all of the SILAIS. At these quarterly meetings, the DGPDwill present a report of
the overall performance of the MOH, and each SILAIS director will present and explain hisher
SILAIS's performance. These presentations will be based on a standardized format (based on the
annual operating plan) which the DGPD will develop and which each SILAIS will use in
reporting its performance. These meetings will provide the basis for fine-tuning individual
SILAIS and MOH's annual action plans, as well as the FYP.

The first quarter M&Emeetingof each year will incorporate a review of the previous year's
performance, that will assess that performance within both the framework of the annual action
plan and the framework of the Five-Year Plan-and,             as deemed appropriate, will modify the
subsequent national, annual action plan and/or the Five-Year Plan. The goal i s to construct the
M&Esystem as an action-based tool for fostering the development of a more on-going, proactive
and strategic system of M O H management at both the national, SILAIS and local levels." This

integrationand implementation of the key institutional informationmanagement systems, includingthe SIGFA,

this M&E systemwill require ongoing coordination with the NationalStatistics Institute (INE).

system will also be used as input into monitoring the fulfillment of contracts of those private
service providers with whom the MOHenters into agreement.

Inaddition to on-going M&E, an annual, independent audit of the SWAp's targets fulfillment
will be carried out under TORSacceptable to all the partners. A mid-term evaluation will be
carried out after two years of implementation. This mid-term evaluation will take stock of the
accumulated experience and provide a feedback mechanism for refiningthe SWAP targets,
strategies and operations.

          NICARAGUA: Health Services Extension and Modernization (2nd APL)


ProgramOutreach

The second phase of the Health Sector Modernization APL will support, along with the M O H
and four other donors, a sector-wide approach supporting the Nicaragua National Health Plan
2004-2015 (NHP), with priority given to the achievement of the health-related MDGtargets. The
NHPhas been operationalized into afive-year implementationplan 2005-2009 (FYIP)that sets
up the planning framework for the SWAp. The APL programmatic objectives are fully
compatible with those of the FYIP,therefore makingthe participation of IDA inthe SWAPfully
viable and recommendable. In accordance with the NHP, the FYIP prioritizes the extension of
coverage to the poorest segments of the population, particularly the Afro-Nicaraguan, indigenous
and rural popuJations in the most socio-economically deprived regions of the country. The FYIP
has a national and overall scope, and contains a well-defined subprogram centered inthree
specific objectives. The first two are, in turn, focalized for the 12most deprived departments
(SILAIS) of Nicaragua. These specific strategic objectives within the FYIP are as follows:

(i)     extension of coverage of a basic health and nutrition services package to the poorest
        areas o f the country, via the new integrated model of health care;
(ii)    physical and functional strengthening o f the health service facilities network, focusing on
        maternal-infant care, so as to provide a seamless path of essential services inthe target
        areas;
(iii)   institutional strengthening and capacity-building, concentrated specifically on developing
        the purchasing, monitoring and evaluation capacities of the MOH, its leadership role to
        enhancing donors' alignment and harmonization, and the management capacity of M O H
        decentralized units and Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast.

The financial resources allocated to the SWAP will supplement the portion of the national budget
dedicated to health, and its annual work plans will be programmed and budgeted simultaneously
and incoordination with those of the health budget as a whole. The FYIP will include activities
under the M O H responsibility mainly.


ProgramFocus

The FYIP targets 12departments and their 12 corresponding health care systems (SILAIS) out o f
the 17 systems that currently exist. Seventy -nine municipalities included inthose 12 SILAIS
have been prioritized. Since there are 115 municipalities nationwide, this implies the SWAP will
cover 75 percent of all the municipalities or 36 percent o f the total population. However, a much
larger proportion, 47 percent, of the poor and extreme poor live inthese municipalities.

Priority SILAIS and the respective municipalities were selected on the basis of the following
criteria defined by the MOH in the preparatory phases of the SWAp: (i) of poverty, as
                                                                            level
measuredby the percentage of people inthe lowest household income quintile as measured by
the DHS (2001); (ii) to health services, as measuredby the percentage of peoplethat live
                       access

more than an hour away from a health care center and the percentage o f institutional birthsin
that municipality; (iii) status, as measured by infant mortality and maternal mortality rates,
                         health
and morbidity rates for acute diarrhea and respiratory infections; and (iv) the needfor continuing
projects aimed at extending coverage o f health services already initiated insome areas. The
following table lists the departments (SILAIS)and municipalities selected on the basis o f the
above criteria:

Furthermore, within these selected regions, additional criteria will be usedfor selecting priority
populations:

     a) Women o f childbearing age between 15 and 49 years and children under 5 will gain
         access to maternal and infant care services under the essential basic health services
         package (PBHS), including non-medical interventions aimed at reducing morbidity and
         mortality inthese target groups;
     b) Rural communities classifiedas poor or extremely poor withinthese targeted
         municipalities;
     c) Dispersedextremely poor populations without access to health services will receive
         services included inthe PBHS through mobile units, supported by health centers;
     d) Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations, especially those living inthe RAANand
         M A S regionswill receive priority attention.

Ineachyear ofthe SWAp, the M O Htogether with INEC will conduct a beneficiary assessment
inthe 12 selected departments (3.3 million inhabitants live inthose 12Departments, ofwhich 2
million live inthe 79 targeted municipalities). This assessment will constitute a census o f the
participating communities. In2005, this assessment will be one and the same as the national
census which i s being conducted this year. It i s estimated that this survey will classify
approximately 470,000 people as potential beneficiaries for the extension o f coverage o f health
care services, applying the abovementioned criteria. Ofthis population, 235,000 will be women
o f childbearing age, 188,000 will be children under 5 years and 47,000 will be young people and
adults with diseases targeted by the PBHS.

ProjectComponents

Strategic objective 1:Extension of access to the Basic Package of Health Services (PBHS)for
thepoorest and most vulnerablepopulations US$36.5million (IDA US$ 7.5 million)
                                                -                          -

The primary objective o fthis component is to extend access to the PBHS to populations inthe 12
targeted departments (SILAIS), which have the worst health and poverty indicators. This
objective will be achievedthrough the financing o f a community health financing scheme. The
M O H will allocate the capitation transfers that will finance the community health financing
scheme to these select SILAIS. The capitation transfers will be calculated on a per capita basis,
based on the estimated cost o f providing the PBHS to the eligible population. The amount o f
funds to be transferred to each SILAIS each year will be calculated by multiplyingthe adjusted
average capitation payment by the number o f persons residing inthe eligible communities. The
total annual capitation payments will be transferred on a prorated monthly basis to the SILAIS.
At the beginningofeach annual contract, an advance equal to one quarter of the annual total
transfer will be distributedto the SILAIS. Subsequentmonthly payments o f the capitation
transfers will be adjusted downward to ensure that this advance i s offset duringthe course o f the
year. Every year the number o f beneficiaries ineach community and the adjusted average
capitationpayment will be reviewed and updated. The SILAIS would inturncontract services
for the PBHS with local public providers and/or private providers.

The IntegratedHealth Care Model (MAIS)

The M O H has developed the Integrated Health Care Model (MAIS) based on previous
experiences and projects implemented in the country. The MAIS delivery model i s based on a
recent cross-cutting evaluation of the 14 primary health care projects implemented nationwide.
This model will serve as the technical framework for the delivery and management of the PBHS
and contains key instrumentsfor the organization and delivery of quality health services (health
team's organization and functions, clinical protocols and service standards, contracting
mechanisms and performance-based payments). The MAIS will evolve as the PBHS i s extended
and new experience i s gained by the M O H on the implementation of these instruments.

Services of the PBHS would be contracted by SILAIS inthree different modalities, according to
the social and geographical characteristics of the population:

(i)    Zones B (rural concentrated): Mostly public providers, if existing in that area, will
       mobilize itinerant teams of health practitioners to provide the PBHS in close co-
       ordination with their corresponding institutional settings.

(ii)   Zones A (urban): The local health center and its catchment network o f health posts
       (municipios)will provide the PBHS to people working inthose urban areas.

(iii)  Zones C (rural dispersed): Most likely NGOs or other private health service providers
       will be contracted to provide outreach services comprising the PBHS to the communities.
       These itinerant teams will coordinate their service delivery with the nearest health center.
       A working referral system will be implementedto ensure that patients who require higher
       level care have access to it, particularly institutional deliveries and perinatal care.

Mobile public and private units will be comprisedo f health personnel (namely doctors and
nurses) and community health workers. They will provide ambulatory health services defined in
the PBHS to remote areas (zones B and C). Mobile teams will be complemented by the role of
paid health practitioners (promotoresde salud) who, although being part o f the delivery team,
will reside in the community, identify at-risk population, promote healthy practices and
environments, provide basic health care and contribute to close follow-up o f patients, pregnant
women and children. The role of community midwives will also be enhanced b y offering
appropriate training, basic equipment, implementing a sort of certification process, and
improving coordination and integration of these community workers' function with the local
health centers, NGOs and mobile teams operating in the area. The role o f health volunteers
(brigadism)will also be promoted and integrated inthe model, particularly to provide nutrition
advice, as the current community nutrition and growth program does (PROCOSAN). This
successful program will be expanded to the targeted communities without it yet, and developed
with new modules (Le. morbidity module) adding to the existing ones. PROCOSAN services
have been included as part of the PBHS. Where it does not exist, the contractedproviders of the
PBHS will provide it. Where it already exists, its current providers will progressively get
incorporated into the delivery of the PBHS model.

Inthe case of the indigenous and afro-descendant communities, the delivery model will be
adjusted in accordance with their specific needs, expectations and traditional customs and values.

The MOH, along with the Autonomous Governments of the Atlantic Coast (RAAN and RAAS),
i s currently working out a specific delivery model for these two regions that will be used for the
extension of the PBHS in those areas.

The Package of Basic Health Services (PBHS)

The PBHS has been formulated, in accordance with the corresponding specifications set up in
the 2002 General Health Law. This law stipulates an ample list of health care services that
should be offered b y the M O H to the entire population without means or without any health
insurance coverage (the non-contributory regime). However, the M O H cannot offer the entitled
package to all the eligible population under the law due to financial restriction. It has therefore
decided to adopt an incremental approach, commencing by offering an affordable package of
health services, based on the cost-effectiveness o f interventions and health and population
priorities established in the NHP, to the population groups that cluster the highest poverty and
disease burden inthe country. Consequently, the PBHS prioritizes the folldwing areas for
intervention: (i) maternal care; (ii) and reproductive health, including family planning and
                                          sexual
the prevention and control of sexually-transmitted diseases; (iii) health (for childrenunder
                                                                                    infant
5 years), child nutrition and development; and (iv) health education, detection and treatment for
the control of the most prevalent communicable and non-communicable diseases inadults.

The PBHS consists of the services outlined in the following table:

                Early detection, control and treatment of malaria, dengue andtuberculosis.
                Early detection and treatment of hypertensionand diabetes mellitus.


Two complementary activities necessary to ensure appropriate utilization of the PBHSby the
targeted population will be supported within this strategic objective o f the FYIP, namely:

    a) The incorporation o f traditional medicine, community structures and practitioners into the
       health services delivery and management model for the indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan
        populations.
   b) Information and communication activities aimed at: (i)                  generating community awareness
        and marketing the extension of health services; (ii)              raising social and individual
        responsibility over healthy practices and better nutritional habits inthe target populations.

The actual delivery of services and the expected outcomes of such services will be monitored
and verified through a two-pronged strategy:

-   A social audit mechanismwill be devised, by which the community will certify quarterly that
    the local providers render the services included inthe PBHS. Annual community surveys will
    also be carried out to investigate the quality and timeliness o f services.



                                                             57

-   Intermediateresults linkedto the delivery of the PBHS will be closely monitored by the
    SILAIS and the MOH. These intermediate results, as described inthe results framework
    (Annex 3), are: institutional deliveries, child immunization, early prenatal care, full prenatal
    care and discharges from Women Centers. The achievement and verification of these results
    will also be subject to an independent annual assessment, as agreed in the MOU.

Financingand payingfor the PBHS

The cost of the per capita premium of delivering the PBHS has been calculated for the 79
municipalities by geographical region, taking into consideration the differential cost of providing
services by the three different delivery models (rural-dispersed; rural-concentrated; urban) and
the amount of potential beneficiaries in each municipality living in those areas. According to that
calculation, the average cost per capita inthe most expensive region, RAAN, i s US$12.2, in
contrast to the more densely populated Pacific region where the average per capita cost i s
US$16.3. These costs have been developed through analysis of actual costs of each component
parts, accountingfor actual prices that prevail inthe markets for medical goods and services,
technology improvements, efficiency standards and expected economies of scale. The cost has
been brought to per capita average basis, taking into account the size of the beneficiary pool.
These costs are considered to be reliable, proxies, on average, for actual costs o f delivering the
PBHS.

To ensure that SILAIS will enforce the delivery of services by contracted public and private
providers, the management agreements between SILAIS and M O H will include the obligation of
SILAIS to spell out intheir contracts with providers: (i)  the rights and obligations of the parties;
(ii) contentofthePBHS;(iii) annualobjectives,follow-upindicators,andverification
    the                            the
mechanisms; (iv) budgetary allocation (inthe case of public providers), and the mechanisms for
payment and incentives; (v) information to be provided for supervision and evaluation purposes.
The following annexes to the contract will also be added: (a) the operational annual plan; (b)
training and development activities for strengthening clinical and management capacities; (c)
investment plan to strengthen the services network and the management plan for the
corresponding catchment network.

The management agreements (Convenios) will also define the result targets for each SILAIS,
usingthe FYIPresult indicators framework, establish the responsibilitiesof SILAIS and MOH
for following-up providers' performance, and specific mutual commitments for that area.

The OperationalManual for the extension of services that the M O H will furnish to IDA, and the
rest of the SWAP partners, before effectiveness o f the IDA credit, will describe inmore detail the
benefit plans, delivery modalities, focalization criteria and identification of beneficiary
mechanisms, payment mechanisms, contract instruments, management responsibilities of public
local providers, supervision arrangements, and procurement procedures.

Strengthening planning, accountability and social participationfor the delivery of the PBHS

The FYIPcalls for the development o f a strong health services purchasing function at the MOH
(the capacity of the M O H to prepare, negotiate, monitor and enforce the management
agreements). This function becomes crucial for the successful implementation of the expansion


                                                  58

o f the PBHS strategy and the accomplishment o f the FYIP targets. The M O H will produce by
January 2006 a restructuring o f M O H central offices so as to define and implement an
operational purchasing body sufficiently staffed, with clearly separated responsibilities from the
direct management o f units, and utilizing an integrated information system providing timely and
reliable data necessary for the formulation and evaluation o f management agreements usedfor
the implementation ofthe SWAp. This capacity buildingwill entail: (i)       capacity assessment and
training activities inthe 12 SILAIS; (ii)    technical assistanceand limited logistics (vehicles,
workshops) necessary to support the implementation and improvement o f the planning and
supervising roles; (iii)    technical assistance and information technology required for the
implementation o f the SIMINSA modules (SIPLA, SIAFI and others) inthese 12 SILAIS; (iv)
identification o f beneficiaries o f the PBHS; (v) studies, workshops and development o f
instrumentsaimed at involvinglocal communities inthe governance and supervision ofthe
expansion o f health care.

StrategicObiective2: Strenptheningthe networkof serviceswith emphasis on maternal
and infanthealthcare         - US$27.8 million   (IDA US$2.8 million)
                                                       -

I t s central objective i s aimed at increasing and improving the capacity o f public providers to
deliver the services included inthe PBHS, especially inthe area o fmaternal and infant care, by
reinforcing physically and functionally the primary and secondary care facilities. The reason for
this component i s that successful infant and maternal care can only be achieved ifadequate
institutional, both ambulatory and hospital, care i s available and accessible to the population. In
fact, the lesser maternal and infant mortality rates get anywhere, the more complicatedthe causes
o f those deaths become. Perinatal diseases are currently responsible for some more than one third
o f total infant deaths inNicaragua. This illustrates the need for relying on good quality and
accessible institutional care for appropriately tackling maternal and infant mortality in
Nicaragua. Reducing maternal and perinatal mortality requires also an operational referral
system, transportation, and good coordinationofthe entire health care process.

The M O Hwill support the expansionof the CasasMaternas network with 30 more o fthese
facilities, since the existingones have proven instrumental inincreasing the rates o f institutional
deliveries for pregnant women living inremote areas. Although not a health center, CMs are
frequently cross-supported by staff from the community's affiliated hospital. Services provided
inthese Casaswill expand over simply lodging pregnant women, to provide family planning and
child nutrition counseling, as well as other education activities (Le., simple vocational training)
for empowering resident women. A feasibility study will be conducted to identify communities
with difficult access to institutional delivery and expressed community support to maintaining
these centers. Fundingwill be provided for the rehabilitation o f existing premises or (on an
exceptional basis) the construction o f new homes, the acquisition o f basic equipment and
furnishings for the homes, time bound (and declining) recurrent costs, activities aimed at
empowering women staying inthe homes, and the promotion o f family planning.

Activities fundedunder this strategic objective o f the SWAPwill include:

(i)  Physical rehabilitation, medical equipment and basic furnishing o f health centers and health
posts inthe targeted areas necessary to provide the PBHS;



                                                     59

(ii)Physical rehabilitation, medical and industrial equipmentnecessary to upgrade the maternal
and infant critical care path o fthe twelve existing hospitals inthe 12targeted SILAIS.At least
the obstetric, neonataland pediatric services ofthese 12hospitals will improve as to comply with
the quality standards set forth bythe M O Hcertificationprocess (habilitacidn). The critical path
consists o f emergency rooms, operating theaters, obstetric and pediatric wards and the necessary
diagnostic (image, laboratory) and supporting services (water, steam and sanitation, catering,
laundry, maintenance and waste management);

iii)ExpansionoftheCasasMaternas(CMs)networkincluding:(a)rehabilitationofavailable
homes inthe communities for that purpose; (b) basic furniture and supplies, (c) operational costs
on a declining basis, (d) outreach activities for the target population, and (e) technical assistance
and training of the communities for the management and financial sustainability o f these homes;

iv) Strengtheningmanagement capacities o f hospitals and local public primary care providers
(municipios), including: (a) general management (strategic and business planning, monitoring
and internal control, performance management); (b) financial and administrative management
(financial accounting and control, humanresources, procurement o f supplies, general support
services - catering, maintenance, cleaning, hospital waste management and disposal); (c) clinical
and patient management (user identification and billing, clinical records, control o f hospital
infections, clinical protocols). These interventions will entail technical assistance for systems
development and implementation, training and information technology. Direct technical
assistance to local and hospital management teams will be provided by itinerant teams o f long
term consultants working under direct supervision o f the M O H Hospital and Primary Care
Directorates. Investmentinhospital infrastructure and equipmentwill be necessarily tied and
simultaneous to investment inmanagement and quality improvement o f those facilities.

This strategic objective is aimed at strengtheningMOH's leadership capacity and accountability
inorder to better enable achievingthe goals ofthe National HealthPlan(2004-15) and its
operational five-year plan (2005-2009). The FYIP goals relatedto this strategic objective are: (i)
improving the efficiency and equity o f health expenditures; (ii)  advancing the decentralization of
the healthsector and developing capacity ofthe Autonomous Governments ofthe Atlantic Coast
to take over management o f their regional health systems; (iii)  alignment and harmonizationof
foreign cooperation with M O H policies and systems; and (iv) developing the M O H capacity for

3.1 Stewardship

The objective ofthis component is to further develop the M O H institutional leadership ofthe
sector, particularly by: (a) monitoring and adjusting, ifneeded, the sectoral policy and strategy;
(b) developing the institutional capacity to evaluate the performance o fthe nationalhealth
system; (c) conducting and coordinating the implementation o f the GON's population policy; (d)
promoting and facilitating the assumption o f public healthresponsibilities (health protection,

promotion and environmental health) by municipal governments. These objectives will be
achieved through the following means:

i)EnhancingtheMOHcapacitytoevaluatetheperformanceofthenationalhealthsystem.
Resources will be allocated to support preparation of the national health accounts, perform a
mid-term evaluation of the five-year implementation health plan, as well as financial assistance
to carry out the 2006 demographic and health survey (DHS).

ii)TechnicalassistanceprovidedtotheMOH,astheGONdelegatedagencyforcoordinatingthe
Nicaragua multi-sectoral population policy, to help it manage, coordinate and monitor the
implementation o f the populationpolicy and its associated action plan.

iii)Capacity-buildingandawareness-raisingactivitieswillbeconductedwithmunicipal
governments to take on municipal responsibilities on public health. This activity will support the
GON effort to scale up municipal government responsibilities attached to the municipal fiscal
transfer law recently approved by the National Assembly.

iv) Coordination and progressive harmonization of foreign aid inthe sector. Technical assistance,
study tours and workshops will be supported inorder to facilitate progress in the harmonization
of external support. The SWAPfund will also contribute to the operational costs, including
salaries of consultants, of a reduced SWAPTechnical Secretariat.

3.2 Institutional strengthening to improve health service delivery and equity.

This will involve the following:

i)DevelopmentofMOH'spurchasingfunctionbythefollowingmeans:

        a) establishing the M O H purchasingbody. It will start as a branch o f the General
        Directorate of Health Planning and Development, managing the day to day relationship
        with SILAIS for the implementation of the community health financing scheme,
        including the use of funds provided by the external agencies and MOH for the SWAp.
        SWAP funds may be used for the contracting of time-limited consultant services that
        bringknow-how and support the operational functions of the purchasingunit;

        b) supporting the MOHannual planning andbudgeting process, facilitating its operation
        and implementing new instrumentsfor rendering the planning and budgeting process
        more needs-based and performance driven (namely, implementation of the new resource
        allocation formula, development of planning guidelines, identification of unit costs,
        development of hospital payment mechanisms).

ii)StrengtheningMOHfiduciarycapacitybyprovidingtrainingandtechnicalassistancefor:a)
deploying the institutional financial management system (SIGFA) in local units; b)
implementation of costing and invoicing systems; c) strengthening the M O H procurement
function. These activities will implement the strengthening plans prepared b y the fiduciary
assessments carried out by the SWAP partners in the preparation stage and all other necessary



                                                61

measures that may be identifiedduringthe SWAP execution. The M O Hwill enlarge the staff of
its procurement unit as defined in the fiduciary strengthening plan. Consultants may be also
needed to enlarge its technical capability.

iii)AdjustingtheMOHinformationsystem(SIMINSA)tomakeitresponsivetotheneedsofits
different end users (central MOH, SILAIS, hospitals and municipalities). This will involve
software development and the information technology and communication equipment required at
central and decentralized levels.

iv) Establishing a system of identifying social security beneficiaries at selected national
hospitals, aimed at reducing cross-subsidies between M O H and INSS. Also, funds will be
provided to develop the identification system o f the non-contributory regime system, starting by
the targeted municipalities for the expansion of coverage.

v) Supporting the technical development of the community health arid nutrition program
(PROCOSAN) in order to formulate and fine-tune the new components and support their
implementation.

3.3 Decentralization

The FYIP seeks to advance the technical and administrative decentralization of the MOH and
facilitate the transfer of human and financial resources to the SILAIS and local providers. The
M O H decentralization agendathat will be specifically supported by the SWAP include the
following:

i)Implementationofadecentralizedhumanresourcemanagementsystem,involvingthe
decentralization of payroll management, personnel planning and budgetingat local level, and
piloting of a performance payment mechanism.

ii)BuildcapacityintheGovernmentsoftheAutonomousRegionsoftheAtlanticCoast(RAAN
and RAAS) so that they become prepared to take on their legal responsibility to design, organize
and manage their regional health services. The FYIP will support the working plans that are
being prepared between the M O H and the Autonomous Secretariats of Health.

                             Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements
          NICARAGUA: Health Services Extension and Modernization (2nd APL)

The Code o f Conduct, which has been signed by all SWAP partners on January 28,2004, sets out
the basic principles guidingthe implementation of the SWAp. These include the following:

Coordination: The M O H and other SWAPpartners will cooperate with each other inestablishing
mechanisms o f collaboration necessary to prevent duplication and facilitate complementarities in
policies, agendas and activities.
Alignment: The MOH and other SWAPpartners will align their actions in accordance with the
National Health Policy and Plan (2004-2015) and the Five-Year ImplementationPlan (2005-
2009). They will also make sure these actions are coherent with the Reinforced Strategy for
Growth and Poverty Reduction (ERCERP), the National Development Plan and other GON
policies.
Harmonization: The GON and all SWAP partners will simplify and integrate their policies,
procedures and operational practices in accordance with the GON legal, regulatory and
institutional structures, procedures and fiduciary systems.

A Memorandum of Understanding(MOU), which has been drafted and furnished to the SWAP
partners by the MOH, sets out the institutional arrangements for the implementationof the
SWAPinmuch more detail. The MOU stipulates the FYIP as the operative instrumentfor the
SWAP inthe medium-term and the consolidation of all the common initiatives inthe SWAp. The
FYIP contains a subprogram along the priorities and geographical focalization set out inthis
credit proposal. This subprogram, for a total amount of US$82.2 million, focalizes the first two
objectives aimed at expanding the coverage o f the PBHS andthe strengthening of the health
service network on 79 municipalities with the worst poverty and ill-health'levels. The FYIPi s
accompanied by a mid-term financial plan for the health sector, setting out the expected total
funding of the health sector each year, by source of funds (fiscal, external and others), as well as
the allocation of those funds across functions, territories and expenditure category. The M O H
and the SWAP partners will create a special fund, FONSALUD, which will resource the
abovementioned subprogram within the FYIP. Initially this fund will collect funds committed by
IDA, IDB, Sweden, Finland andthe Netherlands. However, the fund may enlarge as new
financing from current SWAP donors i s available or new donors join in. FONSALUD will pool
funds from those donors, allowing for specific tracking of expenditures by donor source if
necessary.

The FYIPwill be, inturn, operationalizedevery year in annual action plans, compiling annual
plans and budgets prepared by SILAIS under MOH guidelines. The SWAP annual programming
will be performed within the same context and process of the M O H regular budgeting and
planning cycle. All SWAP participating agencies will meet with the M O H at least twice a year in
springand autumn. The springmeeting will evaluate the progress of the sectoral strategy inthe
past year and will establish common guidelines for the next year's plans. Inautumn, the SWAP
parties will review and agree with the M O H the next year action plan.

Other implementation and institutional arrangements for the management of the SWAP will
consist of the following:


                                                 64

       The M O H Board o f Directors, composed of the Minister, Vice-Minister and Directors
       Generals will have overall responsibility over the planning and direction of the SWAp, as
       part of the overall overseeing o f the M O H responsibilities. The M O H will constitute a
       Technical Secretariat for the SWAp. The Technical Secretariat will report directly to the
       Minister or Viceminister of Health and will be managed by an official appointed by
       himher. The appointed official's TORs and conditions of employment will require
       approval b y all SWAP participating agencies.
       The General Directorate of Health Planning and Development will assist, technically and
       administratively, the SWAPTechnical Secretariat. The Technical Secretariat will be
       staffed with a small number of officials for coordination and liaison with the MOH
       central divisions and SILAIS purposes. All SWAP partners will agree upon the number of
       officials, their TORs and the selection process.
       The M O H Purchasing unit: This virtual entity will initially reside under the responsibility
       of the General Directorate'of Health Planning and Development and will be supported by
       the General Directorate of Financial Administration. It will have the responsibility on the
       operation and supervision of the community health financing scheme. It will
       progressively take on the purchasingfunction of the M O H in the rest of the country (non-
       targeted SILAIS). Its operating cost will be partially financed by the SWAP funds in a
       phased-out manner.
       SILAIS in the targeted departments will have the responsibility to formulate and monitor
       service contracts and performance agreements with private and public providers for the
       delivery of the PBHS.
       Corporate management agreements (convenios de gestidn): These are the purchasing
       instruments between the M O H and SILAIS inthe targeted areas, by which the capitation
       transfers o f the community health financing scheme are allocated. They will also include
       the investment and capacity-building plans necessary to implement the SWAP at local
       level.
       Performance agreements: These are administrative tools, already implemented by the
       MOHnation-wide, signedby SILAIS and the institutional providers (municipios and
       hospitals). They will contain provisions related to the implementation of the PBHS in
       those localities, as indicated in Annex 4.
       Service contracts: These contracts will be similar in content to the management
       agreements but will be entered into with private providers and be legally binding.The
       tendering procedures will be in accordance with the administrative requirements for
       third-party purchases of services under the GON laws.

described above:

Capacity Constraints

The main capacity issues concern: (i) MOH's financial management capacity to oversee the
                                               the
disbursement of SWAPfunds; and (ii) capacity of the SILAIS and governments of the
                                                 the
Autonomous Atlantic Regions to efficiently absorb, administer and monitor SWAP funds. The
MOHhas made substantial progress inenhancing its capacity inthis regard through the
development of the Financial Administration Information System (SIGFA).A financial
management and procurement capacity assessment of the MOHcentral offices and the involved
SILAIS has been done as part of the preparation stage. Strengthening plans have been outlined
and will be devised inmore detail and implemented accordingly.

               Annex 7: FinancialManagement and DisbursementArrangements
          NICARAGUA: Health Services Extensionand Modernization (2nd APL)

Introduction

The financial management(FM)arrangementsand action plancontained here take into account the
findings of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the results of a preparation
missionto the Ministry of Health (MOH), the results of the financial management assessment, and
discussions with Government officials from MOH, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MOF), the
Secretariat of Strategy and Coordination of the Presidency (SECEP), and representatives of various donor
agencies.

The basic premise of the Nicaragua Health FMarrangementsis that these will be based on the GON's
public financial management systems and procedures, with additional safeguards where needed.
Accordingly, the sectorial arrangementspresented here fall under the umbrella of the overarching GOY'S
public financial management modernization plans (i.e., the Plan de Accio'n Gubemamental "PA,")        and
the correlated policy dialogue with the donor community (e.g., the Performance Assessment Matrix under
discussion with the Budget Support Group).

FromJanuary 20 to 28,2004, a mission visited Nicaragua to perform the assessment of the financial
managementcapacity of the executing agency in relation to the proposed Health Services Extensionand
Modernization SWAP. The proposed project is to be implementedby the Ministry of Health (Ministerio
de Salud -MOH) in Nicaragua. The financial management assessment was designed to ensure that the
executing agency has in place an adequatefinancial management structure, keeps adequate automated
accounting records, has the requiredcapacity and strong internal controls in place in order to ensurethat
they will manage the funds appropriately and efficiently.

On the basis of the assessment performed, the following broad conclusions were reached:

    (i)      Overall, M O H has considerably improved its financial management with a reorganization of
             the administration and finance unit and the implementation of the Government's integrated
             financial management system.

    (ii)     Therefore, assuming that M O H carries out the proposed action planpresented inthis
             assessment, especially with regards to staffing, it would have in place adequatefinancial
             managementarrangementsthat meet the Bank's minimumfiduciary requirements to manage
             the specific financial activities of the proposed SWAP.

Commonfiduciary framework

The MOHhas agreed with a group of Donors on a health sector-wide approach where external assistance
would be provided through a virtual Health Sector Support Fund(FONSALUD). Inconnection with the
FONSALUD, a common fiduciary framework (CFF) is being developed.

A CFF may significantly reduce transaction costs of meetingthe diverse requirements of donors;
however, CFF procedures can impose transaction costs of their own, which raises the need for a simple
and gradual approach. In a first stage, it i s likely (and recommended) that the CFF will be adopted by a
limitednumberof Donors. With their focus on country systems, the FMarrangements for the use of IDA
proceedshave been designed as a basis for a CFF.




                                                        69

ImplementingEntity

As outlined inthe Code of Conduct, andthe already drafted MOU, the executing entity for the proposed
health SWAP will be M O H (Ministerio de Salud) with oversight by the Office of the Minister of Health.
The Mesa Sectorial de Salud (MS)comprised of all cooperating agencies in the health sector and all the
health-related government agencies will be the principal forum for cooperation, information exchange and
dialogue for the overall health sector development. MOH and all the SWAP partners will constitute a
Coordinating Committee in charge of overseeing the planning and execution of the FYP and its annual
action plans, and reviewing periodically (at least biannually) the attainment of its targets. Technical
support and internal coordination within M O H will be provided by a SWAP Technical Secretariat
attachedto the MOH's Department of Planningand Development. The director of the technical secretariat
will be appointed by the Health Minister, under TORS,employment conditions and appointment subject
to approval by all the SWAP partners.

M O H is responsible for formulating policies relating to the health sector in Nicaragua, and coordinating,
executing and evaluatingprograms related to the protection, prevention and improvement of the health
status of the Nicaraguan population. M O H is divided into 53 executing units, including 17 SILAIS
(SistemasLocales de Atencidn Integral en Salud) and 33 hospitals. Inaddition, M O H is divided into 9
divisions, includingthe General Administration and Finance Division (Direccidn General Administrutiva
Financiera or DGAF) and the PlanningDivision (Direccidn General de Panijkacidn y Desarrollo). The
PlanningDivision will be responsible for overall technical execution of the program, and the
Administration and Finance Division will be responsible for the financial and administrative
management.

Therefore, MOH, through the DGAF,will have overall financial and accounting responsibility for the
proposed SWAp, including (i)    maintenance of accounting records, (ii)  preparation of project financial
statements in accordancewith national and World Bank guidelines, (iii)     management of bank accounts,
(iv) preparation and submission of quarterly FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs) produced by the
SIGFA, and (v) preparation and submission of withdrawal applications.

Staffing

As described above, the proposed programwill be implementedby MOH, and responsibilities for
financial management will be assignedto DGAF. Therefore, existing staff members within DGAFwill
play a role inthe financial management of the proposed program. The credit will finance qualified
incremental technical assistanceas requiredby the DGAF, such technical assistanceto be absorbed
gradually by MOH.

The Ministry has proposed to create aunit, within the DGAF,to manageexpenditures andbudget
execution of the SWAP(FONSALUD). This unit would include a Coordinator two Analysts and a team
of financial officers who will supervise financial management at the SILAI level and report directly to the
Manager of the Accounting Office. This unit would be responsible for reviewing expenditures of
FONSALUD, coordinating with MOF for disbursement purposes from FONSALUD,providingfollow-up
on budget execution, preparingperiodic financial reports and withdrawal applications for donors.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

The main FMnormative framework for the FONSALUD will consist o f (i)the Budget Regime Law,
which establishes procedures for the formulation, approval, and execution of the budget; (ii)         the Annual
Law of the General Budget of the Republic, which specifies the Revenue and Expenditure Budgets and
expands on the general rules laiddown inthe Budget RegimeLaw; (iii)             the annual Norms and Procedures
for Budget Execution and Control issuedby the MOF; and (iv) the manuals and rules developed under the
Integrated Financial Management System (SIGFA)program.

FMarrangementsspecific to FONSALUD that are not contemplated inthe regulations cited above will be
documented in a concise FMsection of the Operational Manual.

Budgeting
Duringthe second quarter of each year MOH, under the overall budget policy framework provided by the
MOF, will prepareFONSALUD's Investment Program for the next year. At the overall MOH's level of
investments, IDA funds should add to, rather than substitute for, domestic resources.

The Investment Programwill be presentedto the SECEP for its incorporation in the National Public
Investment Plan (PIP). The latter is subject to two levels of approval: (i)      the inter-ministerial Investments
Technical Committee (CTI); and (ii)     the GON's Economic Cabinet.

The approved Investment Programwill be incorporated into MOH's annual budget proposal.
FONSALUD expenditure items will be tagged.16 The healthbudget will be incorporated by the MOF into
the national budget for the President's submittal to the National Assembly in October. The Assembly
would approve the budget by December.

On the basis of the approved budget, MOH will adjust its annual work plan (POA/MOH), which includes
the annual work and procurement plan financed under FONSALUD (POA/FONSALUD). The latter will
be reviewedby IDA.



l6The GON's integratedfinancial management system (SIGFA) allows tagging of expenditures ("marcaje de
seguimiento de proyecto especifico") at different levels of expenditure classification.


                                                         71

Management agreements with Public Providers and Contracts with Private Providers (NGOs)
FONSALUD will support the transfer of community health financing scheme to SILAIS for the
expansion of coverage of the PBHS. A managementagreement will be established between M O H and
the SILAIS, with a specified list of activities andpayment amounts. A monitoring system will be
established to ensure contract compliance by programparticipants.

Information Technology (IT)Systems
Project funds will be captured in the Government's integratedfinancial management system(SIGFA),
utilized by MOH. There will, however, be a need for further cooperation with MOF for the purposes of
aggregating information from SIGFA on a component and category basis (for financial monitoringto the
Bank) and preparing withdrawal applications.

Safeguard over assets
Assets acquired usingproject funds will be inthe custody of the respective organizations. The accounting
system allows for tracking of assets purchased. Therefore, the asset register will be kept within MOH's
accounting system (SIMINSA). The amounts inthe register will be reconciledmonthly against the
respective account balances. And, at least one annual physical inspection of the assets will be undertaken
by M O H staff, preferable with the participation of external auditors.

Reporting and Monitoring

On a quarterly basis, MOHwill prepare and submit to IDA a FinancialMonitoringReport (FMR) for
FONSALUD containing: (i)      Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds (with expenditures classified by
subcomponent) and Cash Balances; (ii)    Statement of Budget Execution per subcomponent (with
expenditures classified by the Government's budgetary economic lines); (iii)     PhysicalProgressReport;
and (iv) Procurement MonitoringReport. The format for the FMR will be flexible enough to satisfy needs
of the Government, IDA and other Donors. An annex to the FMR would contain data specific to IDA
disbursements: (i) Special Account Activity Statement (including a copy of the bank statement); (ii)
Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures for Contracts subject to Prior Review; and (iii)
Summary Statementof Special Account Expenditures for Contracts Not subject to Prior Review. The
FMRs will be submitted to IDA no later than 45 days after the endof eachquarter.

On an annual basis, M O H will prepare Financial Statements for FONSALUD that will includecumulative
figures, for the year and as of the end of that year, of the financial statements cited inthe previous
paragraph, with the corresponding explanatory notes in accordancewith the Cash Basis Intemational
Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS), and MOH's assertion that credit funds were used in
accordancewith the intendedpurposes as specified in the Credit Agreement. These financial statements,
once audited, will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of the Government's fiscal
year (which coincides with the calendar year).

The supporting documentation of the quarterly and annual financial statements will be maintained in
MOH's premises and made easily accessible to IDA supervision missions and external auditors.

FundsFlow

IDA Disbursement method
Credit proceedswill be withdrawn on a quarterly basis under the report-based disbursement method.
Duringimplementation, MOHwill (a) sustain satisfactory FMarrangementsto be verified through
supervision missions, (b) submit FMRs consistent with the agreedform, content and due date, and (c)
submit acceptable audited financial statements by their due date. IfM O Hdoes not continue to meet these
criteria, the method will be changed to transaction-based disbursements only (provided the World Bank


                                                      72

does not suspenddisbursements because of non-compliance with the obligation to maintain an adequate
FMsystem). Underthe transaction-based disbursement method, the SOEthresholds would be consistent
with the procurement prior review thresholds.

IDA Special Account
Basedon MOF's preference, each donor fundingFONSALUD will have its own special deposit account.
Therefore, the MOF (through the Treasurer General) will open and maintain inthe Central Bank (BCN) a
special deposit account for IDA'Scontribution to FONSALUD, which will be co-managed by M O Hand
MOF, to be usedexclusively for deposits and withdrawals of credit proceeds for eligible expenditures.
After the conditions of effectiveness have beenmet, andthe special deposit account has been opened,
M O H will submit the first disbursement request (form 1903B) to IDA, together with the credit
expenditure forecast for the next six months. For subsequentwithdrawals, M O H will submit form 1903B
to IDA, along with the FMR for the quarterjust ended and the expenditure forecast for the subsequent six
months.

Flow of Funds (program disbursements),
Program disbursementswill be madeutilizingMOH's general disbursement procedures. Therefore,
programdisbursements will be made either through direct payment from MOF, or through MOH's
revolving fund. For major expenditures, upon receipt of a request from MOH, MOF will execute
payments out of the national Treasury Single Account (CUT). For minor expenditures, M O H will
execute payments out of its revolving fund mechanism.

On a weekly basis, MOF will verify the amounts spent under the FONSALUD budget lines, which i s
possible as SIGFA produces real-time data on budget execution. On the basis of expenditures incurred
during the period and the percentage applicable to IDA financing of FONSALUD, MOF will reimburse
the CUT from the Special Account. Inother words, withdrawals from the Special Account will be to
cover expenditures pre-financed out of the CUT.

Paymentsunder Component 1will be made in accordance with the provisions of the management
agreementsbetween M O H and SILAIS (such provisions to be consistent with the Operational Manual
that has to be reviewed and approved by the Bank). Montly pro-rated payments to SILAIS will be made
inaccordance with the agreednumber of beneficiaries times the average adjusted per capita premiumin
that SILAIS. Inthe event of significant underperformance, any unusedbalance will be deducted from the
subsequent payment, or, if it occurs at the end of a contract period, it will be refunded. The costing
mechanism will be documented in the Operational Manual and reviewed on an annual basis.

Certain minor expenditures under Component 2 will be paid for by the SILAIS under short-term advances
from M O H subject to reconciliation. Other payments will be managed centrally by MOH's Finance
Department.

Payments to foreign providers in foreign currency can be made directly out of the Special Account.

A new disbursement category (``convenios for SILAIS") has been created above as it does not fit any
traditional disbursement categoriesof the Bank (i.e. civil works, consultants, goods, training).

RetroactiveFinancing
The Bank would finance up to a maximum of US$ 1.0 million for eligible expenditures incurred after
March 1, 2005, but no more than one year from signing.

Audit

Internal Audit
Inthe course of its regular internalaudit activities vis-8-vis the institutional budget, MOH's Internal
Auditor may include FONSALUD activities in its annual work plan. M O H will provide IDA with copies
of internal audit reports covering FONSALUD activities and financial transactions. However, since
MOH's internal audit department's work plan i s limited, for this program, the use of external independent
operational audits (as described below) will contribute to ensure that the resourcesare usedfor the
purpose intended.

External Audit
The annual FONSALUD Financial Statements will be audited in accordancewith InternationalStandards
on Auditing(ISA), by an independent firm and in accordance with terms of reference (TORS)both
acceptableto IDA and the participatingDonors. New audit policy of the World Bank, documented in
"Guidelines: Annual financial reportingand auditing for World bank-financed projects" will be applicable
to the project, as it is appraised after July 1,2003. This means that interms of audit opinion on project
accounting records maintainedby the project, a single audit opinion covering: (i)program financial
statements, (ii)special account statement, and (iii)  adequacy of supporting documentation maintainedby
M O H in respect of expenditures claimed for reimbursement via report-based proceduresand eligibility of
suchexpenditures for financing under the respective Credit Agreement will be required.

In addition to the audit opinion, the auditors will have to present the managementletter, covering: (i)
weaknesses noted by the auditors in the internal control systems of the project, (ii) of application of
                                                                                        cases
inappropriate accounting policies and practices, (iii) issues regardinggeneral compliance with broad
covenants, and (iv) any other matters that the auditors consider should be brought to the attention of the
borrower.

In addition, operational audit reports (under ISRS 4400 "Engagements to perform agreed-upon
procedures regarding financial information") on the procedures followed in execution of FONSALUD
expenditures would be produced annually duringimplementation.

While the audit reports are to be issuedannually, the external auditors are expectedto perform at least one
review visit per quarter during the first two years of implementation, producing memoranda on internal
controls ("management letters") accordingly.

The audit work will be co-financed with credit proceeds.MOHwill appoint the external auditors within
three months after credit effectiveness. Each audit contract i s expected to cover at least two reporting
periods.

                                Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
           NICARAGUA: Health Services Extensionand Modernization(2nd APL)

1.      SUMMARY

An assessment of the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to implement procurement actionsfor the
proposed secondphase of the Nicaragua Health ModernizationProject (APL) was carried out between
January 24-28, 2005. The assessment reviewedthe organizational structure for implementing the project
and the interaction between the project's staff responsible for procurement and MOH's Department for
Administration and Finance. The assessment reviewed the four main components of the program, plus
operational costs.These components will require procurement of small civil works, consulting services
and goods.

Most of the issues/risks concerning the procurement component for implementation of the project have
been identified and include:


0   Inconsistencies between Law 323 and World Bank policies on (i)     registrationrequirements; (ii)
    evaluation systems; and (iii) consulting services;
0   Inconsistencies between IDB and World Bank policies on: (i)     eligibility; (ii)
                                                                                   thresholds for prior
    review; and (iii)  consulting services;
    Weaknessesin the internal and external auditing system;
0   Weaknessesin technical specifications, terms of reference, and contract management; and
0   Needfor additional qualified staff to manage project procurement.

The corrective measures agreedupon will be includedin a fiduciary memorandumof understanding, and
include:


0   Review by SWAP Partners of the annual procurement plan and quarterly updates;
0    Outline for the use of ICB and NCP systems;
0   A capacity plan funded by the Pool Fundto strengthenprocurement procedures, reporting and audit,
     and staff skills; and
0   Addition of qualified staff.

With these measuresin place, the overall project riskfor procurement i s average.

2.      PROCUREMENT CAPACITY

The HealthPlanningand Development General Directorate (DGPD) will be the starting purchasingentity
for the SWAPfunded expansion of services, until the MOH sets up a devoted purchasing unit within its
formal structure. This office will purchase services from public and private providersto achieve the
expansion of services objectives with the SWAPdefinedfunds. It i s also the MOH's intentthat the
purchasingunit to be created will gradually take over the purchasing of heath services throughout the
country using MOH resourcesthrough the annual management agreement signed with all SILAIS, local
providers and national hospitals.

Within MOH's General Directorate for Management and Finance, the Procurement Unit (Divisi6n de
Adquisiciones de Bienes y Servicios, PU) i s responsible for the acquisition of goods, services and works
for the Ministry and its depending administrative entities. The PUis responsible for managing, using
national procedures, all procurement of goods, services and works. Of the total purchases, approximately


                                                     76

50 percent is financed from the national budget. Untilrecently, procurement for World Bank and IDB-
funded projects was managedby Project ImplementationUnits (PIUs) under each MDB's Guidelines,
procedures and SBDs.Thereafter, a recently approved IDBLoan NI-Ll001 (Improving Maternal and
Child Health) charged the PU with the responsibility to manage procurement albeit usingIDB's
procurement guidelines. These transactions are also captured in the annual procurement plan.

The PUcurrently has a staff group of 1Director and 5 procurement officers. The current PUstaffing level
i s insufficient to managethe workload identified in the program. To meet the demands of the proposed
SWAp, it is estimated the PUwill needa complement of 5 to 9 additional procurement officers. The PU
i s in a process of restructuringits organization. Organization, functions and accountabilities of the PU's
staff needto be defined in an organizational/operational manual with individualjob profiles and
description for each of the required positions.

3.        RISK ASSESSMENT AND MEASURES

A numberof efficiencies can be achievedthrough the proposed pooled fundmechanism. The pooledfund
will reduce the number of differing procurement procedures demandedby donors and, in so doing, will
enable the P Uto better plan and consolidate procurement to achieve economies of scale. The review of
the annual Procurement Plan and quarterly updates, coupled with provisions for prior review of proposed
high riskhaluetransactions, a capacity plan procurement to strengthen procedures, and reporting and
audit, to be included in the Fiduciary MOU, will reduce the risk for the PooledFundPartners to support
the proposed SWAp.

The SWAPPartners and GONauthorities agreed on the following to organize procurement processes and
transactions under the SWAp:

      1. All the purchasesand procurement processes, except those expressly delegatedto the SILAIS,
           will be centralized and conducted by the MOH's PU.
      2.   Purchases of goods, works and consulting services financed with resourcesprovided by donor
           agencies will be procuredeither following IDB-WBGuidelines or Law 323, depending upon the
           economies of scale and the threshold levels of the specific transactions.
      3.   Law 323 permits exceptions when procurement i s subject to an agreement with a foreign
           government or internationalorganization. The Fiduciary M O U would constitute such an
           agreement.
      4.   Weaknessesin the application of the regulatory and operational framework, including human
           resources, management systems, and audits, will be addressedin the Fiduciary M O U between
           the SWAP Partners as follows:

           Weakness Identified                                  Mitigation Measures
  Legal and Regulatory Framework.        MOU will require that procurement be conducted by the PUas
                                         follows:

                                               For ICB

                                                   For goods and works, the procurement processes will
                                                   be conducted using the recently approved and
                                                   harmonized WB-IDB procurement guidelines, and the
                                                   corresponding harmonized SBDs, to allow for inter
                                                   alia eligibility o f foreign supplierdproviders as per
                                                   Bank policies. This will require to iron out a few
                                                   differences in the current master SBDs, and to review

                                        Health) as follows: (i) lower the threshold for goods
                                        from 350K (too high for Nicaragua) to a level to be
                                        definedafter a quick review of the market and recent
                                        bids (the current WB threshold is presently set for all
                                        projects at 150K), (ii)set a threshold for shopping
                                        procedures (the current threshold for Nicaragua is set
                                        in the Bank at 25K. IDB'sproject does not mention
                                        it).
                                        For consulting services, the selection processes will

                                        all contracts. Prior review of procedures will take
                                        place for all contracts above 200K. Below a 200K
                                        threshold, the use of short-lists made up of local
                                        consultants only may be authorized, add prior review
                                        will only take place for the first three contracts. Prior
                                        review of individual consultant procedures will take
                                        place for contracts above 50K.

          NICARAGUA: Health Services Extensionand Modernization(2nd APL)


A. Introduction

Inorder to improve healthresults inNicaragua, particularly among the poorest, The World Bank
and the Government o f Nicaragua are inthe process of preparing the second phase of the Health
Reform Program. The strategy for attaining better health results for the target population will be
based on the achievement of higher levels of efficiency, effectiveness, equity and sustainability
by the Nicaraguan institutions that provide health services.

Financing for this new phase has also undergone changes, evidenced by the set up of a common
fund and the adoption of a common strategic approach-known as a SWAp, or SWAP-with six
different donors from the international &operation partners. Duringthe period 2005-2009, this '
fundwill provide the necessaryresources, along with those provided by the Ministry of Health,
to pursue the above mentioned objectives.

The intervention strategies for this second phase are divided inthree main themes: (i)   the
extension of coverage of basic health and nutrition services in the poorest areas of the country,
through the establishment and strengthening o f the new service provision model, (ii)   integration
and strengthening of the healthservices network, with special emphasis on maternal-child health,
through the provision of a basic healthservices package in selected geographic areas of the
country and, (iii)strengthening the Ministry o f Health's institutional capacity inthe following
areas: purchasingof services, monitoring and evaluation, governing and administration capacity
of the ministry's decentralized units and supporting the growing independence of the
autonomous governments of the Atlantic coast.

The intervention strategies set forth in the SWAp, are consistent with the goals established in the
2004-2015 National Health Policy and the Five-Year Health Plan established by the Ministry of
Health (MOH). As such, the starting point at the health reform program has been identified as
the need to establish coordinating mechanisms within institutions as well as across the different
international cooperation funds in order to effectively confront structural health problems in the
most vulnerable population.

This document contains the economic and fiscal analysis results for the second phase of the
Health Reform Project. The analysis examines the investment return and fiscal impact that such
disbursements will have over the public finances o f the Government of Nicaragua.


B. Assumptions of the Analysis

The economic analysis starts with the adoption o f a series of assumptions, about the strategies,
interventions and goals established in the SWAp. The analysis' most important assumptions are
described below:

1.Population covered:Theproposed interventionswill focus onthe highriskSILAIS and
municipalities that were identified in a socio-demographic analysis conductedby MOH, in
combination with analysis that was carried out as part of the evaluation of the 1997-2002
National Health Policy. The targeting was based on vulnerability criteria using several
indicators: three health status measures, average per capita household income and geographical
access. Combining this analysis with estimates of the resources expected to be available to M O H
from both national and international sources, resulted inthe identification of 12 SILAIS and 79
municipalities, presented in the table below, that will be prioritized in the interventions.

According to official 2005 statistics, there are 3.3 million inhabitants inthe 12target
departments, 2 million of whom live in the 79 prioritized municipalities. It i s estimated that the
SWAP will extend coverage to 470,000 beneficiaries, including 235,000 women of reproductive
age, 188,000 children under 5 years of age and 47,000 youth and adults who are regarded as
particularly vulnerable to the area's prevailing diseases which are included inthe Basic Health
Services Package (PBS).

2. Temporal horizon: While SWAP interventions cover a total of 5 years, the impact of project
interventions will be for considerably longer. So as to be consistent with the economic analysis
of similar health projects the time horizon of the analysis will be 10years.

3. Discount rate: A discount rate of 12percent i s used for discount of total benefits generated by
the project. Two alternative scenarios are considered with 10 and 8 percent rates. A 10percent
rate i s normally used inWorld Bank-evaluated projects, which represents the investment
opportunity cost o f project resources. Lower discount rates of course mean that the income
flows from future earnings will be greater. For example, a 3 percent rate has been proposedby
the World Health Organization to discount future income flows received by people whose lives
have been saved, (Murray and Lbpez, 1994).

4. Direct benefits: The analysis considers four types of direct benefits associated with project
interventions: (i)reduction in patient-days as a result o f primaryhealth levels' effective
                  a
functioning, (ii) an increase in outpatient surgery for certain causes that can be treated under
these procedures, (iii) a reduction inintra-hospital infections and, (iv) the savings generated as a
result of improved efficiency of the M O H resulting from decentralization.

(i)Reductioninpatient-days. Oneofthemajorexpectedbenefitsofestablishing theIntegral
Health Treatment Model (MAIS) i s the reduction of certain diseases currently treated in hospitals
because of the ineffectiveness o f reference and counter-reference systems. Treatment o f diseases
inhospitals causes an unnecessary increase incost, which canbe averted by strengthening and
improving the efficiency of primary health care. The most important diseases that can be treated
at the primary level and that will produce the majority o f such savings are: intestinal infections,
acute respiratory infections, malnutrition and perinatal causes.

(ii)Increaseinoutpatientsurgery. Someofthesurgicalproceduresthat arecurrently
performed on an inpatient basis can be safely and more efficiently conducted on an ambulatory
basis. This will generate cost savings in the health system. The most important conditions that
will be targeted for being transformed into ambulatory care cases are: tonsillitis, surgical
contraceptive treatment, detached retina, palm fibrosis, renal arteriovenous fistula, hallux valgus,
hemorrhoids, hernia, slipped disk, knee instability, meniscus, joint stiffness, vocal chords tumor,
bladder tumor and peripheral venous bypass.

(iii)Reductioninhospitalinfections.Promotingbetterhospitalhealthcaremanagement-in
particular, improving hygienic conditions and the quality o f hospital services-will allow a
reduction of intra-hospital (nosocomial) infections inNicaraguan hospitals.




                                                  83

(iv) Savings due to improvements in the decentralization process. Efficiency in the use of
resources will allow the Ministry of Health to save costs. Development of contracting capacity,
improvement of supplies system, improvement in equity of resources, etc. arejust a few of the
proposed actions.

5. Indirectbenefits: Two types of indirect benefits are considered: (i) producedby the
                                                                          those
proposed nutrition interventions and, (ii)  the estimated number of lives saved by the Project.

Persons who are undernourished earn lower incomes throughout their economically active life.
When fewer persons suffer from global and severe malnutrition, their income earning capacity i s
increased. This increased income-earning capacity of the persons whose nutrition status i s
improved by the project can be estimated as the of future income flow, valued on the basis of
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita projected throughout the individual's work life and
translated inpresent value.

The reduction inmaternal and children under 5 mortality rates will reduce the number of deaths
inthese population groups. Savedlives will create an economic benefit that may be quantified
usingthe human capital method; an economic assessment of future income flow receivedby
these individuals, who willjoin or will continue to be part of the economically active population,
i s carried out.

6. Percentage of goal completion: Inthe case of benefits generated through the reduction inthe
rate of malnutrition and through direct benefits, it i s expected that benefits will accumulate
progressively according to the schedule presented in the table below.

7. Project investments and recurrent costs: The total financing of the SWAP is US$82.2
million, which will be disbursed over a period of 5 years inthe pattern shown inTable 3.

It is estimate that recurrent costs equal to roughly 20 percent of the investment in(only) the
infrastructure and equipment component and that these will be absorbed by the MOHonce
project investments are completed in 2009.

8. Use of real (as opposed to nominal) figures: All figures are inreal currency units (US$
dollars of 2004); therefore, the results presented here will not be effected by inflation.

9. Establishment of "without project" and "with project" scenarios: Two scenarios are
analyzed inestimating direct and indirect benefits: without project and with project. Inthe                                                           .
"without project" scenario the performance variables of interest are analyzed assuming rates of
improved experienced during the five-year period 1997-2002. Inthe "with project" scenario
estimates of changes are based on rates of change that will be needed to achieve the goals
presented inthe MOH's Five-Year Plan. The difference between these rates may be interpreted
as the savings generated by the project.

10. Conservativeestimate of benefits: Due to the difficulties inquantifying some of the
expected benefits, this analysis produces what should be regarded as minimumbenefit estimates
does not take into account all possible benefits (inparticular, it excludes any benefit attributable
to positive externalities the SWAP may produce). The economic analyses o f project's feasibility
should, therefore, be regarded as conservative, low-end estimates.

counter-referral systems, thereby better ensuring that ony cases requiring hospital care will be

treated at the hospital level. At the same time, the preventive character of many PBSS-proposed
interventions will allow a reduction in the number of patients who need to be treated at more
complex health levels.

The number o f discharges and average length of stay for intestinal infections, acute respiratory
disease, malnutrition and certain perinatal causes was estimated based on MOH's hospital
discharge databases.

Savings generated are estimated based on the reduction percentage of each cause, which
generates a reduction inhospital patient's length of stay, valued in monetary terms by the cost of
an inpatient day. Estimates indicate that the cost of one patient day i s US$35. It i s estimated
that the rates of reduction are: 40 percent for intestinal infections and acute respiratory and 30
percent for malnutrition and perinatal causes. It i s expected that benefits will be generated
gradually throughout the life of the project.

(ii)Increaseinoutpatientsurgery. Basedonthenumberofdischargesforeacheachofthese
procedures, it is estimated number of procedures that are currently conducted in hospitals but
that could be and that are expected to be performed after implementationof the MAIS on an
outpatient basis was identified. These include treatment o f tonsillitis, surgical contraceptive
treatment, detached retina, palm fibrosis, renal arteriovenous fistula, hallux valgus, hemorrhoids,
hernia, slipped disk, knee instability, meniscus, joint stiffness, vocal chords tumor, bladder tumor
and peripheral venous bypass.

The savings that are expected to be generated by providing these procedures on an ambulatory
basis i s calculated as the difference between total patient-days currently generated versus the
final number of patient-days as a result of the project's actions, and assuming that conducting
these surgeries on an ambulatory basis would require exactly a one day stay.

(iii)Reductioninhospitalinfections. Infectionsacquiredduringhospitalizationresultina
significant increase inpatients' length of stay. Reducing the intra-hospital infection rate results in
averting the costs of unnecessary additional days of inpatient care. In estimatingthe SWAp's
economic benefits, these averted additional inpatient days are valued at their average actual cost
per day.

(iv) Savings due to improvements in the decentralization process. Many local facility level
problems can be resolved by investingin strengthening decentralization. Presently, many
resources are lost or are inefficiently useddue to a lack of local capacity to administer them
properly. Proposed intervention through the project includes areas such as: improvements inthe
management and coordination processes, institutional strengthening to improve service delivery
and support of local level planning and budgeting processes thar are at the heart of the
decentralization process. Savings equivalent to 1percent o f MOH's current budget are expected
as a result of these reforms.

                                         c.2 INDIRECTBENEFITS


The project's indirect benefits are related to the potential life years saved by the project and the
economic and financial value of highest productivity reached. The economic assessment of
additional lives i s calculated as the potential number of life years for each child and mother
saved, multiplied by the real Nicaraguan GDP and accumulated over the expected duration of the
economically active life of those individuals.

After defining the key elements of the methodology employed, the primaryquantitative results
obtained in the economic analysis are presented.



D. Mainresults

The health project's proposed interventions generate a net economic benefit o f US$67 million, in
present value terms, throughout the project's 10-yeartemporal horizon. Out o f total generated
benefits, 87 percent represent indirect benefits interms of maternal and child lives saved and 13
percent direct benefits. Main results attributable to the project are presented in the following
table.

The internalrate of return of the SWAPis 54 percent, which exceeds the 12percent discount
rate. Inother words, other possible alternative uses of the project's investments would obtain 12
percent versus 54 percent generated by investing in the proposedhealth interventions.

When alternative discount rates are employed, the project generates even higher net benefits,
reaching a maximum of US$92 million when using an 8 percent discount rate. This project's

cost benefit ratio i s approximately 2, which implies US$2 inbenefits per dollar investedinthe
project.

Previous results provide ample evidence to declare the project economically feasible, by virtue of
its high return. However, the following section presents an analysis of alternative scenarios, in
order to evaluate the sensitivity of the rate of return to changes in some of the Project's critical
assumptions.



E. Sensitivityanalysis

Sensitivity analysis allows investigating the robustness of the results by introducing changes in
some of the assumptions underlying the estimates, such as possible delays inproject execution or
reductions in the estimated level of benefits. Parameters examined in the sensitivity analysis are:
(1) a two- and three-year dela) in execution, (2) 20 and 40 percent reductions in the eipected
level of benefits, and (3) a combination of scenarios with a proposed 20 percent benefit reduction
and two- and three-year delay inproject implementation. The main results generated in net
present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are presented in the following tables.

The project would bejustified in any of the proposed scenarios, but with significant reductions in
the internal rate of return and the present value of benefits.

Inthe case of a 2 or 3-year maximumdelay inproject implementation, the internal rate of return
would go from 54 percent to a minimumof 28 percent, and the present value o f net benefits
would fall from US$67 million to US$15 million.

Ifreductions inthe amount of benefits attributableto the project take place, the IRRwould be
reduced to 20 percent, which would still exceed the 12 percent discount rate used. The net


                                                      88

present value of expected net benefits would be US$12 million, which implies a more than 80
percent reduction in such category.

A combination of previously considered scenarios constitutes the most extreme case in terms of
project sensitivity. If 20 percent reduction inbenefit flow takes place and project
                      a
implementation i s delayedby 3 years, the internal rate of return would be 15 percent, slightly
higher than the one used to discount economic flows and the NPV of net benefits would be
substantially reducedbut would still total US$2.7 million.



F. Fiscalimpact and sustainability

Inaccordance with conductedestimates and established disbursement flows, the fiscal impact of
this project would be quite mild.Recurringproject costs, to be assumedby M O H after the
SWAPdisbursements are completed, represknt an average of 3 percent of the Ministry's
projectedexpenditures.




                                               89

The costs represent nearly 4.5 percent o f the MOH's current recurrent expenditures. Total
project cost througliout the project's 10-year temporal horizon remains less than 10percent of
MOH's projectedtotal expenditures, and 15percent of the Ministry's recurrent expenditures. As
a percentage of GDP, project costs represent a relatively small amount that does not exceed 1
percent of GDP, which, together with cost flow analyses, benefits and profitability, make the
Project not only viable, but an attractive option, from an economic perspective.

           NICARAGUA: Health Services Extension and Modernization (2nd APL)

The World Bank i s supporting the Government of Nicaragua (GON) on the preparation of the "Health
Services Extension and Modernization 2"dAPL -SWAP". The operation aims at improving the
efficiency, effectiveness and equity of the Nicaragua health system. These objectives will be supported
through activities concerning the strengthening of the first level of care, modemization of the hospital
network, developing institutional capacity and supporting the social security reforms.

This project is expected to lead Nicaragua to an improvement of current conditions of the health sector,
through its expansion and modernization, which will lead to an increment inthe production of health care
waste, and the generation of environmental impact in areas where remodeling activities will take place.
This operation is a category B with minor and reversible environmentalimpact. In order to fulfill the
requirements of the Bank and better support the preparation of this operation, the GON has prepared a
standaloneEnvironmental AsSessment which addresses:a general objective; a methodology, for the
assessment; existing legal framework and legislation in NicaraguaregardingHealth Care Waste
Management (HCWM); an institutional framework; current practices to handle HWC; a baseline
assessment on the existing facilities and their practices on HCWM; and a proposalto improve the
managementof HCW, indicators, strategiesfor implementingthe HCWM plan, didactic materials,
environmental mitigation measures, conclusions, schedule, budget and bibliography.

According to the LCSES- QAT review, this operation triggers the following safeguard policies:
Environmental Assessment and Indigenous People. In order to comply with the requirements of these
polices, the GON has preparedthe Standalone Environmental Assessment and an Indigenous People Plan.

                                ENVIRONMENTALASSESSMENT(EA)

As described above, the EA contains several chapters which address all aspects of HCWM and a set of
activities and procedures to manage the environmental impact generatedby the construction, renovation
or expansion of existing facilities.

The objective of this EA is to perform an assessment of current HCWM environmental conditions inthe
hospitals and centers participatingin this project. The HCWM plans would be applicable where the Bank
i s supporting any of the activities mentioned in the project design. Once the sites and the projects are
identified,the guidelines proposed in the EA will be implemented. A summary of the EA report will be
part of the Operational Manual.

The Health Care Waste Management Plan

The proposed HCWMplan includes a general backgroundwith information on HCWproduction, which,
according to latest estimates, is about 1.43 kilograms/bed/day.

Currently, the comprehensive legal framework to address HWC includes:

Decree No. 35, 1979, Ley del sistema Nacional de Salud; Decree No. 70, 1979, Ley sobre exportacidn de
produccidn farmace`uticos y medicinales; Decree 432, 1989, Regulacio'n e Inspeccidn Sanitaria; Law 156,
1993, Ley sobre radiaciones ionizantes; Law 1168, 1994, Ley que prohibe el trdfico de desechos
peligrosos y sustancias tdxicas; Law 202, 1994, Ley de Prevencidn, Rehabilitacidn y Equiparacidn de
oportunidades para las personas con discapacidad.




                                                      91

Along with the above mentioned legislation, the GON has reported that the Ley de Municipios No 40,
1988, Ley 217, Ley General del Medio Ambiente y 10s Recursos Naturales, and the Ley General de Salud,
on its articles 55, 56,64, 65,66, 67, 68, and 69, all address the framework for Health Care Waste
Management inthe country. It was noticed on the analysis the relation of this regulatory framework with
the existing framework regarding solid waste managementat the municipal level, which contributes to
activities related to final disposal.

Current Situation of HealthCare Waste Management in Nicaragua

The Ministry of Health of Nicaragua has been working on the issue of Health Care Waste Management
since 1994, through technical cooperation and projects with the European Union, the IDBand the World
Bank. Results of this cooperation have been mixed. The plans were applied in 10out of a total of 33
hospitals. The main constraints faced by these institutions were with regards to maintenance and budget
allocation. Most of the hospitals acquired technically advancedtreatment facilities such as incinerators,
but due to the circumstances above stated, some of them are not operative.

The current operation is expectedto focus on improving the current HCWM systems and extending -but
not limiting- its coverage to up to 9 new institutions as follows: Hospital Victoria Motta, Jinotega;
Hospital Asuncih, Juigalpa; HOSPITAL Espaiia, Chinandega; Hospital Dr.Juan A. Brenes, Somoto;
Hospital LuisAlfonso MoncadaGuillCn, Ocotal; H.Nuevo Amanecer, RAAN; Hospital RegionalErnest0
Sequeira, RAAS; Hospital Luis Felipe Moncada, de San Carlos, Rio San Juan; Hospital Cesar Amador
Molina, Matagalpa; Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Gonzalez, Le6n; Hospital SanJuan de Dios, Esteli;
and Hospital JosC Nebrowski, Boaco.

The EA presentedby the GONfocused on HCWM and construction activity on the hospitals listedabove,
which will be part of the Bank's project, and will be disclosed according to Bank policy.

On the EA presentedby the GON, a site visit to the followinginstitutions i s reported:




                                                      92

NOC - Not in operating condition



As seen inthe previous analysis, the issuesconcerning HCWM are focused more on tools for the Plan's
implementation rather than on willingness from the hospital management to implement it. With this
operation, the GON expects to support the strengthening of current practices inorder to fulfill the
sector's needs.


The Health Care Waste Management Guidelines

The Ministry of Health (MOH) expects to implement the guidelines developed through technical
cooperation with the European Union. These guidelines include the following material: guidelines for
training and management of Health Care Waste (7 modules); a training video on H C W M best practices;
a manual for technicians and supervisors; a manual for doctors and nurses; a manual for General Services
Personnel; and a CD which includes all of the above.

The guidelines are basedon a survey conducted in 1996, followed by a second phase which contemplated
the following activities: development of a training program, definition of a management system, and
purchase of necessary equipment to be distributedwithin the participatinginstitutions. In2000, four
additional hospitals (Victoria Mota, Jinotega; Cesar Amador, Matagalpa; Luis Felipe Moncada, Rio San
Juan; Nuevo Amanecer, Puerto Cabezas) were included in the HCWM program.

The guidelines currently beingused by M O H address doctors, nurses, technical staff and MOH
supervisors. The document also contains guidelines to develop tailor-made plans for each institution
where the plans will be applied. The processto be supported by M O H i s the following:

Definition of General Objective and implementation of a working group: there should be an intemal
group at the hospital level to develop and implement the HCWMplans. This committee should account
for the organizational and structural definitions of responsibilities at every level of attention, should be
multidisciplinary, and the coordinator must have technical capacity to handle HCW. Responsibilities also
includecoordination between infirmaries, medical support, cleaning, maintenance and an epidemiologist.




                                                      93

The first activity of the committee is to perform a diagnostic of the current situation. The HCWM plan
will be designed based on thediagnostic, the guidelines and the existing legal framework inNicaragua.

The plan contains at least the following elements: determination of intemal responsibilities, definition of
the flow of operations andregulations regarding health care waste, coordinationof provision of human
and technical resources (procurement of equipment and supplies, personnel protection, etc). Also, the
committee has the responsibility to implement and coordinate the plan and control and monitor its results.
There are other technical responsibilities regarding segregation, final disposal, informationto
communities and patients, risk assessment and management, which are part of the committee's
responsibilities. Also, the committee is responsible for maintaining the reports and files of HCWM.

As this project covers most of the Republic of Nicaragua, a strategy was specifically designedfor the
implementation of Health Care Waste Management Plans. This strategy calls for progressively including
in the fiscal year budgetthe resourcesrequired to support the implementationof HCWM plans,
specifically: allocate own funds to handle HCW; sign technical cooperation agreementswith the major's
offices to manipulate and di8posetreated HCW in specific sites -previously agreed and under safety
conditions- at the sanitary landfills; include standardsfor accomplishments of HCWMplans inthe
accreditation and certification plans. Also, pursingsustainability of the system, explore the possibility, in
hospitals where the incinerator is in operating condition, to offer treatment services to other similar
facilities intown. As supporting documentation, it was noticedthat the following documents also contain
some steps to enhance HCWMpractices in Nicaragua: Esta'ndarespara la Habilitacidn de
Establecimientos de Salud; Esta'ndares de Habilitacidn de ClinicasMe'dicasProvisionales; Esta'ndares
de Habilitacidn de Hospitales en Nicaragua; and Esta'ndares de Habilitacidn de Centros de Salud en
Nicaragua.

Inorder to ensurethe quality of implementation of this component, the GONhasproposed a set of
indicators which will measurethe performance of M O H and the beneficiary hospitals with regardsto
HCWM. Also, these indicators will be the basis for reviewing the compliance of this operation with the
Bank Environmental Assessment Policy. These indicators were proposed by the GON and will be
supervised duringthe life of the project:

Environmental rules for contractors

The guidelines developed by the GON address all the needs of the minor works requiredand supported by
this operation. These guidelines include the following general aspects:

Consideration of aspects such as ventilation, natural and artificial light energy efficiency, historical and
cultural considerations, and security and handicapped access. Also, floor space (ft2)per bedward,
requirements for x-ray rooms, and adequacy of corridors for wheelchairbed access. Moreover, waste
management, maintenance, stockpiles and borrow pits, site cleanup, safety during construction, nuisance
and dust control, community relations, chance find procedures for culturally significant artifacts, and
environmental supervision duringconstruction. More details can be found inthe EA presented by the
GON.

                   SOCIALAND INDIGENOUSPEOPLEPLAN(OD4.20)

As part of project preparation, the project team visited several municipalities throughout the
country, including the Regional Governments of RAANand RAAS, and interviewed with
SILAIS, hospital staff and other health care providers and users. The team also interviewed
Health Councils to discuss their Health Plans in the context of the National Health Plans and the
National Health Law.

The social assessment reviewed the evaluations and studies carried out to assess the 14programs
under the Health Modernization Programof the Ministry of Health (PMSS) since 2001. It
reviewed the evaluation results of the Women's Centers created under the Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan (IPDP) for the PMSS, and corroborated the widely- recognizedpositive
results. Moreover, a Social Feasibility study was carried out b y a local independent firm (ALVA
Consultants) in a selected sample o f 15 municipalities in 7 departments: Jinotega, RAAN,
RAAS, Rio San Juan, Madriz, Chontales and Nueva Segovia. The sample municipalities &e
among the 90 municipalities selected by M O H for installation of Women's Centers; they are
among the poorest and more isolated municipalities inthe country; they have highmaternal-
infant mortality rates; and they have access to a health care provider with surgical facilities (Le.
hospital, clinic, health center with beds present or future recipient of the FONMAT program).

The study included four parts: first, 15 Social Feasibility workshops were carried out in selected
municipalities with the purpose o f introducing, discussing, and seeking agreements for the
creation of 15 new Women's Centers to be managed by their own communities. Cooperation was
sought and agreed with the SILAIS, hospital or healthcenter, or health organization supported by
FONMAT, the Municipal Government, local NGOs, public institutions, private organizations,
Women's Groups, etc. and with the support of the local networks of midwives and health
promoters. Second, an assessment o f users' satisfaction of existing Women's Centers was also
conducted inBilwi, Bluefields, Matagalpa and El Rama. Third, an assessment of perceptions of
satisfaction among health care service users was carried out through a survey of 720 users and
non-users of public primary health care services. Fourth, a similar survey was applied to 150
hospital patients to assess their satisfaction with hospital services, their knowledgehse of social
controls installedby M O H andtheir recommendations towards the promotion of social auditing
mechanisms. Finally, interviews were carried out to assess the coordination among the three
levels in 15 municipalities: PHC, hospitals and Women's Centers.

The results of the Assessment and Feasibility Study were presented to the Regional Governments
of M A N and RAAS in December 2004.

The 1998 IPDPfor the Health Modernization Project called for the creation of Women's Centers
in 10municipalities serving IndigenousandAfro-Nicaraguan population mostly on the Atlantic
Coast, Jinotega and Central region of Nicaragua. The present assessment evaluated users'
satisfaction infour Women's Centers with positive results. Several evaluations of Women's
Centers carried out between 2001-2003 corroborate the reduction of maternal and child mortality
rates and highcost-effectiveness. The creation o f 90 new Women's Centers i s part of the
National Health Plan for Nicaragua.

2. Demographic profileof Nicaragua

Eleven percent o f the Nicaraguanpopulation (out of a total of 5.6 million inhabitants) self-
identify as indigenous and conserve their native languages. The majority of indigenous peoples
belong to five Atlantic Coast groups: Miskito, Mayangna, Garifuna, Creole (Afro-descendants)
and Rama who live in 300 communities of the Atlantic Coast and 15 communities of the
Department of Jinotega and the Central Plateau of Matagalpa. Nearly half of the inhabitants of
the Atlantic Coast at present are `mestizos'. The indigenous peoples inthe mentioned regions
live in extreme poverty conditions with scarce basic health, education, water and sanitation
services. Their living conditions have deteriorated inthe past decade due to the invasion of
colonos, degradation of natural resources in an unsustainable way, open-air miningand over
exploitation of marine resources. On the Pacific Coast, the largest indigenous group i s the
Sutiaba in the Departments o f Le6n and Chinandega. Other groups include the Nahuas, Nicaraos
and Chorotegas who live along the coastal departments of Madriz, Nueva Segovia and
Chinandega.


3. Main recommendationsof the SocialFeasibility Study and Assessment of perceptionsof
satisfactionamong usersof public health care services

    (1) Attention should be paid to traditional and intercultural medicine since people are
        combining both on a daily basis. This subject i s of highpriority inthe Regional Health
        Plans.
    (2) Strengthen local networks o f midwives, MOH and traditional health promoters. Educate
        themto identify, refer, accompany and monitor women inneed of pre and post-natal care;
        small children suffering from URI and diarrheic infections; and men, women and youths
        at risk of HIV/AIDS. Equipthem with gear and access to transportation, to be efficient.
    (3) Although the topic of social control in the health sector i s a concern to the central level of
        the M O H and the Regional Health Councils, at present, the communities and health staff
        interviewed in the field are not aware o f or engaged in any plans for social
        auditingkontrol in the sector.

4. The Situation of the Autonomous Atlantic Regions and their Health Plans

Extensive consultations with civil society and other sectors at the community, municipal and
departmental levels were carried out inthe past two years in order to discuss the Regional Health
Plans for RAAN and RAAS. As part of the Plan, a Health Decentralization Commission that



                                                 97

includes the M O H and Regional health authorities was formed to oversee the decentralization
process. Likewise, Regional Health Commissions and Regional Municipal Commissions have
been formed. The Regional Communal Commissions are inthe process of formation.

A number of workshops and forums have been heldbetween the Regional Governments of
RAAN and the present Minister of Health for the definition of decentralization of political,
financial, administrative and operational power to the Regional Government and its Councils.
The Health Plans for RAANand RAAS are consistent with the National Health Plans for
Nicaragua. At present, the definition of the Health Planfor RAANi s more advanced than that of
RAAS. As part of project preparation, the M O H will finance the Diagnostic Study of Health in
RAAS and a definition of the main elements of a regional health policy.

The most important issuesrelated to the Autonomous Atlantic Regionhealth plans are:

(a) Legal Framework            '


The Health Law (Title 11, Chapter lV)warrants the Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast
the right to define their own health model according to their traditions, culture and costumes,
within the framework of policies, plans, projects and programs of the Ministry of Health. Under
the Health Law, the M O H will coordinate with the Regional Councils the management and
institutional models, as well as those requiredto promote decentralization, de-concentration and
delegation of responsibilities to those regions. The RegionalAutonomous Councils, on the other
hand, will be able to create their own health institutions for service administration and delivery,
within the framework o f autonomy and consistent with the national health policies, norms and
procedures.

Law No. 28 warrants the Autonomy of the Northern and Southern Atlantic Coast Regions
(RAANand RAAS). This law was approved by Congress inOctober 1987 but its Operational
Guidelinesbecame effective in 2003. Under Law No. 28, Decentralization of Administrative
responsibility i s transferred from the Central Government to the Regional Government of the
Atlantic Coast. The law requires that the Regional Governments be involved inthe preparation,
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects implementedon the Atlantic
Coast of Nicaragua. The Law also requires that individuals integrating the Regional
Governments and Commissions have a pertinent profile and be trained in the necessary skills.

Other important legislationpertaining to autonomy are: Law No. 445 of Land Tenure and
Legalization and Law No. 162on the Protection and Preservation of native languages and the
teaching of Intercultural Bilingual Education.

(b) Administrationof Health Care

Prinzapolka i s the poorest municipality inthe country and 95 percent of its population
corresponds to Miskito Indians. It i s the only municipality, however, without a Municipal Health
Delegation on the Atlantic coast. At present it depends administratively on both Puerto Cabezas
and Siuna. The Regional Health Plans recommend the creation of a Municipal Health Delegation
and Council to attend the needs o f Prinzapolka.



                                                 98

The re-incorporation to the Atlantic Region of seven municipalities presently administered b y
Pacific Regions (Waslala and Mulukukuin MAN; and Paiwas, Nueva Guinea, El Rama, Muelle
de Bueyes and ElAyote in M A S ) i s high in the agenda of regional governments as fiscal
distribution of revenues to municipalities i s done on a per capita basis. The re-incorporation of
municipalities has already been done for the education sector, but the decision i s still pending for
the health sector. The total number of municipalities on the Atlantic coast i s 19. After the re-
incorporation i s implemented, the creatiodconstruction and equipment o f Municipal Delegations
will be needed, as well as training of its members.

(c) Financial Autonomy

Decentralization entails that the decisions concerning financial planning and implementationbe
made by the autonomous regions, rather than by the central government.

(d)Participation

Participation of the civil society through the Communal, Municipal and Regional Commissions
i s a salient principle of decentralization and autonomy. The councils represent the peoples for
makingdecisions regarding policy, planning and sharing of responsibilities.

(e) HumanResources

It is widely recognizedthat there are two major problems regarding human resources:

     (i)      Health professionals from the Pacific don't usually choose isolated regions.to live;
              however, they are often assigned there for medical residency, resulting in a high
              turnover of health staff;
     (ii)     Local health staff o f isolated regions who would like to work/live in those areas have
              a hardtime becoming M O H staff.

It i s therefore recommended that health workers graduating inURACCANor other universities
be given priority for M O H staffing inthe isolated areas o f their choice, which may contribute to
keep hospitals and health units staffed.

(f)Expansion Strategy of Primary Health Care servicesfor vulnerable groups

One of the strategies of the Health Plans i s the expansion of basic primary health services for
vulnerable populations through the creatiodimprovement of `subsedes' ,which were created to
strengthen nuclei of health posts serving indigenous and isolated communities. They don't exist
inthe present nomenclature of MOH. They are strategicallylocated to cover areas of difficult
access. Staff includes medical staff, nurses, information systems for monitoring diseases, lab
staff. They operate with energy from solar panels. Subsedes have basic equipment (stethoscope,
tension meter) for child delivery and minor surgery, 5 or 6 beds for patient recuperation,
transportation (boat or car) and communications. They assist a nucleus o f communities with
itinerant teams for vaccinations, and refer patients to bigger units and hospitals.



                                                    99

Ten subsedes have been created inthe past with the support of different foreign donors, to serve
Indigenous and Afro-Caribbean population. The two best-equipped subsedes are Bilwaskarma
and Santa Martha which act as independent service providers. They have a Cooperation
Agreement with M O H where the latter contributes with medical and nursing staff, information
systems and transportation, medicines, extension services and vaccination campaigns. Although
they have yielded successful results, they continue to have a low profile due to lack of financing.
The regional governments seek financial resources to strengthen their operation. At present, most
subsedes have medical staff but lack recuperation facilities, and means o f transportation and
communication.

(g) Strengthening of the traditional health care networks

Given the isolation and low density of population on the Atlantic Coast Region, access to public
health services i s much lower than in'the rest of the country. To compensate for the supply    '

deficit, traditional networks of traditional health agents such as midwives, health leaders
(promoters) and volunteer health workers, `sukias' and `curanderos' (traditional healers), play a
very important historical role inthe surveillance, promotion and supply of health care. They are
the pillars that support the health system inthe regions inhabited by Indigenous and Afro-
descendants. Studies find that more than 40 percent of child deliveries are done by traditional
midwives. Also, the Regional Health Councils calculate that over 20,000 health consultations are
made to traditional leaders by patients seeking health care. Moreover, the `Sukias' and
`curanderos' together with the Institute of Traditional Medicine of the University of URACCAN
(RAAN) are the healers responsible for providing health care to patients sufferingfrom what is
called "krisi siknis" and defined as a cultural-based psycho-somatic disease. According to the
Council, over 5,000 people were treated with that disease inthe past two years. Inmany cases,
activities of the traditional networks are coordinated with local M O H institutions, NGOs, the
coastal universities of URACCAN and BICU (RAAS) and international as well as national
donors (European Union, Doctors without Borders, Acci6n MCdica Cristiana, KEPA
(Norwegian), etc.).

Traditional healers and health volunteer workers are respected prestigious leaders who are held
responsible for the health of the community. They may do their work for free or charge a very
small fee mostly to cover transportation and nourishment. An important item in the Regional
Health Plans o f RAAN and RAAS i s the strengthening o f these traditional healers and volunteers
with training in safe health practices at the Institute of Traditional Medicine of URACCAN,
equipment, and a fee for transportation to deliver reports.

(h) Onthe Definition of the Basic Health Care Package for isolatedareas (PBHS)

A Diagnostic Study of the organization of health care services as prescribedby the Regional
Health Plan i s beingimplemented with the financial support of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB).The study should be completed inMarch 2005. Financing i s sought for a
consultancy to determine the elements of the Basic Health Care Package for the Autonomous
Regions (to include Intercultural Health Care).

Given past experience of extension of health care services to isolatedindigenous and Afro-
Caribbean communities, the Regional Health Care Plans contemplate strengthening of NGOs
which currently deliver said services.


5. Indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan Peoples and Gender Plan

Given the presence of Indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan Peoples in the project area, the proposed
project includes an Indigenous and Afro-descendant Peoples and Gender Plan intended to
include all those living in the regions inhabited by ethnic population. The planbelow results
from the joint consultations of M O H and World Bank with the Central and Regional
Governments, and seeks to respond in part to the Regional Health Plans being formulated. The
interventions included in the Plan below are suggestions made by the Regional Governments and
should be further discussed with the project team, ind the MOH.

The objectives of the Indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan Peoples and Gender Plan are:

    1. To ensure that the Indigenous andAfro-Nicaraguan Peoples within the project area
        benefit from the project in an equitable and culturally-adequate manner;
    2. To promote full and active participation of the indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan peoples,
        their Regional Governments, Regional Health Councils, leaders and authorities inthe
        project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the proposed project.


Recommendations

Given that the bulk of the Indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan population live inthe Atlantic Coast,
the following recommendations derive from the assessments and discussions with the Regional
Health Councils, and are suggested to be incorporated in the project design:

Component 1: Extensionof Access to the Basic Package of Health Services (PBHS) by the
poorestand most vulnerable populations

(a) Consultancy to determine the PBHS for the RAAN and RAAS (US$30,000)

(b) Contracting of private health care providers, particularly NGOs and mobilization of private
and public itinerant health care units, appropriately trained and equipped, to reach out to people
living in remote areas.

(c) Installationof 15 new community-managed Women's Centers in selected municipalities of
RAAN,RAAS, Rio San Juan, Jinotega, Madriz, Nueva Segovia and Chontales.
