The project\n            has the following three components: Component 1) a package\n            of basic health care services (PBHS), focusing on maternal\n            and child health, will be offered to the most deprived\n            population of Nicaragua. Vulnerable populations and\n            localities for the extension of coverage have been\n            identified based on the following criteria: current access\n            to health services, level of poverty, and health status.\n            Component 2) this component of the Sector Wide Approach\n            (SWAp) is designed to support the extension of coverage, and\n            to complement its Maternal-Child Health (MCH)-related\n            activities. Activities in this area are aimed at creating an\n            effectively structured and functioning referral system that\n            will provide a more complete continuum of MCH care to rural\n            communities, while increasing their access to secondary care\n            and improving the overall quality of health care. Component\n            3) the Ministry of Health (MOH) recognizes that to fulfill\n            the vision set forth in the National Health Plan (NHP) and\n            effectively lead the SWAp, it will need to undertake a\n            variety of institutional reforms."}, "docdt": "2005-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
