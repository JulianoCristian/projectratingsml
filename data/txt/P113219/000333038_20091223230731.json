{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Food Crisis Response\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Sierra Leone were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: it can be challenging to ensure the\n            establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system in the context of a crisis response\n            operation. In the context of Sierra Leone, the Government\n            and donors have a well established M&E framework to\n            assess the impact of policy reforms supported by budget\n            support provided by several donors. This framework operates\n            around pre-established timetables and outcome indicators and\n            it currently does not have the flexibility to respond to the\n            need for a rapid crisis response. However, inclusion of the\n            outcome indicators related to this operation in the broader\n            multi-donor budget support M&E framework could have\n            facilitated more regular and complete reporting of results.\n            This point to the need to introduce greater flexibility in\n            the multi-donor budget support M&E framework to allow\n            for the inclusion of policy actions and outcome indicators\n            addressing unforeseen shocks to preserve growth and poverty\n            reduction's longer term objectives. It will be\n            preferable to use an already standing monitoring committee\n            capable of delivering periodic progress reports rather than\n            envisaging the creation of a new technical committee. Also,\n            quarterly reports rather than monthly reports will have\n            provided sufficient information without unduly stretching\n            the government administration. There were advantages gained\n            from keeping the design of the operation simple and well\n            focused on the Government priorities, e.g. tariff reductions\n            and a narrowly defined action plan with well identified\n            outcome indicators. This helped ensure adequate\n            Government's response to the crisis given its limited capacities."}, "docdt": "2009-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
