Reform\n            Project for Tajikistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: For any project attempting\n            important reforms and restructuring in core government\n            operations, especially in a country with a highly\n            centralized decision-making process, the project must\n            involve high level government leadership during both project\n            preparation and implementation. There should be a single\n            project coordination unit, reporting to senior government\n            leadership (and not any one ministry), to oversee such a\n            broad cross government operation. In the absence of such\n            unit, in this case, functions were divided among the state\n            advisor on economic issues, the project director and the\n            Project Coordination Unit (PIU), which often affected the\n            timeliness of decision-making process. To be achievable, the\n            project development objectives should correspond to the\n            available funding and implementation timeframe. Bank\n            management should better ensure that political economy\n            assessments and lessons of earlier applicable operations be\n            incorporated into project design and not solely in Project\n            Appraisal Document (PAD) text. Avoid project activities\n            tangential to the core project concept. The project\n            supported reform in Sanitary-Epidemiology Service and Fire\n            Prevention Inspectorate. The survey conducted at project\n            close suggested that the reforms had reduced the\n            administrative burden on business. However, the reform might\n            have had a larger and more systemic impact by targeting the\n            development of regulatory capacity at the center of government."}, "docdt": "2012-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
