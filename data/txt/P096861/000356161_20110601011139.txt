                              Restructuring Paper

   1. This memo seeks approval for a four months extension of the closing date of the
      Public Sector Reform Project from June 1, 2011 to October 1, 2011. This
      would be the first extension of the Project. The Recipient request for a 4 months
      extension was sent to the Bank on May 12, 2011 (attached).

   2. The Project Development Objective is to establish legal and organizational
      prerequisites for improved public sector management, improve public access to
      legislation, and strengthen regulatory framework in selected areas. The Project
      consists of four components: (i) Civil Service Management; (ii) Supporting
      Implementation of Key Reforms under Public Administration Reform Strategy;
      (iii) Capacity Building in Budget Management; (iv) Capacity Building in
      Regulatory Management; and (v) Effective Management of Governance Reforms.

   3. To date, USD 5,187,088 out of a total of USD 5,538,750 (SDR 3.5 million) has
      been disbursed from the loan, accounting for 93.65 percent of loan proceeds. As
      of May 26, 2011, the current undisbursed balance of the loan account is USD
      351,661, which is due to delays in procurement of some activities. The
      undisbursed sum cannot be spent until the closing date.

Signed Amount                                                           5,538,750
Cancelled                                                                     0.00

Undisbursed                                                               351,661

Funds Available                                                           351,661
Percent Disbursed                                                           93.65

   4. Most of the Project activities have been completed and expected results delivered.
      The works on extending the Civil Service Network are expected to be completed
      before the original closing date. However, the operational acceptance of this
      network will take at least an additional 2 months. The pay grading system is
      being successfully piloted in five central entities and the Ministry of Finance
      plans to extend this new pay grading system to all civil service bodies in October
      2011. In general, the current project rating is satisfactory.

   5. The Executive Office of the President is requesting extension of the closing date
      to complete the implementation of two activities: (i) development of interface for
      the legal database Adlia, and (ii) development of recommendations for
      streamlining the system of health facilities and rationalizing staffing levels in
      health service facilities.

   6. There are no outstanding audit reports and the last audit was found satisfactory to
      the Bank.
