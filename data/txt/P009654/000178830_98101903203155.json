It will increase minor irrigation facilities\n            in the State by the development of some 7,000 filter points\n            and 4,500 tubewells as well as the installation of some\n            4,000 pumpsets to energize existing filter points. It will\n            also include an element for investment in dugwells and\n            dugwell improvements (including energization). Investments\n            in levelling about 10,000 ha will be financed together with\n            some drainage, and the project will include the financing of\n            12 rotary rigs and other equipment for well-drilling plus\n            some land shaping machinery. In addition, financing will be\n            provided for about 1,500 general purpose tractors in the 25\n            to 60 hp range. Provision is also made for consultancy\n            services to the State Groundwater Directorate and for an\n            aerial survey of the crystalline areas of Tamil Nadu and\n            neighbouring States."}, "docdt": "1971-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
