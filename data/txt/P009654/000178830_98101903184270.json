About 20 self-propelled harvesting combines and about\n            100 tractor-drawn harvesters will also be procured. The\n            Agricultural Credit Project in Tamil Nadu will finance part\n            of a lending program by banks in the State to help finance\n            investment in minor irrigation, land levelling, land\n            drainage and improvement and farm mechanization. It will\n            increase minor irrigation facilities in the State by the\n            development of some 7,000 filter points and 4,500 tubewells\n            as well as the installation of some 4,000 pumpsets to\n            energize existing filter points. It will also include an\n            element for investment in dugwells and dugwell improvements\n            (including energization). Investments in levelling about\n            10,000 ha will be financed together with some drainage, and\n            the project will include the financing of 12 rotary rigs and\n            other equipment for well-drilling plus some land shaping\n            machinery. In addition, financing will be provided for about\n            1,500 general purpose tractors in the 25 to 60 hp range.\n            Provision is also made for consultancy services to the State\n            Groundwater Directorate and for an aerial survey of the\n            crystalline areas of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States."}, "docdt": "1971-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
