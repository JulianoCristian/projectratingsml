Lessons\n            learned from the project: Ensure implementation readiness\n            conditions prior to negotiations and accordingly minimize\n            the list of conditions for effectiveness. Simple project\n            designs are likely to have a more effective and timely\n            performance record. Allow for larger size sub-projects would\n            have likely enticed the participation of the priority\n            municipalities at the onset of project implementation.\n            Involve stakeholders in project preparation. Include impact\n            and performance indicators which can be measured and are\n            important for the development objectives. Emergency\n            responses require non-traditional management and fiduciary\n            instruments. Adoption of models that have been successful\n            elsewhere is not enough. Ensure continuity between the\n            designers and the implementers. Avoid intermediate\n            management players by decentralizing directly to those\n            ultimately responsible for Project execution. Avoid locating\n            the fiduciary-related responsibilities in units that have\n            extensive time demands in other projects. More pertinent\n            roles for the NGOs and the supervisory entities. Changing\n            rules during the implementation process is detrimental to\n            obtain good results and thus increases inefficiency and\n            ineffectiveness. Protect the experiment to allow for\n            learning from the programs."}, "docdt": "2006-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
