poor and vulnerable\n            population, the Community Works and Employment Project for\n            Colombia finances small, labor-intensive public works to\n            provide temporary employment to poor workers, increase the\n            net labor income of their families, and prevent\n            deterioration of living standards in poor communities. There\n            are three project components. The first funds subprojects\n            which will finance the salaries of unskilled workers hired\n            under small community works projects and, for some\n            municipalities, a portion of the materials needed for\n            construction. Possible subprojects include 1) minor\n            construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling for schools,\n            health facilities, and basic sanitation facilities; 2) small\n            roads and bridges, culverts and canals; 3) community\n            centers; and 4) pilot housing projects. The second component\n            finances the final preparation and duplication operational\n            manuals and related guidebooks, office equipment, personnel\n            training, operating costs, and promotional campaigns and\n            technical assistance activities. The third component\n            finances project impact evaluation and external review as\n            well as a management information system."}, "docdt": "2000-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
