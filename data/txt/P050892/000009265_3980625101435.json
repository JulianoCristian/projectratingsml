loan\n            administration skills of RS banks. There are five project\n            components. First, the line of credit component will provide\n            emergency financing for needed inputs and repairs to permit\n            small and medium scale majority private enterprises in the\n            RS to restart or increase production to meet rising demand.\n            Second, the bankers' training component will provide\n            technical assistance to participating RS banks. The\n            technical assistance will focus in the areas of credit\n            management, credit evaluation, and adaptation to\n            international standards. Third, the enterprise support\n            component will develop viable business plans and strategies\n            to enhance the quality of sub-loan requests. Fourth, the\n            banking supervision component will apply prudential\n            regulations and accounting frameworks, introduce new\n            examination techniques, and develop risk management\n            capacity. Fifth, the implementation support will finance\n            administrative expenditures and technical assistance for the\n            credit line section of the Project Coordination Unit."}, "docdt": "1998-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
