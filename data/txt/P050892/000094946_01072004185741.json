        development impact modest. While the Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory, the performance by the Borrower is\n            highly satisfactory, given the level of commitment to\n            preparation, and the outstanding performance of the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU). Lessons are as follows. The credit\n            line design, in spite of the emergency situation, succeeded\n            because participating banks were allowed to take the risk,\n            rather than to act on an agency basis; this provided an\n            incentive to the banks to rapidly upgrade credit management\n            performance, despite the difficult environment. Moreover,\n            the effectiveness of the project also stemmed from close\n            Bank supervision, complemented by good PCU management.\n            However, problems of donor funding shortfalls for the credit\n            line, and general donor coordination became more acute,\n            because the Bank was the minority financier. While this\n            minority financing was justified, Bank caution should be\n            exercised if the Bank is the lead donor agency, unless\n            resources are available for active donor coordination. One\n            result of this difficult donor coordination, was that trust\n            fund clearance within the Bank, was also delayed, and\n            reflected lack of resources for implementing complex\n            co-financing. Optimal design for a non-emergency operation\n            might differ from this project design in that: the Credit\n            Line Section might require greater institutional autonomy to\n            reduce political interference; bank accreditation standards\n            could be tighter; and sub-loan approval simplified; and,\n            technical assistance be more cost-effective, particularly in\n            enterprise support."}, "docdt": "2001-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
