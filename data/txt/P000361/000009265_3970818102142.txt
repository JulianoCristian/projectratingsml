PREFACE
The Caisse Centrale de Coopération Economique (CCCE) as lead
agency for the appraisal of the Third HEVECAM Rubber project. has prepared
a staff appraisal report in French. To facilitate its review by the World
Bank, it has been translated into English, vithout modification of content
or presentation. Since the completion of CCCE's report in early May 1984
however, substantial changes have occurred. In particular: (i) the project
start-up date has been postponed by six months to January 1985 and the
planting program has been revised following a post-appraisal mission,
requiring changes in project costs and financing; and (ii) agreement has
been reached with Government on several points, leading to changes in
assurances and recommendations.
To update CCCE's report an Addendum has been prepared and
footnotes (using capital letters) have been added to the main text. The
Addendum consists of two parts, dealing respectively with project costs and
financing and vith assurances and recommendations. The Bank's President
Report and Legal Documents reflect all recent developments as of August 31,
1984.

THIRD HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
The appraisal of the HEVECAM III project took place from September
26 to October 12, 1983. Participating in the mission vere representatives of
the co-financiers (World Bank, Caisse Centrale de Coopération Economique,
Commonwealth Development Corporation, European Investment Bank) and the
Cameroonian agencies involved. During the CAMDEV-SOCAPALM supervision mission
of late November 1983, views vere exchanged vith the Cameroonian authorities
on the conclusions reached by the appraisal mission.
This report vas prepared by the Caisse Centrale de Coopération
Economique, but includes an economic analysis prepared by the World Bank; it
reflects the progress of discussions through the end of December 1983 as well
as the subsequent changes proposed bv the co-financiers.
Preparation of the report vas greatly facilitated by the excellent
spirit of cooperation prevailing between tne representatives of the four
financial institutions.



CAMEROON
THIRD HEVECAN RUBBER PROJECT
I. TRE OIL PALM AND RUBBER SUB-SECTOR
1.01      Approximately one-third of the land area of Cameroon is classified as
agricultural (156,000 km2 out of a total of 465,000 km2). Hovever, the area
under cultivation at any one time is estimated at only 2 million ha or some 13%
of this agricultural area. Smallholder farming predominates, contributing some
93% of total agricultural production, vith plantation agriculture which is
largely oil palm and rubber making up the remaining 7%.
1.02      Within the plantation sector there has been considerable past as vell
as ongoing investment; this has diversified exports which vere heavily
dependent on coffee and cocoa, by creating large plantations of rubber and oil
palm.  Apart from Government contributions this program involved the folloving
loans and credits from external co-donors:

1.03      The oil palm and rubber sub-sector largely comprises the
parastatals, CAMDEV, SOCAPALM and BEVECAM, which at completion of ongoing
and proposed projects vill total about 40,000 ha, 21,000 ha and 15,000 ha
respectively. Private sector plantation companies are smaller, comprising
PANOL (Unilever Plantations) with about 10,000 ha; SAFACAN with some 6,000
ha and SPFS (Ferme Suisse) vith 3,500 ha. Rubber and oil palm
smallholdings are few. Pilot smallholder programs have been included in
the parastatal projects but progress has generally been slow.
1.04      The performance of CANDEV and SOCAPALM has been deficient.  Major
management problems arose from a lack of autonomy and commercial
orientation; incentives are inadequate, and the quality of staff could be
better; operating results so far have been poor and the companies continue
to pose a financial burden on Government. Recently, there has been an
improvement in the management of SOCAPALM. So far, HEVECAM has performed
vell during the investment period; but with the onset of production, it is
important to avoid the problems'from which the other companies suffer.
1.05      Accordingly, under the Loan Agreement for the Oil Palm and Rubber
Consolidation Project, Government accepted'to review, prior to December 31,
1984, its oil palm and rubber development strategy in consultation with the
World Bank. Terms of Reference for the study have been prepared and it is
anticipated that the study, to be carried out by consultants, vill be
completed on schedule. As part of the above review, Government vill be
required to present at negotiations, a statement of intent for the
long-term organization and management of the oil palm and rubber
sub-sector, in general, and HEVECAM, in particular. A/
II. TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF FIRST AND SECOND PROJECTS
A. HEVECAN
2.01      By Decrees No. 75/284 of April 30, 1975 and No. 75/346 of May 23,
1975, the Government established HEVECAM (Hevea-Cameroon), a state
corporation responsible for carrying out a program of 15,000 ha of
industrial plantations of selected hevea plants. This companv, which falls
under the legal provisions established by Law No. 68/LF/9 of June 11, 1968
relating to Development Agencies, vas endowed with an initial capital of
CFAF 700 million. Of this amount, CFAF 400 million represents the
estimated value of the land conceded to it by the Government and the
remaining CFAF 300 million vas subscribed by the Government (CFAF 50
million), the Office National de Commercialisation des Produits de Base
A/   See general condition in Addendum, para 2.02(a).



(ONCPB-CFAF 200 million) and the Société Nationale d'Investissement
(SNI-CFAF 50 million).
2.02      Bv Decrees Nos. 76/615 of July 2, 1976 and 76/403 of December 17,
1976, the Government granted REVECAM a concession of 40,000 ha north of the
Niété River, 45 km from Kribi in the Ocean Department.
2.03      A technical assistance contract vas signed on May 23, 1975
between HEVECAM and the "Société Africaine Forestière et Agricole du
Cameroun"  (SAFACAN), a subsidiary of the "Société des Plantations des
Terres Rouges" (SPTR), turning over to SAFACAM the management of the new
estate. This contract, valid for eight years, is renevable by tacit
agreement for successive four-year periods (para 5.03).
2.04      An "Establishment Agreement" vas authorized by Law No. 76/10 of
July 8, 1976 and signed on August 30, 1976. Under it, HEVECAN benefits
from regime C of the Investuent Code (Annex VII).
2.05      At the time of the first appraisal mission in 1975, it vas agreed
vith the Government that in view of its large size, the program vould be
divided into three phases.
B. First Project
2.06      For the period 1975/76-1978/79, the principal objectives were to
clear 7,500 ha, plant 5,800 ha, complete the operational and housing
infrastructures, carry out a program of complementary research, introduce
food crops, complete the prospection of the concession, and line up the
funds required for technical assistance as vell as for a Master Plan study
for the Ocean Department. 1/
2.07      External financing vas provided by an IDA credit (574-CM) of
US$16 million and a CCCE loan of FF 20 million, both granted in 1975. The
national contribution vas to be CFAF 1,633 million, including the initial
capital subscription of CFAF 300 million. The external loans on lending
terms vere laid down vithin the framevork of the Financial Agreement
between Government and HEVECAN signed in 1975.
2.08      Initial operations vere delayed due to the remote location of the
estate (absence of infrastructure, labor problems, difficult climatic
1/   The study vas entrusted to a consortium made up of SEDA (Société
d'Etudes pour le Développement de l'Afrique (African Development
Research Company), SATET (Sociité Africaine de Travaux et d'Etudes
Topographiques) (African Topographical Research and Construction
Company) and SAFACAM. Its costs vere financed by the IDA credit
(US$873,000) and the CCCE loan (FF 1,100,000).

conditions). Furthermore, the project faced financial difficulties as a
result of:
(1) a change in the regulations concerning the housing of
vorkers;
(ii)  a change in the land clearing techniques, reducing the risk
of root diseases (particularly Fomes); and
{iii) an increase in inventories due to the geographical isolation
and the increase in the fleet of heavv land-clearing
equipment.
The Government then increased its contribution in 1978,
subscribing an additional CFAF 1.4 billion in capital. It vas still
necessary, however, to phase dovn the program to 4,200 ha and to transfer
the remaining 1,600 ha to Phase II. Hovever, the quality of what had been
achieved augured vell for the future of the program. The draft Master Plan
for the Kribi region vas not completed until June 1980.
C. Second Project
2.09      The second project, covering the period 1979/80-1983/84,
comprised the preparation of 9,800 ha of land (of which 1,500 ha was to be
planted during Phase III), the planting of 9,300 ha (of vhich 1,600 ha was
left from Phase 1), maintaining the immature areas from both phases,
bringing 1,500 ha into tapping, constructing all the infrastructure
required for expansion of the estate (roads, housing, hospital, schools,
markets, etc.), building a 30 t/day factory 2/ and preparing nurseries for
the 1,500 ha to be planted during Phase III. Also planned were several
ancillary operations: Initiation of a program of 250 ha of smallholder
estates, completion of prospection of the Niité concession, topographical
and soil surveys on a new site, continued applied research, and food crop
programs.
2.10      The cost of the second project had been estimated at appraisal at
CFAF 20,970 million, 3/ excluding HEVECAM's liquidity needs estimated at
CFAF 2,400 million. External financing vas to be provided by an IDA credit
(975-CM, April 18, 1980, US$15 million), an IBRD loan (1791-CM, April 18.
1980, US$16.5 million), a loan from the CDC (January 24, 1980, 12 million
pounds sterling) and a loan from the CCCE (November 23, 1979, FF 80
million, Nos. 58 31 00 79 050 and 58 31 00 79 060). The Government was to
provide CFAF 3,943 million as well as CFAF 2,400 million to cover the
2/   Theoretical capacity.
3/   Including CFAF 1,012 million in increases in stocks.



liquidity requirements of HEVECAM, equivalent to four months' operating
expenses. The terms for onlending external loans vere defined under the
Cameroon-HEVECAM financing agreement signed on December 6, 1979.
2.11      The various supervision missions conducted on a regular basis
during Phase II as vell as the appraisal mission for Phase III noted that
the project vas p-oceeding very satisfactorily. The major problems
encountered initially had been overcome, in particular those related to the
recruitment and the stability of vorkers, thanks to the introduction of
adequate social infrastructure. This positive result must be credited to a
dynamic and competent management team made up of 43 senior staff, of vhom
12 are expatriates, supported by the technical assistance of SAFACAN, whose
"Cameroonization" program is proceeding effectively.
2.12      The targeted objectives have practically all been met. The land
clearing vorks covering 15,000 ha should be completed in April 1984 and by
end-June 1984, 9,200 ha (as against a projected 9,300 ha) should be
planted. A/ The first two rubber processing facilities (20 t/day for latex
and 10 t/day for secondary grades) 4/ should be operational in early 1984
B! and the initial tapping of the first fields planted vas actually carried
out in July 1983. The other investments have been made as projected, vith
the exception of some housing and equipment which did not prove necessary
during Phase II, largely because of better vorker productivity. All in
all. based on the initial appraisal cost estlmate, this postponement
represents CFAF 705 million. The food crop program has proceeded normally.
In contrast, the pace of establishing the 250 ha of smallholder estates has
been slover than projected, vith 49 ha planted in 1982/83, though it may be
possible that the remaining 201 ha might actually be planted -during fiscal
year 1983/84. The only negative point, though not attributable to the
project, is that the studies on the selection of a new site in the Kribi
area have not been completed.
AI   By end-June 1984, the total area planted reached 14,035 ha: 4,214 ha
under the first project, and 9.821 ha under the secnnd project. The
total area of 15,000 ha would be planted before completion of the
second project in December 1984.

2.13      The project has had, in fact, to face only two sizable
agricultural problems:  Fomes and Gloeosporium, especially since 1981 for
the latter disease. A pest control research program has been undertaken in
cooperation with IRCA. For Fomes, chemical treatments have nov been
sufficiently developed; for Gloeosporium, tests involving aerial treatment
and early defoliation have been carried out. While it is not vet possible
to assess accurately the effectiveness of this or other treatments already
tested against Gloeosporium, which affects mainly the young trees, it has
not had a sizable impact this year (a particularly dry one). Under these
circumstances, earlier vorries may be partiallv alleviated. It is
imperative, however. that experiments be continued.  As a precautionary
measure, in the appraisal of Phase III, sufficient funds have been
allocated for treating Fomes and Gloeosporium.
2.14      On the basis of HEVECAM's provisional results at end-June 1983
and the fiscal 1983/84 budget. the total cost of Phase II has been
estimated at CFAF 24,601 million. as against the 1979 appraisal figure of
CFAF 20,970 which amounts to a cost overrun of CFAF 3,631 million (17Z).
This gap vas analyzed vithin the context of evaluating the execution of the
project. When the postponement of certain construction and plant and
equipment outlays (CFAF 705 million according te 1979 appraisal figures
(para 1.12) and the 100 ha of planting not completed (approximately CFAF 12
million) vere subtracted, the project had CFAF 20,970 million - CFAF 717
mIllion = CFAP 20,253 million available to it. The gap between actual
expenditure and the revised appraisal estimate indicates an actual overrun
of CFAF 4,348 million (21.5Z). Four principal factors explain the overrun:
(iv) increase in the real cost of labor by an annual average of
18Z, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 10% (CFAF
1,385 million);
A/   Updated as follows:

(v)  increase ln the cost of oil products by an annual average of
22% as compared to the appraisal estimate of IOZ (CFAF 839
nillion);
(vi)  depreciations of the French franc vis-a-vis the other
international currencies (the dollar and the pound
sterling), increasing the cost of capital equipment
purchased outside the franc zone (approximately CFAF 1,500
million); and
(vii)  completion of additional construction not foreseen at
appraisal for Phase II (CFAF 1,029 million).
These four factors increased the real costs of the project by
CFAF 4,753 million against an overrun of CFAF 4,348 million, indicating
other savings of CFAF 405 million. It is thus reasonable to conclude that
the project has been carried out in accordance with the appraisal both
technically and financially.

2.15      Particular attention has been paid to the evolution of overheads
as they appear in HEVECAM cost accounting, vhich for the 1983/84 budget
amount to CFAF 2,002 million. The analysis shows that this heading groups
three categories of expenditure which are quite distinct, two of which
should not be included in the overheads:
(i)  CFAF 290 million is for social velfare efforts which are
carried out by HEVECAN on behalf of Government (health,
education, vater and electricity supply for employees,
various social activities, etc.);
(ii) CFAF 400 million represents the cost of activities performed
by HEVECAM (forest clearing, construction, upkeep of
vehicles and equipment, and delivery of supplies), which
could have been subcontracted to third parties had
circumstances in the region so permitted. In this case,
these costs would have been incorporated directly in
suppliers' invoices;
(iii) only CFAF 1,312 million represents real overheads, i.e.,
those costs of managing the project which cannot be charged
directly to operations.
2.16      The actual introduction of the initial financing plan should
resuit in an end-June 1984 increase in funding of CFAF 3,836 million over
the appraisal estimate of CFAF 20,970 million, this as the result of:
(i)  an additional contribution from the Government of CFAF 645
million;
(ii) an additional capability for drawing against external
financing in the amount of CFAF 2,917, as the result of
exchange gains on the loans denominated in U.S. dollars and
pounds sterling; 5/
(iii; CFAF 274 million in interest collected as a consequence of
the company's surplus cash position.
As compared vith the total expenditure for Phase Il estimated at
CFAF 24,601 million, the overall financial resources available of CFAF
24,806 million will produce a net surplus of CFAF 205 million. Hovever, in
accordance with Section 4.01 of the IBRD Credit Agreement of April 18,
1980, HEVECAM's net cash position must represent four months' expenditure
or, at end-June 1984, an amount of CFAF 2,000 million. REVECAM has already
requested that this amount be included in the Special Government Budget for
5/   These exchange gains are greater than the cost increases resulting
from the devaluation of the French franc (para 2.14).

complemented by the CFAF 205 million available, should be slightly above

effectively part of the Government budget before negotiations and actually
disbursed before the signing of the Loan Agreements for Phase III (para
10.01(a)).

III. PROJECT FRAMEWORK
Location
3.01      The estate, a 40,000 ha Government concession, is located south
of the Kribi-Ebolowa road. It is bordered to the southwest by the Lobé
River and to the northwest by the Ndingui River. To the east, the boundarv
stops a few kilometers short of the Adjap-Zingui-Mekanda road. The
geographïc coordinates of the estate center are 100 7' East and 20 44'
North. The estate headquarters and the factory are located about 45 km from
Kribi by road.
Population
3.02      Prior to the initiation of the project, the population density
for the area as a whole vas about 8 persons per square kilometer, or less
than the national figure of 16.5. Excluding the 25,000 inhabitants of the
Kribi municipality, the population density within the project area vas no
greater than 6 persons per square kilometer. This population is
concentrated in small villages along the Kribi-Ebolowa road and the
Adjap-Zingui road. The arrival of the 2,921 HEVECAM employees (count as of
June 30, 1983) and their families (3,619 persons as of the same date) has
been accomplished without any particular disruption.
3.03      Although one of the least populated areas of the countrv, the
Ocean Department shows great ethnic diversity. At least ten different
ethnic groups have been identified.
Topography
3.04      The average altitude of the estate is 50 m above sea level.  As a
whole, it is relatively flat, with tne exception of a few chains of low
hills which rise to about 200 meters. The land surveys nov completed have
shown the cultivable area to be about 18,000 ha, or 45% of the
concession. Part of the unplanted areas could be used for food crops and
smallholder estates.
AI   See footnote A/, para 2.16.



- il -
Soil
3.05      For the most part, the soïl is sandy clay, vith a 40% clay
content and a high proportion of fine sand. It is thus vell suited for the
production of rubber. With a pH of approximately 5, the soil is
sufficiently nonacidic and generally low in potassium. During planting
and for the first two years, it is planned to add 10-10-20 fertilizer and
DAP. A/ Subsequently, beginning with the third year of immaturity and
during the entire production period, potassium vill be regularly applied.
Hydrography
3.06      The concession is crossed east-west by the Niété River.  The
factory vould thus have a year-round water supply pumped directly from the
river and piped 1.5 kilometers. In contrast, drinking potable vater for
the residential areas is provided by various vells.
Climate
3.07      Prior to the beginning of the fi-st project, there were no
precise climatic data on the area. All that vas available vere rainfall
maps showing that the concession vas located between the 1,850 and 2,700 mm
isohyets vith considerable local variations over 3,000 mm at Kribi and less
than 2,000 mm at Ebolowa, with a dry period of three to four months'
duration between late November and March and a shorter dry season in July
and August. Since the start of the project, rainfall measurements have
been made regularly. The details reported can be summarized as follows for
the 1976-82 period.

The variations are sizable, however; the maximum rainfall was
2,670 mm in 1976 and the minimum 1,600 mm in 1980. Be that as it may, in
the 84 months surveyed, there vere only 32 months in which rainfall was
less than 100 mm, including 16 months with less than 50 mm and one month
vithout any rain at all. Four complete years of surveys of temperature
statistics are currently available (1979-1982) and show a high degree of
regularity, with minima rarely below 20 degrees Celsius (averaging 20.9
degrees) and maxima averaging 32.9 degrees Celsius.

On the other hand, surveys of sun conditions have not been
systematic. It is estimated, however, that there is sunlight for 1,500 to
1,800 hours per year, giving an average radiation of 350
calorie-grams/square centimeter per day.
There is a limited risk of wind damage, which has been taken into
account in the selection of clones; RRIM 600, which is particularly
vxlnerable to the wind, has been planted in small areas only. The climatic
conditions are thus generally favorable, but nevertheless include some
risks of isolated droughts which may have an impact on yields.
Vegetation
3.08      The dominant vegetation is characteristic of the classical
tropical forest. Although already logged, some forest areas could be used
further.  A logging permit has been given to the firm Rouillon & Fils.
Nearly 10,000 cubic meters of timber with a market value of CFAF 460
million have been used in the 1979/80-1982/83 period for project buildings.
However, the study requested during negotiations of HEVECAM II, and which
vas to be carried out by the Forestry Department of the "Ecole Nationale
Supérieure d'Agronomie" (ENSA), has never been completed because of
Government's failure to provide the necessary funds. A/
Communications
Port
3.09      During the appraisal of Phase I, some reference was made to the
possibility of developing a deep-water port in the Kribi area. The first
studies on this subject favored selection of the site known as "Rocher du
Loup" (Wolf Rock). When this site was abandoned, a new studv vas conducted
on the Grand Batanga site some 25 km south of Kribi. However, because of
doubts surrounding the execution of the major industrial projects in that
area (SEGAZCAM and SEFERCAM), it seems unlikely that this nev port will be
developed in the near future. It vas therefore decided that HEVECAM's
rubber would be shipped through Douala, where the facilities are for the
time being adequate. The extra cost incurred by the increase in land
transportation requirements (254 km to reach Douala as against 67.5 km for
Grand Batanga) vill increase HEVECAM's operating costs by nearly CFAF 400
million per year (1983/84 basis) when full production is reached. Rovever,
a temporary solution of transhipment by barge at Kribi could be looked
into.
A/   This study is no longer relevant since all forest areas vithin the
15,000 ha project area have been felled.

Roads
3.10      The estate is connected to the Edea-Kribi road by a 15 km access
road which HEVECAM has been maintaining. During the discussions held in
late November 1983, the representatives of the Ministry of Equipment
confirmed that the regrading, completion and maintenance of this access
road were to be carried out under the World Bank's Sixth Highvays Project. A/
(i) As regards the Edea-Kribi main road, Government had already
promised during the Phase II negotiations to complete its
rehabilitation before December 31, 1980. This clause vas
not fulfilled. In early 1983, a contract vas signed vith a
public vorks enterprise for the rehabilitation of the
present road in order for it to be operational year-round.
As for the asphalted road, a technical study will shortly be
handed over to Government.
(ii)  Transportation of rubber from REVECAM and of palm oil from
SOCAPALM's Kienke estate, does not necessarily require a
paved road. Consequently, prior to negotiations, assurances
should be obtained from Government that it vill routinely,
and at its own expense, carry out the maintenance of the
Nicté to Kribi-Edea stretch of road (para 10.01(b)).
Pending the construction of the nev paved Edea-Kribi
section, the present road vill be maintained by the
Government in a condition such that it vill be possible to
transport BEVECAM's rubber and SOCAPALN's palm oil to Douala
during any season (para 10.02(a)). BI
Electrical Pover Supply
3.11      The energy requirements for the processing of rubber and for
household use can be met economically only by using the hydroelectrical
energy provided by SONEL. Various contacts vith SONEL have been initiated
by HEVECAM and, in the course of the November 1983 discussions, it vas
confirmed that SONEL had made arrangements to connect Kribi 6/ vith Akom I.
This work has already been started and should be completed during the third
quarter of 1984. It could be financed by the remains of the World Bank's

should be obtained on the status of this work and its anticipated date of
completion. A/
Public Services and Social Services
3.12      As the seat of the Ocean Prefecture, Kribi has the usual
infrastructure and public services. However, in view of the isolation and
the number of workers and families for the project (a total of almost 7,000
persons), the project found it necessarv not onlv to comply with the legal
obligation of building housing (nine villages totallv completed under
HEVECAM I and Il), but also to provide a number of communal amenities
normally the responsibility of the central, regional or municipal
government: police stations, a post office, a hospital (four wards), four
dispensaries, covered markets, sports fields, public lighting and water
supply for the villages, nine schools (with a total of 43 teachers), six
kindergarten facilities, meeting halls, etc. Similarly, the project
promoted the introduction of essential private services: one bakery,
shops, a bank office, etc. It is only normal that the proiect would bear
the cost of constructing and maintaining the housing, kitchens and sanitary
facilities, which are legal requirements. However, once the production
phase begins it becomes necessary, in order to gain a clear assessment of
the production and marketing activity for rubber, that the cost of
constructing, maintaining and operating those public and social-service
activities carried out by the project on behalf of the public authorities
be handled as follows:
(i) for accounting purposes, these costs should be recorded in a
special account labelled "Operations on beha1 of Third
Parties";
(ii)  from the financial standpoint, appropriate arrangements
should be made whereby these costs are not charged to either
the capital or operating accounts of HEVECAM.
In this regard, an agreement will have to be drawn up between
HEVECAM and the Government vhich would specify the content of the public
and social services that HEVECAM would carry out and the arrangeLrents for
financing them. The signing of such an agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness of the external loans (para 10.05(a)). B/
A/   International competitive bidding vas carried out in February 1984 and
a contractor has been selected. The vork is scheduled to be done
between July and December 1984. Its cost vill be financed by the
Governrent (30Z) and IBRD (HEVECAM Il - Loan 1791-CM, 70Z).

Labor
3.13      The initial concerns about the possibility of the project having
difficulty locating and stabilizing a vork force of sufficient quality have
nov been considerably alleviated. The project no longer has significant
problems in this regard. Analysis of the statistics published by HEVECAM
shows that currently 75% of the work force has at least one year of
seniority, with 50% having more than two years, and 25% more than four.
The proportions of the work force by origin are as follows: vest and
northwest, 46%; south central, 39%; east, 8%; coast, 6%; north, 1%. The
people involved are generally young (82% under 30). The improvements noted
are the result of the good living conditions offered to the workers
(housing, social facilities, medical care, active sociocultural programs,
etc.). Moreover, the project has introduced an extremely active program of
training for the specific tasks involved in rubber cultivation (grafting
and tapping schools) as well as the different trade specialties
(electrician, mechanic, construction, etc.).
IV. THE THIRD HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT
A. Overview
4.01      The Third HEVECAM Rubber project covers a third five-year period
from 1984/85-1988/89. A/ It includes:
(a)  Completion of the Scheduled 15,000 ha Industrial Estate
(i) planting of 1,600 ha of selected clones to bring the total
planted area to 15,000 ha; B/
(ii) maintaining the immature areas, reducing them from 14,195 ha
in 1984/85 to 5,350 ha in 1988/89;
(iii) initial tapping of 9,430 ha, in addition to the 805 ha
already tapped during Phase II;
A/   For the Bank and CDC, the HEVECAM III project covers a four and a half
year investment period (January 1985-June 1989). See Preface.
B/   The total area of 15,000 ha vould be planted before completion of the
second project in December 1984.



- 16 -
(iv) continuing the housing, building and social infrastructure
construction program;
(v) establishing three processing lines for latex and three for
low-grade rubber;
(vi) continuing the program of applied research intended to
preserve the productive potential and improve the quality of
the rubber;
(vii) continuing the technical assistance provided by SAFACAM
under the renewed management agreement.
(b) Related Programs
(i) continuing the outgrower program to cover a total of 500 ha,
including the 250 ha already planted during Phase II;
(ii) continuing the food crop program;
(iii)  research and development on rubber cultivation in the Kribi
area, the central south area and the eastern part of the
country.
B. Description of Program to Complete 15.000 hectares
Clearing
4.02      The land clearing vork covering the 1,600 ha remaining to be
planted will be completed before the end of Phase II. All that will be
required is a small amount of platforming for the villages and clearing
operations for smallholdings and food crops.
HEVECAM's forest clearing equipment includes 14 D8 tractors which
have logged an average of 10,000 working hours, but their excellent
maintenance vill make it possible to extract another 2,500 hours from each.
Planting and Clone Varieties
4.03      The plant stock needed for the remaining 1,600 ha and the
smallholder estates is already in the first year of seedling life. There
has been an exceptional rate of success of grafting in 1983 on 1982
seedlings (90%). On the basis of work actually carried out up to the end
of December 1983 and projections for 1984, 57% of the area will have been
planted in polybag plants, 21% in seed, 14% in stumps and 8% in seedling
bag. The clone distribution will be approximately: GT1, 60%; PB 235. 12Z;
PR 107, 9%; PR 261 and PB 260, 5% each; and PB 217, 4%. In the past two
years, priority has been given to rapidly maturing clones in order to take
into account experience gained in Malaysia and Ivory Coast. Planting



- 17 -
density has been 550 trees/ha (8 m x 2.25 m) vith an average of 420 trees
at the time of the second year of tapping.
Within the framework of a regional cooperation policy, Governient
has asked REVECAN ta provide grafting stock and grafted stumps to Gabon and
the Congo, each of which has initiated a project of about 3,000 ha of
industrial estates. These shipments of plant material are invoiced to the
projects concerned and the revenues are deducted from the expenditure
submitted by HEVECAM to the project co-financiers.
Upkeep
4.04      The cover crop (Pueraria) is maintained so long as the cover from
the trees themselves allows sufficient light to pass. Chemicals have been
used in wide areas so as to reduce labor requirements and the risks of soil
erosion. Fertilizer dosages are nov vell known for the immature phase:
10-10-20 and DAP for the first three years (NO to N2), and Potasium Cloride
thereafter, including during the production period. The addition of
tricalcium phosphate during N3 and N4 is also important.
Phytosanitary Protection
4.05      The two most important risks are Fomes and Gloeosporium.  The
means of combatting Fomes (white root rot) are nov vell adapted. REVECAM
has perfected a system of identification and treatment vith Calixin (active
ingredient: tridemorphe). This treatment is applied only to affected
trees and those nearby in the same line. It is considered reasonable, in
view of past experiences, to make arrangements for two inspection rounds
per hectare and per year during the immature phase and a single round
during the production period. The results achieved by HEVECAM using this
method are excellent, with the tree mortality rate not exceeding 1%
annually.
For Gloeosporium, a disease of the young leaves, two pathogenic
mushrooms have been identified by IRCA: Gloeosporium alba rubrum and
Colletrotrichum-gloesporides. Two types of treatment are currently in use:
fungicides (Delsene) and aerial treatment (Ethrel) to induce early
defoliation. The effectiveness of these measures has yet to be entirely
proven, but they at least appear promising. Provisions for treatment have
been included for application from year N3 to year N14 (12 years) as a
precautionary measure, despite the absence of any severe attack in 1983.
Initial and subsequent tapping
4.06      It has been decided to carrv out initial tapping (on the basis of
a minimum of 200 exploitable trees wlth a minimum circumference of 50 cm)
in year N7 (where NO is the year of planting). This delay is extremely



- 18 -
cautious 7/ in that, despite the attacks from Gloeosporium beginning in
1981, the growth of the GTI and PB235 clones has shown an average increase
in circumference of 8 cm per year over a 5-year period, which is altogether
satisfactory.
In view of experiences in other producing countries, including
Ivory Coast, HEVECAM proposes using a reduced intensity tapping system with
intense stimulation beginning the first year with 10 applications of Ethrel
per year. This S/2, d7 A/ system makes it possible ta reduce the need for
trained tappers (and consequently to improve the performance bonus systems)
while tapping more during peak periods and reducing the consumption of bark
panels by about 30% as conpared to the d3/d4 system.
Yields
4.07      The yield forecasts show annual average production of 1,982 kg/ha
over a 30-year period, which appears to be sufficiently cautious an
estimate in view of the results obtained by IRCA and the "Société Africaine
de Plantation d'Hévéas" tSAPH) in Ivory Coast, both of which exceeded 3,000
kg/ha in S/2, d7 in 1981. The results of the first HEVECAM tapping of the
1976 and 1975 plantings are very promising.

With the exception of the initial one-year lag, the industrial
estate yield in the table closely resembles the figures used during the
appraisals of Phase I and Phase II, and vas accepted by the appraisal
missions' agriculturists. While it is not overly optimistic in theory,
achieving it will require particularly effective and precise technical
management. For the smallholder estates, it appeared prudent to apply a
coefficient of only 60%, as vas done at SAPH in Ivory Coast.
7/   A delay of 6 years vas assumed in the appraisal of HEVECAM II.
A/   A tapping system by which half the circumference of the tree is tapped
every seven days.

Collection of Latex
4.08      Uith the use of stlnmlution, it can be reasonably assumed that
70% of the production  ull be collected in liqid latex and 30% as
coagulum, cup lump, bark-scrap and ground-scrap. This percentage of latex,
below the one estimated during the Phase Il appraisal (75%), vas arrived at
following the results obtained by SAP* ln Ivory Coast. At present, HEVECAM
is using 0.8 liter cups, which it vii exchange later for larger 1.2 liter
cups. Collection is normally in a tank for the liquid latex. For the
smallholder estates, the latex vill be coagulated in the cups to facilitate
collection.
Quality of Rubber
4.09      HEVECAN has conducted an exhaustive study of the processing
techniques for latex in Malaysia, Indonesia and Ivory Coast. It is
difficult at present to have a vell founded notion cf the future
comparative advantage of smoked sheet and crunb rubber. Hovever, past
experience shows that the prices for the best crumb grades (5L) are higher
than those for smoked sheet RSS1. In recent years, efforts to improve
factory techniques have been focused especially on "crumb" factories (for
example the SAPH's OSROU factory in Ivory Coast), and there must be
possibilities for improving the manufacturing procedures for sheet rubber.
Nevertheless, it appears preferable for BE vCAM to concentrate on the
processing of crumb rubber, as the analysis conducted indicates that under
current investment and manufacturing cost conditions, smoked sheet must
seil at a price CFAF 29/kg (US$74 per ton) higher than crumb rubber in
order to be competitive. Hovever, when the factory has been extended after
the end of the third investment phase. the choice between crumb and sheet
vill be subject to review in accordance vith market trends and technology
shifts.
Under these circumstances, the assumptions on quality of finished
products are as follovs:

Factory
4.10      The schedule for setting up the factorv's production lines has
been drawn up on the following grounds: two months of peak production,
each representing 15Z of annual productior (as proved to be the case at
Dizangué), a regular 80% utilization of theoretical installed capacity of
the equipment (1 t/h for drying latex as against 1.2 t/h estimated by the
manufacturer), and operation during peak periods in two 8-hour shifts for
25 consecutive days (400 hours).
To make it possible to improve vork site organization and obtain
better prices from suppliers, it vas decided to group orders as much as
possible.

Packing, Shipment and Exportation of Rubber
4.11      The crumb rubber vill be packed in 33.3 kg bales either on wooden
pallets of 30 bales each (1 t) or wrapped in stretched polyethylene (shrink
wrap system) vith 33 bales per pallet (1.1 t). These pallets vould be
shipped in 20-foot containers, making it possible to load 16 to 18 tons per
container depending on the packaging method (or an assumed average of 17 t
per container). The containers could be carried on trucks rented from
private carriers in Douala. As regards final destinations, it has been
assumed that 50% of the production vould be exported to France, 25% to the
other countries of southern Europe, and the remaining 25% to the northern
European countries.
The shipping cost per ton based on tariffs currently being
applied comes to CFAF 20,650 per metric ton (base 1983/84).

Insurance costs are 0.25% of c.i.f. value, vhile marketing costs
(brokerage fees, surveillance of off-loading, negotiation fees, arbitrage,
etc.) have been estimated at 1.25Z of the c.i.f. value.
Labor
4.12      At the end of Phase I, there vas a total labor force of 1,600.
During the course of Phase II, an additional 1,400 personnel vas recruited.
By the end of Phase III, another 1,200 employees vill have to be hired (for
a total of 4,200). For a peak period (starting in 1997/98), total
employment bas been estimated at 5,700. It vill therefore be advisable to
increase the housing and social infrestructure. Hovever, by adopting the
stimulated d7 tapping system and keeping the tapping vork on a force
account basis, the staffing increase during Phase III has been limited to
1,200 persons instead of the estimated 1,700 forecast during Phase I and
Phase II appraisals on the basis of other tapping methods.
Operational Structures
4.13      Plans exist for:
{i) in Douala: the construction of 250 square meters of office
space and 1,000 square meters of varehouse to replace the
present rented space which is no longer suitable;
(ii) in Niété: the construction near the factory of garages,
varehouses and shops as vell as the offices of the
Directorate of Agricultural Operations. The remaining
offices and present buildings are to be retained. In
addition, plans are to build three division offices, three



- 22 -
fertilizer varehouses, four division varehouses, five
herbicide varehouses and eight garages (two per division).
Housing
4.14      The housing program includes the construction of 575 type A2
workers' houses with kitchen and sanitary facilities, of which 105 vould be
for factory personnel, and the reconstruction of 125 houses in villages
number 1-2. The construction standard of wooden houses built ten years ago
in these villages is inferior to that of houses built recently. A new
standard for house construction vas adopted, namely average space occupied
per worker of 19 square meters compared to the 15 square meters planned for
Phase II due to 33% of workers being married. There are 15 houses for
supervisors and foremen, including six supervisors and three foremen's
houses for the factory.
Related Social Infrastructure
4.15      This comprises tying into the SONEL line for the public lighting
of six villages (vith two more remaining to be connected after the end of
Phase III), vater supply to three villages, the construction of a fifth
yard in the central hospital, four dispensaries, three primary schools,
three kindergartens, five major markets, ten shops, five religious
buildings, three sportfields, a staff club, two meeting halls and two
festival halls. In addition, the social services of the project include
the purchase of a variety of equipment for the hospital, the dispensaries
and the schools.
Impact on Environment
4.16      Some 90% of the total project plantings have already been planted
under the first and second projects. Steep lands have not been planted and
adequate soil conservation measures have been taken through the
establishment of leguminous cover crops. Food cropping by plantation labor
near the villages and by rubber smallholders would be confined to the flat
and slightly undulating lands to minimize the risk of soil erosion. The
block rubber processing plants, commenced under the second project, would
be completed under this one. The factorv design vould incorporate adequate
treatment systems to ensure that the concentration of effluent would be
vithin accepted limits.
Rolling Stock and Miscellaneous
4.17      This covers all purchases and repairs of vehicles and
miscellaneous equipment (not including those pertaining to the factory and
social services) required to complete the program and bring it into
operation. The purchase in 1987/88 of a twin-engine aircraft has also been
added. The current single engine craft rented part-time from SOCAPALM is
approaching the end of its useful life, and it appears appropriate to
replace it by a twin-engine craft that can be used more flexibly (flying in
all veather conditions, with landing authorized in Yaoundé-it is highly



- 23 -
probable that the use of a single-engine aircraft for all veather
conditions may soon be banned in Cameroon). The maintenance of a private
air connect-ion is important because the CANAIR Kribi-Douala flight no
longer exists and the highway travel time from Niété to Douala, even vith a
reconditioned road, vill still be five hours, and even more during the
rainy season. Moreover, REVECAM's requirements justify the purchase of its
own aircraft.
Associated Experimentation
4.18      In order to maintain the plantation's productive potential,
improve cultivation techniques and the quality of the rubber, the
associated research program already existing in Phases I and II vill have
to be continued and expanded. This program is one of applied research
rather than basic research, which is normally carried out by specialized
national institutions, and vill be aimed primarily at:
(i)  improving the measures against Foues and Gloeosporium;
(ii) testing of tree/ha densities, fertilizers, stimulation and
tapping for the industrial estate and smallholdings, as vell
as between-row crops for the latter;
(iii) lov-temperature drying of the rubber;
(iv) experimenting vith food crops.
This program vill be the responsibility of HEVECAM vith
logistical support from national institutions (IRA) and foreign research
institutes (especially IRCA). Its annual cost vill average CFAF 105
million (base 1983/84).
C. Description of Associated Prograits
(a)  Smallholder Estate Program
Principles of Intervention
4.19      Beginning in Phase II, the Government stressed the development of
smallholder estates in association with the industrial estate. This
orientation has been reinforced under the Fifth Plan. The results obtained
during Phase II show that, in general, there is a strong interest in this
type of operation on the part of the people. Indeed, two categories of
persons are involved: the village-level independent planters, rather few
in number and spread along the major road arteries, and the nonindependent
planters who are generally "contractors" vho have moved into the HEVECAM
concession to carry out certain piecevork activities (pruning, construction
work, etc.). The latter category has an investment and labor capacity
which is often greater than that of the independent planters. Accordingly,
the first 250 ha program of Phase II vill be divided: 150 ha for the



- 24 -
nonindependent and 100 ha for the independent planters. This prcportion
could conceivably be reversed for Phase III. It is nonetheless true that
it vill still be an experimental program; as a consequence, its scope vill
necessarily have to be Ilmited, and all the more so to avoid the problems
experienced with the CAMDEV and SOCAPALM smallholder operations. As a
result, there is a limited target of an additional 250 ha.
Operating Arrangements
4.20      Partners.  HEVECAM acts as the Covernment's chief contractor and
the National Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) is responsible for credit
operations. A credit management agreement has been concluded between
HEVECAM and the planters. A/
Distribution of Tasks
HEVECAM: provides the folloving services:
- selection and training of planters;
- mechanical preparation of the land (only for nonindependent
planters);
- provision of selected plant stock, inputs and necessary
equipment;
- control of project execution;
- collection and purchase of rubber;
- maintenance of collection trails;
- bookkeeping for planters;
- relations with FONADER and the supervisory authorities for the
arrangement of financing and repayments.
FONADER: provision of credits and bonuses for planters.
Planters:
- preparation of land (in the case of independent planters);
- execution of planting, maintenance and tapping operations.
Financing Arrangements
Government:
- subsidy to HEVECAM covering supervisory staff and structural
costs during the introductory phase as vell as preparation of
land area for nonindependent planters;
- subsidization of planters, through FONADER, corresponding to
A/   See general conditions in Addendum, paras 2.02(c) and 2.03(a).



- 25 -
50% of the value of the work days provided by the
planter during the introductory phase (N-1 to N-6);
- advance to REVECAM covering supervisory staff and structural
costs as from 1989/90. This advance is reimbursed in the form
of a lump-sum payment per kilogram of village rubber
collected;
- advance to HEVECAM for services rendered during the
operational phase (shipment of inputs and maintenance of
trials), also reimbursed in the form of a lump-sum payment per
kilogram of smallholding rubber collected.
FONADER:
- Long-term credit to planters (11.25% interest for 20
years with 10 vears' grace) covering the purchase of grafted
plants, the provision of inputs and all HEVECAN services.
other than the mechanical preparation of the land area;
- short-term credit at the time of initial tapping (9.25%
annual interest for 6 months).
Planters:
- payment in kind during the establishment period
(N-1 to N-6) A/ of 50% of workdays;
- assumption of the cost during operational phase of all inputs,
small equipment and workdays;
-  repayment of long-term and short-term credits to FONADER.
Special Remarks
4.21      It is planned to limit the village smallholder to an average of 5
hectares B/ and the medium size holdings to an average of 20 hectares.
The purchase price of the rubber collected shall be 60% of the
ex-factorv price for secondary grades.
(b) Food Crops
Principles of Action
4.22      This second program, also financed by the Government and already
begun during Phases I and II, has two purposes:
A/   Year 1 to Year 6 after planting which is ref erred to as Year N-O.
B/   From 2 ha up to a maximm of 10 ha.



- 26 -
(i)  to increase food production to meet the groving demand
resulting from the arrival in large numbers of HEVECAM
workers and their families (15,000 to 20,000 persons during
peak periods);
(ii)  ta increase the incomes of project workers and planters in
the area by helping them to produce food themselves for
their own needs and to market the surpluses through the
project.

4.23      The program vould consist of three parts:
(i) by HEVECAN vorkers: HEVECAN manually clears about 15 ha per
village of 300 workers (i.e., .05 ha per vorker). This land
is made available to the workers who may purchase
plantain/banana and sweet potato seedlings from HEVECAM,
which maintains a nursery for this purpose. The products
may be consumed by the producer or sold to the project
treasurer's offices at a puaranteed price. During Phase II,
116 ha have been cleared, and 60 ha vill be cleared during
Phase III for villages 11, 12, 13 and 14. In addition, a
plantain/banana plantation involving project workers on a 26
ha parcel vill be set up under a contract between the
company and volunteer workers. In this case, the vorkers
must repay the cost of the seedlings made available to them
and sell their production to the project treasurer's office;
-ii) by the smallholder planters on the estate and nearby:
HEVECAM helps the planter clear his own land (tree clearing
only), and the planter himse7f must finish the preparations.
HEVECAM provides the plants and undertakes to buy the
production at a fixed price. The program covers 20 ha of
additional land per year and should enable the rubber
planters to obtain an income before tapping;
(iii) by HEVECAM: the project itself vill develop 75 ha vith
sweet potatoes, plantain and manioc so as to meet rapidly
the food requirements and to improve crop-raising techniques
(seeding, maintenance, etc.) in cooperation with IRA (para
4.18). This operation vill serve as a support to large-
scale IRA operations, which vill provide its technical
ossistance.



- 27 -
All in all, these three programs are estimated to cost CFAF 281
million, or CFAF 56 million per year. According to the calculations, total
revenues from them vill exceed cumulative expenditure by the end of the
third year.
Main Problems
4.24      It vill be particularly important to ensure that smallholders and
planters rotate crops adequately, leaving areas fallow and introducing
nitrogenous plants to regenerate the soil.
(c)  Future Development of Rubber in Cameroon
4.25      In view of the favorable market prospects for rubber (para 6.04),
Government vishes to examine the feasibility of further expansion of rubber
in a regional program, carried out under the project and financed
completely by Covernment. Investigations would be made in (i) the Ocean
Department in which HEVECAM is located; (ii) the Centre Province; and (iii)
the East Province. With regard to the first of these areas, a survey vould
be made of three potential areas: to the south of Lobé; between Lookoundjé
and Kiendé; and between Lookoundjé and Nyong. The land suitability survey
vould comprise 15,000 ha in each case, so as to obtain a net planted area
of 7,000 ha. In respect to the second area, a socio-economic study would
be carried out in the Ntem Department to determine the feasibility of
integrating rubber into the traditional cocoa and food crops farming
systems. The conditions of the East Province differ considerably from
those in which rubber is presently cultivated in Cameroon, being at an
altitude of 600-700 m with a rainfall at 1500-1750 mm. The feasibility
study vould therefore include clone trials on three sites, each of 15 ha,
from which assessments of growth could be made some five years after
planting and also a broad evaluation of the physical and economic potential
of the area.
V. OBJECTIVES, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Objectives
5.01      The legal provisions under which HEVECAN vas founded (para 2.01)
gave it a dual mission:
-  The commercial activity of establishing the enterprise,
operating the production unit and marketing the production.
To this end, HEVECAM is governed by the provisions applicable
to limited-liability companies under private law;
-  To contribute, under the control of the public authorities, to
implementation of the economic and social development plan, in
particular to improve the living standards of vorkers in the
company and the surrounding population.



- 28 -
Supervision
5.02      Although the law does not rule out the possibility of private
sector participation in the share capital, it is currentlv held entirely by
the Government or public enterprises (para 2.01).
The Board of Management is composed of nine to twelve members
(eleven at present) appointed for three-year terms.  Tle Chairman of the
Board is appointed by the President of the Republic by decree, and the
Prefect of Ocean Department is an ex officio member. The "Office National
de Commercialisation des Produits de Base" (ONCPB) (National Office for the
Marketing of Primary Commodities) has two seats on the board by virtue of
its participation in the capital; for the same reason, the "Société
Nationale d'Investissement" (SNI) (National Investment Company) has one
seat.  The Covernment is represented bv two persons from the Ministry of
Agriculture, two from the Ministrv of Planning and Industry, one from the
Ministry of Finance and one Government Commissioner.
Management
5.03      In view of the stakes involved (CFAF 60 billion of investments in
1983 terms and nearly 6,000 jobs created), it is essential to assure that
the operation is managed in accordance vith sound commercial efficiency and
that, in particular, the management team is of high caliber and has the
necessary autonomy and responsibility. Upon founding the company, the
Governuent, under a technical assistance agreement signed on May 23, 1975,
turned over the responsibility for directing the operations of
establishing, maintaining and operating the project to a specialized firm
(the SAFACAM-Terres Rouges Group). This firm was to designate one of its
highly qualified staff to exercise the povers vested by lav on a General
Manager, and to vhom the Board of Management would delegate all other
povers necessary for the efficient management of the project. Furthermore,
during the period that Cameroonian staff with the required qualifications
and experience vere not available and subsequently during the time required
for their training, the SA`hlAA-Terres Rouges Croup undertook to make
personnel belonging to its. .wn organization or to sister companies
available to the project. Finally, SAFACAM-Terres Rouges vas to provide
its know-how, prepare the annual programs and the corresponding budgets,
conduct inspections everv six months, and train and improve the Cameroonian
staff. SAFACAM-Terres Rouges further undertook to handle marketing in the
event HEVECAM so requested, in accordance with terms to be agreed between
the parties when appropriate. A/
This agreement has been carried out in a highly satisfactory
manner since its inception. The personnel assigned have always been up to
the tasks, vhether in technical, administrative or fïnancial areas, and
A/ See general condition and condition of Board presentation in Addendum,
paras 2.03(b) and 2.04(b).



- 29 -
have been especially conscientious about ensuring the conditions for true
gradual replacement bv Cameroonian supervisors. In this regard, HEVECAM is
a fine example of the integration of national and expatriate staff in an
unified team where each carries out his duties effectively. Moreover, the
SAFACAM-Terres Rouges Group has truly benefited HEVECAN vith the experience
it has acquired in Cameroon and other areas of the vorld, in particular in
Asia.
This agreement vas valid for an eight-year term and renevable by
tacit agreement for successive periods of four years. The first reneval
occurred in May 1983, and it vill be necessarv to modifv its present
arrangements to take into account the transition from development to
production and marketing of rubber. The remuneration arrangements in the
management contract should be based to a greater degree on the results
obtained, in particular the self-generated funds. Moreover, the SAFACAM-
Terres Rouges Group, in its twice-yearly inspection reports, should
emphasize the comparative analysis between HEVECAM and other estates vith
regard to general overheads and operational costs, in particular the labor
costs. Likewise, particular attention should be paid to analyzing the
accounts and monitoring the cash flow.
Government will have to submit its proposals vith respect to the
modifications to be made in the p-resent arrangements two months prior to
the date of negotiations (para 1U.01(c)). A/
Procurement B/
5.04      Existing procedures for procurement were modified by Decrees
83/440 and 83/441 of September 1983. It -rill be necessary to assess
vhether this new procurement regulation vill give HEVECAM sufficient
autonomy in this respect.
Public and Social Service Activities
5.05      As indicated in paragraph 3.12, in order to identify clearlv the
operations pertaining to HEVECAM's two roles, the following arrangements
vill have to be made:
(i) maintain separate accounting records (Operations on Behalf
of Third Parties) and estabiish a special and suitable
financing arrangement for the public and social service
activities;
A/   Satisfactory proposals have meanwhile been received; see general
condition and condition of Board presentation in Addendum, paras
2.03(b) and 2.04(b).
B/   This section has been revised; see Addendum para 1.09.



- 30 -
(ii) specify these activities vithin the framework of a general
agreement between the Government and HEVECAM. This document
vould be a condition of effectiveness of the external loans
(para 10.05(a)).
Organization of REVECAM
5.06      The present organization of the project has been vell suited to
establishment operations and has born ample witness to its competence and
effectiveness. The technical management is sound and has been able to
respond with sufficient rapidity to the major problems encountered, in
particular the Fomes and Gloeosporium diseases, the hiring and training of
Cameroonian workers and supervisors. Generally speaking, the management
has been able to deal satisfactorily with all the problems brought about by
carrying out a vast agroindustrial operation in a particularly
underdeveloped area. Administrative, accounting and financial data are of
high quality and published regularly. In this regard, the quality of the
quarterly progress reports is exemplary. The current organizational
structure is illustrated by the organization chart at Annex I.
T'ais organization vill have to evolve in ordcar to deal with the
problems of the start-up operations and expanding production activities bv:
(i) gradually establishing decentralized management units:
(a) four field sectors of 3,750 ha each as each enters the
tapping stage;
(b)  an Industrial Department (DI) covering the factory,
shops, garages, and the maintenance of buildings and
housing; and
(c) a Central Services Department including the General
Management, the Administrative and Financial Department
(DAF), the Technical Studies Department (DET) and the
Agricultural Operations Department (DEA).
Each administrative unit should control all the relevant
activities and draw up administrative documents (analytical
budget, analytical accounts, statistics). Control vill be
exercised by DAF as regards the functioning of analytical
accounting systems and personnel management, by DET as
regards the technical standards for budget preparation, and
by the DG (management control) as regards management ratios,
the control of cost of operations, and the relationship
between the norms and the budgets.
The necessary coordination vill be provided by DEA for the
agricultural sections and DI for the industrial units.
(ii) Computerized processing of technical data (statistics),
budget data, and accounting and financial data. Before so



- 31 -
doing, HEVECAM vill have to simplify and harmonize
procedures so as to avoid a number of duplications in the
various published documents, to define an analytical
accounting plan which is more suitable, and to clearly
define procedures. A data processing team for the first
four years of the project is planned foi this purpose.
In any event, and for the life of the loans, the General Manager,
the Administrative and Financial Director, the Director of Technical
Research and the Industrial Director vill have to have qualifications and
experience deemed acceptable by the cofinanciers. This assurance should be
obtained at negotiations, as vas the case for the negotiation of Phase II
(para 10.03(a)).
Accounting Records and Documentation Required
5.07      In addition to SAFACAM's half-yearly inspection report (para
5.03), HEVECAN must continue its past practice of producing quar-erly
reports which make it possible to monitor developments as regard to
physical operations (production, labor, supervision, inputs, vehicles,
materials, processing, etc.), the cost price per operation, and the
financial situation. In particular, the half-vearly and annual reports
should highlight and analyze any major departures from the appraisal
report. The annual budgets should be forvarded to the cofinancierr for
examination before submittal to the Board of Management (para 10.03(d)).
Both the budgets and the annual balance sheets should also be compared with
the appraisal report forecasts. Assurances should be obtained at
negotiations to this effect (para 10.03(e)). A/
External Audits
5.08      HEVECAM should continue its past practice of using the services
of a qualified outside auditor, whose appointment should be approved by the
cofinanciers. The internal audit report should be submitced to the
cofinanciers four months following the end of the financial year, currently
June 30. This report must include all the customary verifications, in
particular:
(i) compliance vith all the stipulations as regards the origin
of goods and services in accordance with the various loan
agreements;
(ii) receipt and actual performance of goods and services;
(iii) payment for them;
A/   These assurances should include a Deputy General Manager; see general
condition in Addendum, paras 2.03(c), 2.03(f), and 2.03(g).



- 32 -
(iv) in the event these goods and services are financed by
external loans, their eligibility for such financing as vell
as their use as foreseen at appraisal; and
(iv)  special commentary on other expenditure not subject to
justification.
In addition, this report must verify HEVECAM's debt/equity ratio.
Assurances vith regard to the implementation of these arrangements should
be obtained during negotiations (para 10.03(c)).
Training and Replacement of Expatriate Supervisors
5.09      The training of the vork force has been provided by the project
since its inception. The grafting school, for example, has made it
possible to train specialized vorkers to a skill level comparable to that
prevailing at SAPH in Ivory Coast and other rubber companies in Malaysia
and Indonesia. The same effort has been successfully carried out in other
areas involving mechanics, electricity and construction. This effort must
nov be extended ta train tapping personnel. A tapping school vas set up in
1982; the first twelve tappers are obtaining good results.
The training of Cameroonian supervisors has also been an active
area and the 30 Cameroonian supervisors now in place are, as a whole, quite
competent 8/. However, experience in other similar projects has shown that
because of a high demand for university-trained supervisors (ENSA and
Polytechnic School), it vould not be possible to fill all the management
positions with nationals through this source. Annex II illustrates the
trend for supervisory personnel and the replacement of expatriate managers
by Cameroonians. This forecast vas carried out by the appraisal mission
folloving discussions vith, and vith the approval of, the General
Management of HEVECAM and representatives of the supervisory authority
par;icipating in the mission. Ai
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
Production of the Industrial Estate

July 1983. Pending the entrv into service of the two HEVECAM processing

facilities envisaged for early 1984 (para 2.12, footnote B) the latex gathered,
after coagulation in the cups, is currently processed in SAFACAM facilities at
Dizangue. Annex IV shows the provisional production from 1983/84 to 2017/2018.
Maximum output is expected to begin ih. fiscal year 1998/99.  During the five
years of the project, production vill it.crease from 721 t r,- to 12,799 tons,
the latter figure representing scarcely 38Z of annual pro uction in the peak
period. The total production during the five years of the project (29,910
tons) amounts to 3.4Z of the 873,000 tons expected during the 30 years of
tapping. In other vords, this third phase remains essentially a phase of
investment, and the self-generated funds of the proiect vill continue to be
quite limited during the period.
Duration of Production
6.02      During this appraisal, it was assumed as a vorking hypothesis that
the fields would not be replanted following 30 years of tapping. This vas, of
course, merely an assumption; unless the prospects for natural rubber are
extremely poor 30 years hence, it is quite obvious that it vill be in the
interest of the plantation to maintain its productive capacity by extending and
reneving the areas under cultivation as appropriate. The operation of
maintaining productive potential vould have to be undertaken out of
self-generated funds beginning in about the year 2000.
.Smai'riOlders' Program
6.03      The smallholder estates will begin to produce in the final year of
the project, 1988/89, vith 23 tons. Full production should be achieved in
2000/01, -wirh 675 tons. Total production anticipated from the 500 ha in the
program over a 30-year tapping period is about 17,500 tons.
World Market Prospects
6.04      From 1950 to 1979, vorld consumption of natural and synthetic rubber
increased from 2.4 million to 12.3 million tons and subsequently fell slightly
to 11.5 million tons in 1982. During that period, the share of natural rubber
decreased from 67Z of the total to approximately 30Z and in 1982 vas about 32%,
or some 3.7 million tons.
Analysis of the long-term prospects for natural rubber and its
competitiveness vis-a-vis synthetic elastomers have been the subject of
extensive study and debate. In 1980, the World Bank and FAO published a report
entitled "The World Rubber Economy: Structure, Changes, Prospects," which is a
good reference document. In addition, since World War II there has been an
International Group for Rubber Research, with headquarrers in London, vith
representatives from almost all the countries in the vorld, that produce and
consume natural and synthetic rubbers; it also has observers from the major
international organizations concerned (FAO, UNCTAD, World Bank, International
Rubber Research and Development Board (IRRDB), research institutes, etc.).
Growth prospects and projected prices for all elastomers depend
heavily on assumptions about oil prices, and recent projections have shown
great variation. Bank forecasts indicate a steady growth in elastomer demand



- 34 -
to about 21 million tons in the year 2000, and relative stability in the
proportion of natural rubber required. Assuming a share for natural rubber of
30Z, the annual demand for natural rubber vould therefore be some 6.3 million
tons, an increase of 2.6 million tons (70%) over present production. Provided
that HEVECAM rubber remains competitive, there should be no problem in
marketing the relatively minor annual production of 30,000 tons.
Producers and Consumers of Natural Rubber
6.05      Three producers provided almost 80% of the 3,735,000 tons of natural
rubber in 1982: Malayssia, with 1,517,000 t (41%); Indonesia, vith 878,000 t
(23Z); and Thailand, with 552,000 t ('5%).  The African continent (essentially
West Africa), with 165,000 t, accounts for scarcely 4% of world production.
Used primarily for the manufacture of tires (60 to 70% of total
consumption), particularly radial tires, natural rubber is consumed largely by
the most developed industrial countries: United States, 585,000 t (35%);
Japan, 439,000 t (12Z); EEC, 650,000 t (18Z). Consumption patterns are thus
particularly influenced by developments in the automobile industry. Per capita
consumption is about 15 kg/year in the United States, 10 kg/year in Europe, and
less than 3 kg/year in the Third World. Consumption in China, for example, is
roughly 0.5 kg/year. The potential market is hence very large, not to mention
the fact that research programs leave hope for improvements in quality for new
uses (rubber with stabilized viscosity, thermoplastic rubber, liquid rubber,
etc.).
Although limited for the time seing, Africa's production is growing
rapidly, and its share in the world market should be able to increase in the
future: it is unlikely that Malaysia and Indonesia can continue to develop this
crop at the same pace as in the past because of the problems of competition for
land with other crops and for labor.
Market Organization and Prices
6.06      Within UNCTAD, an International Natural Rubber Organization was
created on October 6, 1979 and ratified in 1982 by all the States concerned.
This provides for the establishment of a maximum buffer stock of 550,000 tons
(15% of production), financed half by exporting countries and half by importing
countries. It is probable that the establishment of this organization in 1982,
even though it vas only confined to natural rubber, made it possible to halt
the rapid decline in prices which started at the end of 1980 and to help bring
about the recovery which began in 1983. As of January 1984, the c.i.f. price
of rubber in Europe vas about US$1,250 per ton, or CFAF 490 per kilogram using
the exchange rate of CFAF 392 as applied in this report or CFAF 545 per
kilogram at the current exchange rate. It appeared reasonable for appraisal
purposes to retain the World Bank's long-term assumptions (revised July 7 and
confirmed in October 1984 for RSS1 c.i.f. New York). Hovever, during the rive
years of the project, in order to estimate carefully the gross self-generated
funds, it vas decided to apply a 10% deduction to the project's rurnover. The
SAFACAM management contract (para 5.03) vill be expanded to include rubber
marketing arrangements.



- 35 -
Finally, the various grades produced vere taken into account so as to
determine the average price of HEVECAM output in terms of the projected price
for RSSI:

VII.  PROJECT COST AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS A/
Total Project Cost
7.01      The total cost for the five years of the project is CFAF 34,808
million (US$88.8 million). The cost has been calculated:
(i) exclusive of interest during construction on Phase III
financing (CFAF 4,207 million, or US$10.7 million) because
of the onlending proposals examined below. It should be
noted that under the existing arrangements for the onlending
of the HEVECAM I and REVECAM II loans, there are no
financial charges relating to the first tvo projects during
the five years of HEVECAM III;
(ii) exclusive of all taxes vith the exception of those which,
not being readily identifiable, are normally included in the
cost of the project (approximately 8%). This question vill
be re-examined below;
(iii) inclusive of physical contingencies calculated at various
rates depending on the nature of the operations (average
4.4Z) and price contingencies (based on 15% per annum for
local costs and for foreign exchange costs 7.5Z per annum in
1984/85, 7X in 1985/86, and 6% thereafter). Baseline costs
AI   This chapter has been amended; See Addendum, Part I.



- 36 -
are expressed in mid 1983/84 terms, using available data, in
particular those from the CEC's 1983/84 international
competitive bidding documents. In total, contingencies
represent 45Z of the base cost and 31% of the total cost.
On average, the foreigu exchange component is about 34% (CFAF
11,850 million, US$30 million).

7.02      The cost of the project has been broken down into three major
categories:
(i)  completion of the 15,000 ha industrial estate, as discussed
in paragraphs 4.01 to 4.17 above, except for the activities
of the public and social services carried out by HEVECAM on
behalf of the Goverument, described in paragraph 4.15;
(ii)  operations carried out by REVECAM on behalf of the
Government as described in paragraphs 4.18 to 4.24 plus the
public and social service activities discussed in paragraph
4.15;
(iii)  working capital requirements, taking into account the
increased need for spare parts resulting from the increase
in processing and transportation capacities, a requirement
for operating liquidity calculated to cover tvo months of
operating expenditure and 1.5 months of sales, and a lag
between the expenditures and their reiabursement by external
co-donors' loans.
Proposed Financing Plan and Disbursements
7.03      The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 9.  External loans
total CFAF 18,448 million (US$47 million), or 53% of the project cost, with
the balance being provided by the Government--CFAF 11,894 million (US$30.4
million), or 34Z-and by HEVECAM-CFAF 4,466 million (US$11.4 million), or
13Z. It has been assumed that the external loans would apply only to the
program for completing the 15,000 ha, vhile the operations carried out on
behalf of the Gover.aent are financed 100Z by the Government, and the
working capital is funded by the Government and REVECAM's own resources.
7.04      The assumptions used for the external loans are as follovs:
IBRD        CCCE         CDC           EIB
Amount (CFAF million)   4,613        4,613        4,613        4,609
(US$ million)            11.8         11.8        11.8          11.8
Loan Period               20 years   20 years    20 years      15 years
Grace Period               5 years    5 years      7 years      5 years
Indicative Annual
Interest Rate             10.50%     10.00Z       10.00%        8.00O
Front-end Fee              0.25%        -          0.50Z          -
Commitment Charge          0.75%        --         0.75%        1.00%

All these loans vill be made to the Government; the folloving
chapter discusses the on-lending arrangements for these loans between the
Government and HEVECAM so as to take into account the latter's capacity to
sustain debt service and taxation. Signature of this financing agreement
will be a condition of effectiveness of the IBRD and CDC loans and one of a
disbursement conditions for CCCE (para 10.05(d)). A/ Moreover, the
smallholder program totally financed by the Governient, will be carried out
by HEVECAN under a credit agreement vith FONADER, to be signed before March
31, 1985, which vill also have to be approved by the cofinanciers (para
10.03(g)). Government will have to guarantee that at all times the net
vorking capital vill be such as to be able to finance the net operating
cycle calculated on the basis of tva months' turnover and one and one-half
months' operating expenditure exclusive of financial costs, including any
short-term bank assistance the company might obtain. Moreover, Government
will have to undertake to provide sufficient equity funds to the project to
cover, for the life of the project, the gap between capital investment
outlays and their repayment by external financing. This assurance should
be obtained during negotiations (para 10.02(a)). B/
7.05      With the exception of the management contract and the light
vehicles and equipment (CFAF 480 million, or US$1.2 million), which are
financed 100 percent by CCCE, 9/ as well as the factory (CFAF 4,609
million, or US$11.8 million), financed 100 percent by EIB, the other goods
and services will be purchased by the project in accordance vith World Bank
procedures and in compliance vith prevailing Cameroonian legislation.
Hovever, the possibilities for increasing the flexibility of Cameroonian
procurement procedures as they apply to HEVECAM, vill be studied during
negotiations with a view to increasing their efficiency.
7.06      The disbursement assumptions are given in tables 10 and 11, where
costs have been detailed by colenders. For external sources of funds, a
lag of four months has been estimated between the date of expenditure and
actual disbursement.
7.07      The IBRD, CCCE, CDC and EIB loans vould be linked by a
cross-effectiveness clause. C/ Finally, Goverument should guarantee the
satisfactory outcome of operations during and after the five-year period of
the project.
AI  See condition of effectiveness in Addendum, para 2.05(b).
B/   See general condition in Addendum, para 2.02(d).
9/   See Annex VI.
C/   See condition of effectiveness in Addendum, para 2.05(c).

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Situation Prior To Amenduents
General Conditions
8.01      At the present time, HEVECAM benefits from:
(i) an "Establishment Agreement" signed April 30, 1976 (see para
2.04) which enables the company to benefit from Regime C of
the Investment Code. Under the terms of this agreement,
HEVECAM is exempt from payment of import and export duties
for a period of ten years and from Company tax for the first
five years of operation;
(ii) a financing agreement for the REVECAN I loans stipulating
the on-lending terms to the company of the loans contracted
by the Government with external cofinanciers. A similar
financing agreement vas concluded December 6, 1979 to
stipulate the onlending terms for the HEVECAM II loans.
HEVECAN I Onlending
8.02      Interpretation of the HEVECAM I financing agreement raises no
problems.
(j) the actual cost of Phase 1, closed at June 30, 1979, is CFAF
6,717 million (including inventories for CFAF 374 million);
(ii) the corresponding financing, part of which vas provided
after June 30, 1979, amounted to CFAF 7,778 mîll'on, broken
down as follows:

Initial deposit (national sources)                       300.0
Further ïncreases                                      3,328.4

Long-term loan, United Republic of Cameroon            3,561.1
Onlending of part of CCCE loan              759.7
Onlending of part of IDA credit           2,801.4
Interest earned                                          103.2
Local sources of funds amounted to CFAF 2,876.1 million as
compared to the originally projected CFAF 1,745 million estimated
at appraisal.
(iii) Onlending terms to HEVECAM of IDA credit and CCCE loan to
Government: the onlending agreement provides that the funds
from these two loans would partially cover:
(a) agricultural operations, the cost of buildings and
infrastructure, the purchase of equipment and material
as well as fixed costs:
major onlending: 15% as capital increase
85% long-term loan from United
Republic of Cameroon to HEVECAM.
The terms of this loan are clearly described:
Amount: 85% of the (real) expenditures referred to
above, or CFAF 3,561.1 million computed at the end of
the investment period.
Term: 30 years with a grace period (principal and
interest) of 15 years.
Interest rate: 5.50% per annum.
Repayment:  30 half-yearly installments of CFAF 175.9
million each (principal and interest) beginning March
1, 1991.



- 44 -
(b) Operations to develop food crops, research associated with
the project, and the cost of technical assistance.
Onlending in the form of a subsidy.
As a consequence, HEVECAM's debt service from Phase I is limited
to the repayment of the loan of CFAF 3,561.1 million, or an
annual cost (from March 1991 to September 2006) of CFAF 351.8
million.
HEVECAM II Onlending
8.03      The HEVECAM II financing agreement, based on estimated
disbursements at the end of Phase II, is analyzed as follows:
(i) the total cost of Phase II as of June 30, 1984 is estimated
at CFAF 24,601 million (paras 2.15 and 2.16).
The financing made available to HEVECAN as of that date will
be as follows:
Capital increase                                  5,550
From domestic funds           4,550
Refinanced by CCCE            1,000
Subsidies                                         1,831
From domestic funds           1,050
Refinanced by CCCE              781
Long-term loan, United Republic of Cameroon    17,151
Onlending of total loan
IDA + IBRD                8,425 10/  A/
CDC                       6,507
Partial onlending of CCCE
loan                      2,219
(ii)  The onlending terms are as follows (Articles II and III of
the financing agreement):
10/ The IDA credit, which was the first mobilized, has been fully
utilized. In contrast, US$5.6 million of the IBRD 70an, or CFAF 2,178
million equivalent, would not be made available for Phase II pending
study by the World Bank of Government's proposals for its use.
A/   These remaining funds are being used to finance an extension of Phase
II; see footnote to para 2.16.



- 45 -
Anount: to be determined, at the end of the investment,
upon examination of the amount of external financing
actually received, or approximately CFAF 17,151 million.
Term:  20 years with a grace period (principal and interest)
of 10 years.
Interest rate: In accordance with Article III, Section
3.02, it vili be set at the end of the Phase II investment
period and calculated in such a way as to permit repayment
to the Government of:
- all the amounts disbursed (in terms of CFA francs)
against the IDA, IBRD and CDC loans;
- the proportion of the CCCE loan onlent in loan form;
- interest and other financial costs borne by the
Government in implementation of the variaus agreements
concerning credits with IDA, IBRD, CDC and CCCE, on
the proviso that:
-  any moratory interest whicb may eventually be
charged vill not be passed on to REVECAM;
-  the charges on the IDA credit will be calculated on
the basis of the terms applicable to the Bank loan
(term, interest rate and commitment charge);
Repayment: 20 equal, half-yearly installments (principal
and interest), the first falling due on June 1, 1990.
(iii)  Examination of the financing agreement and of the covering
letter to the cofinanciers shows that REVECAM is to repay to
the Governuent, after the end of the ten-year grace period
and aver the folloving ten years, the folloving annual
amounts:
- all the loans received (i.e., CFAF 17,151 million), with
the Government bearing all exchange risks to avoid any
impact on REVECAM;
- all interest paid by Governuent to the cofinanciers (CFAF
14,686 million), in accordance with the loan agreements
between the Government and the cofinanciers.
HEVECAN III Loans
8.04      In accordance with the terms set forth in paragraph 7.04, the
total external loans envisaged for financing Phase III, amounting to CFAP
18,448 million, vill incur a total financial charge of CFAF 18,377 million.



- 4 6 -
It is assumed that HEVECAN vill fully support the debt service on
these external loans in accordance vith the same terns and repayment
schedule.

Taxation
8.05      In view of the provisions of HEVECAM's incorporation agreement,
it should pay full import and export duties, as of fiscal 1986/87. In
addition, after the first five years of operations, it will also pay the
company tax (38.5%) as well as all other taxes for which HEVECAM is (or
should be) presently exempted, either under the "Establishment Agreement"
or under the external loan agreements.
Impact on Projected Cash Position
8.06      Table 13 provides, in simplified form, the estimated cash-flow
for the 15,000 ha HEVECAM operation 11/ under its present contract, without
amendments.  To facilitate calculations, the evaluation of taxation
estimates has been confined to taxes on production costs, imports and
sales. The company tax has not yet been taken into account. Finally,
calculations were made only through 2005.
During the five years of the project, REVECAN would have to pay
an additional sum of CFAF 9,954 million, representing CFAF 4,207 million of
interiim interest and CFAF 5,747 million In taxes. The net annual cash flow
shows a deficit during another four years and the cumulative total does not
become positive until 2000. HEVECAM would thus register a structural
deficit for many years that would require sizable Government subsidies
annually. This structural deficit is not due to a lack of productivity by
HEVECAM or the rubber sector in Cameroon. It is simply the result of the
long gestation period required before a hectare of rubber reaches full
production. Two years are required to prepare the land and the plant
stock, followed by seven years before the first tapping, and another seven
years before reaching full production.
11/ All the 15,000 ha operations, excluding smallholder estates, food
crops and development of hevea rubber cultivation in the south central
and eastern parts of the country.

B. Financial Situation Following Amendments
To take this situation into account, the cofinanciers propose two
series of adjustments, the first concerning the terms of financing and the
second the tax status of the project.
Adjustments to Onlending Terms (see Annex VIII concerning HEVECAM I and
HEVECAN II onlending terms)
8.07      The proposed adjustments are as follows:
HEVECAM I:     The existing onlending terms, 15 years grace + 15 years
repayment, remain unchanged.
REVECAM II:    The existing onlending terms, 10 years grace + 10 years
repayment, would be modified as follows: 13 years grace + 7
years repayment. This leaves the 20-year total life of the
loan unchanged.
HEVECAM III:   The following onlending terms are proposed: 10 years grace
+ 10 years repayment.
Exchange risk:  It is proposed that the Governnent, as borrower of
foreign exchange, bear the exchange risk, and onlend to
HEVECAM in local currency.
These arrangements do not, therefore, change the basic principles
already accepted, under which HEVECAM repays to Governuent the total
financial costs it bears in nominal teras, with the exception of possible
exchange differences. On the other hand, they do improve the progressive
nature of BEVECAM's debt service, making it compatible vith the rising pace
of production.
Grace Period     Repayment        Total
HE=CAM I            15 years        15 years       30 vears
HEVECAM II           13 years        7 years       20 years
HEVECAK III          10 years       10 years       20 years
Table 14 summarizes the debt service of HEVECAM 1, Il and III
following amendments.

Changes in Taxation A/
8.08      The cofinanciers have duly noted Government's concern with
adjusting the tax status of development companies to take into account
their special purpose. In the case of an agro-industrial company like
REVECAM (as is the case for oil palm companies), its special nature lies
essentially in the fact that it takes many years to establish the
plantation and much more time is required before a planted hectare reaches
full production.
These time lags, as noted, are much longer than those customarily
required for an industrial investment project, which is the frame of
reference used as the basis for establishing the Investment, Customs and
Tax Codes.
It is consequently less a particular tax status that HEVECAM
needs than a special provision within the common law governing commercial
companies, since it is a commercial company.
A/  This section has been substantially revised; see Addendum, para 1.14.

After an in-depth analysis, the cofinanciers propose that the
REVECAM company be exempted from all tax and customs duties (import and
export duties, company taxes, business license tax, turnover tax, special
company taxes, registration fees, etc.) as long as it has not reached a
sufficiert maturity ratio, i.e., as long as 50% of the area under
cultivation has not reached full production (fiscal year 1994/95). The
promulgation of a law or regulations setting forth the adjusted tax
arrangement would be a condition of effectiveness of the loans (para
10.05(b)). A/
Provisional HEVECAM Accounts Following Amendments
8.09      Tables 15, 16 and 17 show the financial prospects for REVECAM
after adjustment of the onlending terms and taxation system.  These three
tables relate solely to the operations of the 15,000 ha program as vell as
the proposed subsidized public and social service activities of HEVECAM.
Normally, if the cofinanciers' proposals are accepted, expenses of these
public and social services should not appear on REVECAM's accounts, but in
a separate account labelled "Operations carried out on behalf of the
Governuent" (see para 4.15 above).
C. Financial Rate of Return
8.10      Financial rates of return have been calculated for the 34-vear
project life. The investment costs of HEVECAN I and II have been taken
into account, including taxes, financial requirements for stocks, working
capital and interest payment for loans. All costs have been expressed in
constant 1983/84 terms. Benefits have been accrued from rubber sales at
constant 1983/84 projected World market prices. The analysis vas first
carried out for the 15,000 ha plantation by taking into account only its
related investment and operating costs and then extended to the total
project by including all other social activities (except the smallholder
program).  The financial rate of return for the smnallholder program vas
analyzed separately. The Financial Rates of Return are as follows:
Plantation      Total         Smallholder
(15,000 ha)    Project a/      Program
FRR %        FRR Z           FRR Z
1.   Point Estimate                10.24          9.37            8.98
2.   Sensitivity

Benefits increase by 20%   14.15          13.19           12.13

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
9.01      The third phase of the project which commenced in 1975 vould
complete the 15,000 ha industrial scale plantation in à sparsely populated
and hitherto largely neglected forest region. In the prolect area, forest
of little economic value has gradually been replaced by high value rubber
plantings. Rubber has become a priority crop in Government's development
plans due to its value in foreign exchange earnings and its suitability for
the rather infertile soils of the lowland humid tropics. The plantation's
average annual production of 32,000 tons during the 20-year period of
stable production (1994-2013). at the projected World market price, vould
generate at least US$41.0 million in foreign exchange (in 1983/84 dollars)
per year. This vould help reduce the country's present heavy dependence on
cocoa and coffee for agricultural export earnings.
9.02      The project, through its association with IRCA and its own
experimentation program, would improve the technological base for the
Cameroon rubber industry.
Economic Rate of Return
9.03      Economic rates of return have been calculated for the 34-year
project life of HEVECAM III. All costs vere taken from the very beginning
of the project and, therefore, include investuent, recurrent and
exploitation costs, taking account of production, transportation and
marketing costs. Two principal analyses vere carried out; firstly,
excluding the costs of the supplementary activities such as the rubber
development program, the food crops program and the provision of social
services; and secondly, with the inclusion of the costs of these
supplementary activities. The smallholder program vas analyzed separately.
9.04      All costs are exclusive of taxes and inclusive of physical
contingencies. Foreign exchange costs have been calculated on the basis of
US$1.00 = CFAF 392, while local costs have been adjusted by a standard
conversion factor of 0.77 to take into account the present overevaluation
of the CFAF. Labor vas costed at net vages after taxes, which is
considered to represent its opportunity cost.
9.05      The quantifiable benefits directly attributable to the project
would be derived from the sale of rubber on export markets. The price of
rubber vas derived from the July 1983 World Bank projections for RSSI Spot
New York and is expressed in 1983/84 dollars. The prices for plantation
rubber and smallholder rubber are discounted by 4 and 10% respectively to
reflect the average price of the different qualities of crumb rubber
produced by the two types of producers. Other addïtional benefits that
would accrue to the Kribi region as a result of infrastructure development
are difficult to quantify. These are, therefore, excluded from the
analysis. The detailed derivation of the economic cost and benefit streams
is presented ïn the project files under the assumptions listed above. The
economic rate of return results are summarized as follows:

a/ Excluding smallholder program.
9.06      The ERRs indicate that the project vould be profitable even if
the costs of supplementary programs vere included. HEVECAM, as an
entreprise, vould have an ERR of about 16%. The overall project vould have
an ERR of about 15%. The smallholder program would have an ERR comparable
to that of the overall projet.
Sensitivity Tests
9.07      The following sensitivity analysis compared the impact of changes
in costs, benefits, prices, yields and lags in benefits to the rate of
return and net present values of the industrial plantation, the overall
project and the smallholder program.

9.08      The analysis shows that the total project, excluding the
smallholder program, can effectively withstand the impact of a 10% change
in costs, benefits, prices, or yields: the ERR would be above the 12%
estimate for the opportunity cost of capital in all these cases. Costs
would have to increase by 20% or benefits would have to drop by 20% for
project rates of return to decline below 12%. Alternatively, the
sensitivity analysis of the ERR to changes in costs and benefits expressed
in terms of switching values at the 12% opportunity cost of capital shows
that either a shortfall in benefits of 15% or a rise in cost of 17% would
reduce the ERR to 12%.
9.09      Prices and yields are the major determinarts of the project's
benefits. If the World market price should drop by 10% ir 15%, the ERR of
the total project vould decrease from 15% to 13% and 12% respectively.  A
yield reduction of 15% or 20% would bring the ERR down to 13% or 12%. A



- 59 -
delay in the timing of benefits by one year or two years would result in a
reduction of the ERR to 13Z and 11Z respectively.
9.10      Both the plantation and the smallholder programs have ERRs that
are not very sensitive to changes in the key parameters. For instance,
with a 20% increase in costs, the ERR continues to exceed 12% for both
programs; while with a 20% decrease in benefits, the ERR slips to just
below 12%.
Risks
9.11      In the first and second projects, the supply of adequate labor
and the stability of the labor force vere considered possible problems. In
this connection the project has not encountered major problems. Some 50%
of the labor force nov has more than two years service vith over 80Z less
than 30 years of age. This is in large part due to the satisfactory social
benefits provided by the plantation and the active program of training
labor in the specifie tasks of the plantation.
9.12      The major risk is that HEVECAN might become afflicted vith the
same problems of maintaining efficient commercial operation as encountered
by CAMDEV and SOCAPALM folloving the transition from the development to the
exploitation stage. The SAFACAM management contract vould be reinforced in
terms of its performance requirements and this is considered an adequate
safeguard during the project period. In the longer term, the positive
dialogue between Covernment and the Bank on the corrective measures
required for the parastatals (albeit that this dialogue is still at an
earlv stage), and the policy statement of intent for the oil lpalm and
rubber sub-sector anticipated at negotiations should provide the necessary
Government support for the efficient operation of the parastatal
plantations.
9.13      The principal agricultural risk vould be Gloeosporium leaf
disease. The disease, however, is well known in the rubber world.
Promising control measures have been developed and are being activelv
refined by HEVECAM's technical department in coordination with the I.R.C.A.
Research Institute. The precautions incorporated in the project design are
considered adequate for attainment of the estimated yields.

X.  CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS A/
10.01     Two months pricr to negotiations, Government should provide the
cofinanciers with:
(a) evidence of the budgetary provisions of the CFAF 1,990 million
required 12/ to bring the cash position of the company at the end
of Phase Il in June 1984 to the equivalent of four months'
operations, in accordance vith clause 4.01 of the IBRD Credit
Agreement of April 18, 1980 (para 2.16);
(b)  evidence of action to rehabilitate the Ed-a-Kribi and Kribi-Niité
roads (para 3.10);

the proposed SAFACAM marketing contract (para 5.03);
(d) the proposed adjustments in the tax status of HEVECAM (para
8.08).
10.02     During negotiations, the Governuent should agree to the following
points:
(a) HEVECAM's vorking capital and self-generated funds vould, at all
times, be sufficient to cover its production cycle and the gap
between its investment expenditures and their related financing
by external sources of funds (para 7.04); and
(b) to ensure regular maintenance of the Niét&-Kribi and Kribi-Edea
roads (para 3.10).
10.03     During negotiations, HEVECAM should agree to the following:

procedures (para 5.07) and external auditing (para 5.08), adapted
to the date of production start-up;
A/   This chapter has been substantially revised; see Addendum, Part Il.
12/  This amount vas calculated during appraisal in October 1983.  It
should be updated based on the use of HEVECAN II credits and the
company's financial situation.



- 61 -
(c) to update the present arrangements with SAFACAN for management
and marketing contracts; HEVECAN would consult vith the
cofinanciers before any termination, suspension or amendment of
these arrangements (para 10.01(c));

CANEROON
THIRD HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT
ADDENDUM TO CCCE STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT i/
I.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINA' ING ARRANGEMENTS 2/
Project Costs
1.01      The project has the following three major cost components (see
Addendum Tables 1 and 2):
(a) completion of industrial estate development, as discussed in
CCCE report paragraphs 4.01 to 4.17, except for public and
social service activities carried out by HEVECAM on behalf
of the Government;
(b) operations carried out by HEVECAM on behalf of the
Government as described in CCCE report paragraphs 4.18 and
4.19 plus the public and social service activities discussed
in paragraph 4.15; and
(c) working capital requirements, taking into account the need
for spare parts resulting from the increase in processing
and transportation capacities, and liquidity covering four
months of operating expenditures.
1.02      The total cost of the project would be CFAF 32.8 billion (US$83.7
million) including taxes and contingencies over a four and a half year
period. Identifiable taxes account for CFAF 3.2 billion (US$8.2 million)
or 9.8% of total project cost, leaving a total net of taxes of CFAF 29.6
billion (US$75.5 million). Substantial investments have already been made
under the first and second projects in heavy equipment, vehicles and
materials. With the plantation nov entering into the production phase, the
third project vould include a high proportion of local operating costs. and
the foreign exchange component vould only be 35% or CFAF 11.5 billion
(US$29.3 million).
1.03      Baseline costs have been estimated by CCCE in mid-1983 prices.
To retain consistency with CCCE's appraisal report and working documents,
this cost base has been retained here. Thus, price increases since mid
1/   This Addendum has been prepared by the World Bank.
2/   This Part, including Addendum Tables 1 to 4 replaces Chapter VII of
CCCE Report.

1983 have been ïncladed in the contingencies; they have, however, been
verified with actual price developments through November 1984 and have been
found ta be acceptable. Likewise, cost estimates are based on the exchange
rate used bv CCCE of US$1.00 - CFAF 392, prevailing at appraisal. The use
of the exchange rate currently applied by the Bank (US$1.00 = CFAF 418)
could lead to savings in the loan amount of about 52 which, if materiali-
zed, would be cancelled upon project completion. Since Government and the
other donors have specifically requested the Bank to respect CCCE's cost
estimates and financing plan, the former exchange rate has been used in
this report.
1.04      Total contingencies amount to 47% of base costs and 32% of total
costs. Physical contingencies, estimated at various rates depending on the
nature of the operations, average 4% of base costs. Price contingencles
for local costs vere calculated at 15% for all years of the project, and
for foreign cost at 7.5% for 1983/84 and 1984/85, 7% for 1985/86 and 6% for
the remaining three years of the proJect. The price escalation factors
follov estimates of annual Cameroonian inflation for local costs and
forecasts of international inflation for foreign supplied goods and
services.
Proposed Financing
1.05      The proposed financing plan is shown in Addendum Table 3.
External loans would total CFAF 17,100 million (US$43.7 million) or 52Z of
total costs (58% of project costs net of taxes) vith the balance being
provided by the Government - CFA 11,400 million (US$29.0 million) or 35% of
total costs and by HEVECAM - CPAF 4,300 million (US$11.0 million) or 13% of
total costs. The external loans would apply only to the plantation
development program, in a mixture of parallel and joint financing, while
operations carried out on behalf of the Government vould be financed 100%
by the Governient and vorking capital would be funded by the Governient and
BEVECAM's own resources.
1.06      The contributions of the four externa1 loans and their terms
would be as follows:
Amounts          X of                   Terms
US$      CFAF     Project Cost  Interest  Period  Grace Period

CCCE      11,800     4,610         15.5         8.6        20         5
CDC       11,800      4,610        15.5         9          20         7
EIB       11,800     4,610         15.5         8          15         5
Total     43 700    17 100         57.5
The proposed Bank loan of US$8.3 million -would include a capitalized
front-end fee of US$20,698. All external loans would be made to the

Page 3 of 8
Government and passed on to REVECAM under a financing agreement agreed upon
in draft form at negotiations. The CCCE, CDC and EIB loans would be passed
on to HEVECAM at the rates charged to Government. However, in line vith
Bank policy, Bank loan proceeds would be passed on at a rate incorporating
a premium of one percentage point. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by HEVECAM. A condition of effectiveness would be the signature by
Government and HEVECAM of the financing agreement stipulating these
on-lending conditions as well as arrangements for the financing and
execution of public and social services activities in the HEVECAN area
(Addendum para 2.04(a)). All four loans would be linked by a
cross-effectiveness clause (Addendum para 2.04(b)).
1.07      Parallel financing amounting to US$29.6 million would be arranged
as follows:
(a)  CCCE:  100% of light vehicles and equipment and technical
assistance (US$3.1 million);
(b) EIB: 100% of factory (US$11.8 miJlion);
<c) HEVECAM: 100% of the indirect cost of plantation labor
(US$1.2 million); and
<d) Government: 100% of experimentation and social service
operations for Government's account (US$13.5 million).
Joint financing would be applied to the remainder of the plantation
development program of US$42.6 million in the following shares: Bank 19Z;
CCCE 20%; CDC 28%; HEVECAM 6%; and Covernment 27%.  Finally, working
capital requirements of US$11.50 million would be financed jointly by
HEVECAM (63Z) and the Government (37Z).
1.08      During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that: (a)
Government vould ensure that HEVECAM's liquid assets would at all times be
kept at a level sufficient to cover its investment and operating
expenditures (including its tax liabilities) for a four-month period
(Addendum para 2.01(d)); and (b) HEVECAM vould obtain the Bank's agreement
before incurring any new debt that would raise the ratio of debt to equity
above 2.8 until 1992 and 2 thereafter, and vould increase its annual debt
service to more than hnlf its projected annual revenues (Addendum para
2.02(e)).
Procurement
1.09      Items to be financed on a parallel basis amounting to US$29.6
million would be procured according to each co-donors' own procurement
guidelines (Addendum para 1.07). For all other items financed jointly,
procurement arrangements would follow Bank guidelines. Contracts for
US$150,000 or more would be avarded through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance vith Bank guidelines. Contracts for goods
below US$150,000 but more than US$50,000 would be awarded through local
competitive bidding procedures (LCB), acceptable to the Bank. For

carried out by HEVECAN on force account with a limited amount of local

attract foreign bidders and suitable local contractors are not
available in the area. Civil works in Douala, however, would be

Disbursement
1.10      Bank disbursements would be based on the following categories and
amounts:
Disbursement Categories of IBRD Loan
Amount         Percentage of Expenditure
Category                        US$'000              Financed by IBRD
1)  Civil Works                   1,400         19% of total expenditure
2)  Vehicles, Equipment             450         19% of total expenditure
3) Plantation Development
Costs                         2,450         19% of total expenditure
4) Management and Administrative
Services                      3,150        19% of total expenditure
5)  Front-End Fee                    21
6)  Unallocated                     829
Total                             8,300
The Bank would not accept a reimbursement application for less than
US$50,000 equivalent. Disbursements against category 2 would be fully
documented. Disbursements against categories 1, 3 and 4 vould be made
against statements of expenditure (SOEs). Full supporting documentation
showing costs incurred and work completed would be reta±ned for inspection
by the Bank during project supervision. HEVECAM has a satisfactory cost
accounting svstem, and experience under the first and second projects has
shown the SOEs provided to have been accurate. Control would be reinforced
by specific verification provided by the external auditors (CCCE report,
para 7.07). 
1.11      A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Addendum Table
4.  It is estimated that the Bank loan woul- be disbursed over about five
years, three years shorter than the Regionwide historical profile for the
tree crop sub-sector in West Africa.  This shorter disbursement period is
realistic because of the lower probability of delays. First. HEVECAM is an
ongoing operation not subject to the start-up delays experienced elsewhere.
Second, the planting program has been completed and the project does not
include major investment items that could be delayed. Finally, HEVECAM's
disburseinent department has an excellent crack record in preparing and
processing disbursement applications.

Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
1.12      HEVECAN vould, within the context of its financial accounting
system, keep records consistent with sound accourting practices and
adequate to reflect both its general financial situation and the detailed
costs of its operations. HEVECAM would submit quarterly reports to the
Government and the colenders containing sunmarv financial information. The
report would show actual against budgeted expenditures and would also
relate physical progress achieved to target objectives. In addition to
these quarterly reports, half yearly inspection reports would continue to
be prepared jointly by SAFACAM and REVECAM and vould be submitted to the
Government and the colenders. HEVECAM's annual operating and investment
budgets would be made available to the colenders for comments prior to
final approval bv its Board of Management. Moreover, within six months
after the Bank loan closing date, HEVECAM would prepare a completion report
for submission to the Bank. Assurances regarding the application of these
arrangements were obtained at negotiations (Addendum para 2.02(f)).
1.13      HEVECAM would continue, as under the first and second projects,
to appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank for the annual
auditing of its accounts. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank
vithin six months after the close of each financial year, that is, not
later than December 31 of each year. The auditor's opinion on project
expenditures would include verification whether goods and services financed
by the Bank have been procured from eligible suppliers and a special
opinion on HEVECAN's submissions of statements of expenditures. In
addition the auditor's opinion vould include a verification of HEVECAM's
debt to equity ratio. Assurances regarding the application of these
arrangements were obtained during negotiations (Addendum para 2.02(g)).
Taxes 3/
1.14      Ideally, HEVECAM's present tax exemption status should be
extended until 50Z of the planted area reaches full production (approxi-
mately in 1993). International agreements between UDEAC countries (Custom
Union of Central African Countries) and national laws, however, preclude
the adaptation of tax arrangements to the long gestation period of a rubber
plantation. The Government has formally agreed to extend these tax
exemptions urtil the end of project execution (lune 30, 1989). Thereafter,
and depending on HEVECAM's projected cash flow requirements, tax levies
would be either reimbursed ex post, or compensated by operating subsidies
or capital increases so as to maintain an acceptable level of liquidity.
To that effect, an understanding was reached at negotiations.
