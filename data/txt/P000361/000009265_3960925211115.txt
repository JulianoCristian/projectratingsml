MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Cameroon
Third HEVECAM Rubber Project (Loan 2485-CM!
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Cameroon
Third HEVECAM Rubber Project (Loan 2485-CM)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office with
Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The plantation and infrastructure objectives of the project were achieved on schedule.
However, planned yields could not be reached even though they remain higher than most other local
rubber producers. HEVECAM is currently facing severe financial problems due mainly to the
collapse of the world market for rubber, and the concomitant appreciation of the CFA franc.
Accordingly, the economic rate of return reestimated at completion is negative. The public sector
enterprise responsible for implementation is not financially viable and will be unable to balance its
books when it is required to service its debt, starting in FY93. On balance, the project is rated as
unsatisfactory and its sustainability as uncertain considering the obstacles still standing in the way of
achieving profitable operation even under the revised institutional arrangements currently being
explored.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) is comprehensive and informative. An audit
is planned.

THIRD HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT (LN. 2485-CM)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third HEVECAM Rubber Project in the
Republic of Cameroon, for which the World Bank Loan 2485-CM in the amount of US$8.3 million
equivalent was approved on January 15, 1985. The loan closed on June 30, 1991, one year behind
schedule. The loan was fully disbursed with the last disbursement on October 12, 1990. Initially,
cofinancing in the amount of US$11.8 million equivalent each was provided by the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), and the
European Investment Bank (EIB). However, CCCE approved a supplementary loan of US$20 million
equivalent in 1 989 to cover a part of Government's share of project costs.
Parts I and IlIl and the Evaluation Summary of the PCR were prepared by the Agriculture
Operations Division of the Occidental and Central Africa Department. Part II was prepared by the
Borrower. The PCR is based primarily on the Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda,
and discussions with Bank staff and representatives of the Borrower.
The Report was sent to the Cofinanciers for comments. However, none were received.

THIRD HEVECAM RUBBER PROJECT (LN. 2485-CM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Obiectives and Financina (Part 1, para. 3)
1.          In 1975, the Government of Cameroon began the long term development of a rubber
estate located on the Niete River. Through Hevecam , a state corporation, planting was to cover
1 5,000 ha over a 1 5 year period, and rubber output was to reach 32,000 t. During the first two
projects, most of the plantations and infrastructure were established. The purpose of the Third Project,
which is analyzed in this Report, was to complete investment in agricultural operations (by planting the
final 1600 ha) and infrastructure, start up commercial production and develop village plantations. A
fourth project is planned, and this will complete the program, particularly as regards processing
facilities.
2.           The Appraisal Report of the Third Project was prepared by the CCCE. The total cost
of the Third Project was calculated to be CFAF 32.8 billion (US$84 million), and half of the financing
was to be provided in the form of loans from CCCE, CDC, EIB and the World Bank, while the
Government of Cameroon and HEVECAM were to provide the balance. The amount of the World Bank
loan was US$8.3 million.
Proiect Desibn and Oroanization (Part 1, para. 4)
3.           The main lessons drawn from the first two projects (i.e. the underestimation of costs
for land clearing, high labor costs and difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of seeds and budwood)
were taken into account in preparing the Third Project. The design however did not envisage the lower
than expected yields obtained, the rapid appreciation of the CFAF, and the drastic fall in world market
rubber prices.
4.           HEVECAM which had demonstrated its efficiency during the first two projects, was
made responsible for the Third Project. This efficiency was the result of a management contract
between the Government and SAFACAM, a private company specialized in rubber production.
Proiect Implementation (Part 1, para. 5)
5.           The Bank Loan became effective in August 1985, six months after Board approval.
Disbursements under the Loan were regular and the original closing date was extended only once.
During implementation Government was unable to fulfill its financial commitments and it obtained an
additional Loan of CFAF 5.9 billion (US$20 million) from the CCCE in 1 989. In addition, because of
a combination of low yields, unexpected low prices, a strong appreciation of the CFAF with respect
to the dollar as well as disappointing financial performance of HEVECAM in generating funds internally,
project financial resources were reallocated mostly away from capital expenditure and working capital
to cover operating costs. This financing shortfall led management to seek cost reduction by using
small local enterprises and scaling down the housing program from 700 to 500 units.



- iv -
6.             An outgrower program, initiated under the second project was continued under the
Third project, with 520 ha planted over the 1982-90 period. Difficulties encountered during the
implementation of this component included land tenure problems, the long gestation period of hevea
discouraging farmers from satisfactorily maintaining their plantations, and problems associated with
selecting the right farmers who should be involved in setting up these plantations.
Proiect Results (Part 1, para. 6)
7.             The Project had mixed results. From a managerial and execution point of view, the
Project was carried out very satisfactorily. The main reasons were the good performance of the
technical operator, the fact that key staff remained in the same posts, and the effective support
provided by the Government's supervisory agencies and the donors. In spite of the remoteness of the
project area, the lack of any infrastructure and the delays characteristic of a public enterprise, the
project staff were able to establish an efficient organization and train high-quality staff. From a
financial point of view, the Project failed. A combination of factors contributed to this situation; the
original project design was based on overoptimistic price projections of rubber and on generous
investment assumptions. Moreover, the project was carried out by a Public Enterprise with its
management rewarded on a cost plus basis contract and judged on technical performance only.
Hence, there was no incentive to reduce costs.
8.             The physical targets were achieved. Because the area planted under the second Project
had been larger than planned, 997 ha were planted, compared to an appraisal target of 1,600 ha
bringing the total plantation area to 1 5,028 ha. Immature areas were maintained, 500 housing units
and 73 social facilities were constructed, and six processing lines were established. The final cost of
the Third HEVECAM Rubber Project was CFAF 27.2 billion (US$86.1 million equivalent), compared
with the projected CFAF 32.8 billion (US$83.7 million). The main reasons for the difference in CFAF
costs were the judicious use of local subcontractors, the efficient management of works carried out
under contract, and the elimination of certain non-essential investments. However, because of the
depreciation of the US dollar, the actual costs in dollars exceeded the appraisal dollar estimates.
9.             Although the three projects were executed satisfactorily, HEVECAM will be unable to
balance its accounts when it is required to service its debt, beginning in FY92/93. The following table
shows that the reason for this is the dramatic decline in world rubber prices and, to a lesser degree,
the leaf and root diseases that affected yields and production. Even the efforts made to reduce costs
have been inadequate to offset the considerable fall in income produced by these factors.

10.          The financial performance of HEVECAM is and will remain disturbing for the near future.
Annual operating losses remain very high at CFAF 3.0 billion (US$10 million) for 1990/91. The
financial situation is made all the more critical by the low current and projected CFAF price of hevea
and the continual appreciation of the CFAF with regard to the dollar. Consequently, unless there are
major changes in dollar world prices or exchange rates, HEVECAM will be unable in the near future to
service its debts or to replace assets though with prudent financial management and cost cutting it will
be able to meet its production costs. The Economic Rate of Return of the project using the official
exchange rate is negative. At a shadow exchange rate of 50% above the nominal rate the ERR is
about 1 % compared to an ERR of 15% calculated at appraisal.
Sustainability (Part 1, para. 7)
11.          In the light of the adjusted yield projections and the efforts made to reduce production
costs, HEVECAM considers that it will be able, from 1993, to cover its production costs (other than
debt servicing) and generate sufficient revenues to renew its operating equipment. However, these
projections seem optimistic, because yields still appear to be overestimated and management efforts
are hampered by the organization's status as a public enterprise. It is therefore probable that the
Government will have to service the enterprise's debts and subsidize its operations, unless world prices
rise spectacularly and/or the exchange rate is adjusted. The latter would have an important impact on
HEVECAM, because it is a labor-intensive enterprise with low import components. Under present
conditions, HEVECAM would need:
(i)    a 1 5% increase in its sale price, in order to cover its production - operating
expenses; and
lii)   an additional 25% price increase in order to meet its debt service obligations.
12.          It seems that privatization is the only alternative available in order to maintain
HEVECAM operations with a minimum cost for the Government. Although the current management
is more effective than in other parastatals, we believe that there is room for further cost reductions
(say of the order of 15% at the minimum) with private management. Private management would
reduce costs significantly, especially by (i) improving the personnel productivity through performance
incentives and free personnel policy, (ii) reducing social costs and excessive overheads and (iii)
streamlining procurement procedures. These measures would be extremely difficult to implement by
the Government because of social, political and administrative constraints.
13.          Pending the sale of industrial assets (which may not be feasible in the current economic
situation), a long term leasing arrangement with a private firm should be sought. Under these
conditions, the private firm would be able to continue HEVECAM operations, renew the industrial
equipment and pay a rent which would help the Government in reimbursing the debt. The rent should
be linked to rubber prices in CFA Francs to take into account future changes in world prices and in
exchange rates. The plantation estates should be subdivided and transferred to small and medium size
outgrowers, once land tenure problems are solved, to significantly reduce agricultural costs.
1 4.         Finally, it should be noted that prospects for rubber prices are more favorable than
those for other agricultural commodities. For example, Malaysia (the world's largest producer) is
undertaking a replanting program to counter the falloff in its output over the last two years. It is also
important to note that West Africa ought to have a comparative advantage, given its lower labor costs
than those in South East Asia, over the coming years. Improvements in management efficiency are
however crucial if West African countries are to compete with the South East Asian countries.

Lessons Learnt (Part 1, para. 9)
1 5          The experience of HEVECAM shows that -- in order to substantially reduce costs --
future projects of this type should be confined to the private sector. HEVECAM's high investment cost
(CFAF 65 billion, or US$200 million) results in a large measure from the government-controlled nature
of the project, as evidenced by the following factors:
-      the use of government contract procedures, and related high construction standards
not adapted to the needs of agricultural operations.
-     the requirement that equipment and machinery be new, whereas in many cases a
private operator would have considered used equipment adequate;
-     the need for HEVECAM to assume responsibility for much of the Government's social
and regional development role, including the development of the outgrower program;
-      a lack of flexibility in personnel management;
-      a cost-plus management contract conducive to technical excellence rather than
profitability.
16.          Before launching a project of this scale, it is essential to examine and evaluate the
relevant technical agricultural aspects (soils, climate, plant diseases) in adequate detail.
17.          The rate of return and sensitivity tests should take into account the usual risks
highlighted in the preparation reports, e.g. technical problems (diseases, soil, climate) and possible wide
price fluctuations and not be a simple mechanical exercise.
1 8.         Other lessons:
(a)    The project shows that the Bank can act as a partner in projects prepared and
appraised by other donors. It is not essential for the Bank to play a leading role in all
projects that it finances, provided it satisfies itself that the proposed project is
technically, financially and economically worthwhile, and that a commonality of views
on key issues with cofinanciers has emerged.
(b)    The participation of several agencies with different disbursement procedures, provides
great flexibility, and allows to avoid disruptions of project operations when one co-
financier momentarily halts its funding.
19.          In conclusion, HEVECAM provides a good example of a project that was perfectly
executed from a technical point of view, but which turned out to be non-viable financially. This
situation resulted mainly from a decline in world rubber prices, and also from excessive investment
cost. To a large extent the latter aspect is the result of the public enterprise nature of HEVECAM, and
of basing agricultural development on government action rather than on associating the farmers.
Nevertheless, the project did have a positive impact on the development of the region. It created 4,500
jobs at an average unit cost of US$50,000. Although this is a high level, it is comparable to the
average for the modern sector in Africa. The project also provided Cameroon with another source of
foreign exchange earnings, which should help to improve its external sector accounts since rubber
production has a low import content.



- vii -
20.          In present circumstances, everything should be done to keep the enterprise in operation
without, however, imposing additional costs on the Government accounts. This could possibly be done
by leasing HEVECAM's assets to the private sector, which is much better placed than the Government
to face international competition.

2.    Backaround
2.1          Cameroon has a broad climatic range, from tropical forest in the south to Sahelian
conditions in the north. As a result, agriculture (which provides the country's economic base) is very
diverse. Rubber growing has been developed by the Government in order to increase exports, which
previously consisted primarily of coffee and cocoa. Public enterprises have been used to pursue this
objective, and they were given the additional role of participating in the development of disadvantaged
regions by constructing roads and social infrastructure and supporting village producers. It is in this
context that, since 1967, the World Bank has provided financing totaling US$131.3 million for five
projects undertaken by two public enterprises (CAMDEV and HEVECAM).
2.2         In Cameroon, rubber is produced by three enterprises, two of which are public
(CAMDEV and HEVECAM) and one private (SAFACAM). Since 1984/85, when the Third HEVECAM
Rubber Project was launched, output has risen from 1 7,000 t to 40,000 t, as a result of increases in
CAMDEV (from 12,000 t to 21,000 t) and HEVECAM (from 1,000 t to 17,000 t). The area currently
devoted to rubber growing is about 35.000 ha, and the total output expected once all cultivated areas
are in production is about 50.000 , with a value (FOB Douala) of CFAF 12 billion (US$40 million), even
at current depressed prices. These figures should be compared with those for CMte d'lvoire (68,000
ha planted, 40,000 ha in production, and an output of 61,000 t) and world output (about 5 million t).
2.3          HEVECAM was established in April 1975. Its purpose was to establish an agroindustrial
complex consisting of 1 5,000 ha of rubber, together with social and industrial infrastructure, in the
Ocean Department, 40 km to the east of Kribi on the Niete River, 250 km from the port of Douala.
It was also to be responsible for promoting food crop production in the region and conducting
experiments on the Hevea plant. Seed capital totaled CFAF 300 million, but this was increased to
CFAF 17.7 billion (US$60 million at current prices) when the Third Project was launched at the
beginning of 1985. The capital was provided by the Government (33%), ONCPB (59%) and SNI (8%).
Output at normal levels of production was to be 32,000 t of rubber per year, representing a yield of
over 2 t per ha. An assistance agreement was signed with SAFACAM, a Cameroonian private-sector
rubber producer that is a subsidiary of the French group Terres Rouges.



-2-
2.4          The First Project was implemented from mid-1 975 to mid-1 979. The objectives were
to plant 5,800 ha and establish the necessary infrastructure, the cost being CFAF 6.5 billion
(US$28.5 million). Financing was provided by IDA (US$16 million under Credit 574-CM), CCCE
(F 20 million, i.e. US$4.4 million), and a government contribution of CFAF 1.6 billion. The IDA and
CCCE financing was onlent to HEVECAM at an interest rate of 5.5% for a period of 30 years, with a
1 5-year grace period for principal and interest. Because of the type of problems that frequently affect
such a project, and resulting from its scale, the remoteness of the area and the lack of labor and
infrastructure, the performance rate for the objectives was only 70% and projected costs were slightly
exceeded (by 6%). However, project quality was good, and indicated that future prospects would be
favorable.
2.5          The Second Project covered the period from mid-1 979 to end-1 984. The objectives
were to complete the clearing of 15,000 ha, bring the area planted to 13,400 ha, maintain immature
areas, establish the first processing lines (with a capacity of 30 t per day), continue constructing
infrastructure, establish 250 ha of smaliholdings, and begin tapping. The financing necessary had been
estimated to be CFAF 23.4 billion. External financing was provided by an IDA Credit (975-CM;
US$15 million), an IBRD Loan (1791-CM; US$16.5 million), and a CCCE loan (F 80 million). The
Government was to provide the balance (CFAF 6.4 billion). The external financing was onlent by the
Government to HEVECAM at a rate of 7.95% for a period of 20 years and with a 13-year grace period
for principal and interest.  Practically all the objectives were achieved, and quality was again
satisfactory. However, there was a cost overrun of about 20% resulting from considerable increases
in labor and fuel costs and from the depreciation of the CFAF, which made equipment purchased
outside the franc area more expensive. Nevertheless, the financing provided was adequate to cover
this overrun, because of the rise in the values of the dollar and the pound sterling.
3.     Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.1           By the end of the Second Project in 1984, HEVECAM was efficient and well managed,
and had succeeded in planting over 13,000 ha of rubber and establishing processing facilities with a
capacity of 30 t/day, together with sound social infrastructure and services for conducting agricultural
research and developing the activities of local farmers. The objectives of the Third Project were to
complete the program of investment in agriculture and infrastructure and, particularly, to initiate
commercial operations on a sound basis. To this end, the following activities were to be undertaken:
-      planting the final 1,600 ha, to bring the total area to 1 5,000 ha;
-      maintenance during the pre-production period of the rubber trees planted during the
first two projects until they could be brought into production;
-      carrying out tapping of about 9,430 ha in addition to the 805 ha already being tapped
by the end of the Second Project;
-      expanding processing capacity from 30 t/day to 64 t/day for latex and 32 tons/day for
low grade rubber;
constructing housing and social infrastructure, for workers;
continuing the field trial on rubber varieties, disease control, and tapping techniques
necessary for maintaining potential, increasing productivity and improving the quality
of the rubber;



3 -
-     provision of technical assistance to HEVECAM (which had been developed as an
investment organization) in order to convert it into an efficient industrial and
commercial organization.
3.2          In addition, and in line with HEVECAM's development role, the enterprise was to
perform the following activities:
-     expand the outgrower program from 250 ha to 500 ha;
-     implement a pilot food crop program;
-     research the conditions for developing rubber growing in the Southern and Eastern
Provinces.
At appraisal, the cost of the Third Project was calculated to be CFAF 32.8 billion (i.e.
about US$84 million at 1984 prices).
4.    Proiect Desian and Oraanization
4.1          Design. Though the first two projects financed by the Bank and other donors had been
judged technically and managerially successful, owing to uncertainties concerning world market
prospects for rubber and because of management problems in some of the parastatal companies,
Government decided with the donors to limit expansion of rubber plantations and to only complete the
initial HEVECAM program of 15,000 ha. The main lessons drawn from the first two projects
concerned the underestimation of costs for land clearing, high labor costs and difficulties in obtaining
adequate supplies of seed and budwood. These lessons were taken into account in preparing the third
project. The design however did not envisage the lower than expected yields obtained, the rapid
appreciation of the CFAF, and the drastic fall in world market rubber prices. The design therefore relied
on high-cost plantation rubber production rather than the more cost efficient outgrower rubber program
which could have reduced costs. Project preparation was carried out by CCCE, and appraisal done
jointly by CCCE, the Bank, CDC and EIB. The appraisal report was prepared by CCCE with the Bank
preparing only a President's Memorandum and an addendum on Economic Analysis to the Appraisal
Report.
4.2          Organization. HEVECAM, which had demonstrated its efficiency during the first two
projects, was made responsible for the Third Project. This efficiency was the result of a management
contract between the Government and SAFACAM, a private company subsidiary of the French group
Terres Rouges. SAFACAM appointed competent expatriates to the key positions of General Manager,
Agricultural Manager and Financial Manager, and these remained in their positions during almost the
whole of the Second and Third Projects; indeed, the General Manager had occupied that post since the
very beginning of the Program. As a result of the many supervision missions conducted by the
Government's supervisory agencies and the donors, project execution was monitored and all necessary
adjustments were made.
5.    Proiect Implementation
5.1          Effectiveness and rate of disbursement. The Third Project began in January 1985.
Although the Bank loan was approved in February 1985, it only become effective in August of that
year. However, in spite of this difference between the dates of loan approval and project start-up, no
difficulties were encountered, thanks to the availability of other external financing. Disbursements of
the Bank Loan were regular (see Part l1l), and 93% of the financing had been disbursed by the original



closing date (June 30, 1990) and were completed by october 1990. A further year extension of the
closing date had been granted to complete all investments.
5.2          Costs and financina: At the time of the appraisal mission (October 1983), the cost of
the project was estimated at CFAF 34.8 billion. It was reduced to CFAF 32.8 billion in light of the
results achieved by the end of the Second Project (since these were not available at the time of the
mission). The following table shows (in billions of CFAF) the final financing arrangements for the Third
Project, together with the amounts actually disbursed.
Planned          Actual
Government   - Capital                      6.940           6.940

Loans:       IBRD                          3.255            2.624
CCCE                         4.265            4.265
CDC                          4.610            4.110
EIB                          4.610            4.621
HEVECAM Self-financing                     4.300                0
Total                       32.800           27.200
The following observations should be made:
-     Government was unable to fulfill its commitments (totaling CFAF 11.4 billion).
Therefore, in 1989, it obtained an additional loan from CCCE (CFAF 5.9 billion).
-     The amounts disbursed under the loans from CDC and (especially) the Bank were
smaller than planned, because of changes in exchange rates.
-     The expected self-generated funds did not materialize because of the problems of
yields and unexpectedly low prices (see para. 4.1).
5.3          Because of the financing shortfall and the need to cover operating losses, resources
were allocated as follows (in billions of CFAF):
Planned                  Actual
Capital investment                          23.850                  19.700
Subsidies                                    4.460                   4.280
Working capital                              4.490                   1.170
Operating loss                                   0                   2.050
32.800                 27.200
5.3.1        The investment program was reduced by eliminating certain activities that were not
essential and, in particular, by scaling down the housing construction program. It was possible to
reduce the labor force by improving the organization of activities and changing the tapping schedule.
5.3.2        Consequently, the shortfall in financing did not have a serious impact on project
execution, mainly because the original investment program (and therefore financing needs) had been
somewhat overestimated. The overestimation reflected in a large part the much higher rates of



-5 -
inflation assumed at appraisal, 15% p.a on local costs and 7% p.a for foreign costs, whereas the
actual rates of inflation were below 10% and 5% respectively.
5.4           Execution of aaricultural investments
(a)    The Plantation Proaram. Although problems arose because of the instability of
the labor force (which was hired from other regions of the country), HEVECAM was able to carry out
the works satisfactorily and on schedule, without using subcontractors.
(b)    The Outarower Program. Over the period 1982-1990, 520 ha have been
established by 86 farmers. To date, only 20% of the planted acreage is in full production and initial
results show that yields are 30 to 40 % lower than those obtained on the estate plantation. The pilot
project is in its early stages of development, and of too modest in scale to draw any firm conclusion.
It has, however, permitted to identify issues which need to be addressed prior to expanding this
program. Among the principal ones are: land tenure, social and technical problems.
-      land tenure: land rights have to be established, before farmers are willing to develop
land and plant trees that belong to them and cannot be claimed at a later date;
-      social: the prospective farmers are selected from local inhabitants (presently deriving
their livelihood from hunting and fishing) and from immigrant workers (most now
employed at the estate). With regard to the former, the responses are slow because
they have no agricultural tradition and have difficulties changing their way of living
from hunting to permanent cultivation. With regard to immigrant workers, there is a
need to guarantee them job security and a receptive environment (land tenure, schools,
infrastructure, technical support).
-      technical: while food crops are grown seasonally, it takes seven years for hevea to
generate a cash income. This long gestation period discourages farmers to weed and
maintain satisfactorily the hevea trees while waiting for the results: although
intercropping food crops, such as vegetables, with hevea trees has shown good
results.
5.4.1        In future this experiment, how individual outgrowers can develop and integrate in
combination with the new form of management to be given to the estate operations, should be
pursued.
5.5           Buildings and Drocessina facilities. HEVECAM carried out part of the works on force
account and provided engineering consultancy and monitoring for the rest. For most of the social
infrastructure works, it hired local SMEs, which were selected in accordance with standard
procurement shopping procedures. For the processing facilities and construction works in the industrial
area, Cameroon-based enterprises were used, although these were generally subsidiaries of European
firms.
5.6           Procurement. For works undertaken by non-Cameroonian enterprises, HEVECAM
followed the guidelines on bidding issued by the World Bank. No problems arose and all the bids were
in comformity with Bank guidelines. For the works performed on force account (mainly relating to
agriculture), the charges were based on cost accounting calculations, as verified by the supervision
missions and auditors.

6.    Proiect Results
6.1          Investments: Because the area planted under the Second Project had been larger than
planned, under the Third Project it was necessary to plant only 997 ha (instead of the planned 1,600
ha) in order to achieve the final objective of 15,000 ha. The area tapped was 10,900 ha, compared
with the objective of 9,430 ha. Instead of the planned 700 housing units, 500 were constructed
because fewer workers will be involved in the project than originally planned now that output
projections have been reduced. The processing lines were established as planned. As regards the
other programs, the area planted, under the outgrower pilot scheme was 287 ha, compared with the
planned 250 ha. Agricultural trials were continued and intensified, and a method was devised for
controlling a fungal leaf disease (by spraying defoliants from the air in the dry season in order to
provide a less favorable environment for the fungus that attacks leaves during regrowth). Now that
the Third Project has been completed, HEVECAM has 15,000 ha of planted land, a processing facility
with a capacity of 130 t/day (for a 1 6-hour day), storage facilities, workshops and machinery, and the
housing and social infrastructure necessary for the 4,500 employees. All that remains to be done over
the next two years, is for HEVECAM to bring its machinery pool up to a full complement, and to
complete its processing facilities so that it can collect and process all the latex produced once normal
production levels have been reached; total investments required amount to only about CFAF 1 billion.
6.2          Technical results: Because of unfavorable climatic and soil conditions, aggravated by
diseases affecting roots (Fomes)1 and leaves, HEVECAM's average yield of dry rubber per ha once
normal production levels have been reached is unlikely to exceed 1,650 kg, compared with the 2,250
kg estimated at appraisal. In light of experience, specialists regard the appraisal figure as too
optimistic, and it is now estimated that average yields will be closer to 1,500 kg per ha. Nevertheless,
it should be noted that this is still an acceptable yield for rubber, judging by the results obtained in
other rubber producing countries. Thus, one of the major deviations from the original appraisal
estimates was in yields. Plant disease risks were flagged at appraisal, but it was assumed these could
be effectively controlled. Their neutralization, on the large scale plantation, turned out to be more
complex than foreseen and this has affected yields. The following table compares the projections with
the results achieved (in t/ha):

6.2.1        The most disturbing factor is that Fomes has killed many trees in the oldest areas (in
the eighth year, only 380 of the 500 trees per ha originally planted remain). However, this can be
partly attributed to the problems with soil preparation methods encountered at project start-up. It is
also likely that the initial treatments prepared by the Experimentation Service will make it possible to
reduce the number of losses. However, the additional cost incurred will be about CFAF 30,000 per
ha.
1/    Outbreaks of Fomes have been so severe that special soil preparation methods have been
adopted, at an additional cost of about CFAF 100,000 per ha.



6.2.2        No particular problems have arisen with regard to the operation of the processing
facilities. HEVECAM manufactures three main types of product: granular rubber produced from latex,
granular rubber produced from cup scrap (i.e. second grade), and centrifuged latex, which it has only
just begun to manufacture. Because of its efficient quality control laboratory, HEVECAM has a good
reputation in the market. Similarly, efficient processing supervision has reduced input consumption
to satisfactory levels.
6.2.3        Past and projected output is as follows:

93/94                         1,636        24,321
94/95
6.2.4        Although the long-term objective (i.e. 24,321 tons per annum) is achievable, based on
present experience, it is unlikely that production (output) will increase by 25 percent between 1990/91
and 1991 /92, as forecast by HEVECAM.
6.3          Manaaement: HEVECAM is well managed compared to other parastatals in African
countries, as the following points illustrate:
-     it has developped a good management information system based on a computerized
budget and accounting system;
-     it has increased its labor productivity by improving the worker/ha ratio from 1:4 to
1:4.5 over the last three years;
-     it has improved the tapper latex/day production to 33:1 from 28:1, and it expects to
reach 39:1;
-     it has streamlined the engineering staff (responsible for development studies) from 358
in 1988 to 200 in 1991, which is consistent with the transition from development to
production;
-     it has sold surplus clearing equipment.



-8 -
6.3.1        Because of the efforts devoted to organization and productivity, HEVECAM's staffing
at normal production levels should not exceed 4,500 persons (currently 4,300), compared with the
5,700 projected at appraisal. Nevertheless, further cost improvement can be achieved. For example,
the general services staff numbers about 220, and some of the vehicles could be replaced by less
expensive models. However, it seems that only the introduction of a private management firm will
make it possible to enter a new stage of development.
6.4          Personnel numbers and training: The following table shows HEVECAM's current overall
staffing levels:
Agricultural
Production                3,275
Research                     69
Joint services              291
Industrial
-     Processing facilities        226
-     Workshops                    206
General services                         220
4,287
6.4.1        Of this total, there are 695 women (16% of the work force), a comparatively large
proportion for rubber production.
6.4.2        So far, it has been necessary to hire labor from other regions of Cameroon, and this has
caused a certain amount of instability in the work force. Gradually, however, HEVECAM's personnel
is becoming settled, and this trend is being accelerated by the country's overall employment situation.
The number of expatriate managers has declined from 11 in 1 985 (the beginning of the Third Project)
to the present 4, and there are now 36 Cameroonian managers. This indicates how efficient
HEVECAM's training program has been. It should be noted that such a problem is comparatively easy
to solve when there are sufficient local personnel with the necessary educational qualifications (as in
the case of Cameroon), and when the enterprise in question is well managed. HEVECAM hires the best
young staff available who -- because the enterprise is well organized -- obtain on-the-job training
through contact with expatriates. This form of training has proved to be more effective than sending
young personnel abroad to take academic courses away from the practical day to day problems.
6.4.3        Particular efforts have been devoted to training the tappers, because this is very
specialized work and their performance will affect the enterprise's results over both the short and the
long term. The following table shows HEVECAM's training costs during the Third Project (in millions
of CFAF):

6.4.4        Except for some short courses for managers in Europe and other African Countries
(Abidjan), all training has been provided at HEVECAM by specialists from Cameroonian enterprises (in
data processing, accounting, mechanical engineering, etc.).
6.5          Marketina: Except for a few local sales to a footware and a tire manufacturer (totaling
120 t in 1990/91), almost all the rubber produced is exported, being sold through the sales department
of Terres Rouges. Part of it is sold under contract to Michelin and Dunlop, and the rest is offered on
the international market. The transactions are FOB Douala, at the world price. Terres Rouges bills
HEVECAM for the real cost of its services, with a ceiling of 1 % of the CIF value of the goods. Since
the beginning of the Third Project, when HEVECAM came into production, selling prices have been as
follows (see Annex 9):
Year                 Averane sellina orice
1984/85             CFAF 354 per kg FOB Douala

86/87            CFAF 257 per kg FOB Douala

89/90            CFAF 232 per kg FOB Douala
90/91            CFAF 215 per kg FOB Douala
6.5.1        The other main deviation of project results from appraisal estimates concerned rubber
prices. World rubber price in current US$ were projected to increase by 65 % over the period 1 984-
1991, when, in fact, they decreased by 10 % (see annex 9). Moreover the prices were further
depressed by continuous appreciation of the CFA franc versus the US$ from CFAF 477 = US$1 in
1984/85 to CFAF 263 = US$1 in 1990/91. The following table shows the discrepancies between
expected and actual CFAF prices per kg:
84/85      85186      86/87       87/88      88/89       89/90
Projected CIF           497         562        618         672        727         818

6.5.2        For the future, it appears that the prospects for natural rubber are better than those for
most other agricultural commodities. It is for this reason that Malaysia, the world's largest producer,
has decided to arrest the decline in its output over the last two years, by rehabilitating some of its
older plantations. It seems reasonable to assume that West Africa is comparatively well placed in the
coming years, because of likely trends in labor costs in Africa vis-a-vis Asia. Finally, it should be
remembered that Africa account at present for only 5 percent of the world output (about 5.5 million
t).
6.6   Financial asmects:
(a)    Current merformance. and groiections: Annex 3 shows HEVECAM's performance since
the beginning of the Third Project, which also marked the beginning of production. It
shows that annual operating losses have ranged from CFAF 0.9 billion (in FY85/86) to
CFAF 3 billion (in FY90/91), even though debt service charges had not yet been
included in the accounts (because of the grace period). These cumulative losses have



- 10 -
reduced the equity to CFAF 6.7 billion, which is only 38% of nominal capital (CFAF
17.7 billion) and 14% of long-term capital (CFAF 46 billion). In such circumstances a
private enterprise would have to either obtain a capital inflow or go into liquidation.
Nevertheless, short-term indebtedness is not excessive for an enterprise of this scale.
("Suppliers credits" amount to about CFAF 1 billion; there is no bank overdraft; and
receivables are at a normal level, in contrast to the situation of many less well-
managed public enterprises.)
Although it is not surprising that an agroprocessing enterprise with large fixed costs
such as HEVECAM should make a loss before reaching the stage of full production, it
is more disturbing to see that medium-term prospects are unfavorable. The table below
shows current production costs and projections for 1992/93, which can be regarded
as the first year of normal production levels:

D. Amortization                    144          102
E. Total production costs, net of  38           312
financial charges
These costs do not include debt servicing. This will become due in 1992/93, and will
total about CFAF 1 billion beginning from that year (i.e. about CFAF 45 per kg).
These production costs can be regarded as reliable, and have been used to make the
medium and long-term financial projections shown in Annexes 2 and 3. With an
average selling price of CFAF 228 per kg (current), these projections show that
HEVECAM's internal cash generation (net of financial charges and once the enterprise
has attained normal production) would total about CFAF 500 million. This will not be
sufficient to enable HEVECAM to service its debts or renew all its assets.
Consequently, unless there are major changes in world prices or exchange rates, the



- 1 1 -
Government will have to continue to carry HEVECAM's debt burden and finance the
replacement of some assets.
HEVECAM is a typical example of an enterprise that could benefit from a depreciation
of the real exchange rate, since about two thirds of its operating costs are incurred
locally and all its income is in the form of foreign exchange. For example, operating
costs for 1990/91 are as follows (see Annex 4):
Total costs (net of amortization and debt
servicing)                                           CFAF 4.5 billion
of which:    personnel costs                         CFAF 2.7 billion
imported goods and services             CFAF 1.8 billion
Once normal production levels are reached -- when costs are expected to be CFAF 4.9
billion (of which CFAF 2 billion payable in foreign exchange) and income will be CFAF
5.4 billion -- a 50% depreciation of the real exchange rate would increase net internal
cash generation from CFAF 0.5 billion to CFAF 1.5 billion at current prices (i.e.
CFAF 2.25 billion at the real depreciation rate). Even so, HEVECAM would not be able
to achieve the necessary financial equilibrium to enable it to undertake asset renewal
and debt servicing, which will exceed CFAF 2.5 billion in 1995/96 and reach a
cumulative total of CFAF 4.3 billion by the end of the 1 990s.
(b)    Rates of Return: Projections made during the appraisal of the Third Project showed a
10% internal rate of financial return (IRR) and a 1 5% economic rate of return (ERR)
over 34 years. Due to much lower yields and selling prices, and despite important
reductions in investment and productions costs, the revised rates of return are
negative, with an IRR of -17% and an ERR of -14% (over 34 years). The latter rate
was obtained by using the same conversion factor (0.77) as for the appraisal, in order
to allow for the over-valuation of the CFAF. Nevertheless, the ERR does not take
account of the project's impact on regional development, which is very difficult to
quantify. Using shadow exchange rates improves the IRR, but will not bring it back to
a level approaching 10%. In fact, with a shadow rate of 50% above the nominal rate,
the IRR remains negative (-3%), and becomes positive only at 100% (+ 1%) above
nominal rates.
6.7          Proiect Impact on Re ional Development and the Environment
(a)    The project's impact on regional development is difficult to quantify, although it will
clearly produce a number of effects, for the following reasons:
-     the creation of 4,500 jobs, which have attracted traders, food producers and
craftsmen to the area;
-     the establishment of an hospital in an area previously without such medical
services;



- 12 -
the development of SMEs specializing in construction, electric power, wood
processing and -- in particular -- transportation, in the areas of both Kribi and
Douala;
improvements in the road network, benefiting the entire population of the area.
(b)    There were a number of apprehensions as regards the environmental impact of the
project:
The deforestation of about 20,000 ha did not have a detrimental impact, since
the area has been replanted with rubber trees, which are more efficient in their
photosynthesis than natural forest and the hilly areas have been covered with
cover plants.
-      The effluent from the processing facilities, containing latex and chemical waste
(formic acid and ammonia), are properly treated by being filtered through a
series of screens and passed through four settlers with a unit area of 4,000
m2, two of which are for aerobic fermentation and two for anaerobic
fermentation. The quality of the water after treatment and before its release
into the Niete River is monitored by the laboratory at the processing facilities,
and samples are regularly sent to the Institut Pasteur in Yaounde for testing.
-      The rubber industry is a large consumer of wood because all exports are
transported on non-reusable palettes. HEVECAM itself consumes 1,200 m3 of
wood per year, but this is only scrap from the wood processed for export, and
not newly felled material.
7.     Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.1           Short-term. Under current conditions (see ann. 2), HEVECAM  will continue to be
operating at a loss. Consequently, the Government (the sole owner) is responsible to finance all debt
servicing; find the resources necessary for cover operating losses, and for increased working capital;
and finance the final capital investment under the Fourth Project. The total financing requirements will
be about CFAF 1.5 billion. However, due to its difficult budgetary position, government is presently
negotiating with CCCE to obtain an additional loan.
7.2           Medium and lona-term. Although projections indicate that, excluding amortization and
debt servicing, HEVECAM can achieve financial equilibrium from 1992/93, it is unlikely that such
equilibrium will be realized, because yield projections remain overoptimistic and present prices remain
too low. Further cost reductions are necessary, and these can only be achieved within a private sector
management framework.  Under present conditions it is estimated that further production cost
reductions can be achieved, in the order of at least 1 5 percent. In particular, a private firm would be
able to: (i) increase personnel productivity through appropriate performance incentives, strict personnel
management and possible staff cuts; (ii) reduce free social services; (iii) strongly reduce the company
overheads (e.g. closing down the Douala office and replacing several cars by motorcycles or bicycles);
and (iv) sharply cut the cost of supplies by avoiding administrative procurement and by adopting lower
standards (e.g. purchase of second hand equipment).
7.3           Pending the sale of industrial assets (which may not be feasible in the current economic
situation) a long term  leasing arrangement with a private firm should be sought.  Under these



- 13 -
conditions, the private company would be able to continue HEVECAM operations, renew the industrial
equipment and pay a rent which would help the Government in reimbursing the debt. The rent should
be linked to rubber prices in CFA Francs to take into account future changes in exchange rate and in
world prices. The plantation estates shoud be subdivided and transferred to small and medium size
outgrowers, once land tenure problems are solved. Other potential alternative arrangements should
also be explored, with a view to introducing an effective private sector management of the enterprise.
The overall objectives would be to protect the jobs created, and to minimize the financial burden for
the Government. The Government and external donors must urgently agree on the details of
implementation of the privatization process, and on the necessary measures required to make this an
attractive proposal for potential buyers and/or tenants.
8.    Bank's Performance
8.1          The Bank carried out 10 supervision missions during the five years of the project, most
of which included a financial analyst, a rubber specialist, and an economist. In most cases, these
missions were organized jointly with the other donors, and although the coordination was time
consuming, it proved to be beneficial. These missions undoubtedly caused HEVECAM to keep its
technical and financial monitoring documentation up-to-date, and enabled the Bank to keep itself
completely informed regarding the project's progress. The inclusion of a rubber specialist meant that
some of HEVECAM's projections could be submitted to more realistic revisions, and that valuable
technical advice could be given to the agricultural services. The Borrower has noted the Bank
inflexibility when it became necessary to modify the pati-passu arrangments at the end of 1 987 (see
Part II), but the problems seem to have been caused mainly by administrative delays on the part of the
government agencies responsible for supervising HEVECAM.
9.    Lessons Learnt
9.1          With hindsight, a number of lessons can be learned from the HEVECAM project as a
whole, because the Bank participated in the financing of all three projects.
(a)    Before launching an agricultural project on such a scale, it is essential to ensure that
all possible precautions are taken with respect to the agricultural aspects. More
detailed studies should have been made prior to embarking on a large scale project.
The findings would probably have resulted in a different scaling and phasing of the
project.
(b)    Undoubtedly, additional costs are incurred when a project is implemented by a
government enterprise, for the following reasons:
-     Contract procedures require higher construction standards than are necessary
for agricultural operations;
-     Only new equipment and machinery could be purchased, whereas in many
cases a private operator would regard used equipment as acceptable.
-     The management contract to operate HEVECAM rewards the operators for
technical performance rather than for financial results (see para. 11.2).
(c)    The system adopted for paying the management contractor was certainly less than
ideal, because it was geared to the amount of investment (in the implementation



- 14 -
phase) and to operating costs (in the production phase). Once again, more importance
was attributed to the quality of the works than to profitability.
(d)    The rate of return, and sensitivity tests, should have taken into account all risks
hightlighted in the preparation findings, such as technical problems (diseases) and wide
price fluctuations, and not be a simple mechanical exercise.
(e)    The Third Project shows that the Bank does not necessarily have to take the leading
role in the projects it finances, since this part can be done by another cofinancer (in
this case CCCE), which can take responsibility for project preparation and for preparing
the Appraisal Report. Nevertheless, the Bank should ensure that, at appraisal, it can
make its own reliable assessment of the conclusions drawn and that a commonality of
views on key issues with cofinanciers has emerged.
(f)    The participation of several agencies has provided greater flexibility. In this case, the
arrangement allowed disbursements to be continued without interruption even when
one of the co-financiers halted momentarily.
(g)   If the Bank were to finance other agroindustrial plantation projects, the agricultural
aspects should -- as far as possible -- be undertaken by the farmers themselves, while
processing and marketing should be the responsibility of the private sector.
9.2          In conclusion, HEVECAM provides a good example of a project that was perfectly
executed from a technical point of view, but which turned out to be unviable financially. This situation
resulted mainly from a decline in world rubber prices, and also from excessive investment cost. To a
large extent the latter aspect is the result of the public enterprise nature of HEVECAM, and of basing
agricultural development on government action rather than on associating the farmers. Nevertheless,
the project did have a positive impact on the development of the region. It created 4,500 jobs at an
average unit cost of US$50,000. Although this is a high level, it is comparable to the average for the
modern sector in Africa. The project also provided Cameroon with another source of foreign exchange
earnings, which should help to improve its external sector accounts since rubber production has a low
import content.
9.3          In present circumstances, everything should be done to keep the enterprise in operation
without, however, imposing additional costs on the Government accounts. This could possibly be done
by leasing HEVECAM's assets to the private sector, which is much better placed than the Government
to face international competition.
1 0.   Borrower's Performance
10.1         The Government did everything necessary to bring the project to completion. In
general, it met its obligations within a reasonable time, in spite of the financial problems arising over
the last few years. When the problems became excessive, as in 1989, the Government borrowed
CFAF 5.9 billion to contribute to HEVECAM in the form of investment and subsidies. It also agreed
to adopt the following measures, in line with the performance contract signed with HEVECAM in
February 1 990: (i) capitalizing CFAF 10 billion in loans (the whole of the First and Second Projects);
(ii) forgoing interest on the capitalized loans (CFAF 7 billion); (iii) rescheduling debt servicing for the
balance on loans for the Second Project (CFAF 13 billion). In justification of these measures the
Government undoubtedly took account of HEVECAM's regional development role.



- 15 -
10.2          The Government did not interfere with the project to any excessive degree, and granted
the General Manager the largest possible measure of flexibility compatible with a government-controlled
enterprise. It also participated actively in all supervision missions. However, it is to be regretted that
the Government did not fulfill the following commitments, which it had entered into as part of the
performance contract:
-      It did not carry out a study for a tax system that would take account of the special
nature of perennial crops.
-      It did not address HEVECAM's proposals for increasing the competitiveness of the
rubber industry (e.g. by reducing certain parafiscal taxes and electric power tariffs,
liberalizing maritime freight rates, adopting special tax measures, eliminating
registration fees, etc...)
-      It made no proposals for transferring to the State some of the public service costs
assumed by HEVECAM (in particular, those relating to education, law enforcement and
posts and telecommunications).
10.3         When FONADER ceased to exist in 1988, the Government took no steps to replace it,
thus compromising the continuation of the outgrower planting program. Finally, the Government did
not prepare a master plan for the development of the Oil Palm and Rubber Sector, as it had agreed to
undertake under the Loan Agreement.
11.   Proiect Relationshios
Project relationships with the Bank, and with the other donors, were excellent at all
times. The relationship between the Government and the World Bank were also satisfactory until
1 989, when the Bank and the other donors called for the privatization of HEVECAM to be initiated.
No such steps have yet been taken, and until a satisfactory plan is agreed, the Bank is unwilling to
participate in the financing of a Fourth Project, i.e. the final phase of the HEVECAM investment
program.
1 2.   Consultina Services
1 2.1        As indicated in para. 8.2, at the outset HEVECAM signed a contract for the provision
of support for implementation and management with SAFACAM, the latter being a private enterprise
(a subsidiary of the French group Terres Rouges) which operates oil palm and rubber plantations in
Cameroon. Its services have certainly been much more effective than might have been expected from
a more conventional source of general technical assistance.  It is quite clear that the sound
implementation of the project's physical components was the result of the presence of competent
expatriate managers receiving support locally from SAFACAM and from the Paris headquarters of
Terres Rouges. It should also be noted that the three main expatriate officials (the General Manager
and the Agricultural and Financial Managers) remained in their positions throughout the project, in spite
of the difficult living conditions, and this continuity also contributed to the satisfactory execution of
the project.
1 2.2        The mode of payment for external support in the implementation phase (cost-plus) was
less than ideal. However, it should be noted that it would have been difficult to apply a different
system, because the external partner did not bear full responsibility for the operation (since it was
operating under a management contract), and was responsible to a Board consisting of government
officials. It also had to act in accordance with the statutes governing public enterprises. Moreover,



- 16 -
the mode of payment adopted was in keeping with the practices of the time, and the rate agreed (2%
of investment) was considerably lower than the amount sometimes applied (between 8% and 9%).
There are certainly more grounds for criticizing the payment system adopted for the operating phase
(1.5% of operating costs), because it would have been comparatively easy to find systems that
provided greater incentives to make savings.
12.3         The main criticism that can be leveled at the external support is that it made insufficient
adjustments to correct overoptimistic yields. As a result, and despite lower rubber prices than
anticipated, this maintained a favorable financial outlook of HEVECAM's operations and, thereby,
obscured the need and urgency for drastic investment and cost reductions as profitability did not
appear to be an issue.
13.   Proiect Documentation
All quarterly financial and technical statements and annual reports produced by
Hevecam were very detailed and of high quality. Operating accounts and annual balance sheets were
also published within agreed time limits, and these were audited by the Cameroonian subsidiary of
Price Waterhouse. Finally, it should be noted that twice a year high-quality supervision reports were
also produced.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The views expressed below are those of HEVECAM, the final beneficiary of the Loan
granted to the Republic of Cameroon (the Borrower).
1.    Effects of exchanae rate changes: The Bank's Loan Agreements are expressed in US dollars,
and this leads to a number of well-known problems when loans are made to borrowers in the franc
area. Nevertheless, it will be useful to consider the particular effects this had on the Third Project.
1.1          At the time the loan was aranted:
When the project was examined and the Agreement was signed, it was planned that
the Bank's share would be US$8.3 million (CFAF 3.255 billion at the rate of US$1 = CFAF 392), i.e.
19% of pari passu. In fact, the US$8.3 million provided financing to the value of only CFAF 2.62
billion (an average rate of US$1 = CFAF 316), a financing shortfall on the Bank's part of CFAF 630.8
million.
1.2          At the time of revavment:
Indexing this Loan against a basket of currencies reduced the effects of exchange rate
differences between the CFAF and the US dollar, and limited exchange risks in both directions.
However, it should be noted that, by October 15, 1990, the date at which the financing
terminated, the amount of US$8.3 million had been revalued to US$9.6 million (the revaluation factor
being 1.16), which was equivalent (at the rate of US$1 = CFAF 255.35) to CFAF 2.46 billion, as
opposed to CFAF 2.12 billion, the value that the loan amount would have reached if it had not been
indexed to the basket of currencies (i.e. a revaluation of about 16%).
Nevertheless, it should be noted that, as of that date (October 1 5, 1 990), the revalued
loan amount to be repaid (as expressed in CFAF) is smaller than that received (CFAF 2.457 billion,
compared with CFAF 2.624 billion), a potential exchange premium of CFAF 167 million.
2.    The Monitoring of the Revalued Loan and the Interest Rate
The Bank provided the Cameroonian Government with semimonthly statements on Loan
2485-CM (with copies to HEVECAM), and, in particular, these made it possible to monitor changes in
the variable interest rate and the amortization adjustment factor.
Since 1 988, HEVECAM has received these very irregularly, and we have had to request
this documentation whenever it had not been received.
The most recent documents received relate to the period from October 1 to 1 5, 1 990.
In this connection, please refer to our telexes 1 93-HCNT/T of September 13, 1 988 and
11 2-HC/T of July 20, 1990 (with a follow-up in the form of fax No. 87-HCNT/FE of September 24,
1991).
At the same time as submitting this Report, we are writing to the Bank to request all
the semimonthly statements that we have not received.



- 18 -
It should also be noted that we have sometimes received documentation relating to
Loan 2160-CM (relating to SOCAPALM and the Cameroon Development Corporation).
3.    Problems Arisina From Chanaes in the Bank's Pori Passu Share
When the Loan Agreements were signed, the following paripassu shares were agreed:
Government           27  %
HEVECAM               6  %
Bank                 19  %
COMDEV               27.5 % )    Subtotal for loans:
CCCE                 20.5 % )           67%
100.0 %
After the 1987 supervision missions, it was proposed to change the donors' shares in
light of the following:
-     changes in exchange rates since the preparation of the financing plan;
-     the reductions in HEVECAM self-financing and government financing.
Although CCCE and COMDEV agreed to change their shares retrospectively to July 1,
1987, the Bank agreed in principle to do so only from June 1, 1988, resulting in the following
breakdowns:
From July 1, 1987 to May    From June 1, 1988 to the
30, 1988             conclusion of the project
Bank                   19  %                        24 %
COMDEV                 46  %                        46 %
CCCE          30i                                     %
_________               96.5%                       100%
CCCE and COMDEV agreed to these changes in letters dated, respectively,
November 21, 1988 and November 2, 1988 (confirmed by a letter of May 3, 1989).
For its part, the Bank waited before making a decision on these changes until it received
an official request from the Ministry of Planning and Land Use Development. This was not received
until October 3, 1988 (by telex). As a result, it was only from this date (October 3, 1988) that the
Bank's share could be changed (see the letter dated December 13, 1 988).
This lack of synchronization caused one of our applications for a release of funds (No.
27/87-88 for CFAF 32.68 million), and led to a third paripassu period:



-19-
From June 1, 1988 to
l ______________        October 30,  1988
Bank                         19 %
COMDEV                       46 %
CCCE                         30__%_
95 %,
i.e. a shortfall of 5%
HEVECAM considers it unfortunate that the Bank showed a certain administrative
rigidity in these circumstances, particularly in view of the fact that, in the end, the entire amount of
US$8.3 million was indeed mobilized.
In spite of this, HEVECAM's management was entirely satisfied with its relationship
with the various Bank representatives who monitored the project, and appreciated their
cooperativeness and insightful opinions.
