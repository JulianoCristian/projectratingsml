Its main objective would be to complete the\n            establishment of the planned 15,000 ha of rubber with its\n            associated industrial and social infrastructure, bringing\n            the plantation to a state of commercial exploitation. It\n            would consist of the following components:  (i) maintenance\n            of areas planted under previous Bank-financed projects and\n            initial tapping of about 9,000 ha; as well as; (ii)\n            continuation of the program of infrastructure establishment,\n            including estate buildings, housing for estate workers, and\n            expansion of crumb rubber processing facilities.  The\n            project would include; (iii) associated programs, namely the\n            expansion to 500 ha of the outgrower program, a pilot\n            program of food crop production aimed at provision of basic\n            foodstuffs for workers, and studies and rubber trials (in\n            the areas of Kribi and the Southern and Eastern provinces)."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
