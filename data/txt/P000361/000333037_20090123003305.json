During the first two projects, most of the\n            plantations and infrastructure were established. The purpose\n            of the Third HEVECAM Project, which is analyzed in this\n            report, was to complete investment in agricultural\n            operations (by planting the final 1600 ha) and\n            infrastructure, start up commercial production and develops\n            village plantations. A fourth project is planned, and this\n            will complete the program, particularly as regards\n            processing facilities."}, "docdt": "1992-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
