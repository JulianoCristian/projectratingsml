                         services and build community infrastructure, and (d) strengthen capacity of government to formulate, implement, and manage medium and long-term
                         development programs. The project consists of a Grant of US$ 44 million covering health sector and of a Credit of US$410 million covering the rest of the
                         project.

                         The project has achieved its objectives and the results are, in some cases, beyond expectations. As an emergency operation, the project was not to deal with sustainability, sector
                         policies, sector reforms or institutional reforms, but it was important to bring to the attention of the government and the other development partners that it was critical to maintain and

                         safeguard the many important achievements of the project (roads, electricity, water treatment plant, ports, health zones, schools, railways, erosion protections,urban streets, etc.).
                         These achievements represent some $700 million investments and need adequate mechanisms from the government and other partners (such as proper use of the road
                         maintenance fund) to sustain the investments. The project has helped prepare sector strategies for future operations and Road Fund study which has led to the establishment of the
                         existing Road Fund which is operational. Also the team integrated sustainability issues through high level and technical workshops carried out synthesize Ministries, National entities
                         and development partners to the need of maintaining and safeguarding these investments and achievements of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has achieved its objectives and the results are, in some cases, beyond expectations. As an emergency operation, the project was not to deal with sustainability, sector
                         policies, sector reforms or institutional reforms, but it was important to bring tothe attention of the government and the other development partners that it was critical to maintain and
                         safeguard the many importantachievements of the project (roads, electricity, water treatment plant, ports, health zones, schools, railways, erosion protections, urban streets, etc.).
                         These achievements represent some $700 million investments and need adequate mechanisms from the governmentand other partners (such as proper use of the road maintenance
                         fund) to sustain these investments.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
