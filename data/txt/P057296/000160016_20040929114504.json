The report anticipates\n            negative environmental impacts and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Among the risks and proposed mitigations it\n            discusses are the following: Reduce noise. During\n            construction, protect against the emanation of toxic gases\n            and the risks of inhaling particulate matter. When\n            transporting materials, systematically spray material or use\n            tarpaulin on trucks, spray land routes, and limit vehicle\n            speed. Locate concrete and coal works far from human\n            habitations. Regulate vehicle emissions, control traffic,\n            and require motorist to install muffler equipment. All open\n            air burning must be preauthorized, and the project manager\n            must approve incineration of ordinary garbage and industrial\n            waste. Protect against soil degradation due to erosion,\n            vegetative loss, and interference with protected species by\n            removing, storing, and replacing topsoil; replanting areas\n            after use; and bio-regenerating soil polluted by accidental\n            dumping. Alleviate adverse effects to the quality of surface\n            and underground water by avoiding dumping and controlling\n            waste disposal, controlling vehicles traversing the\n            watercourses, avoiding excavation during the rainy season,\n            avoiding the storage of hazardous materials near\n            watercourses, installing filtration barriers, regularly\n            maintaining equipment and machinery, avoiding oil spills,\n            and managing water use. Put in place a compensation system\n            according to agreed upon standards for the destruction of\n            fruit trees and crops, buildings, and real and personal\n            property. Set up a forest management program, and control\n            hunting and launch a preventative information campaign to\n            reduce interference and destruction of animals. Protect\n            workers and the general population from infectious diseases\n            and pollution by treating water and reducing, separating,\n            recycling, storing and disposing of waste according to\n            agreement, and providing information on disease prevention;\n            from accidents by securing buildings; and from fire hazards\n            by acquiring equipment. Lastly, the project will protect\n            cultural heritage and religious sites and monuments and/or\n            compensate the population as required."}, "docdt": "2004-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
