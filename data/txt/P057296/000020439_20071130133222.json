The additional grant would help\n            finance the costs associated with completion of certain\n            priority activities included in the original Project scope,\n            which are subject to unanticipated cost overruns and\n            financing gaps. The focus of the support will be for: (i)\n            urgent rehabilitation of key elements of electricity sector\n            infrastructure, and (ii) project execution and supervision\n            across the infrastructure component of the Project in order\n            to ensure that activities are completed by the Project\n            closing date.
