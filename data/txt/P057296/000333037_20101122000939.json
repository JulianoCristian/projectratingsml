Some lessons learned\n            included: a distinction needs to be made between emergency\n            operations caused by natural disasters and those in a\n            post-conflict context. In the first case, institutional\n            capacity and policy tend not be major issues. In the second\n            case, because of the destruction caused by conflicts, the\n            process starts off with much lower levels of capacity and\n            knowledge. This argues for the need to include institutional\n            reforms, capacity building and sector strategy formulation\n            as was done in this project in order to start laying the\n            foundations for the future. Strong commitment from\n            management in terms of resources and continuity within the\n            task team is a key determination of successful\n            implementation. The use of Non-governmental organizations\n            proved to be an effective and efficient way of\n            implementation the social activities at the grass root\n            level. This should serve as a lesson and good precedent.\n            Even in emergency situations, an effort should be made to\n            address sustainability issues at the project or program\n            design stage. If not done, the investments made could be\n            jeopardized over the long term. If this is not discussed\n            during project preparation and appraisal, it should be\n            included as part of early implementation activities as it\n            was done in the project case."}, "docdt": "2010-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
