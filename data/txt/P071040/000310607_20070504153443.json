OF THE SECOND\n            PALESTINIAN NGO PROJECT,TFS50291-DFID - SECOND PALESTINIAN NGO PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Revised", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory;\n            assessment of risk to development is rated as high;\n            Bank's performance is rated satisfactory and\n            Borrower's performance is also rated satisfactory. Some\n            of the lessons learned included: 1) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E). Although data is necessarily\n            qualitative in this kind of project, it should be\n            systematically organized to avoid the anecdotal. The Second\n            Palestinian NGO Project (PNGOII) was unable to produce\n            baseline data across all components inhibiting any\n            measurement of development outcomes. More attention to\n            participatory approaches to needs assessment, planning\n            implementation and monitoring should allow baseline data\n            collection to be incorporated in monitoring system design.\n            Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the working environment\n            will probably continue to be subject to security-related\n            interruptions and delays that force project designers to\n            move ahead without data collection in some cases; 2) Variety\n            in Grant types. Although PNGOII had rather a multiplicity of\n            grant types, it clearly demonstrated the need for different\n            categories. The Partnership Grants paired experienced NGOs\n            operating at a national level with small community based\n            organizations and provided a model for knowledge transfer.\n            It also developed long lasting collaborative partnerships\n            among NGOs in an environment where competition among NGOs is\n            rife. The Emergency Grants demonstrated the value of drawing\n            rapid donor funds to emerging needs; 3) Capacity-Building.\n            This takes time especially in conflict-affected or unstable\n            contexts, and the Bank's commitment to the NGO sector\n            by remaining engaged through a series of projects was\n            critical, although PNGOII was just one of a sequence of\n            projects whose long-term outcome is yet to be measured.\n            Capacity building occurred indirectly through the experience\n            of implementing sub-grants or directly through the\n            components designed to 'teach' skills; and 4)\n            Looking Forward to PNGOIII. Strategic development in the\n            grant components took a back seat to achieving success in\n            the provision of services and creation of a network of NGOs\n            and Community-based organizations all the way to the final\n            beneficiaries. Under any successor projects, it will be\n            important for the relative responsibilities of NGO\n            Development Centers Board and staff to be fully and clearly\n            documented and followed. This should lead to improved\n            awareness of the need for strategic thinking and development."}, "docdt": "2007-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
