       Organization (NGO) Project will strengthen NGOs'\n            capacity to deliver sustainable services to poor and\n            marginalized Palestinians, while supporting the overall\n            professional, and strategic development of the Palestinian\n            NGO sector. The project will be implemented as a\n            comprehensive program of capacity building, by improving the\n            quality, impact, and sustainability of service provision\n            schemes. Project components include: 1) provision of grants\n            for the implementation of service delivery projects, to be\n            implemented by lead NGOs, and Partnership Grant Managers, in\n            partnership with smaller NGOs. These projects will target\n            marginalized communities, through a mix of\n            sectoral/regional, and community-based projects, to be\n            implemented over a period of two years. Technical assistance\n            (TA), and organizational capacity building will be provided\n            as needed; 2) provision of grants by NGOs, and Development\n            Grant Recipients (DGR), for implementation of projects,\n            provided ability to manage quality projects was demonstrated\n            during Phase I of the project. Grants awarded to DGRs will\n            represent incremental support, which will significantly\n            contribute to sustain project activities financed under\n            Phase I of the project; 3) the Sector Support Program, to\n            provide technical expertise at the sectoral level, and will\n            promote information exchange, elaborate stronger\n            sector's role in development, and, promote a dialogue\n            for enhancing public, and nongovernmental service delivery\n            programs; and, 4) TA, and monitoring and evaluation, to\n            support capacity gaps in managerial areas of the\n            partnership/development grants programs, and, to conduct\n            overall program evaluations."}, "docdt": "2001-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
