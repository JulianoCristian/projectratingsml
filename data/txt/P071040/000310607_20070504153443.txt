1. Project Context, Development Objectives [or Global Environment Objectives] and Design (this section is
descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1      Context at Appraisal

The Palestinian NGOII Project (PNGOII) was a follow-up to the first Palestinian NGO Project (PNGOI) which,
between November 1997 and December 2002, provided US$14.5 million in grants to NGOs to deliver services to
the poor. Despite being overtaken by the downturn in political and security events (the Palestinian resistance,
Intifada, started in September 2000), PNGOI largely achieved its development objectives with a Satisfactory
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rating. PNGOII was designed, appraised and implemented in a period
of severe social and economic fragility in the West Bank and Gaza, brought about by the volatile political and
security context. The continuing Intifada against an Israeli policy of closures, curfews, and cantonment combined
to produce a changing and unpredictable setting for all forms of development cooperation. The project was
nevertheless broadly consistent with the Bank's evolving assistance strategy of this period, subsequently endorsed
by the Board in December 2003, which was essentially to support the strengthening of capacities for, and
financing the delivery of, basic services to the poor through the development of efficient and transparent
institutions.

The rationale for continuing assistance to an active NGO sector was clear and sound, both in improving
sustainable services and responding to emergency needs as they arose. The NGO sector pre-dated the Palestinian
Authority (PA) by many years and was rightly judged to be one of the more effective means of delivering Bank
assistance through whatever circumstances lay ahead. PNGOI already provided the evidence and institutional
framework for a continuation. In the words of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), "The project objective is
consistent with the Bank Group strategy outlined in "Replenishing the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank,"
April 1998 (R98-96), which stresses the need for sustained growth and increased job opportunities through an
equitable development process. By furthering "a shared vision of the NGO sector and by enhancing its capacity to
play its role more effectively, the project will contribute to supporting the development of a sound civil society -a
major element of good governance and of a healthy transformation towards statehood." At the same time, it was
acknowledged that "PNGO II will provide an essential instrument for supporting the Bank's engagement in an
expanded emergency program and, more importantly, in supporting the key role played by NGOs in responding to
community needs under circumstances of enormous economic and social difficulty." In other words, the project
was set up to address either a stagnating (emergency assistance) or recovery (institution-building) scenario but
with more emphasis on the latter in line with an optimistic Bank strategy.

PNGOII continued to operate in a political climate that saw the stalling of the Oslo peace process and in a
developmental context that, at best, has failed to sustain any economic recovery. The continuing and increasing
inability of the PA to provide services put a greater dependency on the NGO sector as an alternative delivery. At
times, peaks of violence and social disruption made the context more suitable for emergency relief where
developmental progress was hard to measure. Outcomes have been so impacted by forces external to the project
(for example, the unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005) that assessment of the project' s achievements and
shortcomings is complicated and clear findings are hard to substantiate.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) [or Global Environmental Objectives (GEO)] and
Key Indicators [as approved]

The project aims at strengthening the capacity of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) to deliver sustainable
services to poor and marginalized Palestinians while supporting the overall professional and strategic
development of the Palestinian NGO sector.




                                                           1

Key performance indicators:

         (a)     an estimated 60% of beneficiaries would come from the lower poverty group and/or would be
                 amongst those marginalized due to physical and/or social constraints;
         (b)     over 60% of the beneficiaries would express satisfaction with the services provided through
                 NGOs to selected target beneficiaries;
         (c)     an estimated 60% of services provided by Development Grant recipients and 50% of services
                 provided by Partnership Grant recipients would be sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project;
                 and
         (d)     at least 50 NGOs would be assessed as having increased their capacity to plan, manage, and
                 secure longer-term funding for their service delivery programs.


1.3      Revised PDO [GEO] (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised but the key indicators in the PAD were reduced to three in the Implementation Status
and Results Reports (ISRs) (at ISR No. 9, 04/27/05) and differ slightly in formulation: (a) increased capacity of
NGOs to deliver sustainable services to the poor; (b) services delivered are benefiting the poorest of communities;
and (c) increased professionalism and capacity of NGOs to deliver services. The ICR reverts to the original PAD
indicators.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries (original and revised; briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified
in the PAD and as captured in the PDO[GEO], as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

As final beneficiaries, PNGOII targeted the poor and marginalized groups in Palestinian society who had no
access, or limited access, to services which secured their social and economic needs.       In this group, PNGOII
particularly targeted those under-served or marginalized due to their geographic location, in addition to those who
were vulnerable due to social and physical limitations (e.g., women, youth and the disabled), and to the respective
sectors and sub-sectors defined as priority due to limited resources available to support them. Outreach to the
final beneficiary population was to be accomplished through small NGOs and Community Based Organizations
(CBOs), which constituted the immediate beneficiaries. Smaller NGOs and CBOs were selected by lead partner
NGOs. No revisions to targeted beneficiaries were made.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)

1.       The Partnership Grants Program (US$8.79 million): This program was to award grants for the
implementation of 5 - 8 service delivery projects to be implemented by lead NGOs - Partnership Grant Managers
(PGMs) - in partnership with smaller NGOs/CBOs. The projects were to target marginalized communities through
a mix of sectoral/regional and target community based projects. Projects were expected to be implemented over
a period of two years and to have an average total budget of US$1 million with an estimated sub-grant size of
US$50,000 to US$100,000. About 7% of the overall budget was to be allocated to the provision of technical and
organizational capacity building programs to smaller NGOs or CBOs.

2.       The Development Grants Program (US$2.5 million): This program was to award grants for the
implementation of 10 - 15 projects by NGOs - Development Grant Recipients (DGRs) - that have demonstrated
the ability to manage quality projects during PNGOI. Grants to be awarded to DGRs would represent incremental
support that would contribute significantly to the enhanced sustainability of a project activity financed during
PNGOI and/or replicating a project activity in another location and/or assistance to bring an NGO to a high level
of capacity or sustainability. Projects to be financed would range between US$50,000 - US$300,000. The


                                                         2

Program was to set aside up to 7% of the total budget for tailor-made capacity building and institutional
development to recipient NGOs.

3.       The Sector Support Program (US$1.33 million): This program was to provide support at the sectoral
level, drawing on technical expertise of stronger NGOs and NGO networks. It would finance activities intended
to: (a) promote information exchange and networking within the NGO sector; (b) support the elaboration of a
stronger vision of the sector's role in development and its involvement in policy setting; (c) promote a positive
working environment for PA/NGO dialogue and for enhancing complementarity between public and non-
governmental service delivery programs; and (d) support the capacity of NGO networks to provide leadership in
the NGO sector and to better represent the needs and interests of their constituents/members. The program was to
be implemented through a combination of grants and sub-contracts to finance research, advocacy work, data
collection, discussion fora, seminars and technical expertise.

4.       Technical   Assistance     (TA)   and    Monitoring    &    Evaluation      (M&E)    (US$0.5    million):
National/international expertise was to be provided to: (a) support capacity gaps in areas that relate to effective
management of the partnership and development grants programs (community participation, M&E, fund-raising
etc); (b) develop M&E and targeting tools, including adaptation of the Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool
and pre-investment and targeting studies; and (c) conduct overall program evaluations, including annual financial
and management audits, a Mid-Term Review (MTR), evaluations of the governance structure and the potential for
developing the Supervisory Board into a governance structure that would outlive the project.

5.       Project Management (US$1.90 million): The Project Management Organization (the PMO) would be
responsible for the management of the grant awarding process, overall supervision of sub-projects, provision of
technical expertise to sub-grant managers and reporting on and dissemination of project results and impact. The
PMO would also facilitate dialogue between various stakeholders and administer the implementation of the Sector
Support Component of the project, including the procurement of expertise, organization of workshops/seminars
and the provision of referral services.

6.       The Emergency Grants Program (US$TBD): This component was proposed as a window for
channeling emergency funds that may be made available to the Bank by other donors as part of their response to
immediate emergency needs. The PMO had already managed the disbursement of US$1 million from the World
Bank's Emergency Response Program (ERP) for employment generation projects implemented by NGOs. Funds
made available for this component would finance projects not exceeding US$100,000 in value, aiming to support
employment generation, expansion/rehabilitation of basic health service facilities, community centers and
rehabilitation services. This component was not funded at the appraisal stage, as an emergency could not have
been envisaged at that time. In the unlikely event that no additional donor funds should be mobilized, the
component would be dropped with no impact on any of the other components.

1.6      Revised Components

The project components as listed in the PAD were not revised but additional activities were added as detailed
below.

1.7      Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule,
and funding allocations)

Donor co-financing was subsequently leveraged for the Emergency Grants Program to a total of US$4.88 million
(with an additional US$6 million in parallel financing from the Agence française de Développement (AFD). Three
significant changes were made to the program.         An Urgent Development Grants component amounting to
US$2.56 million was added to respond to the deteriorating economic and social conditions in the northern and
southern West Bank. Twenty five projects were funded for the following activities: agricultural employment


                                                         3

generation, psychological counseling, vocational training, education for people with special needs, health and
youth. Budget for this component relied on uncommitted grants from the Partnership Grants Program. A second
additional undertaking was the Counseling Center for Women in Difficult Circumstances (CCWDC) which was
fully funded by an Italian contribution of US$3.2 million. Finally, an unforeseen Residual Funds Grants facility
(totaling US$0.9 million) for NGOs was made possible by the strengthening the Sterling and Euro in the
international currency markets. This provided 24 small grants for non-formal education, agriculture and youth-
related activities.


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

PNGOII was a follow-on project whose design and preparation was well able to benefit from the ICR for PNGOI
which rated its outcome as "Satisfactory". Improvements to operational procedures, monitoring, potential for
sustainability, community participation and targeting, capacity-building for smaller NGOs and support to the
NGO sector as a whole, were all identified for attention in PNGOII.             These improvements were largely
incorporated, especially in the TA and M&E component. The PAD included a useful section on "Lessons
Learned and Reflected in Project Design". Of all these recommendations, beneficiary involvement appears to
have received at least attention both in design and subsequent implementation. Critically, the risk section
captured the possibility of severe deterioration in the overall context and the contingent shift to emergency
response.

The project design also benefited from PNGOI in facing the complexity and risks of working in an unpredictable
context, especially in opening a potential emergency component. It was also able to anticipate the operational
strengths and needs of the PMO and NGO sector as a whole, although it may not have accurately assessed the
PMO's procurement capabilities.

The PDO does raise one problematic issue ­ the question of "sustainability" which in a context where services
may well (and subsequently did) decline on account of the deteriorating security context, is a hard standard to set.
Sustainability remained undefined in the PAD both in relation to services and NGO capacity building. It was
interpreted by the task team to mean the functional sustainability (financial and institutional) of the NGOs
delivering the services. To include this kind of sustainability, especially "beyond the lifetime of the project", was
probably an over-ambitious indicator to include in the design. The ICR will return to this issue in subsequent
sections.

2.2     Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk
status, and actions taken, as applicable)

The tabulated summary of the 11 PSR/ISRs (Annex 6(d)) tracks implementation progress, risk status and the
regularity of supervision. This and the recipient's ICR (Annex 10) carries a detailed account of implementation
which clearly benefited by close supervision from an in-country Task Team Leader (TTL). As with PNGOI, the
project experienced a delayed start, largely due to the delay in drafting an operational manual. Further delays in
establishing the grant components are more readily attributed to the working environment at this stage (2002
experienced a peak in violence and closures inhibiting movement and working conditions), and already there was
consideration of re-allocating partnership grant funds (whose approval process was also reported as slow and
bureaucratic) to urgent development grants. The project was extended three times, initially in August 2004 in
order to allow completion of implementation, with particular concern on the capacity-building and sector support
components. A further extension was granted in April 2005 to allow for continuation of project activities,
especially the project management structure, to carry over to the new project, the Palestinian NGO III (PNGOIII).
The ICR concludes that implementation was responsive to changes in project context and content and took


                                                         4

reasonable corrective action when components were in difficulty. It is noteworthy that because the project
responded effectively to delays it was never rated `at risk'.

One additional activity, the establishment of the Counseling Center for Women in Difficult Circumstances
(CCWDC) in Bethlehem, was particularly affected by cumulative delays in building the center. Further delays
also occurred because a large number of stakeholders are involved in the implementation of the project and the
two main partners (the Italian and Palestinian NGOs) responsible for the technical assistance aspect of the project
had a difficult working relationship. These delays have pushed the recruitment and related training of centre staff
beyond the end of PNGOII. Consequently, the Italian Grant funding this activity was initially extended through
February 2007, with a final extension until May 31, 2007, to allow for completion of final activities. Assessment
of the outcome at this stage is therefore not possible.


2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E Design: the PAD was reasonably explicit about M&E arrangements at project and sub-project level
(including an explicit project component) although leaving implementation in the hands of `subsequent training'.
However, the focus in design was on project outputs rather than development outcomes; and (b) M&E
Implementation: In essence PNGOII left an information system in place to track compliance in disbursement of
funds, but not outcomes. The August 2006, the Impact Assessment team noted that "One of the important
achievements of the monitoring and reporting process was that it provides an organizational framework to ensure
compliance and probity in the disbursement and utilization of funds." Nonetheless, they also note that "Most of
the project records focused on activities and outputs. Training in impact evaluation for PMO staff was only
commissioned towards the end of the Project and there was no time to communicate impact evaluation ideas to
recipient NGOs." They conclude that "A solid basis has been constructed upon which it will be possible to create
a more qualitatively orientated system of M&E. There is need for more direct involvement of beneficiaries in the
M&E process and the greater participation, along with the establishment of appropriate evaluative and impact
related baseline data, will contribute towards improving the capacity of the PMO as a learning organization." The
ICR concurs with this assessment and notes therefore the difficulty in any utilization of the monitoring data. An
effective participatory monitoring system is being put in place by PNGOIII.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Financial Management: Throughout the life of PNGOII, the PMO issued regular audit reports on time and
auditors' opinions have always been unqualified. It has maintained an effective internal control system to ensure
that project expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents are maintained, accounts are reconciled
periodically and project assets, including cash, are safeguarded.

Procurement: At entry, the Bank may have over-estimated the procurement capacity of the PMO and
underestimated    the   procurement     workload. Considerable   procurement-related   delays   occurred    during
implementation, in part because there was no dedicated procurement specialist within the PMO but also because
of the complex and time consuming procurement requirements of the Bank. Despite training offered by the Bank,
it was reported that the Bank could have provided more support through guidance in preparing annual
procurement plans and quicker turn around time for the review of bidding documents. To address the challenges
in addressing the project's procurement needs, one key staff member received procurement training in Turin, Italy.
In addition, the Bank hired a procurement consultant to provide training for the PMO staff. Based on the
experience of PNGOII, NDC, as the implementer of PNGOIII has already hired an experienced procurement
specialist dedicated for this activity.

Environmental safeguards: Although this was a category C project, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
was included in the Operations Manual. The EMP was mainly designed to mitigate negative environmental


                                                          5

impacts related to very small scale infrastructure construction. However, environmental safeguards were not
sufficiently planned for during project implementation. For example, it would have been advisable to include a
Bank environmental specialist during supervision.


2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion,
operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation and Maintenance arrangements,
sustaining reforms and institutional capacity and next-phase follow-up operation, if applicable)

PNGOII rates Highly Satisfactory in providing for the continuation of its objectives. Following a Supervisory
Board meeting on future directions, the April 2005 ISR proposed a follow-on PNGOIII project well before the
end of PNGOII. The timely production of a Completion Report by the PMO facilitated analysis of the main
issues and changes to be made under PNGOIII. Clearly, the maintenance and establishment of the NGO
Development Center (NDC) provide the institutional (with the accompanying technical and financial know-how)
setting to ensure effective project continuity. Due to the timely initiative of the Supervisory Board, the skills,
experience and institutional set-up of the PMO have been embedded as the executive arm in the new NDC.
Sustainability of gains made under PNGOII is also discussed in the following section.


3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities, and
Bank assistance strategy):

Overall, the PDOs, design and implementation were clear and responsive to both the fragile economic and social
context and the Bank's evolving strategy. In the words of the PAD, "The project objective is consistent with the
Bank Group strategy outlined in "Replenishing the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank," April 1998 (R98-
96), which stresses the need for sustained growth and increased job opportunities through an equitable
development process. As stated, the design took up many of the lessons from PNGOI, and despite deterioration in
the development context, objectives remained relevant to the end.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives [or Global Environmental Objectives] (including
brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4)

In general, the project achieved its twin development objectives as measured against the original key performance
indicators and subsequent indicators in the ISR. The ICR considers that the project generated a considerable level
of service provision through NGOs throughout a period when their delivery was highly jeopardized by conditions
on the ground (see Annex 4). PNGOII successfully continued an innovative approach for the Bank to service
delivery in a conflict-affected context. Some questions remain about success in targeting the poorest and most
marginalized groups and in employing more participatory approaches to involving beneficiaries in all aspects of
planning, implementing and monitoring projects.

The first objective was strengthening the capacity of NGOs to deliver sustainable services to poor and
marginalized people. Available data, especially on the outcomes from the different grant components are
positive. Although the ICR concedes that some of the data were based on subjective 'satisfaction ratings' against
the objectives, these score consistently high and provide solid evidence of success in a context where results are
hard to measure. Ninety-three percent of the projects evaluated by the Beneficiary Impact Assessment
(BIA) addressed unmet service needs. Eighty-four percent of beneficiaries reported that the project contributed
towards improving the quality of services provided to them, exceeding the target value of a 60% satisfaction rate.
All beneficiary NGOs reported satisfaction with the capacity building activities and said the project helped
increase their vocational and professional skills. However, the BIA focused on beneficiaries' experiences with the


                                                        6

project rather than gains in their rights and well being, more objective measurements of these would have
provided a clearer indication of the project's achievements. Sixty-two NGOs representing 70% of grant
recipients (compared to the PAD's target value of 50 NGOs) have met their objectives and achieved impact sought
in their success indicators, increasing their capacity to deliver sustainable services to the poor.

The second objective was supporting the overall professional and strategic development of the Palestinian
NGO sector. The ICR concludes that this objective was partially achieved (and likely more prone to disruption
by the political and security context). Certainly, the record on outputs is positive. Support in the form of training,
policy dialogue, information exchange and financial management was provided to five NGO networks and
enhanced their professional credentials and financial sustainability. Seven studies of the NGO sector and civil
society were conducted (two more than the PAD target), together with a study of the general best practices of 27
NGOs that were reviewed. Two hundred NGOs participated in the development of an NGO Code of Ethics, in
addition to the success of the 62 NGOs noted above. These achievements in total suggest that the project
exceeded the key performance indicator of "increased capacity of fifty NGOs." Despite progress in information
exchange, the united health insurance program and the progression of the supervisory board to an NGO
Development Center (NDC), the capacity-building activities in the Sector Support component were less
successful.

In both objectives, the question of sustainability and its measurement is slightly problematic especially where the
outcome is beyond the project's control (i.e., the overall situation causes services to deteriorate faster than the
ability of the project to improve them). The ICR therefore rates sustainability relative to the context, i.e.,
counteracting the deterioration of services and institutions. Within the lifetime of the project, it clearly increased
the chances of sustainability by raising finance (including donor finance) and capacity for NGO service providers.
Beyond its lifetime, the project has also successfully "passed the baton" on NGO work from PNGOI to PNGOIII,
creating NDC as a vehicle for future development. Taking this approach to sustainability, the ICR rates the
project positively.


3.3 Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least
cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The project finances meritorious and basic services for poor and vulnerable people, hence a traditional rate of
return analysis does not apply. The Bank's Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) reports also indicate that the
focus on the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) should be on institutional development aspects rather than economic
consideration. However, analyses of the short-term employment generation of the sub-project has shown that the
labor content under PNGOII was about thirty percent, much higher than smaller schemes elsewhere in the
country.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs [GEO], and
efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory.

Notwithstanding the deterioration in conditions and impact on sustainability, the ICR considers the outcome
achievements to be Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above)

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


                                                           7

The beneficiaries of the first PDO are described as the poor and marginalized.      The objective was met in that
70% of the beneficiaries of partnership grants were from the lower poverty group. This exceeds the indicator
target that an estimated 60% of beneficiaries would come from the lower poverty group and/or would be amongst
those marginalized due to physical and/or social constraints. At the beginning of the project (end of 2000) the
poverty rate was 30% amongst the Palestinian population of West Bank and Gaza. By 2004, the poverty rate was
reported as 47% and has continued to rise. In such a situation, it is easier to find people living in poverty but
much harder to be sure of reaching those most in need or those who subsequently become vulnerable. Without
the continued participation of beneficiaries in needs assessment and analysis, standards on targeting are harder to
maintain. In PNGOII targeting was left to NGO sub-projects, who in the difficult and changing circumstances
seem to have done a satisfactory job.

The project beneficiaries constituted 55% women. Unfortunately the BIA did not carry out any gender analysis
so the gender related impact is difficult to assess beyond the macro observation.

Anecdotal evidence suggests social development gains amongst the NGOs. The Impact Assessment (IA) found
widespread examples of grant recipients building positive relationships with local government institutions and the
PA. They observed sensitive adaptation to variations in local social conditions and associated patterns of
solidarity and social capital.    Formal and informal linkages were seen to have developed between several
community groups and there is increasing NGO coordination and cooperation with governmental institutions and
local NGOs. A number of NGOs indicated to the IA team that the project had helped them to strengthen their
relationship with local communities and local government and to promote community support and participation.
Again, a more rigorous approach to collecting and analyzing qualitative data would have provided a stronger
conclusion on these aspects.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and
institutional development):

As recorded, institutional strengthening of NGOs directly benefiting from project finance was widely reported.
Changes in the political and economic context, especially towards the end of the project, make it less clear
whether these gains are sustainable or may benefit the NGO sector as a whole. The IA commented that whereas
five years ago a PNGO project evaluation team could talk about increasing provision of more sophisticated
services for exceptionally disadvantaged people, they now found people talking about lack of food. In these
circumstances the impact of the Project may have been in helping institutions survive rather than positively
develop. Nevertheless, the ICR notes that improving the capacity of NGOs to compete for donor funds in a
context where services and their providers are dependent on external development assistance is a form of
institutional strengthening.

On the level of the PMO itself, the ICR concurs with the IA which commented that there has been no significant
institutional change during the Project. This was in part because PMO staff were too preoccupied with working
for change in others to reflect upon and implement development in their own institutional practices. This form of
institutional learning will be addressed in PNGOIII.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High.

The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained depends upon one overriding factor outside the
project's control and to three factors that are arguably more within its influence.


                                                          8

First, continuing volatility of the political and security situation and resulting economic and social impacts (as
well as the impact on sustained donor funds) clearly threaten sustainability of the development objectives on both
the service provision and NGO capacity-building fronts. The ICR does not rate this as "non-evaluable" (according
to ICR guidelines on war and insecurity) and notes that an NGO project might be expected to have greater
flexibility than many types of Bank projects to work around this kind of constraint. However, the risk remains
high and is clearly a threat to outcomes.

Secondly, sustainable service provision also depends upon a complementarity between public and NGO
programs. The SSP component recognized that a positive dialogue between the PA and NGOs was necessary,
and, politics allowing, this would be a priority for successor projects.

Thirdly, whilst the project's capacity-building of NGOs has been satisfactory it has not yet been able to introduce
a culture of meaningful beneficiary involvement or of critical self reflection and onward institutional
development. These are essential qualities for the flexible and agile NGO sector that is needed in such a volatile
operating environment and is being addressed in PNGOIII.

Finally, the governance of the project through the Welfare Association (WA) Board still has to address a number
of significant shortcomings identified both in the MTR and in the 2004 external evaluation of the Board. Under
PNGOIII, the Board has now evolved under PNGOIII into the NGO Development Center (NDC) and these
continuing concerns will need to be addressed fully.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and outcome
issues)

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry           (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Bank identified, facilitated preparation of, and appraised the operation such that it was likely to achieve the
planned development outcomes consistent with the Bank's evolving strategy. The Bank incorporated all the
lessons of PNGOI as far as possible with a realistic assessment of institutional and implementation capacities in a
volatile environment. Risk assessment was accurate (without undue pessimism that would have taken it out of line
with the Bank's strategy) with the emergency grants option as mitigation.


(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Project was closely supervised by a TTL based in the country office and was subject to six monthly ISRs
throughout its lifetime. This close supervision assisted the PMO to overcome the considerable difficulties created
by the deteriorating political situation and related access and other working restrictions. The PSRs/ISRs record
most of this candidly with the possible exception of procurement difficulties. During the project, some of the
components went through periods of unsatisfactory performance or progress but were all successfully resolved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.


                                                          9

Given the extremely difficult operating conditions, often more akin to emergency relief than development or even
post-conflict recovery, the Bank maintained the project at a level where the basic goal ­ services through NGOs ­
was achieved to a remarkable degree, with an additional element of capacity building albeit not to the level hoped
for at the time of the PAD.

5.2      Borrower Performance

NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and justification
only for Overall Borrower Performance.

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The ICR takes this rating to apply to the WA as sole signatory and recipient of the grant. The WA fulfilled its
responsibilities in overseeing the PMO. It should be noted that the Ministry of Planning was a strong supporter of
the project and was represented on the Supervisory Board as an observer. This ensured oversight and
complementarity of grant activities with public services.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

The PMO managed the project as agreed with the Bank, was responsive to changes and other demands of
stakeholders, and produced deliverables such as audits and evaluations on time. On the strength of their overall
performance, the Bank has endorsed their role as implementer of PNGOIII.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

11.1 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Although data is necessarily qualitative in this kind of project, it
should be systematically organized to avoid the anecdotal. PNGOII was unable to produce baseline data across all
components inhibiting any measurement of development outcomes.         More attention to participatory approaches
to needs assessment, planning implementation and monitoring should allow baseline data collection to be
incorporated in monitoring system design. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the working environment will
probably continue to be subject to security-related interruptions and delays that force project designers to move
ahead without data collection in some cases.

11.2 Variety in Grant types. Although PNGOII had rather a multiplicity of grant types, it clearly demonstrated
the need for different categories. The Partnership Grants paired experienced NGOs operating at a national level
with small community based organizations and provided a model for knowledge transfer. It also developed long
lasting collaborative partnerships among NGOs in an environment where competition among NGOs is rife. The
Emergency Grants demonstrated the value of drawing rapid donor funds to emerging needs.

11.3 Capacity-Building. This takes time especially in conflict-affected or unstable contexts, and the Bank's
commitment to the NGO sector by remaining engaged through a series of projects was critical, although PNGOII



                                                        10

was just one of a sequence of projects whose long-term outcome is yet to be measured. Capacity
building occurred indirectly through the experience of implementing sub-grants or directly through the
components designed to 'teach' skills. In the latter case, beneficiary NGOs needed more guidance on what support
in terms of TA, M&E and SSP components were available to them.

11.4 Looking Forward to PNGOIII. Strategic development in the grant components took a back seat to
achieving success in the provision of services and creation of a network of NGOs and CBOs all the way to the
final beneficiaries. Under any successor projects, it will be important for the relative responsibilities of NDC's
Board and staff to be fully and clearly documented and followed. This should lead to improved awareness of the
need for strategic thinking and development. For example, while Development Grant recipients have all done
very well in achieving sustainability and growth in their services, none are yet proposing new types of services
which would enable them to draw on their success in programs they currently run. The question of how NDC
should develop as a central or decentralized institution needs to be considered given the complexity and
variability of needs and operating conditions in WBG and interviews with different stakeholders and beneficiaries
frequently raised this issue. The need for increased beneficiary involvement in successor projects has already been
highlighted. At the other end of the spectrum, dialogue with the PA, politics permitting, will be key to obtaining
strategic objectives. PNGOIII also builds procurement capacity.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies:

The borrower/implementer provided a very thorough ICR whose conclusions and recommendations are broadly
consistent with this ICR. Comments were also provided on the draft ICR and are attached in Annex 7.

(b)     Co-financiers:

Co-financiers were generally satisfied with PNGOII with the exception of the CCWDC component.

(c)     Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society):

NGOs interviewed expressed general satisfaction with the project with some reservations about `bureaucracy'
perceived as emanating from the Bank, especially on grant application procedures and procurement. It appears
that more guidance on procedures (rather than correction to any intrinsic failings) is required. On capacity-
building, NGO interviewees were first to point out that this was a much longer term process and that
achievements in a two-year sub-project grant would be hard to measure. They also reported that a 10% overhead
limit produced 'understaffing' forcing them to supplement the costs with their own funds, and that 15% would be
more realistic. Training in the SSP component was rated Unsatisfactory ­ ill-suited and not well-prepared.

Annex 2.     Outputs by Component


Note: The PMO's ICR (Annex 7) accurately records the detailed achievements of each component.

1.       Partnership Grants: All of the six programs funded under this component were fully implemented by lead
NGOs reaching 89 partner organizations. The six recipients have also received their interim audit reports. As
of October 2005 disbursement against funds allocated to this component reached 98%. TheUS$7.0 million
disbursed is calculated to have reached 108,000 beneficiaries. Recipients reported that partnership grants were
better planned but more bureaucratic than development grants with a lengthy approval process that was prone to
be overtaken by events. Both partnership grants and development grants were reported to have built capacity more
effectively than the SSP. Both had good geographical and thematic coverage, and relations with the PMO
throughout were excellent. The ICR rates this component Highly Satisfactory.

2.       Development Grants: All of the 19 projects funded (in excess of the PAD target of 10-15) have completed
their activities. The US$3 million disbursed is calculated to have reached 18,000 beneficiaries. The cost
effectiveness of this approach appears to be less than for partnership grants in terms of cost per beneficiary
reached. Development grants cost 2.5 times more per beneficiary. Recipients acknowledged good capacity
building gains in this component. The ICR rates this component Satisfactory.

3.       The Sector Support Program (SSP). Despite progress in information exchange, the united health insurance
program and the progression of the supervisory board to an NGO Development Center (NDC), the capacity
building activities, as recorded, have been incomplete on outputs and un-measurable on outcome. On capacity
building, NGOs reported limited understanding of, or benefit from, this component. The difficulties arose from an
initially poor objective definition which made recruitment and retention of a correctly qualified and skilled
program manager problematic. This was recognized at the MTR and the program objectives were revised.
Following this, the program was able to make a late start and to make good progress in some aspects.
Nonetheless, the program objectives were still too broad to be reaching the specific needs of individual NGOs,
hence the lack of identification reported by beneficiary organizations. Such significant shortcomings in a critical
aspect of the overall program design should be identified and rectified earlier in future. The ICR rates this
component Moderately Satisfactory.

4.       Technical Assistance (TA) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The shortcomings on M&E have been
recorded throughout the ICR. The BIA was completed, but, as recorded, multiple evaluations (including the final
impact evaluation) generally lacked rigor and therefore the ability to assess development outcomes with
reliability. The ICR rates this component Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.       Project Management. As recorded, the PMO did a satisfactory job of managing the entire program
through a volatile economic and social period. The necessary attention to day-to-day problem solving probably
reduced the opportunity to enhance its own capacity. The enthusiasm and dedication of project staff at all levels
was noted by the IA team. They gave credit to the attitudes and style of the PMO field staff for grant receiving
NGOs feeling that they had ownership of the activities funded by the project despite its demanding procedures.
The ICR rates this component as Satisfactory.

6.       Emergency Grants. This component, triggered by the deteriorating economic context, was funded entirely
by other donor funds (AFD and the Swiss) resulting in 82 employment generation projects. These grants were
consistently rated Highly Satisfactory for the last two years of the project. They generated nearly 150,000 person
days of employment at a time when unemployment had more than doubled. They were highly efficient in
meeting immediate needs in very difficult circumstances. The ICR rates this component Highly Satisfactory.

Additional components:

7.      Urgent Development Grants from unallocated grant resources (under the partnership component) were
used to address agricultural, health and other special needs in areas most affected by the economic downturn. The
ICR rates this component Satisfactory.

8.      Residual Funds Grants. Exchange rate windfall gains enabled US$0.89 million additional funding to
NGOs on a demand basis. The ICR rates this component Satisfactory.

9.      CCWDC. The ICR is unable to rate this component at this time since it has been extended due to the
reported delays in implementation. A Completion Report will be prepared when this activity is completed in May
2007.

Annex 3.     Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

         The project finances meritorious and basic services for poor and vulnerable people, hence a traditional
rate of return analysis does not apply. IEG's reports also indicate that the focus on WBG should be on
institutional development aspects rather than economic consideration. However, analyses of the short-term
employment generation sub-project have shown that the labor content under PNGOII was about 30%, much
higher than smaller sub-project schemes elsewhere in the country.

Annex 5.         Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)


PNGOII Beneficiary Impact Assessment: Executive summary

The general objective of the Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) is to identify the impact of the
development operations by gaining the views and perceptions of the intended beneficiaries as to the
changes that resulted from these interventions.

The BIA had the following objectives:

  (a)   Assessing the nature and degree of beneficiary satisfaction (availability, accessibility and quality of
        services) with the PNGO II projects and sub-projects;
  (b)   determining the degree, and increasing the rate of participation; and
  (c)   determining the level of awareness of the existence and nature of the PNGO II fund and the ways to
        relate to it.

The total number of institutions received support from PNGO during the second project cycle was 216. As per the
ToR, the research team selected 46 NGOs/grants by utilizing stratified random sampling which took into
consideration the following criteria:

1. Cover all types of grants (partnership grant, development grants, emergency grants and urgent grants).

2. Represent the different sectors (agriculture and water sector, health, youth, education and others).

In addressing the terms of reference of the beneficiary impact assessment (BIA), the research team incorporated
the views of both the supply and demand sides of the project (providers and beneficiaries of PNGO's supported
projects). The methodology utilized in-depth interviews with representatives of Palestinian NGOs as well as the
beneficiaries utilizing structured and semi-structured questionnaires. The findings should be interpreted in the
light of the limitations of the evaluation methodology. The findings are not based on an objective evaluation but
mainly reflect the perception of both the providers and beneficiaries of PNGO's supported projects.

1.1. Summary of institutions' main findings
The results of the interviews with implementing institutions' representatives are as follows:

1.1. A. Management of grants

1.      Majority of institutions had poor understanding of the conceptual and operational definition of project
outputs. Majority of institutions could not differentiate between project main outputs and activities.

2.      Majority of institutions indicated that the budget was adequate or very adequate for the implementation of
the project. Approximately, one third of institutions which implemented projects think the budget is inadequate.
This implies that institutions need to improve their skills in project planning and budgeting while developing their
proposals and action plans. More attention should be given to the development of action plans of partnership and
emergency grants to avoid falling short in the budget which affects the ability of the NGO to provide adequate
services to the target groups.

3.      Majority of institutions were satisfied with the process of obtaining grants from PNGO-Welfare Association
especially in the clarity of application procedure, clarity of institutions' eligibility to benefit from PNGO grants and
requirements of writing the grant proposal. Higher dissatisfaction with obtaining grants and in the delay of
transferring the money were among institutions which implemented partnership grants.


                                                          19

4.       The high rate of implementation of projects' outputs is of significance and reflects the presence of adequate
management support and follow up mechanisms from both the implementing institutions and PNGO-Welfare.

1.1.B. Capacity-Building

1.       Despite the fact that the institutions are happy with the positive impact of the projects on their capacity
building especially in conducting needs assessment, improving technical capacity and developing communication
skills, the institutions (NGOs) are still in need of developing their capacity in financial management and the
improving the quality of services.

2.       The majority of interviewed institutions indicated that the project have had a positive impact on the capacity
building of institutions and had direct positive impact on beneficiaries and their families in different areas as
indicated above.

3.       Development grants had the highest impact compared to the partnership and emergency grants. The areas
that had the highest impact were; improved ability of institutions to conduct needs assessment, better understanding
of people's needs, improving technical capacity of staff and their communication skills. Again, one has to be aware
of the fact that grants have different objectives and this evaluation needs to address the specific objectives of
each type of grants.

4.       The institutions are very satisfied with the capacity building they had from implementing the PNGO-
supported projects especially in proposal writing and writing technical reports.

1.1.C. Beneficiaries' Participation

1.       Institutions seem to have limited understanding and appreciation of community participation including
those of the local NGOs. The tools and techniques of involving and mobilizing people are relatively lacking and
require much more attention by local NGOs and the donor community.

2.       The service providers lack the skills and tools of involving local communities and therefore the community
mobilization component should be strengthened in order to maximize the impact and relevance of the supported
projects. Many institutions believe or claim that they are capable of knowing the needs and priorities while
beneficiaries have little to add to the design and implementation of projects.

3.       The ability of the project services to promote sense of participation and equity was much higher in Gaza
than those in the West Bank.

1.1.D. Impact on Beneficiaries

1.       The major project's contributions to the target communities include; it managed to address the unmet needs
of the poor and marginalized, improving the quality of services; improved access to health and social services and
improved the health and nutritional status of people.

2.       To increase the positive impact of the project on target beneficiaries including the poor, the institutions
recommended supporting projects that enhance the economic and social sectors which enable people to become
productive and earn adequate income to improve their living conditions.

1.1.E. Recommended Actions of Priority to the Target Beneficiaries

1.       They indicated also the need to support more rehabilitation projects that can equip the poor with skills and
allow them to enter to the local market, develop workers' vocational skills, support agricultural projects, support


                                                         20

health projects, support infrastructure, support job creation, provide financial support and support institutions that
provide assistance to the poor, establish housing for the poor and support women's projects.

1. 2. Summary of Beneficiaries' Main Findings

1. 2. 1. General profile of the beneficiaries' sample:

1.       Majority of interviewed beneficiaries were employed (completely or partially) but had low income. Two
thirds completed less than 12 years of education. This implies that PNGO supported projects have managed to target
less advantaged and poor segments of the Palestinian people in West Bank and Gaza.

1.2.2.   Relevance of project's components to beneficiaries needs:

1.       The majority of beneficiaries indicated that project' services were either relevant or very relevant to their
needs and priorities. Cross tabulation of these results with the type of grants showed that there is a significant
difference among the three main types (development, partnership and emergency grants) in relationship with how
beneficiaries perceive the relevance of projects' services.

2.       The beneficiaries of the Northern and Southern regions of West Bank and Gaza had the highest needs and
priorities in most of the development areas which reflects the size of their unmet needs.

3.       Majority of beneficiaries indicated that improving their level of education, supporting and upgrading their
work and personal skills, supporting infrastructure such as roads, clinics, water and sewage, job creation and
supporting occupational rehabilitation of those disabled and unemployed were of highest priorities for them.

1.2. B. Eligibility of Beneficiaries

1. The majority of beneficiaries indicated that they did not have clear knowledge of the eligibility criteria for
receiving services from projects supported by the Welfare Association Consortium. Information and
communications pertinent to project's services and eligibility of target groups may be inadequate and can be
improved.

2. The services provided by the projects' services supported by the Welfare Association Consortium managed to
cover adequately more than 80% of target beneficiaries, while those who indicated that services were not adequate
provided reasons related to limited project budget.

1.2.C. Participation of beneficiaries

1.       Neither beneficiaries nor institutions have developed adequate culture and tools for involving the public
in development projects which aim at improving their living conditions.

2.       Significant number of beneficiaries was not aware of the different project components which directly or
indirectly imply that the participation and involvement of people in the project planning and implementation was
inadequate and require much more efforts especially on the part of NGOs and CBOs.

1.2.D. Availability of Project Services (coverage)

1.       The availability of project services was generally adequate for majority of beneficiaries interviewed,
relatively inadequate especially among beneficiaries who live in poorer regions in West bank and Gaza and those
who live below the poverty line.



                                                         21

2.      Approximately, one third of beneficiaries had problems related to the availability of services and half of
them had reasons related to the high cost of these services. These concerns were highest among beneficiaries in
the south of West Bank and Gaza.

3.      PNGO supported projects have managed to reach out for segments of the poor and marginalized
beneficiaries. However, more efforts are required to cover more of the poor people especially in the Southern
region of Gaza and Northern and Southern regions of the West Bank.

4.      The main institutions' suggestions to increase projects' benefits to the beneficiaries included; Increase
coverage, reduce cost sharing and improve training and education, increase job opportunities, support agricultural
projects, and strengthen follow-up and supervision.

1.2. E. Quality of Project Services

1.      Majority of beneficiaries thought that the project's services provided by different NGOs were of good
quality. There is still approximately one quarter of beneficiaries who thought that NGOs' services require further
quality improvement. Again the main reasons for their dissatisfaction with the quality of NGO services include
limited availability of services and resources and relatively high cost of services. The most dissatisfied with the
quality of services were beneficiaries in the Southern regions of West Bank and Gaza.

2.      Project services supported by PNGO-Welfare were perceived of better quality in comparison with other
similar services supported by other institutions/donors. However, the majority of beneficiaries could not answer
the question because they could not compare with services supported by other sources.

3.      The majority of beneficiaries were satisfied with the mode (methods) of delivering the supported NGOs'
services.

1.2.F. Project's Positive Impacts

1.      The project seems to have had positive impact on changing the lives of beneficiaries. Approximately,
three quarters of beneficiaries indicated that the project managed to provide positive direct impact in the following
areas; provided economic incentives (job creation), improved psycho-social status of families, improved
educational skills and experience, improved quality of health services, facilitated the accessibility to needed
services and improved infrastructure. For those who were negatively affected, they indicated the inadequacy of
services and high cost of services was among the key reasons. This applies mainly to the Northern regions of the
West Bank and those in the South of Gaza.

2.      The main direct benefits that beneficiaries had by participating in the different projects supported by
PNGO-Welfare include; improving the economic conditions of beneficiaries, improved psychosocial conditions,
contributed to improvement in their personal and technical skills.

3.      The project helped increase the vocational and working skills of beneficiaries, improved beneficiaries'
psycho-social health and well being, reduced their family expenditures on necessary items such as food, improved
the service infrastructure, increased service coverage , increased beneficiaries awareness in different areas,
increased women's participation in different areas of development and increased support for needy beneficiaries.

4. The project had made a positive impact on the lives of women and children but this impact was felt in an
indirect way through the adult members of their families. Again, women and children in the Southern region of
the West Bank had the lowest impact.




                                                           22

5.       The poorer segments of the project's beneficiaries had better appreciation of the project's services despite the
fact that they had fewer benefits than other groups.

1.3. Common Findings Between Institutions and Beneficiaries' Assessment:

The results of both institutions and beneficiaries were in agreement in most of the issues investigated. These can
be summarized as follows:
(a)      Both assessments revealed that there is high relevance of the types of projects to the beneficiaries' needs
         and priorities.
(b)      Both assessments indicated that services were made available to all target areas despite the fact that one
         fifth of beneficiaries were not able to utilize the different projects' services.
(c)      Both indicated that the services were inadequate to cover al of those in need and that the allocated
         financial resources remain to be limited to cover more people.
(d)      The majority in both assessments indicated that the quality of services was high and useful to the target
         beneficiaries with some degree of variability.
(e)      The responses from both sides indicated that the projects contributed to building the capacity and skills
         the target groups.
(f)       Both assessments indicated that the projects had benefited the poor and marginalized through job
         creation, building occupational skills, supporting agricultural projects, awareness and education and
         supporting health services.
(g)       Both sides had almost similar responses on what type of projects are needed to serve the interest of the
         poor and marginalized such as increasing the coverage of services, developing occupational skills,
         decreasing the cost of services and supporting income generating projects.
(h)      Both assessments indicated that the target beneficiaries participated in the project needs assessment and
         implementation of activities but with great variation between the two. The beneficiaries and institutions
         could not spell out adequate methods and tools needed to mobilize local people.
(i)       Both assessments recognized that the projects' services helped beneficiaries improve their health,
         psycho-social well being, education and awareness, provided economic incentives and received needed
         services.

Annex 7.     Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

(Emailed comments received on April 2, 2007)

Dear Mesky,

We have reviewed the ICR for PNGO II. Please find below our comments:

1.    On page 1, first paragraph, PNGO I was implemented between November 1997 and August 2001. It was
initially designed as a three year project to be completed on 14 August 2000, but a transition period of one year
between phase I and phase II was granted until 14 August 2001. PNGOII therefore started on 14 August 2001.

2.   On page 4, paragraph 2.2, "CCWDR" should read CCWDC. The delays in implementation are attributed only
to the construction of the center. However a series of delays are also related to the working relationship between
the partners implementing the technical assistance component, and the fact that various stakeholders are involved
in the implementation of the CCWDC project.

3.   Page 5, the paragraph titled "procurement" under section 2.4 `safeguard and Fiduciary": Since the ICR could
not ascertain the root of the procurement-related delays, I prefer that we do not attribute the delay only to lack of
procurement expertise within the PMO. The PMO had the required expertise; however it did not have within its
structure a full time Procurement Specialist. Therefore the procurement work load for PNGO II might have been
underestimated, rather than the procurement capacity of the PMO being overestimated at entry. This could be a
matter to which we might not agree, but I hope you will take it into consideration. In our opinion, considerable
delays were also caused by the "bureaucratic" procedures at the Bank, and in many cases the Procurement Staff in
the country office could not make decisions before they received clearance from the head office. Selecting the
management audit firm for the last year of PNGO II is an example.

4.    Annex 1, "Project Cost by Component": The actual amount recorded for emergency grants (co-financing)
US$4.8 million does not match the amount recorded in our ICR (US$ 5,441,211, please refer to page 32 of the
ICR prepared by the PMO). The actual amount we recorded included:
     a) US$ 2,233,946 (US$1,792,522, the reallocation from DFID funds to emergency grants, and US$441,424
         to damage repair)

     b) US$ 3,207,265 (co-financing from ITL/PECDAR (US$1,500,000), CIDA (US$607,361), and IDB
         (US$1,099,904))

     This would bring the "Total Financing Required" to US$ 25,399,541 instead of 24.70 million.

5. Annex 2, "Outputs by component":
     a) Paragraphs 1 and 2: The fact that the ICR rates the partnership grants as "highly satisfactory" and the
         development grants as "satisfactory" might not be a fair conclusion. Development grants are more
         sophisticated than partnership grants. The achievement of development grants objectives and outputs are
         therefore much likely to cost more and require more time to realize. Under paragraph 1.1.B "Capacity
         Building", the ICR states that the "Development grants had the highest impact compared to the
         partnership and emergency grants". I therefore recommend that the rating to this component be changed
         to highly satisfactory.

     b) Paragraph 4, the technical assistance component: The rating "moderately unsatisfactory" is only based on
         the M&E, the beneficiary impact assessment and the final impact assessment. However, under the
         technical assistance component various other activities were initiated and successfully completed
         including financial and management audits, mid-term review, evaluation of the governance structure of

        the Supervisory Board and the potential for developing the Supervisory Board. I therefore recommend
        reviewing the rating on this component.
