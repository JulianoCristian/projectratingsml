of the major public institutions serving the housing sector,\n            namely KLDC and KNHC. These objectives are to be pursued in\n            the context of an ongoing dialogue on housing policy issues\n            between the Bank and the Korean Government which will be\n            intensified through the technical assistance and housing\n            sector study to be financed from this loan. The project\n            includes development of about 380ha of urban residential\n            land in ten medium-sized cities including off-site\n            infrastructure, construction of about 8,500 housing units\n            for low-income households, community and commercial\n            facilities and technical assistance covering staff training,\n            professional services, project preparation, studies and\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
