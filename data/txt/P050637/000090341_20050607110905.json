The\n            experience under this project illustrated some of the\n            limitations of partial private ownership to improve\n            municipal finances. Decentralization is a process that is\n            prone to reversals and decelerations. The State level\n            reforms expected at the beginning of the project did not\n            materialize, but the project still achieved considerable\n            successes. The ISP component would most likely have been\n            handled much better in a stand-alone project or as part of\n            an operation involving more closely related issues. It has\n            been noted by an external reviewer that the innovative\n            transactions pioneered by the Tamil Nadu Urban Development\n            Fund (TNUDF) have not been succeeded by the creation of a\n            framework that would permit a market for this type of\n            transaction. In implementing this operation, the TNUDF was\n            stretched to meet the Bank's very detailed project\n            finance model, including economic and financial analysis,\n            safeguard and fiduciary rules while operating within a\n            dynamic financial market servicing a large number of Urban\n            Local Bodies ULBs."}, "docdt": "2005-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
