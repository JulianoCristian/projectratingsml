Loss\n            of land, structures (houses and commercial property), labor\n            and trade, access to commonly enjoyed civic amenities and\n            services, and standing crops and trees will be offset by the\n            following options offered: equivalent land or cash\n            compensation at replacement or market value; reasonable\n            transition allowance; employment in reconstructed enterprise\n            or package for re-employment or starting a business; and\n            restoration or replacement of amenities. Major environmental\n            impacts are anticipated with water treatment plant projects\n            and river intake works, and regarding sewerage collection\n            and treatment to maintain water quality. Laws have been\n            enacted to control water pollution, such as the requirement\n            to obtain consent to discharge effluent and to pay consent\n            fees to the state pollution control board for projects\n            causing water pollution.
