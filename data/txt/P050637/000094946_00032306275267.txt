EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BACKGROUND
1.   The Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL) has been set
up to manage a Trust fund -Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF). The trust
has been established to manage urban infrastructure projects in Tamil Nadu. The
deployment of funds will be on the basis of a management contract and will be
managed by TNUIFSL.  Eligible borrowers include Urban Local Bodies (ULBs),
Statutory Boards, Public Undertakings and potential Private Investors.
2.   The fund has a corporate Trustee Company (TC) with shareholdings from Govemment
of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) and three leading Financial Institutions - ICICI (Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation of India), HDFC (Housing Development and Financial
Corporation) and IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited). To
continue with the emphasis on poverty alleviation, a new Grant Fund (GF) has been
established.
3.   TNUDF will channel increased financial resources, including private financing, into high
priority infrastructure investments. Specifically the fund would:
a  fund viable urban infrastructure projects;
O   mobilise resources from capital markets;
O   facilitate participation of private sector in infrastructure development through direct
investment and joint delivery mechanism of infrastructure services;
O  would eam retums for contributors and ensure sustainability of the fund;
O   improve financial management of ULBs, enabling them to access debt finance
from markets
4.   The projects financed would:
0   ensure that investments are commensurate with service demands;
O   eam stipulated economic and financial retums;
O   be institutionally viable so that the borrowers are capable of implementing the
management arrangements to do so;
O   ensure that no adverse environmental and social impacts are generated or that the
borrower will be taking corrective measures to minimise such impacts in
consonance with the Environment and Social Report (ESR).
5.   Typical urban infrastructure projects eligible for funding would include water supply,
sanitation, solid waste management, roads, transportation, sites and services, area
development and other remunerative/non-remunerative urban infrastructure projects.
Power and telecommunication projects are excluded because of the magnitude of such
projects in relation to the size of the fund as well as the regulatory issues involved.



txecuDve summary
6.   Recognising the environmental and social issues that can arise in urban infrastructure
projects. TNUIFSL has evolved an ESR. The ESR provides TNUIFSL an overall
framework to guide it in identification. assessment and management of environmental
and social concerns at the project level. The ESR outlines the policies, assessments
and procedures that will enable TNUIFSL to ensure that a project that it funds is
developed in consonance with ESR and is adequately protected from attendant risks.
The ESR also aims to sensitise borrowers to assessment and management of
environmental and social issues arising in urban infrastructure projects.
7.   The ESR has been prepared by TNUIFSL with the assistance of Consultants -
Development Altematives - specialised in the field of environment and social issues.
The process of preparing this report has included desk research on the legal and
institutional framework, analysis of priority issues in the infrastructure sector,
consistency checks with operational directives of the World Bank and other multilateral
agencies. There have also been a series of discussions within and outside TNUIFSL
for the preparation of the Report.  The project team acknowledges the Project
Management Group (PMG) of the Govemment of Tamil Nadu, the Directorate of
Municipal Administration, the World Bank Task Force and several other institutions and
individuals for their contribution in evolving this ESR.
8.   The Environmental and Social Report (ESR) for TNUIFSL is in two volumes:
Volume 1:  consists of an Executive Summary; and, a Social and Environmental
Assessment Framework
Volume II:  consists of the Environmental and Social Information package for
borrowers of TNUIFSLL loans
While the ESR includes both volumes, appropriate parts of Volume 11 will form part of
the Information Package to be given to the borrower along with the Loan Application
Form.
9.   The ESR has been formally approved by the Board of Directors, TNUIFSL.
TNUIFSL POLICY STATEMENT
TNUIFSL has adopted the Environmental and Social Policy of the TC to promote
environmentally sound, socially acceptable and commercially viable urban
infrastructure projects. TNUIFSL, like the TC of TNUDF, believes that each of its
projects will improve the standard of living of populations in and around project
locations.
TNUIFSL -ESRI Final Draft! January'97  i                   Development Alternatives



txecurve .Summary
10.  The Policy statement of the TC and TNUIFSL commits all projects to
-   Environmental soundness by conserving natural resources, preserving bio-
diversity and ecological equilibrium; minimising release of polluting wastes and
integrating waste management mechanisms within projects.
O   Social relevance and acceptability by avoiding or minimising resettlement,
ensuring responsible reseHtlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons;
and addressing legitimate concerns of relevant stakeholders.
11.  TNUIFSL expects that most of the projects that it funds will be small and medium
urban infrastructure projects. It is possible that limited resources available for
mitigating environmental and social issues arising within projects could affect their
economic viability. Therefore mitigatory measures to deal with environmental and
social issues such as best practices available would be encouraged.
12.  While adopting the environmental and social policy of the TNUDF TC, TNUIFSL has
reflected its own commitments through detailed operational procedures illustrated in its
Environmental and Social Report (ESR).
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
13.  To evolve its environmental and social management procedures for mitigating these
issues, TNUIFSL has carefully examined the portfolio of possibie urban infrastructure
projects.
14.  Based on the magnitude and implications of environmental issues that can arise in
them, TNUIFSL has categorised urban infrastructure projects into three categories viz.
E-1, E-2 and E-3.
15.  E-1 projects are those wherein TNUIFSL foresees major environmental impacts thus
necessitating Environmental Assessment Reports (EAR).
16.  E-2 projects are expected to have moderate environmental issues. Borrowers will
submit a simple Environmental Management Plan for E-2 projects based on a
catalogue of environmental management measures made available by TUNIFS.
17.  No environmental issues are expected in E-3 projects and hence can be termed
Ienvironmentally benign'.
18.  Based on the number of households# that may be affected by the project and
magnitude of social impacts, TNUIFSL has categorised projects as either S-1, S-2 or
S-3 projects.
TNUIFSL -ESRI Final Draft/January97                      *  DevelopmentAlternatives



ixecuDve Summary
19.  S-1 projects are those that will affect more than 40 households# and will require a
detailed Social Assessment Report (SAR).
20.  S-2 projects are those which will affect between one to forty households. In this case
the borrower can submit a simple Social Management Plan (SMP) for which formats
are provided by TN U IFSL.
21.  S-3 projects, on the other hand will not have any housholds affectedat all i.e. they can
be classified as 'socially benign'.
NATIONAL AND STATE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
Regulatory Framework - Urban Infrastructure Projects
22.  ULBs, are distinct from other undertakings due to their 'body politic' character. The
74th Constitutional Amendment, 1992 empowers municipal bodies to take necessary
steps for management of areas under them, including protection of environment.
ULBs are considered 'state" as per Article 12 of the Constitution. This implies that
municipal bodies can be proceeded against under a writ, for violations to Fundamental
Rights or Directive Principles, as their actions are state actions.
23.  The Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 appoints local planning
authorities and empowers them to plan for an urban area and/or designated areas.
This law empowers local planning authorities to assess, levy and recover development
charges. The Act envisages three classes of authorities: regional planning authorities;
local planning authorities; and new town development authorities and the constitution
of a Town and Country Planning Board.
24.  The Tamil Nadu Municipalities Law and Building Bye Laws derived from the Madras
District Municipalities Act, 1920 extends to the whole of the Presidency of Madras
except the City of Madras. The law essentially deals with establishment, constitution
and govemment of District Municipalities and authorities; taxation and finance; public
health, safety and convenience.
Regulatory Framework- Environment
25.  Mandatory environmental laws applicable to TNUIFSL financed projects are both
pollution and natural resource related. Key Mandatory environmental laws are;
O   Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Tamil Nadu Water
(Prevention And Control of Pollution) Rules, 1974
O   The Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977
O   Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
O   Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980

txecuuve ssummary
1  Wiidlife Protection Act. 1972
13  Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification. 1990
26.  World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01outlines Bank policy and procedures for
environmental assessment (EA) of bank investment lending operations and related
types of environmental analysis. Small scale municipal infrastructure and services
projects envisaged to be financed by TNUIFSL are not clearly categorised in OD 4.01.
They may be considered the lowest level of Category B i.e. projects with comparatively
less significant impact; not as sensitive, numerous or diverse impacts.
27.  Key prescriptive environmental laws and policies are:
Legislations
O   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 and Tamil Nadu Air (Prevention
of Control of Pollution) Rules 1983
O   Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989
Policies
O   National Conservation Strategy and Policy Statement on environment and
Development, 1992
n   Policy Statement for Abatement of Pollution 1992
Compliance with environmental requirements laid down by the policy, legal and regulatory
framework will not pose a problem in a majority of projects that are envisaged to be
financed by TNUIFSL. However, in most cases the regulatory agency is the municipal
authority. Hence it will be essential for the municipal body requesting the finances to
clearly separate the project execution function and regulatory function. It will be the
responsibility of the Municipal Commissioner to fumish the necessary undertaking of
compliance along with the project proposal. Categorisation of projects will be done so
that assessments can be done speedily and remedial measures can be adopted.
Regulatory Framework - Social
28.  Mandatory Social Laws are:
O   Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended in 1984
O   Govemment Order dated 21.09.95 from the Commissioner of Land Administration
describing procedures for acquisition through negotiation
O   Board Standing Orders (Standino Orders of the Commission for Revenue Board)
based on the Revenue Act 1884 of the Madras Presidency (for Rayatwari states),
regarding assignment of land, lease and cancellation and encroachments.
0   Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905
0   The Tamil Nadu Slum Areas (Improvement and Clearance) Act, 1971

txecuDve summary
29.  This World Bank OD 4.30 describes Bank policy and procedures on involuntary
resettlement as well as conditions that borrowers are expected to meet in operations
involving resettlement. The objective of the Bank's policy is to ensure that populations
displaced by a project also benefit from the project and that standards of living are
improved, or at a minimum, restored. TNUIFSL as a borrower of credit would ensure
that Bank policies are followed.
TNUIFSL's SOCIAL ENTITLEMENT FRAMEWORK
30. TNUIFSL will ensure that the Policies and procedures described in the ESR will be
applicable to all World Bank supported projects. An entitlement framework has been
evolved along guidelines provided by the World Bank Operational Directives. The
social entitlement framework is shown in Table 1.
31.  In contrast to the environmental legislation which exists in India and provides a
reference for the environment part of the ESR, no similar framework or legislation
exists for general social impacts of urban infrastructure projects - resettlement and
rehabilitation (R&R) in particular. In order to provide a framework for the R&R process
in projects where World Bank financing is involved, this ESR provides a list of
entitlements for project affected individuals, families and establishments. Detailed
exposition of the social entitlement framework for World Bank financed projects is
provided in Appendix 5. Seven basic categories of issues/impact are foreseen under
this entitlement framework:
(a)    Loss of land
(b)    Loss of structure
(c)    Loss of source of livelihood
(d)    Loss of access to common resources and facilities
(e)    Loss of standing crops and trees
(f)    Losses during transition of displaced persons/establishments
(g)    Losses to host communities

TNUIFSL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
35.  TNUIFSL, as a financial intermediary, will ensure the financial viability of each project
that it funds. TNUIFSL will catalyse municipalities into attracting private investments on
their own.  The project cycle for appraising and monitoring projects forms the
background for assessment and management of environmental and social issues that
could arise within projects financed by TNUIFSL.
TNAIUFSL Project Cycle
36.  During screening and scoping of projects, levels of detail to which each aspect of a
project needs to be assessed, will be determined. After a project has gone through
successful appraisal and approval, TNUIFSL will closely monitor construction,
operation and maintenance phases.
37.  During project screening, TNUIFSL will assess the eligibility of a project based on
TNUIFSL's lending policies. The assessment will form a part of the Initial Screening
Report (ISR) and will decide whether or not the project should be taken up for detailed
appraisal. The borrower will prepare and submit a Detailed Project Report (DPR) as
per guidelines provided to him in the Information Package.
38.  During Project Appraisal, TNUIFSL along with the borrower will vet the DPR.
Environmental and social aspects will be cross-checked against standards set in the
ESR. The loan officer will submit the appraisal report for approval with a
recommendation to accept the project as submitted; accept with modifications; or
reject it.
39.  After requisite approvals and concurrence are obtained, the loan officer will discuss
basic terms of agreement such as rate of interest; repayment schedule;
security/guarantee; and environmental and social commitments with the borrower.
TNUIFSL then prepares and signs the loan agreement with the borrower. The first
loan installment is then disbursed.
40.  TNUIFSL will monitor all projects they finance to ensure conformity to agreed
standards during construction, operation and maintenance.  Quarterly Progress
Reports will be submitted ty Borrowers. All projects above Rs.15 crores and
approximately 25% of the other projects will be audited annually through interaction
with borrowers, local user groups, govemment, etc.  The Audit Report will be
submitted to the TC Board through the CEO.

TNUIFSL's POLICY STATEMENT
Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure and Financial Services (TNUIFSL), set up to manage the Tamil
Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF), aims to promote environmentally sound, socially
acceptable and economically viable urban infrastructure projects. TNUIFSL, like the Trustee
Company (TC) of the TNUDF, believes that each of its projects will improve the living standards
and the environment of populations in and around project locations.
TNUIFSL commits each project to:
ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDNESS BY
-  Conserving natural resources
-  Preserving bio-diversity and ecological equilibrium by reducing pressure on natural resources
-  Minimising release of polluting wastes to amounts that do not harm the environment
-  Integrating waste management mechanisms within projects and maintaining environmental
quality of project locations
SOCIAL RELEVANCE AND ACCEPTABILITY BY
-  Addressing legitimate concems of relevant stakeholders, especially project affected persons
-  Avoiding or minimising resettlement due to land acquisition through appropriate technical
and management measures
- Ensuring responsible resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons through
sustainable livelihood options that at least restore, if not improve, their standard of living
-  Protecting marginalised and vulnerable groups, including the economically and socially
disadvantaged
-  Minimising health and safety hazards
TNUIFSL expects that most of the projects that it funds will be small and medium urban
infrastructure projects. It is possible that limited resources available for mitigating environmental
and social issues arising within projects could affect their economic viability.  Therefore
mitigatory measures to deal with environmental and social issues such as best practices
available would be encouraged. Further, TNUIFSL will use the Grant Fund and other funding
mechanisms to operationalise the environmental and social policy.
While adopting the environmental and social policy of the TNUDF Trustee Company, TNUIFSL
has reflected its own commitments through detailed operational procedures illustrated in its
Environmental and Social Report (ESR).

SECTION 1
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
1.1   TNUIFSL manages funds for the TNUDF, one of India's largest urban development
projects with a multi-city, multi-sectoral focus. TNUIFSL will extend term-loans to
Urban Local Bodies(ULBs), Statutory Bodies, Public Undertakings, and Private
Investors for urban infrastructure projects in the stae of.Tamil Nadu.
1.2   From the experience of TNUDP projects, TNUIFSL recognises environmental and
social issues related to urban infrastructure projects. TNUIFSL will address their
mitigation through a set of management procedures elaborated in its ESR.
1.3   To evolve its environmental and social management procedures, TNUIFSL has
carefully examined the portfolio of urban infrastructure projects previously executed
by TNUDP and environmental and social issues arising in each of the projects.
Projects were then categorised on the basis of environmental and social impacts.
TNUDP projects in the past have encompassed over 500 sub-projects including
roads, bridges, street lights, solid waste plants, storm water drains, bus stations, and
markets in 90 out of 110 municipalities in Tamil Nadu (refer Appendix I and 2 for list
and location of municipalities)

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
1.6    While TNUIFSL financed projects improve general living standards within urban
localities, they can also have associated impacts on the local environment and
people. Based on the experience of past projects carried out by urban local bodies in
Tamil Nadu, this document identifies environmental and social issues that can arise in
urban infrastructure projects. Issues that could arise in various urban infrastructure
projects are listed below.
I. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE PROJECTS:
(a) Water Supply:
1.7    Water supply projects include augmentation of water lines (about one to ten km in
length), purchase of water tankers (capacity of ten thousand litres) and construction
of overhead tanks (capacity of ten lakh litres). Typical environmental issues that may
arise are:
- safe drinking water
-  change in hydrology and drainage pattems due to the construction
- waterlogging due to leakage during operation and maintenance
- disturbance to other service lines due to construction activity.
(b) Storrnwater Drainage:
1.8   Stormwater projects will include construction of open/closed drains (about half a km
to seven km) which may cause:
-  changes in landuse, hydrology and drainage pattems due to the construction
- waterlogging, change in surface and groundwater quality due to leakages
- disturbance to other service lines due to digging and construction activity
1.9   Social issues may arise due to stormwater drainage projects if there is land acquisition or
displacement of people, especially squatters.
(c) Sewerage/Sanitation:
1.10   Sewerage projects will include construction of public conveniences (one to five units
consisting of eight seaters); pay and use latrines (ten to twelve units of one seaters);
sewage treatment plants (with a capacity of ten thousand litres); and septic tanks.
Environmental issues that can arise in these projects are:
-  changes in hydrology and drainage pattems due to the construction
- surface and groundwater contamination due to leakages



- wateriogging dunng operation and maintenance
I. SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT:
1.11   Solid Waste Management projects include development of compost yards (with an
area of four to five acres) and purchase of vehicles (capacity of ten tonnes) for
transport of garbage. These projects may cause
-  change in hydrology and drainage due to garbage dumping,and composting
- change in surface and ground water quality due to leaching
- smell of decomposing garbage
- public health nuisance during maintenance due to decomposing garbage
- change in urban aesthetics
Ill. TRANSPORTATION:
1.12   Transportation projects will include roads, street fumiture, road structures and
terminals.
a) Roads:
1.13   Road projects include widening of roads (width of one meter to a length of four to
twenty kms), improvement of road surfaces (for a length of five to thirty km), laying of
intemal roads (for a length of two to five kms), construction of traffic islands (one to
five units ) and road dividers (for a length of one to two kms). These projects will be
at a very small scale and may cause only minor environmental issues such as:
- change in hydrology and drainage patterns due to construction
- increase in air pollution and noise levels due to traffic congestion
- disturbance to other services during construction
- destruction of roadside microhabitat/vegetation due to widening and construction
1.14   Social issues may arise in these projects if there is land acquisition or displace
squatters or petty roadside shops or the loss of private structures (such as compound
walls, etc.)
b) Street fumiture:
1.15   Street fumiture projects will include traffic signals (one to five junctions), streetlights
(sixty to six hundred poles) and signboards (hundred to five hundred units) which may
cause minor environmental issues such as:
- disturbance to other services/lines



-  increase in urban congestion
-  increase in air pollution and noise levels due to congestion
-  effect on urban aesthetics
c) Road Structures:
1.16   Road structure projects to be funded by TNUIFSL will include construction of
subways (for pedestrians, cycles and fast moving vehicles of one unit of two lanes of
30 to 40 meters width), road overbridges (two lanes of four hundred meters width),
culverts (one to five units) and small bridges (one unit with a width of six to ten
meters). Environmental impacts that may arise are:
- change in landuse, hydrology and drainage patterns due to construction
-  water logging due to poor drainage facilities
-  disturbance to other services/lines
-  urban congestion
1.17   Social issues may arise if these projects involve any land acquisition or displacement
of people
d) Bus ShelterslTerminals:
1.18   TNUIFSL will fund construction of bus terminals (one to five units), bus shelters
(about thirteen busways), workshops and truck terminals (one unit for thirty lorries)
which may cause minor environmental issues such as:
-  increase in air pollution and noise levels
-  land contamination due to oil and grease
-  destruction of vegetation due to construction
-  sewage due to bus cleaning
1.19   Social issues may arise in these projects if they involve any land acquisition or
displacement of people
e) Inland Waterways
1.20   TNUIFSL will fund construction of Inland waterways
IV.COMMERCIAL COMPLEXES:
1.21   Commercial complexes will include shopping complexes (of thirty to fifty shops),
vegetable/fish markets (fifty to seventy five shops) and slaughter houses (six to ten
bays), marriage halls (each unit about five hundred seats)/townhalls, lodges (thirty



rooms) and dormitories (for tnirty people) and tourist complexes (fifteen fo twenty
rooms). Environmental impacts which may arise are:
- disturbance to other services/lines due to construction
- disposal of solid waste generated from these complexes
- air, water and health problems due to slaughter houses
- increase in urban congestion
1.22   Social impacts that may arise if the project involves any land acquisition or
displacement of people.
V. NON COMMERCIAUCOMMUNITY AMENITIES:
1.23   Construction of parks and playgrounds (one acre units), institutions (two classrooms)
and hospitals (fifteen beds) and the development of burial grounds (one acre units).
Environmental impacts will be negligible and those that may occur are:
- change in landuse
- solid and hazardous waste disposal
- public health and safety
1.24   Social issues may arise if the projects involve any land acquisition or displacement of
people.
VI. INTEGRATED AREA DEVELOPMENT:
1.25   Under integrated area development will include housing (sites and services), guided
urban development and traffic and transport programmes (TRAMPS) whose
subcomponents will include combinations of the above projects at various scales.
Environmental issues that may be expected are:
- change in landuse, hydrology and drainage patterns due to construction
- waterlogging
- solid waste
- destruction of vegetation
- disturbance to other services/lines
1.26   Social issues may arise if the project involves any land acquisition or displacement
of people.



CATEGORISATION OF URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
The urban infrastructure projects in Table 1. 1 have been categorised based on the magnitude
of environmental and social issues.
I. ENVIRONMENTAL CATEGORIES OF PROJECTS
1.27   Based on the effects, TNUIFSL has categorised urban infrastructure projects into
three categories viz. E-1, E-2 and E-3.
a.    E-1 projects are those wherein TNUIFSL forsees major environmental
impacts thus necessitating Environmental Assessment Reports (EAR).
b.    E-2 projects are expected to have only moderate environmental issues.
TNUIFSL has laid down generic design guidelines to mitigate these issues.
c.    No environmental issues are expected in E-3 projects and hence can be
termed 'environmentally benign'.
1.28   Tablell.2 illustrates categorisation of urban infrastructure projects based on their
environmental sensitivity.   TNUIFSL will review  this categorisation  annually
depending on experience gained from projects funded.

II. SOCIAL CATEGORISATION OF PROJECTS
1.29   Based on the number of households# that may be affected by the project, i.e. PAPs
(refer paragraph 2.39 for definition) and magnitude of impacts, projects have been
categorised as either S-1, S-2 or S-3 projects.
a.     S-1 projects are those that will affect more than 40 households.#
b.     S-2 projects are those which will affect between one to forty households. #
C.     S-3 projects, on the other hand will not have any households affected at all
i.e. they can be classified as socially benign.
1.30   Table 1.3 provides TNUIFSL's categorisation of urban infrastructure projects based
on their social sensitivity.
Table 1.3: CATEGORISATION OF PROJECTS BASED ON SOCIAL SENSITIVITY

integrate readily available solutions into the project design.



SECTION 2
NATIONAL AND STATE POLICY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
2.1    While extending extend term loans to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), statutory boards,
public undertakings and private investors for urban infrastructure projects, the
TNUIFSL will ensure compliance to mandatory environmental and social laws and
regulations that apply to specific projects. Besides mandatory laws, regulations and
policies which are prescriptive will influence management procedures for
environmental and social issues in TNUIFSL financed projects.
JREGULATORY FRAMEWORK - URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
I. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
2.2    ULBs, are distinct from other undertakings due to their 'body politic" character. It
constitutes the urban democratic grassroots in India. Apart from their statutory
status, and mention in Entry 5 of List II of the 71h schedule of the Constitution, they
have now been given due constitutional recognition. This is in the form of the 74th
Constitutional Amendment, 1992 which has inserted provisions in an attempt to
decentralise administration and decisionmaking. The 74th amendment empowers
municipal bodies to take necessary steps for management of areas under them,
including protection of environment (see Appendix 3 for Articles inserted in
Constitution). ULBs are considered 'state' as per Article 12 of the Constitution. This
implies that municipal bodies can be proceeded against under a writ, for violations to
Fundamental Rights or Directive Principles, as their actions are state actions.
2.3    ULBs, in specific projects will act in dual strains, i.e. both project sponsorship
/execution and project approvals/ permissions/ monitoring. As a regulatory body,
ULBs will also be responsible for ensuring environmental and social compliance.
Their local govemment status can expose them to distinct legal recourse, action and
claiming of reliefs.
2.4    When acting as regulatory authorities, there is an in-built duty to provide quality
amenities and urban facilities and to ensure that these systems function on a sound
environmental and social base. A framework enabling the setting up of infrastructure
amenities and delineating powers and responsibilities is found in various State laws.



11. TAMIL NADU TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT 1971
2.5   This Act appoints local planning authorities and empowers them to plan for an urban
area and/or designated areas. Typically this involves preparation/implementation of
Master Plans specifying uses to which land can be put to. Such zoning ensures
functional and ordered development. The plan delineates land for residential,
industrial, commercial, agricultural and recreational purposes or forests and mineral
exploitation; demarcates objects and boundaries of archaeological/historical interest;
and identifies new towns/cities, transportation and communication facilities, water
supply, drainage, sewerage, sewage disposal and other public utilities and amenities.
This law empowers local planning authorities to assess, levy and recover
development charges.
2.6   The Act envisages three classes of authorities: regional planning authorities; local
planning authorities; and new town development authorities and the constitution of a
Town and Country Planning Board.
111. TAMIL NADU MUNICIPALITIES LAW AND BUILDING BYE LAWS
2.7   The relevant legislation is the Madras District Municipalities Act, 1920. This law
extends to the whole of the Presidency of Madras except the City of Madras. It is
under this law that local bodies are empowered to provide and maintain public
amenities and facilities.
2.8   The law essentially deals with:
- Establishment, constitution and government of District Municipalities and authorities
- Taxation and Finance
- Public Health, Safety and Convenience
2.9   The law delineates constitution/election of urban local bodies and demarcates powers
and responsibilities of these authorities. This law vests properties to be administered
in local bodies. The law also vests "works" such as waterworks, lighting, public
drainage and garbage disposal. Other activities include maintenance and repair of
streets, regulating construction through building regulations and providing other
amenities. With zonation as laid down in the Master Plan, building regulations
provide for development in consonance with floor space indexes and other rules.
ULBs also have powers of inspection and monitoring (See Appendix 4 for main
features of this legislation).



IV. DEVELOPMENT CONTROL RULES FOR MADRAS METROPOLITAN AREA
ILLUSTRATION UNDER THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1971
2.10   Madras, apart from being a major Metropolitan city, is the only town that has
prepared Control Rules under the Town and Country Planning Act. 1971. With its
status as an important borrower, it is essential to understand these control rules.
Other major cities such as Madurai and Coimbatore are also in the process of
developing Master Plans.
2.11   The rules have been developed under Section 9-C, Chapter lI-A of the above Act
which prescribes that the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority shall carry out
a survey of Madras Metropolitan Area and prepare a Master Plan. The contents of
the Master Plan are found in these rules detailing policies and programmes for the
overall development of Madras. The plan emphasises regulation of land and building
use.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK - ENVIRONMENT
I. MANDATORY
2.12   Mandatory environmental laws applicable to TNUIFSL financed projects are both
pollution and natural resource related. Pollution laws in the last decade impose strict
controls over industrial and municipal operations. Despite participation by States and
other bodies, GOI continues to have the final say on all matters concerning natural
resources, even with policies such as the National Forest Policy, 1988 which invites
local participation.
a) Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Tamil Nadu Water
(Prevention And Control of Pollution) Rules, 1974
2.13   These laws seek to control pollution of water and enhance the quality of water. Under
this law, it is mandatory to obtain consent for discharge of effluents and pay consent
fees to Tamil Nadu State Pollution Control Board (TNSPCB) for any municipal
projects causing water pollution.
b) The Water (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977:
2.14   This Act provides for levy and collection of a cess by local authorities on water
consumed by persons or industries to augment resources for Pollution Control
Boards.



c) Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
2.15   This law essentially links pollution ana naturai resource issues.  It seeks to
supplement existing laws on pollution control and also lays down standards for air
quality and noise. The Central Government in pursuance of its rule-making powers
under the Act, has passed notifications regulating siting of industry and operations.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required for TNUIFSL projects as
they do not fall in the categories listed in Schedule I of the Environment Impact
Assessment notification, 1994. However the law includes a provision for projects that
are costed above Rs. 60 crores which have to undergo an EIA.
d) Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
2.16   Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to halt rapid deforestation and
environmental degradation. Without approval from the Central govemment, State
govemments cannot de-reserve forest land or direct that it be used for non-forest
purposes. Municipal projects with activities falling in reserved forest areas need a
clearance from MoEF.
e) Wildlife Protection Act, 1972
2.17   This Act seeks to protect wildlife, by creating protected areas and controlling trade in
wildlife products. If TNUIFSL activities cross over into protected area regimes then
requisite permission must be obtained.
f) Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 1990
2.18   This notification under Environment ( Protection ) Act, 1986 supplements the law on
site clearance by declaring certain zones as CRZ and regulates activities in these
zones. Further GoTN has also issued orders regulating development within 500 m
from the high water mark.
II. PRESCRIPTIVE
Constitutional Guarantees
a) Article 48-A of the Constitution
2.19   This directive principle states that the State shall endeavor to protect and improve the
natural environment



b) Article 51-A of the Constitution
2.20   This fundamental duty states that it is the duty of every citizen to protect and improve
the natural environment.
2.21   Courts have tended to enlarge the scope of fundamental rights so that environment
dimensions are recognised. When municipal bodies act as borrowers, TNUIFSL will
see to it that checks and balances are properly instituted as these local bodies are
subject to constitutional challenge.
Legislations
c) Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 and Tamil Nadu Air (Prevention
of Control of Pollution) Rules 1983
2.22   These laws address the prevention and control of air pollution. TNUIFSL projects will
not cause any air pollution hence these laws will not be directly applicable. If air
pollution is caused, immediate remedial action will be taken.
d) Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989
2.23   This law addresses handling of hazardous substances that fall under specified
schedules. Projects envisaged by TNUIFSL will not require handling of specified
substances.
Policies
e) National Conservation Strategy and Policy Statement on environment and
Development, 1992
*f) Policy Statement for Abatement of Pollution 1992
C. WORLD BANK OD 4.01 REQUIREMENTS
2.24   World Bank's Operational Directive 4.01 outlines Bank policy and procedures for
environmental assessment (EA) of bank investment lending operations and related
types of environmental analysis. Small scale urban infrastructure and services
projects envisaged to be financed by TNUIFSL are not clearly categorsed in OD
4.01. They may be considered the lowest level of Category B i.e. projects with
comparatively less significant impact; not as sensitive, numerous or diverse impacts.
Also considering the scale, remedial measures can be easily designed. Screening of
the project at the outset will identify environment issues if any, suggest appropriate



mitigation measures required. and also decide whether any detailed environment
studies resulting in an environmental assessment repor. are required at all.
IV. COMPETENT REGULATORY AGENCIES
a) Municipal Bodies
2.25   For most laws applicable to TNUIFSL projects, municipal authorities (who will be
recipients of finances) will have to certify that they are abiding by the law they are
entrusted to protect and administer. In case of other borrowers, clearances specified
in the Acts would have to be obtained before sanctions.
b) Pollution Control Boards
2.26  In certain cases like 'consent to discharge' under pollution laws, the TNSPCB and
Department of Environment and Department of Forests.
c) StatelCentral Ministry Of Environment and Forests
2.27   Only in a few cases such as projects in reserved forests or protected areas will the
MoEF of the Central Govemment be involved.
d) World Banklother Multilateral Agencies
2.28   The World Bank and other Multilateral Agencies will ensure compliance with their
Operational Directives.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK - SOCIAL
I. MANDATORY
a) Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended in 1984
2.29   This Act enables the State to acquire private land for public purpose and has
provisions for acquisition for industrial purposes. The Act ensures that no person is
deprived of land except under law and entitles affected persons (landowner, tenant or
licensee) to a hearing before acquisition, with due and adequate compensation made
thereafter.
2.30   Only land owners, tenants and licensees are possible compensation recipients. The
landless, agricultural and non-agricultural labourers, artisans, forest produce
collectors are excluded. The Act deals with cash compensation and provides several



methods of valuing compensation. Several States are using negotiations as a means
to fix compensation and acquire land. Grevance/Redressal mechanisms are also in
place and affected persons may seek the intervention of the High Court and Supreme
Court.
b) Government Order dated 21.09.95 from the Commissioner of Land Administration
regarding acquisition through negotiation
2.31   The Tamil Nadu Government Order provides for acquisition of land through
negotiation and assessment of land value by a committee. The District Collector has
powers to approve amounts less than Rs. 15 lakhs. Approval for amounts above this
has to be sought from the Government of Tamil Nadu. The reason for resorting to
private negotiation is to implement schemes within a time bound schedule, arrive at
an acceptable value, preempt protracted court cases which only delay all processes.
Guidelines have been framed for purchase of lands under private negotiation.
Implementing and operating agencies for such a scheme are a District level and a
State level negotiating committee with ancillary monitoring powers.
c) Board Standing Orders (Standing Orders of the Commission for Revenue Board)
based on the Revenue Act 1884 of the Madras Presidency (for Rayatwari states).
2.32   The Board Standing Orders based on the Revenue Act, 1884 of the Madras
Presidency broadly states policy on Government owned lands. This policy covers
assignment of land, lease and cancellations and encroachments.
d) Government of Tamil Nadu (Resettlement and Rehabilitation) Policy applicable to
Involuntary Resettlement under the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project
2.33   GoTN has been implementing the TNUDP project since 1988. With a view to provide
R&R compensation and assistance to PAPs, GoTN has laid down these policy
guidelines considering relevant legislation and the World Bank guidelines. This is
provided as annex 1.
2.34   Key points in the policy:
-    Ensures that all PAPs will be compensated and rehabilitated to improve or at
least restore their living conditions and income eaming capacity at the pre-
project level and will share in project benefits
-    When PAPs lose land/structures and will be displaced and/or economically
affected adversely, detailed planning will be made along with implementation
arrangements in an operational R&R Action Plan



Defines PAPs, lists entitlements. details peoples participation, supervision
by NGOs and supervision and monitoring
Mentions an implementation schedule that would be broken up into specific
activities and coordinated with the chronogram of construction
The cost would be part of the overall project budget and adequate provision
would be made for contingencies and inflation
2.35   Relevant provisions in this policy prepared by GoTN have been incorporated into
TNUIFSL's management procedures keeping in view the practical issues related to
urban infrastructure projects.
11. WORLD BANK OD 4.30 ON INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT
2.36   This directive describes Bank policy and procedures on involuntary resettlement as
well as the conditions that borrowers are expected to meet in operations involving
resettlement. The objective of the Bank's policy is to ensure that populations
displaced by a project also benefit from the project and that standards of living are
improved, or at a minimum, restored. TNUIFSL as a borrower of credit would ensure
that Bank policies are followed.
11l. TNUIFSL's SOCIAL ENTITLEMENT FRAMEWORK
2.37  In contrast to the environmental legislation which exists in India and provides a
reference for the environment part of the ESR, no similar framework or legislation
exists for general social impacts of urban infrastructure projects - resettlement and
rehabilitation (R&R) in particular. In order to provide a framework for the R&R
process in projects where World Bank financing is involved, this ESR provides a list
of entitlements for project affected individuals, families and establishments. Detailed
exposition of the social entitlement framework for World Bank financed projects is
provided in Appendix 5. Seven basic categories of issues/impact are foreseen under
this entitlement framework:
(a)    Loss of land
(b)    Loss of structure
(c)    Loss of source of livelihood
(d)    Loss of access to common resources and facilities
(e)    Loss of standing crops and trees
(f)    Losses during transition of displaced persons/establishments
(g)    Losses to host communities



2.38   For purposes of this framework. the following aefinitions will be applicable
2.39   Projected Affected Persons (PAP): PAP means those who are:
- physically displaced/economically adverseiy affected as a result of physical re-
location;
- economically affected but not physically re-located;
- losing access to community amenities and resources.
2.40   Household (HH): A household is a group of persons who commonly live together
and would take their meals from a common kitchen.
2.41   Replacement Value: Replacement Value means market value excluding
depreciation. In cases where buildings are involved, depreciation will not be taken
into account. Replacement value of land should be determined through a land
market survey.
2.42   Cut-off date: Cut-off date is used to determine the eligibility of PAPs. The cut-off
date will be the date of the baseline survey. The survey will identify the residents or
users of the land being acquired.
2.43   Land: The term land refers to land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act or
through private transactions. All land provided under the entitlement framework
should be provided with secure tenure.
2.44   PAPs will be given choices regarding the entitlements provided. If land-for-land is
chosen by the PAP, the land should be of equivalent value and/or productivity. Basic
units or minimum economic holding will follow the norms of the national, state or local
Govemments sufficient to restore or improve the standard of living.

IMPLICATIONS TO TNUIFSL
1. MUNICIPAL BODIES AS BORROWERS AND REGULATORS
2.45   The dual nature of municipal bodies brings with it distinct implications.  As a
govemment agency, its duty is to set up amenities and facilities, to monitor
operations and be in charge of approvals. In a project sponsor mode, those same
regulations will apply to its operations but in case of violation the repercussions are
far greater. TNUIFSL's lending operations are presently focussed on these agencies.
11. CONSUMER PROTECTION
2.46   While the legal framework did not deal with the issue of consumer protection, this
area of law has developed rapidly. If municipalities provide sub standard
infrastructure or there are deficiencies in service, an affected consumer can take
legal action. This will be kept in mind in TNUIFSL financed projects and it will be
ensured that the services provided will subscribe to high standards of quality
Ill. ENVIRONMENT
2.47   Compliance with environmental requirements laid down by the policy, legal and
regulatory framework will not pose a problem in a majority of projects that are
envisaged to be financed by TNUIFSL. However, in most cases the regulatory
agency is the municipal authority. Hence it will be essential for the municipal body
requesting the finances to clearly separate the project execution function and
regulatory function. It will be the responsibility of the Municipal Commissioner to
fumish the necessary undertaking of compliance along with the project proposal.
Categorisation of projects will be done so that assessments can be done speedily
and remedial measures can be adopted.
IV. SOCIAL
2.48   Land acquisition is not expected in a majority of TNUIFSL financed projects. Some
projects like road widening may have land acquisition or relocation of squatters and
hence rehabilitation and resettlement. Provisions for negotiated derivation of
compensation rates for land, ensures that problems of acquiring land from private
individuals are minimised. However cumbersome procedures for mutation of land
from different govemment departments need to be simplified.
SECTION 3



TNUIFSL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
3.1   TNUIFSL, as a financial intermediary, will ensure the financial viability of each project
that it funds. TNUIFSL will catalyse municipalities into attracting prvate investments
on their own. The project cycle for appraising and monitoring projects forms the
background for evaluation and management of environmental and social issues that
could arise within projects that are scrutinised and funded by the TNUIFSL. This
section elaborates the project cycie of the TNUIFSL and the environmental and social
assessment and mangement process therein. A risk evaluation and management
process that is in consonance with the project cycle has also been elucidated.
TNUIFSL PROJECT APPRAISAL PROCESS|
3.2   The key task of TNUIFSL will be to appraise project proposals submitted by ULBs,
Statutory Bodies, Public Undertakings and Private Investors; to ensure compliance
with its operational procedures; consistence with risk management mechanisms;
and, enforce loan recovery mechanisms. During screening and scoping of projects,
the levels of detail to which each aspect of a project needs to be assessed will be
determined. After a project has gone through successful appraisal and approval,
TNUIFSL will closely monitor the construction, operation and maintenance phases.
1 PROJECT SCREENING
3.3   A project may be initiated through a formal lefter of intent, a telephonic or personal
discussion. TNUIFSL will assess the eligibility of a project based on TNUIFSL's
lending policies. The scale and sensitivity of associated issues in a project would
determine the categorisation of the project from an environmental and social
perspective. The scope of the project document i.e. if it should include EAR and/or
SAR, environmental management designs etc. would then be identified. A Loan
Application form and an appropriate Information Package will be issued to the
Borrower for specific project details.  The Loan Application Form will include
environmental and social screening criteria.
3.4   On receiving a completed Loan Application form from the borrower, TNUIFSL will
assess the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Be3ides this, the financial and
economic rate of retum; proportion of Loan to the Grant Fund; environmental and
social impacts; and risks will be also be assessed for the project. The assessment
will form a part of the Initial Screening Report (ISR) and will decide whether or not the
project should be taken up for detailed appraisal.



3.5   The borrower will prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) as per guidelines
provided to him in the Information Package and will submit the document to
TNUIFSL. Requisite environmental and social detaiis will also form a part of the
DPR.
3.6    On receiving the DPR. TNUIFSL will designate a loan officer who will undertake a
quick desk review to verify that all requisite information has been furnished in the
DPR. The loan officer will then clear the DPR for detailed appraisal and will inform
the Borrower about the time period required for detailed appraisal.
11. PROJECT APPRAISAL
3.7    During Project Appraisal, TNUIFSL (with the help of corporate consultants in the case
of E-l/ S-1 projects) along with the borrower will vet the DPR. Technical aspects that
will be looked into are eligibility criteria for projects and borrowers; suitability of site;
availability of inputs; appropriateness of, and proven experience with, the technology
offered; engineering designs; and construction, operation and maintenance
arrangements. Economic aspects will include cost estimates; financial operating'
plan; economic and financial viability; and adequacy of proposed financing.
Organisational aspects considered will be the institutional, legal and contractual
framework; risk analysis; necessary clearances from regulatory agencies; and
required covenants. Environmental and social aspects will be cross-checked against
standards set in the ESR. Field investigations to verify various document components
will be carried out when necessary.
3.8   The loan officer will submit the appraisal report for approval with a recommendation
to accept the project as submitted; or accept with modifications; or reject it.
Ill. LOAN SANCTIONIDISBURSEMENT
3.9    When project costs are below Rs.15 crores, the loan has to be approved by the
TNUIFSL board. Projects above Rs.15 crores will obtain approval for loans from the
Trustee Company (TC) Board. The first three loans where resettlement issues are
involved, loans over US $ 5 million and loans for which project cost exceeds US $ 20
million are subject to the approval of IDA.
3.10   After requisite approvals and concurrence are obtained, the loan officer will discuss
basic terms of agreement such as rate of interest; repayment schedule;
security/guarantee; and environmental and social commitments with the borrower.
TNUIFSL then prepares and signs the loan agreement with the borrower. The first
loan installment will be then disbursed.
*     First three El/ SI projects will be reviewed and cleared by the Bank.#



IV PROJECT MONITORING, AUDIT AND RECOVERY
3.11   TNUIFSL will monitor all projects that it finances to ensure conformity to standards
during construction, operation and maintenance. Quarterly Progress Reports will be
submitted by Borrowers. Visits to project sites will be undertaken as and when
necessary. Based on verification of progress reports, field visits and compliance to
loan disbursement conditions, subsequent installments will be disbursed.
3.12   TNUIFSL is also setting into place a system of auditing projects. All projects above
Rs.15 crores and approximately 25% of other projects will be audited annually with
the help of extemal/corporate consultants. The Audit Report will be submitted to the
TC Board through the CEO. TNUIFSL will ensure that there is no default in loan
repayments by enforcing strict loan recovery mechanisms.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT FRAME WORK
3.13   The environmental and social assessment procedures evolved by TNUIFSL are in
consonance with its project appraisal process. The various steps for environmental
and social assessment and management of TNUIFSL projects have been dovetailed
into the TNUIFSL project appraisal process. For each step the objectives, process
steps, outputs and responsibilities have been identified. Initial screening criteria have
been evolved for projects, based on magnitude and sensitivity of environmental and
social issues.
3.14   PROJECT SCREENING
Objectives
i.    Screen and Scope projects from environmental and social perspective.
ii.    Receive environmental and social components of DPR
Process
a.    TNUIFSL will discuss the project with the borrower to identify environmental
and social issues based on the checklist in Section 1. An initial screening and
categorisation of the project will be carried out depending on the types and
magnitude of environmental and social issues.
b.    After discussions on the project, an Information Package (IP) will be issued
as part of will be,issued as a part of the Loan Application Form.
C.    The IP will consist of an environmental and social screening form, information
on possible environmental and social issues in urban infrastructure projects
and EAR/SAR (which includes Rehabilitation Action Plan) for E-1 and S-1
projects, EMP format, generic environmental management measures and
catalogue of environmental management measures for E-2 projects and SMP
format for S-2 projects and the social entitlement framework for S-1 and S-2
projects.
d.    Details required in the Loan Application Form will be filled out and submitted
to TNUIFSL by the borrower in the Loan Application Form. TNUIFSL will
verify the environmental and social issues as part of the Initial Screening
Report (ISR), and finally categorise the project as E-1, E-2/ S-1, S-2.



e.    Based on guidelines issued in the Information Package, the borrower will
prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) using outlines for E-land S-1
projects andlor EMP ano SMP. The DPR will include a Rehabilitation Action
Plan (RAP) as part of the SAR for S-1 projects.
f.    On receiving the DPR from the borrower, TNUIFSL will assess whether the
environmental and social details given are adequate. If inadequate, the DPR
will be sent back to the borrower for further information. On receiving a DPR
complete in all aspects, TNUIFSL will specify a time period to the borrower
for environmental and social appraisal.

Objectives
i. Appraise environmental and social components of DPR
Process
a.    During project appraisal, TNUIFSL will appraise environmental and social
components of the DPR. While reviewing EARs and SARs with the help of
corporate consultants, TNUIFSL will look at the type of environmental and
social issues, adequacy of environmental and social management measures
provided and the cost of implementing the environmental and social
management measures. The proposed project sites will be visited if
necessary.
b.    TNUIFSL -will discuss any further changes or modifications that have to be
made to the environmental and social components of the DPR with the
borrower. TNUIFSL will finalise the environmental and social appraisal report
as part of the Project Appraisa, Report.

3.16. LOAN SANCTION AND DISBURSEMENT
Objectives
i-    Approval of environmental and social components of DPR from appropriate
authority
ii.    Concurrence from Multilateral Agencies
iii.   Issue of Sanction Letter
iv.    Finalisation of Loan Agreement
Process
a.    Prior to Loan sanction and disbursement, the environmental and social
components of the DPR have to be approved by the appropriate authority.
Projects that have costs below Rs.15 crores will have to be approved by the
AMC board and projects that cost above Rs.15 crore will be sent to the TC
board for approval. The first three loans where resettlement is involved and
loans for projects where projects costs exceeds US $ 20 million are subject to
the approval of IDA.
b.    Sanction letter for the loan will be issued. TNUIFSL  will discuss
implementation of environmental and social management measures of DPR
with the borrower. The Resettlement Plan as approved in the DPR will be
implemented by ULB, if the project is sponsored by ULB. The RAP will be
implemented by Private Borrower if the project is implemented by Private
Borrower. The funding for resettlement would be made out of Grant Fund
(GF) in case of ULB sponsored projects. The environmental and social
commitments will be then translated into covenants as part of the Loan
Agreement. Once the Loan Agreement has been finalised and signed,
TNUIFSL will disburse the first loan installment.

3.18. PROJECT MONITORING AUDIT AND RECOVERY
Objectives
a     Ensure conformity to EAR and SAR during construction, operation and
maintenance
b     Audit projects
Process
a.    During Environmental and Social Monitoring and Audit, TNUIFSL will ensure
that the Borrower conforms to the EAR and SAR during construction,
operation and maintenance.
b.    Monitoring of Environmental and Social components will be carried out
through environmental and social compliance reports that form a part of
Quarterly Progress Reports. Visits will be carried out to project sites if
necessary. The project will also be monitored through interactions with
borrowers, local user groups, govemment etc. and where implementation of
the EAR and SAR is complete, it will be certified as part of the Project
Completion Report.
c.    Annual maintenance reports will be submitted by the borrower to TNUIFSL till
completion of loan repayments.
d.    TNUIFSL  with the  help  of external consultants audit projects on
environmental and social aspects annually. While all projects of E-1 and S-
lcategory will be audited, TNUIFSL will sample 25% of the E-2 and S-2
projects. The remaining E-2 and S-2 projects and all E-3 and S-3 projects will
be audited through compliance reports.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
3.19   Environmental and Social risks could adversely affect project operations, eamings
and hence loan servicing obligations of TNUIFSL. Even though projects that will be
funded by TNUIFSL are expected to be physically and financially small (refer Table
1.1), TNUIFSL recognises the importance of managing environmental and social
risks that could arise in E-1 and S-1 projects. TNUIFSL will carry out environmental
and social risk management as a part of its project management strategy. In order to
manage environmental and social risks which can occur in projects, TNUIFSL has
dovetailed environmental and social risk management into its Environmental and
Social Management Process.
3.20   TNUIFSL's risk management process will comprise the following steps:
* Risk Management Plan
* Risk Appraisal
* Risk Allocation
* Risk Monitoring
3.21   The framework is as shown in Table 3.3
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
3.22   After receiving a completed Loan Application Form from the borrower, TNUIFSL will
identify risks from the checklist provided in Section 1 and crosscheck the same with
the Loan Application Form. TNUIFSL will carry out a preliminary environmental and
social risk assessment and risk characterisation on the basis of their approximate
financial implications. TNUIFSL will then carry out a preliminary environmental and
social risk allocation as shown in Table 3.4 and prepare an initial Risk Management
Plan as part of the ISR.
3.23   TNUIFSL will receive a detailed risk management plan from the borrower as part of
DPR. The DPR will be scrutinised for adequacy of information. If the information is
adequate, TNUIFSL will retain the report for further appraisal. If the information is not
adequate, TNUIFSL will send back the report to the borrower for further details.



11. RISK APPRAISAL
3.24   TNUIFSL will appraise the Risk Management Plan provided by the borrower in DPR.
TNUIFSL will cross-check the environmental and social risks identified in the ISR.
TNUIFSL will then appraise the type and magnitude of risk, the characterisation of
risk and risk allocation and management measures in consultation with the borrower.
Ill. RISK ALLOCATIONITRANSLATION
3.25   TNUIFSL obtains approval from the CEO for risk management measures in projects
which cost less than Rs. 5 crores. TNUIFSL will obtain approval from the AMC board
in the case of projects which costs between Rs.5 to 15 crores and from the TC board
for projects that cost above Rs.15 crores. TNUIFSL will translate risk allocation into
covenants after consulting the borrower. Finally TNUIFSL and the borrower will sign
the covenants and TNUIFSL will disburse the first installment.
IV. RISK MONITORING AND PREPAREDNESS
3.26   TNUIFSL will monitor risk through Quarterly Progress Reports and field visits
whenever necessary. TNUIFSL will conduct risk monitoring through interactions with
borrower, State Govemment and Regulatory Agencies.
3.27   The borrowers should at any point in time be prepared to encounter risk even after
the best prevention measures are set in place. TNUIFSL will ensure this through a
set of protocols that clearly define who has to execute specific tasks. The borrower
should ensure that plans are prepared and implemented.
3.28   After the appropriate risk management systems are set in place, TNUIFSL will share
and transfer the remaining risk and the associated liabilities, through insurance.
TNUIFSL will explore the opportunities whereby these risks can be insured.
Insurance Mechanims
3.29   A potential risk for TNUIFSL is the possibility of being held liable by third parties for
environmental damage. Protection against this becomes increasingly important as
the question of placing liability (fault) for such damage is now more accepted.
3.30   As far as legislation on environmental insurance is concemed, the only law on the
matter is the "Public Liability Insurance Act7, 1991. In case of an accident, payments
to victims will be made from the Grant fund and insurance cover.
3.31   TNUIFSL will consider liability limits, deductibles, and self-insurance.  The risk
analysis process will identify what level of exposure to damages arises from



operational procedures or procucts the institution is exposed to. Limits to the liability
TNUIFSL can cope with will be defined in accordance with specific findings and due
consideration would be accorded to the danger of accumulation

SECTION 4
ORGANISATIONAL SUPPORT STRUCTURE
4.1   In order to ensure that the policy obligations and associated procedures in the
Environmental and Social Report (ESR) are operationalised, TNUIFSL has outlined
an organisational support structure. Besides fixing responsibility, the organisational
support structure also outlines capacity building essential for TNUIFSL staff and
borrowers.
Organisational Structure
4.2   TNUIFSL has consciously been designed as a lean organisation with minimal
overheads. (Refer Chart 4.1). The personnel and support systems are to be
incrementally geared up as business expands.
4.3    TNUIFSL will deploy six professionals headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in
the first year. Six professionals will consist of two Vice Presidents (Projects), one
Company Secretary, one Manager (Technical) and two Managers (Accounts).



Responsibility Allocation Framework
4.4   In the first two years a majority of the projects to be financec are expected to be
environmentally and socialiy benign projects (E-3 and S-3 categories) or those where
best practises available can be easily applied (E-2 and S-2 categories - refer Section
3). Very few projects with severe environmental and social complexities (E-1 and S-
1 categories) will be financed.
4.5    TNUIFSL will ensure sensitivity to environmental and social aspects of various
projects among its project appraisal and management staff. TNUIFSL has clearly
delineated the functions of professionals within the organisation.
4.6    Both Vice presidents at TNUIFSL will do appraisals of projects.  The Manager
(Technical) will help the CEO and Vice Presidents in project specific environmental
and social assessment and management issues. The two Managers (Accounts) will
maintain loan accounts of borrowers.
4.7    As the portfolio of projects increase in numbers and complexity of environmental and
social issues, more specialised expertise will be inducted into the TNUIFSL as full-
time staff.
Corporate Consultants For Environmental And Social Issues
4.8    TNUIFSL will empanel three to five Corporate Consultants from among individuals or
organisations who have the full range of expertise to address environmental and
social concems related to urban infrastructure projects. They will assist in developing,
appraising and monitoring E-1 and S-1 category projects. They will also address
other project specific environmental and social issues as and when necessary.
4.9    The Corporate Consultants for environmental and social issues will essentially
provide services to TNUIFSL as required, for the following
- Advising TNUIFSL on environmental and social issues
- Environmental and social screening of projects wherever required by the
TN U IFSL
- Reviewing EAR, SAR and other documents submitted by borrowers for specific
environmental and social project components
- Monitoring and evaluating projects
4.10   The Corporate Consultant will also undertake the annual environmental and social
audit of all TNUIFSL financed projects. The Terms of Reference for corporate
consultants is fumished in Appendix-6.



Capacity Building
4.11   TNUIFSL envisages capacity building of its own personnel and its borrowers who
will include Urban Local Bodies. Statutory Boards, Public Undertakings and Potential
Private Operators in order to ensure that the ESR is effectively operationalised.
4.12   The TNUIFSL personnel have not been exposed to formal training in the
management of environmental and social issues. Thus the training programme for
various role players will include an orientation programme on the ESR, Municipal
Finance, Urban Planning, Project Management and Engineering and Public Health.
Course outline for various modules, the duration and the participation envisaged has
been illustrated in table 4.1.
4.13   The training programme is to be co-ordinated and anchored within a training
institution in Tamil Nadu (such as Tamil Nadu Institute of Urban Studies) and other
local and National Institutions and individuals experienced in various aspects of urban
infrastructure projects, will be called upon through an open bid to develop and
conduct courses on various modules. These institutions could include Madras School
of Economics (MSE), Anna Institute of Management (AIM), Environmental Training
Institute of TNPCB, Anna University, Indian Institute of Technology (lIT) Madras,
Madras Institue of Development Studies (MIDS), EXNORA, National Environmental
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUI),
Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), National Institute of Public Finance and
Policy (NIPFP), Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), Development
Altematives (DA), and Indian Institute of Management (IIM).
4.14   Based on the experiences gained over the past 2 years, TNUIFSL will modify its
training efforts and will make it more practical. The expanded training programme
will be supported through the institutional development component of TNUDP-II. The
generic training programme# is elaborated in Table 4.1
