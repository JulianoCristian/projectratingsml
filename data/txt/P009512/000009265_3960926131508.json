They entail (a) construction of\n            small scale flood control, drainage and irrigation\n            subprojects; and (b) rehabilitation of infrastructure\n            damaged or destroyed during the 1987 floods. Specifically,\n            the project includes:  (a) construction of permanent water\n            control structures in about 200 small subprojects; (b)\n            construction of about 15 new subprojects requiring both\n            earthworks and structures; (c) procurement of vehicles and\n            equipment; and (d) provision of technical assistance and\n            training to assist BWDB in institution building.  Under this\n            project the World Food Programme (WFP) intends to provide\n            food in exchange for work to be carried out under specific\n            project activities.  Subprojects are to be selected during\n            project implementation in accordance with guidelines agreed\n            during negotiations."}, "docdt": "1987-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
