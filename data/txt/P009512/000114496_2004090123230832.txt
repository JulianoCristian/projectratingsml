SCHEDULE 7
Part I
Criteria for Selection of Sub-projects under
Part A of the Project
Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, to qualify for Project finance, 
sub-projects would have to meet the criteria outlined  below. These  criteria would 
ensure the technical, economic, and financial viability of the sub-projects. Included 
in the criteria would be requirements that sub-projects would:
1.
For all Sub-projects
 
(a)
be the subject of an up-to-date appraisal by BWDB and its consultants, 
including an evaluation of hydrology, soils, crops, fisheries, and transport 
requirements of the schemes, and an assessment of the impact the  scheme is likely to 
have on adjacent areas; for sub-projects other than repairs and rehabilitation works, 
an economic analysis would be made and their economic rate of return would be at least 
15% on project investments (excluding sunk costs);
(b)
be discussed during preparation with farmers, local authorities, and  
representatives of the technical departments concerned, particularly agriculture and 
fisheries; farmers should be willing to execute on-farm developments below the eight 
ha farm turnouts at their cost and to contribute to the operation and maintenance of 
the sub-project upon its completion;
(c)
be completed before June 30, 1993;
 
(d)
be operated and maintained under arrangements satisfactory to the 
Association;
2.
For Appurtenant Structures Sub-projects Only
Page  14
(e)
cost not more than $375 per ha (in 1987 prices);
 
(f)
have been designed originally by BWDB and, except for repair and 
rehabilitation works, would have been constructed under the Food-for-Work Programme;
(g)
have a base cost not to exceed $400,000;
 
(h)
be completed within two construction seasons;
 
3.
For Fully Planned Sub-projects Only
 
(i)
cost no more than $500 per ha in (1987 prices) for flood control and 
drainage works; $2,000 per ha for irrigation works, including on-farm distribution 
system to eight ha farm turnouts; and $2,500 per ha for schemes combining flood 
control, drainage, and irrigation works;
(j)
have a gross protected area not to exceed 7,500 ha (flood control and 
drainage schemes) and a net irrigated area not to exceed 1,000 ha (irrigation 
schemes);
(k)
have a base cost not to exceed $1,500,000; and
 
(l)
be completed within three construction seasons.
 
Part II
Criteria for Selection of Rehabilitation Works under
Part D of the Project
1.
Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, all Rehabilitation Works estimated 
to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more may be undertaken only  after prior review 
and approval by the Association of the scope of such works and of the expenditures 
involved.
2.
Rehabilitation Works not covered under the preceding paragraph do not need prior 
approval by the Association but must be selected in accordance with the following 
criteria:
(a)
damages to be repaired are:
 
(i)
a consequence of the 1987 floods, or
 
(ii)
damages which, if not repaired, will vitiate or seriously diminish 
the effectiveness of other flood damages being repaired under the 
Project.
(b)
reconstruction would restore structures to their original  specifications 
or to such higher specifications, including necessary additions  or alterations, as 
may now be warranted to ensure their optimal performance and integrity over a 
reasonable life; and
(c)
other sources of financing are not available.
