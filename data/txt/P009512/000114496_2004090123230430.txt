Mr. E.A. Chaudhury
Secretary, Economic Relations Division
Ministry of Planning
Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
Dhaka, Bangladesh
Dear Mr. Chaudhury:
      Re:   BANGLADESH: (Credit No. 1870-BD)
     Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project
            Amendment dated October 24, 1989
I refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated February 19, 1988 for the 
Second Small Scale Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project (Credit 1870-BD) 
(the Development Credit Agreement) between the People's Republic of Bangladesh (the 
Borrower) and the Association.
I also refer to my letter to you dated October 24, 1989 (the Amendment Letter) 
in which I had conveyed the agreement of the Association to amend the Development 
Credit Agreement as set out in the Amendment Letter, subject, however,  to the 
requirement that the Association has received satisfactory evidence that funds 
allocated in the Annual Development Program (ADP) of the Government of Bangladesh 
(GOB) for FY90 to the River Research Institute (RRI) have been reallocated to flood 
control, drainage and irrigation projects financed by the Association.
We have now received a letter dated April 23, 1991 from Mr. Kamaluddin, Deputy 
Secretary, ERD, informing the Association that: (a) for FY91, GOB has allocated and 
will release an additional amount of Tk 106 million to flood control, drainage and 
irrigation projects financed by the Association; (b) for FY92, GOB will provide at 
least Tk 164 million in addition to the initial allocation for FY91, or a total of Tk 
528.5 million; and (c) withdrawals from the Credit for expenditures incurred in 
respect of RRI will be limited to a total of Tk 106 million equivalent in FY91, with 
remaining disbursements being completed in FY92.
I am pleased to advise you that the Association has agreed to the modified 
arrangements for reallocation of funds set out in ERD's letter dated April 23, 1991, 
referred to above. In order to provide for such modified arrangements I am also 
pleased to advise you that the Association has (i) agreed to amend the Development 
Credit Agreement as set out in the Attachment hereto;  and (ii) reallocated SDR 
900,000 from Category 3(b) (Unallocated) to the new Category 2(e) of the table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement. In addition, the 
Association has reallocated SDR 120,000 from Category 3(b) (Unallocated) to Category 
2(c) to reflect past and expected disbursements from Category 2 (c).
Please confirm the agreement of the Borrower to the foregoing by signing the 
attached original counterpart of this letter and return it to us for our records. Upon 
such confirmation, the Development Credit Agreement will stand amended in accordance 
with (a) our amendment letter dated October 24, 1989; and (b) the Attachment hereto.
Sincerely yours,
Shinji Asanuma
