Lessons learned from the project are: i)\n            land acquisition compensations should be fair and based on\n            market studies of prevailing land values and the land\n            acquisition system itself ought to be carefully planned and\n            the bureaucratic process should be initiated before project\n            appraisal or negotiations; (ii) while the situation has now\n            improved, counterpart funding was initially an issue\n            impeding project implementation. More careful appraisal of\n            expected funding levels should be undertaken to adjust\n            project size to likely budget constraints; (iii) the\n            Operation Status Survey (OSS), conducted on over 250\n            subprojects completed under the 1979 project and this\n            project, indicated that, with the exception of recently\n            completed works, embankments and hydraulic structures are in\n            a state of disrepair due to faulty operation and delayed\n            maintenance. As agreed, Government of Bangladesh (GOB)\n            should take urgent action, using its own funds, to remedy\n            these defects; and (iv) participatory Operation and\n            Maintenance (O&M) practices, demonstrated on a pilot\n            basis under this project, should be introduced on a wider\n            scale. The International Development Association (IDA), GOB\n            and Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) management\n            should improve monitoring of progress of O&M and timely\n            remedies and actions taken to resolve emerging issues."}, "docdt": "1996-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
