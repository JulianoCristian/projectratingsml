 In January 2014, the Ministry of Finance team completed its evaluation of Stage I bids to develop the PFMS and prepared a shortlist for the ICB4
 procurement. This was reviewed by the World Bank team and the OPRC and the shortlist was approved in principle, subject to some additional steps to
 mitigate implementation risks. However, as a consequence of public unrest in January and February 2014, and the resulting change in government,
 progress on the procurement of the PFMS system was suspended while the Ministry reviewed its needs in the light of changed economic circumstances
 and the need for fiscal restraint. In April, the Finance Ministry request a restructuring and partial cancellation of the loan. The Ministry and the World
 Bank Team then explored a number of options for restructuring the project, including continuation of the procurement process already underway for the
 new PFMS (ICB4) with reduced scope, and varying levels of investment to upgrade the existing Treasury system and the associated IT infrastructure.
 Discussions took place by video conference and during these discussions the Government explained that substantial investments had already been
 made to upgrade the Treasury system, reducing the need for the new PFMS.

 Given the significant new investment in the Treasury system and the lack of consensus to support the PFMS, the Bank and Government concurred that
 the Government's best course of action would be to close the project early, to cancel the unused portion of the loan and to identify new activities to
 support improved PFM. On October 3rd, the Ministry wrote to the Bank requesting cancellation of the unused part of the loan and of the ICB4
 procurement process, and to bring forward the project closing date to December 31st 2014. An amendment to the Loan agreement was prepared and
 signed on October 31st 2014.

 The project reports (IFRs) submitted regularly in 2013 - 2014, were reviewed and found acceptable. Budget allocation for 2014 is available, and even
 exceeds planned project disbursements. The project Designated and transit accounts are functioning normally, signature cards are available. All project
 applications have been processed in full during the period under review. Project audit report covering 2012 has been submitted on time before June 30,
 2013. Private auditors BDO issued unqualified audit report, and did not note any weaknesses in the internal controls for implementation of the Project.
 Audit of 2013 project financial statements were carried out by the Accounting Chamber, and were submitted with some delay in September 2014. The
 audit report was also unqualified. The contract with BDO is being extended to cover the final project audit covering the period from January 1, 2014 until
 the new application deadline for this project (or until the date of last transaction).



 The Ministry of Finance requested a partial cancellation of the loan, on the basis that the proposed automated Public Finance Management System
 could not be successfully implemented. The Ministry requested the Bank to cancel part of the loan in the amount of $46,056,830, and to bring forward
 the project closing date to December 31st 2014. An amendment to the Loan Agreement, to this effect, was signed on October 31st, 2014.
