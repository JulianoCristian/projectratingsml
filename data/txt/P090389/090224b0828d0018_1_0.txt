                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In January 2014, the Ministry of Finance team completed its evaluation of Stage I bids to develop the PFMS and prepared a shortlist for the ICB4 procurement. This was reviewed by
                         the World Bank team and the OPRC and the shortlist was approved in principle, subject to some additional steps to mitigate implementation risks. However, as a consequence of
                         public unrest in January and February 2014, and the resulting change in government, progress on the procurement of the PFMS system was suspended while the Ministry reviewed
                         its needs in the light of changed economic circumstances and the need for fiscal restraint. In April, the Finance Ministry request a restructuring and partial cancellation of the loan.
                         The Ministry and the World Bank Team then explored a number of options for restructuring the project, including continuation of the procurement process already underway for the
                         new PFMS (ICB4) with reduced scope, and varying levels of investment to upgrade the existing Treasury system and the associated IT infrastructure. Discussions took place by

                         for the new PFMS.

                         Given the significant new investment in the Treasury system and the lack of consensus to support the PFMS, the Bank and Government concurred that the Government's best course

                         of action would be to close the project early, to cancel the unused portion of the loan and to identify new activities to support improved PFM. On October 3rd, the Ministry wrote to the
                         Bank requesting cancellation of the unused part of the loan and of the ICB4 procurement process, and to bring forward the project closing date to December 31st 2014. An
                         amendment to the Loan agreement was prepared and signed on October 31st 2014.

                         The project reports (IFRs) submitted regularly in 2013 - 2014, were reviewed and found acceptable. Budget allocation for 2014 is available, and even exceeds planned project
                         disbursements. The project Designated and transit accounts are functioning normally, signature cards are available. All project applications have been processed in full during the
                         period under review. Project audit report covering 2012 has been submitted on time before June 30, 2013. Private auditors BDO issued unqualified audit report, and did not note any
                         weaknesses in the internal controls for implementation of the Project. Audit of 2013 project financial statements were carried out by the Accounting Chamber, and were submitted
                         with some delay in September 2014. The audit report was also unqualified. The contract with BDO is being extended to cover the final project audit covering the period from January
                         1, 2014 until the new application deadline for this project (or until the date of last transaction).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Finance requested a partial cancellation of the loan, on the basis that the proposed automated Public Finance Management System could not be successfully
                         implemented. The Ministry requested the Bank to cancel part of the loan in the amount of $46,056,830, and to bring forward the project closing date to December 31st 2014. An
                         amendment to the Loan Agreement, to this effect, was signed on October 31st, 2014.
