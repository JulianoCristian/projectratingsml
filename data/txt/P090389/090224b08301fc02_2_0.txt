                                  Executive Summary

        The Ukraine Public Financial Management Project (PFMP) was approved in January
2008 with the objective of improving operational efficiency and transparency of public financial
management in Ukraine. PFMP followed a successful Treasury Modernization Project which
closed in 2004. The Government had requested an IBRD loan of $45 million for a second Treasury
Project. However, following institutional reforms bringing State Treasury under the Ministry of
Finance through a Presidential Decree in 2005 and the formation of a new government in 2006,
the Government’s priorities changed. In consultation with the Bank, the Ministry of Finance
requested the Bank to develop an integrated Public Financial Management System (PFMS),
instead of modernization and upgrading of State Treasury system.
         PFMP had three components: strengthening institutional capacity and operational
effectiveness; development of an integrated PFMS; and project management. The project cost was
$65 million, of which, $50 million was IBRD loan and $15 million was Borrower’s contribution.
Of the total project cost, $61.2 million (95 %) was allotted to development of integrated PFMS.
The original project period was five years, anticipating closure on June 30, 2013.
         PFMP was restructured three times. The first restructuring in 2012 extended the loan by
two years until June 30, 2015 and changed the PDO indicators, linking their end of project targets
to the implementation of PFMS, and altering some project activities. The second restructuring in
2013 amended the loan agreement to include covenants which provided for termination of the
project in the event that procurement deadlines for PFMS were not met. The third restructuring in
2014 cancelled the portion of the loan related to the acquisition of the FMIS amounting to
US$46.06 million and revised the project closing date from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2014.
        When PFMP closed in December, 2014, the major result expected from the project – the
development of an integrated PFMS – had not been achieved. Total disbursements were just $3.94
million: 6 percent of the original project cost.
        Project start-up was delayed because the Ministry of Finance wanted to complete
improvements in PFM business processes under the first component before starting procurement
of the PFMS. At the urging of the Bank’s task team, the authorities eventually agreed to implement
both PFM reforms and the acquisition of the PFMS in parallel.
        Progress in implementing the PFMS then stalled owing to the failure of three separate
attempts at procurement. The first attempt was cancelled by the Bank, on the advice of senior
management, following an anonymous complaint about the technical compliance of bids, despite
OPRC approval and in the absence of a specific allegation of corruption. The second attempt
sought to use of single stage bidding process to recover time lost through cancellation of the first
attempt. This failed when all of the technical bids were rejected as unresponsive. The third attempt
was making good progress when a change in Government and policy priorities in early 2014 led
the authorities to request cancellation of the procurement process and the undisbursed portion of
the loan.
        Alongside the failure of the procurement processes, project implementation was affected
turnover of key counterparts in Government and tensions between Treasury and the Ministry of
Finance. Treasury’s lack of commitment to the PFMS option may have undermined project
implementation. Indeed, Treasury continued to upgrade and modernize its system using
government resources alongside the project and has successfully launched an upgraded e-
Treasury.
         Notwithstanding the failure of the PFMS, the Project has made a modest contribution to
strengthening of institutional capacity and operational effectiveness of Ministry of Finance.
Technical assistance provided by the project supported the design of new business processes
which were regulated through the promulgation of new Decrees. The budget department
developed new budget preparation instructions that included a mid-term budget framework, linked
the budget to the economic and social development program and introduced budget-performance
indicators. The project also helped the authorities make progress in accounting and financial
                                                 ix
reporting. Budget execution data was published on the State Treasury website regularly. The State
Treasury developed the Unified Chart of Accounts which was compliant with IPSAS and GFS
2001. The State Financial Inspections Department used the Risk-Based Planning Methodology to
improve efficiency of their inspections.
        Progress against PDO indicators was unsatisfactory. This is partly because key PDO
indicators were linked to implementation of the PFMS. When alternative indicators are used –
such as changes in Ukraine’s PEFA ratings over the period 2005 to 2010, progress in Open
Budget Index, compliance with IPSAS and GFS2001 standards, use of financial inspections – it is
possible to offer a slightly more generous assessment: modest progress was in some areas of
operational efficiency and transparency.
        An important lesson learned for project design is that the PDO Indicators for PFM reform
projects should focus on the PFM outcomes that the project seeks to deliver rather than the IT
solution. PFM reform outcomes can be achieved by improving the regulatory framework, business
processes and institutional capacity independently of the IT-enabled FMIS solution adopted. While
an effective IT-enabled FMIS will support improvements in business processes, it is not a
necessary condition for successful reform. Following this approach, PFM reform projects can
achieve satisfactory outcomes even if the IT-solution fails.
         PFMP also illustrates that projects supporting FMIS can mitigate the risk of IT failure by
keeping the IT options open during project implementation. If PRMP had supported Treasury in
the continued development of the e-Treasury system during project implementation, pending the
final delivery of the PFMS solution, the project would have contributed to the development of a
partial IT solution even if PFMS failed. This would have given continuity to Treasury
modernization efforts and could possibly strengthened Treasury engagement in the project and
reduced institutional resistance.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.        Country context. Ukraine is a lower middle income country with a population of 46
million. In 2006, during preparation of the Public Financial Management Project (PFMP),
Ukraine’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was US$1,940. From 2000 and until 2005,
Ukraine had enjoyed a strong economic recovery, with growth at around 7.5 percent per year on
average, among the highest in Europe at that time. Foreign direct investment and bank lending
flowed into the country and, together with strong improvements in the external terms of trade due
to high steel prices, sustained double digit growth in domestic demand. Rapid economic growth
facilitated a sharp decline in poverty, which fell sharply from 31 percent in 2001 to 8 percent in
2005. However, public satisfaction with their material well-being remained low. Structural change
had started but remained incomplete and Ukraine continued to lag behind the European Union
(EU) accession in terms of economic reform.

2.       Sector Context. A Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment was
undertaken in 2006 and published in March 2007. This assessment argued that Ukraine had in
place the fundamental PFM systems for managing macro-fiscal policy, some elements for enabling
strategic allocation of resources and a few tools for improving operational efficiency. This
reflected the relative emphasis in a first round of reforms that had put in place the Treasury and
improved budget processes. Second generation reforms were beginning to grapple with strategic
allocation of resources, operational efficiency and accountability. While the budget and financial
reports were quite comprehensive, the absence of an automated commitment control system,
inconsistent integration of pension financial reports into the consolidated reports, the weak
governance and oversight framework for state-owned enterprises were identified as significant
gaps. Rudimentary tools for targeting spending to government priorities were in place, such as
Cabinet involvement in setting budget guidelines, targeted programs and a program-based budget,
but the absence of a medium-term expenditure framework, integrating targeted programs, capital
spending, and recurrent spending into a coherent macro-fiscal framework, posed a risk to overall
fiscal discipline, hindered strategic resource allocation and limited pressure for improved
efficiency.

3.      Sector Policy. The Government of Ukraine (GoU), in office since August 2006, had
continued its commitment to PFM reforms in support of improvements in service delivery and
governance paving the way for accession to the European Union. Institutional reforms brought the
previously independent Treasury under the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance (MoF)
developed a PFM Reform Strategy from the more detailed strategies and action plans of the major
players within the PFM system. GoU committed to implement reforms aiming at greater
transparency, accountability and efficiency and started to introduce performance-based budgeting
(PBB), public financial control and accounting reforms. In line with this emerging broad PFM
Reform Strategy, the MoF developed a PFMS Modernization Strategy to guide the development of
the information technology supporting reforms. This was approved by the Council of Ministers
(CoM) as Resolution No, 888 dated October 17, 2007. This strategy proposed the development of
an integrated PFMS information system that would serve as a backbone to all public expenditure
management processes and linked to the revenue collection systems. The PFMS would bring
together the budgeting cycle under a single platform and facilitate the implementation of
improvements in fiscal planning, budgeting, treasury, debt management, accounting and auditing.
The PFMS was to capitalize on the existing core treasury system and provide an integrated
platform for approximately 8,500 internal users in the MoF, State Treasury of Ukraine (STU),
State Kontrol-Revision Service of Ukraine (KRU) offices, central line ministries and other
government agencies, as well as around 50,000 external system users.

4.       Rationale for Bank’s assistance. The World Bank had supported the GoU’s PFM
reforms through the Treasury Systems Project between July 27, 1999 and December 31, 2004,
financed by the Bank (Project ID: P049174) at a project-cost of US$ 27.24 million. The project
assisted the Government design and implement a fully functional, automated Treasury system that
would serve as an effective instrument for budget execution and cash management. Reform
measures included the design and implementation of the underlying legal framework, the setting
up of the organizational arrangements for treasury-based payment and receipts processing and
design of the associated systems and procedures. These measures enabled Treasury to monitor
budget execution closely, collect and provide the MoF comprehensive reliable and timely
information required for the management of government expenditure and significantly improved
the capacity of the Government for fiscal management. The overall objectives of the project were
successfully accomplished and the achievement of objectives is rated satisfactory.

5.       In 2004, the government had requested the support of the Bank to design and finance the
second phase of the treasury modernization project. However, in 2006 and during project
preparation the orientation of the project shifted in line with Government policy, reflecting the
integration of Treasury under the Ministry of Finance and the adoption of a strategy that sought to
introduce an integrated PFMS covering all Ministry of Finance functions. The Bank was well-
placed to support these reforms, mobilizing international experience and building on extensive
country analytical work.

6.       The new project’s objectives were consistent with, and supported, the 2002 Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Ukraine covering the period 2004-2007, the 2004 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the
2005 CAS Progress Report, and the 2006 Public Finance Review (PFR), all of which
acknowledged accomplishments in Treasury development, highlighted the need to strengthen
fiscal discipline and improve PFM and raised concerns about the fragmented fiscal management.
PFMP was also linked with the Development Policy Lending (DPL) program, which supported
better public governance by implementing policy and institutional reforms across three
overlapping areas of improving the investment climate; better public administration and public
finance management; and, broadening of social inclusion.

1.2       Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The development objective of the Project (PDO) was to strengthen public financial
management by improving operational efficiency and transparency. This was to be promoted
through an integrated PFMS and support for the MoF’s urgent reform program. The Key
Indicators used to measure performance were as follows:

         Increased strategic alignment of the budget with the public policy priorities through higher
          integration of the planning and budgeting processes and improved information for
          budgetary debate and analysis in Parliament, public hearings, and society at large;
         Reduction of 20 percent in time required to get necessary information for managerial
          decisions through the use of an integrated management and information platform; and
         Increased transparency and reliability of public sector financial reporting through
          compliance with international accounting standards and alignment with EU accession
          requirements.

1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators

8.       The PDO remained the same throughout the project. However, PDO Indicator no. 2 was
partially revised and the end-of-project outcome targets for PDO Indicators no. 1 and 3 were
changed during the project’s first restructuring on April 30, 2012. The restructuring also extended
the loan by two years, until June 30, 2015 and changed activities under the second component to
enhance PFMS functional and technical requirements in line with the latest regulations, reform
actions, and advances in technology; include new PFMS modules to support additional needs that

emerged within the last two years; replace two major International Competitive Biddings (ICBs)
with a single-stage combined ICB package to shorten the procurement period for remaining
activities; and strengthen the qualification requirements to ensure the participation of only
experienced and well qualified suppliers during rebidding

9.      PDO indicator no. 1 at the time of appraisal was “Increased strategic alignment of the
budget with the public policy priorities through higher integration of the planning and budgeting
processes and improved information for budgetary debate and analysis in Parliament, public
hearings, and society at large”. The emphasis at this stage was on higher integration of planning
and budgeting processes and providing improved information for budgetary debate and analysis in
Parliament, public hearings, and society at large. The PDO indicator was revised as “Increased
strategic alignment of the budget with the public policy priorities”. The emphasis on higher
integration and improved information was removed. This revision was inconsistent with the PDO
of improved operational efficiency and transparency; integration of planning and budgetary
processes would have positively contributed to improving operational efficiency; and improved
information for budgetary debate and analysis would have contributed to improved transparency.

10.     The end of project target for PDO indicator number 1 at the time of Appraisal was “Fully
Functional PFMS in use during execution of 2012 budget”. This was revised during
Restructuring as “2016 State Budget and Forecast for MTBF periods (2017-2018 RR) are
prepared by using PFMS”. The target was thus revised to cover the extended project period until
2016 budget preparation; and link PFMS not only with Budget but also the MTBFs. This revision
would not have impacted the achievement of PDO. The interim yearly targets at the time of
Appraisal were ‘approved budget laws consistent with approved Medium-term Budget
Frameworks (MTBFs)’. These were revised also during Restructuring to ‘preparing State Budget
and Forecast for MTBF periods based on economic and social development programs, and
national target programs’. This revision strengthened the linkage and alignment between plan and
budget. However, this came very late in the project implementation period.
                                                        3
11.     The PDO indicator no. 3 was “Increased transparency and reliability of public sector
financial reporting through compliance with international accounting standards and alignment
with EU accession requirements”. This indicator was unchanged during the restructuring.
However, its end of the project target was revised. At the time of Appraisal, end of project target
was “Certification of compliance with international accounting standards”. At restructuring, this
was revised to “National accounting standards are in use (via new PFMS)”. The revised target
was more challenging to achieve requiring not only application of the standards but also the
application using the PFMS. This change was made at a time when the procurement process of the
PFMS had been cancelled and it was to be re-started using upgraded technical specifications and
revised procurement method. The intention was to motivate the government to develop and use the
PFMS within the agreed time frame.

12.      In addition to changes in PDO indicators, changes were made in the Intermediate Outcome
Indicators and the end of project targets. These changes are summarized in Annex 2. Under
Component 1 on strengthening institutional capacity and operational effectiveness, two
intermediate results indicators were dropped and two indicators were added. At Appraisal stage,
one out of four Intermediate Indicators were linked with PFMS. After restructuring two out of four
Intermediate Indicators were linked to the PFMS. Under Component 2 on development of
integrated PFMS, one out of four indicators was dropped and the remaining three were revised to
enhance the level of end of project targets in relation to functionality of the PFMS.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

13.     The MoF was the beneficiary of the Project. Project activities were also designed to assist
STU and KRU substantially to strengthen treasury and internal audit operations and support
reform needs in addition to urgent MoF requirements while developing an integrated information
system.

1.5       Original Components

14.       The original components of the Project were as under:

         Component 1: Strengthening institutional capacity and operational effectiveness
          (US$2.581 million): The purpose of this component was to assist the MoF in selected
          institutional capacity building activities for PFM reforms, functional review of the MoF,
          business process re-engineering, and design of ICT solutions, as a part of broader PFM
          reform agenda (2007-2011). Enhancement and optimization of the functions and
          operational efficiency of the MoF, KRU and STU were other important objectives.
          Assistance in strengthening the institutional capacity was to be limited due to existence of
          adequate donor funding (grants) available for the GoU to implement PFM reforms.
         Component 2: Development of an Integrated Public Financial Management System
          (PFMS) (US$61.195 million): With the completion of the Bank’s first Treasury project in
          December 2004, a well-functioning Treasury System (TS) was already in place. The
          reform agenda now required the integration of key PFM modules to create a single,
          integrated centralized information system that would serve as a backbone to all public
          expenditure management processes and link with the revenue collection systems.
         Component 3: Project Management (US$1.224 million): This component was to ensure
          timely and efficient allocation of resources, to carry out project procurement, financial
          management, and audit activities, to monitor and evaluate the implementation and to
          interact with all local and international entities involved in project execution.

15.     The first component was to build institutional capacity and improve business processes in
budget preparation, budget execution, cash management, internal financial controls, and
transparency in budget planning and public expenditure. The second component was to integrate
key PFM modules and create a single, integrated centralized information system. Together, these

                                                   4
components would contribute to improved operational efficiency and transparency leading to
strengthened public financial management.

1.6       Revised Components

16.       There were no revisions in the components.

1.7       Other Significant Changes

17.      Second Project Restructuring in April, 2013. During the course of implementation in
2013, it was felt that there was a risk that the Project will not achieve its PDO by the closing date
of June 30, 2015, because of delays in the procurement of the PFMS solutions. The
implementation of the PFMS was indispensable to the attainment of the PDO and the bulk of the
remaining disbursements (90 percent of the total loan). A low level of disbursements was expected
before the completion of the PFMS contract. To mitigate this risk, the Bank and the Borrower
agreed to amend the Loan Agreement (LA) to include key covenants and dates for another bidding
process (single-stage) based on a mutually agreed timetable. Delays or failure of the Borrower to
comply with the new covenants and meet these target dates would jeopardize the Project.

18.      Third Project Restructuring in October, 2014. Progress on the project had been very slow
in respect of acquisition of the FMIS. Other components of the project had proceeded
satisfactorily. However, procurement of the FMIS had failed twice. A third attempt to acquire a
Financial Management Information System (FMIS) was underway and was progressing well using
a two-stage bidding process when the Government changed course following the change of
Government in March, 2014. The project was restructured in April 2013 with a series of covenants
which provided for termination of the project in the event that procurement deadlines were not
met. In view of the political and economic developments in the country, which had created severe
fiscal pressures, the Government reviewed its priorities and requested that the project be scaled
down and closed. The Ministry of Finance decided not to pursue the option of a customized off-
the-shelf FMIS. Instead, they decided to upgrade the hardware and add to the functionality of the
existing Treasury system. As a result, as per Government’s request, the Bank cancelled a portion
of the loan related to the acquisition of the FMIS amounting to US$46.06 million and revised the
project closing date from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality of Entry

2.1.1     Soundness of background analysis:

19.      The Bank funded Treasury System Project, completed in December 20041, had assisted the
GoU in setting up the new treasury function, modernizing treasury operations and upgrading its
capacity for fiscal management. The Treasury was capable of monitoring the budget execution
closely and collecting and providing the MoF with comprehensive, reliable and timely information
for effective public expenditure management. The GoU had requested the Bank’s assistance for the
second Treasury project (Treasury II), through their letter dated August 12, 2004 (attached as
Annex 4), with following objectives: to improve the scope and functionality of the system of
public finance management and associated legal framework and procedures developed under the
first Treasury project; and to enable the system to become a better instrument for budget allocation
and technical efficiency, better execution, audit and control, and further improved cash
management. A PHRD Grant2 was approved and became effective in January 2005 for the

preparation of Treasury II project. However, due to a changed political scenario in 2005, State
Treasury became subordinate to the MoF through a Decree of the President3.

20.      The MOF requested immediate advisory support from the Bank for its reorganization,
identification of information needs and establishment of EU compatible functionality. Following
discussions with the MoF, Treasury and other stakeholders, the Bank and the MoF decided that the
Treasury-II project should be converted into an integrated PFMS project incorporating additional
functional modules and providing linkages with other systems in and outside the MoF. This
reflected Ministry’s understanding of its information system needs and the new institutional
arrangements after State Treasury became subordinate to the MoF (by Decree of the President in
2005, followed by the formation of a new government in August 2006). The Bank agreed to
activate the PHRD grant for the Treasury to assist in preparation of the new PFM project and to
advise the MoF and STU on reorganization and integration issues. The focus shifted to preparing
the integrated PFMS project. While the Treasury was actively involved in the development of the
PFMS solution and the project at the design stage and while the relationship between Treasury and
the MoF fundamentally changed, it is not clear that all stakeholders were committed to the process
of institutional integration or the decision to abandon the e-Treasury system in favor of an
integrated PFMS solution.

2.1.2     Assessment of the project design:

21.     Objectives: The PDO was to strengthen PFM by improving operational efficiency and
transparency. This was achievable within a 5-year project time-period and the government could
be held accountable for it.

22.      Components: The Project had three components - strengthening institutional capacity and
operational effectiveness; development of an integrated Public Financial Management System
(PFMS); and, Project management. Considering that Bank-financed ‘Treasury Systems Project’
was satisfactory and the government had requested support for that in the form of Treasury II
project, the Project could have included a fourth component to support continued support and
upgrading for the e-Treasury. This would have allowed the project to support system
improvements and provided a safeguard in case of delays or failure of the integrated PFMS
solution. The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in their report of 2009 wondered ‘whether the
integration of Treasury into the MoF overloaded Ukraine’s politically volatile circuits, particularly
when resistance of the civil service, and, government changes, had been identified as a substantial
risk. It consumed significant Government and Bank effort and attention that might have been
better focused on improving data systems’. Inclusion of a component to support the Treasury
modernization could have reduced the tension and reduced the risk of institutional resistance from
the Treasury. During implementation, the project restructuring in April 2012 provided an
opportunity to include a component to support treasury modernization. This option was not
considered despite the failure of the PFMS procurement process and the proposed restart of
procurement process with upgraded technical specifications of PFMS. In the absence of support
from PFMP, the State Treasury used its operations and maintenance budget to continue upgrading
of e-Treasury system on its own.

2.1.3     Adequacy of government’s commitment

23.     The Project was prepared with support from the PHRD and Dutch Grant over a two year
period. The project design was informed by the organizational review of the MoF undertaken in
2005, the PEFA assessment in 2006, and the White Paper on Internal Audit and Control of 2005.
This supported the integration of Treasury under the MoF and the use of an integrated IT solution
to help Treasury become more responsive to the information and control needs of the MoF.
Government ownership and commitment was flagged as a substantial risk during preparation,
notably vested interests by civil servants and others, as well as government changes. One of the
implementing agencies, the State Treasury, lost its independence and much of its authority while

    Decree#676 dated June 2005.
                                                 6
the MoF gained power and influence. State Treasury now had to report to the Cabinet through the
MoF rather than directly. Thus, while MOF was fully committed to the project design and KRU
was generally supportive, it was not always clear that the State Treasury was fully committed.
Indeed, at times Treasury officials appeared to highlight problems and raise issues in a manner that
hindered effective implementation of the project and the introduction of a new integrated IT
system. While MoF and the Bank chose not to support the upgrading of the e-Treasury through
PFMP, focusing instead on the development of an integrated system, Treasury continued to
support e-Treasury system using the meagre state resources earmarked for its operations and
maintenance from 2009. Treasury continued to view the e-Treasury system as a viable alternative
to the PFMS throughout project implementation. Indeed, in the closing months of the project,
when the authorities were exploring options for scaling back the project, Treasury proposed to use
part of the funds to scale up the IT capability and create modest additional functionality in the e-
Treasury system.

2.1.4   Assessment of Risks

24.     Risks were adequately assessed at the Appraisal stage. The risk to the PDO was identified
as “loss of the Government commitment to public financial management reform”. This was quite
accurate. While PFM projects are often presented as technical programs of PFM modernization
with no political ramifications, they are not neutral programs of financial modernization, as they
take away an important lever of central political control, changing the way in which public
finances are managed, from discretionary central sanction to a more automatic rule based system
of decentralized spending of authorized appropriations. In this case, there was a significant shift of
power from the State Treasury to the MoF. This inevitably caused resentment and possibly
generated passive and active institutional resistance to reforms.

25.      To succeed, this project needed sustained political commitment, strong technical capacity
and a change management strategy that addressed the institutional tensions between winners and
losers of the reforms. While the project was supported by several successive governments during
preparation and ratified by the Parliament by almost 300 MPs such initial agreement at the highest
levels of government, although important, was not sufficient to ensure continuity or depth of
ownership. This is particularly true in an environment such as Ukraine with frequent government
changes. Most importantly, high level political support did not address let alone overcome the
underlying tensions between MoF and the State Treasury. Perhaps, the planned risk mitigation
measure (Bank to closely monitor the Government commitment and continue to maintain dialogue
with the MoF on key PFM issues”) could have contributed to a resolution of this tension if a
serious effort had been made to explore how to meet Treasury’s needs and concerns (such as by
including a component upgrading e-Treasury). However, the solution adopted was to enforce
implementation of the integrated solution rather than explore options and open dialogue between
the various stakeholders.

2.2     Implementation

26.     Project implementation is deemed unsatisfactory because the project’s main outcome —a
new installed PFMS which supposed to substantially improve the automation of business
processes by supporting improved financial control, higher quality and timeliness of information
flows, and larger transparency— was not achieved.

27.     Most of the activities under Component 1 were implemented as planned. These activities
supported PFM system reforms and developed new business processes, including: instructions on
preparation of budget requests; a methodology for the evaluation of budget program efficiency; a
performance program budgeting system; establishment of budget performance indicators;
optimization of number of budget programs; agreement of norms of sectoral fiscal capacity;
systems for monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness authorities exercised by local self-
government; a new system for risk-based planning of financial inspections; and, strategic


                                                  7
alignment of budget and MTBF with policy priorities are a few such institutional changes that are
going to remain with the government and strengthen their management public finances.

28.     None of the activities foreseen under Component 2 were implemented and as result the
PFMS was not delivered. Failure to deliver the PFMS did not have a direct negative impact on
PFM system performance but it did significantly delay the implementation of an integrated IT
solution. Fortunately, State Treasury had continued to implement and upgrade its e-treasury
system, which almost fully covers functionality of the Treasury module envisaged in the PICB-4.
Implementation of an integrated PFMS is still an important issue for the MoF which wishes to
automate budget processes. Preparation of a new project on building a modern PFM system and e-
governance development remains an important reform agenda for the MoF, the State Treasury and
the SFI. The factors that led to the failure of Component 2 and the project as a whole are reviewed
below.

29.     PFMS start-up delay. The MoF did not want to start the procurement of the PFMS until
the PFM business processes were improved under the project’s first component. The task team
argued that PFMS software would be flexible enough to adapt to any changes in the business
process of PFM and so there was no need to delay PFMS procurement. Eventually, after a delay of
eight months MoF agreed to implement the first and second components both in parallel rather
than sequentially.

30.      Failed Procurement of PFMS. The project’s success or failure hinged on timely
procurement. The Project had initially planned two ICB packages for software (ICB1) and
hardware (ICB2) respectively to be undertaken through two-stage procurement processes.
Procurement proceeded smoothly until an anonymous complaint was received in respect of ICB1
stating that not all bidders had complied with the technical requirements and that Oracle licensing
conditions were not in the best interests of the project. The task-team referred the complaint to the
INT which initiated investigations. Since complaint was not against any particular company and
did not allege corruption, INT took some time in gathering information on possible of collusion
and corruption. While the investigation was ongoing, the matter was referred to OPRC for a
decision. OPRC, after careful review of facts, noting that an INT investigation was ongoing,
approved the selection based on the lowest cost method. Meanwhile, in view of the ongoing INT
investigation and possibility of corruption, Senior Management directed the task team to cancel the
procurement process. The task team complied accordingly and cancelled the procurement process
under both ICB1 and ICB2. Senior Management’s intervention in the process of providing a ‘no
objection’ in a procurement decision led to the cancellation of a potentially successful procurement
process. Subsequently, INT reported that one of the companies in the consortium that had bid the
lowest cost under ICB1, was found guilty of corruption in another project of another sector and
that it had been temporarily suspended. That company could not, therefore, be granted a Bank-
contract from the date of its temporary suspension.

31.      After the cancellation of procurement process under ICB1 and ICB2, the Project adopted
single-stage procurement process under ICB3. While a two-stage procurement process is usually
followed for procurement of technically complex IT systems, to allow bidders to acquaint
themselves with the technical requirements in the first stage, the risk of technically unresponsive
bids was considered to be relatively small given that the market had already been consulted in the
earlier – failed – ICB1 and ICB2 processes. However, firms failed to provide technically
responsive bids and ICB3 process had to be cancelled. This delayed the procurement of PFMS
significantly.

32.      After the failure of ICB3, ICB4 was re-launched as a two-stage process in 2013. This
process was going relatively smoothly with first stage nearing completion, when the political
situation changed in early 2014. The Government indicated that priorities had changed, decided to
cancel the procurement process and requested that the Bank cancel the remainder of the loan and
project activities terminated.


                                                 8
33.     Institutional Leadership. Implementation of reforms was hampered by frequent changes
in the project leadership at various levels. Following the resignation of Minister of Finance in
early 2009, the January 2010 Presidential elections led to a appointment of a new Minister of
Finance provided a firmer basis for political leadership. At a more operational level,
implementation was hampered by eight changes in the Project Leader during the project
implementation period. This contributed to a lack of focus and continuity of priorities. The
shortcomings in project leadership were aggravated by differences in views among component
managers as well as between the key institutions involved. This hampered effective decision
making, prevented decisive action and contributed to delays in project implementation and
ultimately to the cancellation of the PFMS procurement procedure.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34.      M&E Design: The indicators used were not effective in measuring the impact on the PDO
of improving ‘efficiency’ and ‘transparency’ of PFM. All of the PDO indicators suffered
significant limitations.

35.      PDO indicator #1: ‘increased strategic alignment of the budget with public policy
priorities’ would have positively impacted the ‘effectiveness’ of PFM, but not its ‘efficiency’.
However, ‘improving ‘effectiveness’ of PFM’ was not part of the PDO. The end of Project target
at the time of Appraisal was kept as ‘fully functional PFMS in use in the execution of 2012
budget’. This was neither ‘necessary’, nor ‘sufficient’ condition for ensuring a strategic alignment
of budget with public policy priorities. While PFMS would be a tool for budget management, the
strategic alignment of plan priorities and budget has to happen outside the IT system before PFMS
can the process in the IT environment. The focus should have been on addressing the problem
identified in diagnostics at the time of project preparation: preparing budget forecasts based on
economic and social development programs and national target programs. At appraisal stage,
budget provisions were to be linked to the MTBFs.

36.     PDO indicator #2 sought to measure efficiency in terms of: ‘reduction of 20 % in time
required to get necessary information for managerial decisions through the use of an integrated
management information platform’. While the PFMS could have contributed significantly to time-
savings, the PFMS was not a necessary or a sufficient condition to achieve this outcome. PFMP
financed functional reviews and business-process reengineering, which could have contributed to
time-savings independently of the PFMS. An alternative measure of operational efficiency could
have been the PEFA indicators. There was a PEFA assessment conducted in 2005, from which,
scores on a few relevant indicators and dimensions could have been used as a baseline. There was
a repeat PEFA assessment was conducted in 2011, and a PEFA assessment is now planned in
2015. Thus, the project could have an objective, evidence-based, and a third-party assessed
baseline, mid-term, and end of project measure of operational efficiency.

37.      PDO indicator #3 sought to measure transparency in terms of: Certification of compliance
with international accounting standards. While compliance with international accounting standards
would have allowed budget ‘provisions’ and ‘actuals’ data to be reported with a more detailed set
of classifications, the classification system is not a sufficient condition for transparency. A more
effective measure of transparency would be the indicators underlying the Open Budget Index
(OBI) which assesses the government publishes key budget documents: the focus is on availability
of information for citizens to analyze, question and debate budget provisions and expenditures.
PEFA Indicator-10 is also a good measure of budget transparency. So, while the indicator so
designed would allow reporting of budget data in a more detailed set of classifications, it would
contribute to transparency only if the budget data is published in a more effective and timely
manner to allow greatest possible citizen’s access.

38.      M&E Implementation. On PDO indicator 1, the baseline and achievements have not
been precisely drawn. The baseline reads: “existing budget formulation methodologies are not
conducive for the use of budgets as a policy instrument”. There is no measure of the ‘extent’ and
‘direction’ of deviance between budget and policy. Similarly, the progress reported is that budget
                                                9
and MTBF forecasts are based on the forecast of economic and social development program,
action program of council of ministers, and national target programs. Again, there is no attempt to
actually measure the degree of alignment.

39.     On PDO indicator 2, there was no baseline information at appraisal. Consequently, it is not
clear whether 20 % reduction was adequate or over ambitious. The baseline study was conducted
in 2012, which is close to the original project closing date. The repeat survey was conducted only
in 2013, not at the end of the project. Thus, this indicator, both by design and measurement, failed
to measure impact on operational efficiency.

40.     On PDO indicator 3, there were two main sets of targets – first to fully develop and
approve national accounting standards for public sector, and second, to ensure that those
accounting standards were in use via the new PFMS. These indicators were well understood and
measurable.

41.      M&E utilization. Due to design flaws, the M&E framework could not contribute
satisfactorily to project management. There is very little evidence that the M&E framework were
actually used as management tools to guide project activities, resource allocations or supervision
activities.

2.4       Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

42.     The Project had a continuous “Satisfactory” rating for the Financial Management and
“Moderately Unsatisfactory” rating for the Procurement Management. There were no major
operational issues related with financial management and disbursement: disbursements were only
5.6 percent of the original project cost due to the failure of procurement of integrated PFMS which
amounted to about 95 percent of the total project cost.

43.      Shortcomings of the project procurement were reviewed above in section 2.2. ICB1 and
ICB2 procurement processes were cancelled on instruction from Senior Management owing to
perceived risk of corruption. ICB3 was conducted using a single-stage bidding process, in
expectation that qualified bidders from the cancelled ICB1 and ICB2 would have applied and there
had been adequate market consultation during these process. This assumption proved mistaken: the
bids received were all technically unresponsive and ICB3 had to be cancelled. ICB4 was launched
and making good progress but could not be completed owing to a change in Government priorities
in early 2014.

44.      None of the project activities triggered social safeguards. The Project provided funding for
institutional reforms and did not include new construction, land acquisition, or any other activities
that raise social safeguard issues. The project operation was limited to provision of technical
assistance in support of the Government’s strategy for public financial management reform. No
negative environment impact arose from implementation of this Project. There were no deviations
or waivers from the Bank safeguards/ fiduciary policy procedures.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes
3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

         Relevance of Objectives: Substantial

45.     The PDO was to strengthen PFM by improving operational efficiency and transparency.
At the time of loan approval, this objective was consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for the fiscal years 2008-2011, the second pillar of which, sought to improve public services
by targeting greater efficiency in spending, and using improvements in public sector financial
management as an entry point into public sector reforms. This objective continues to remain
relevant today in light of the CPS for fiscal years 2012-2016, the first pillar of which, supports the
                                                  10
sustainability and efficiency of public finances and a more transparent and accountable use of
public resources. The objectives were relevant to the DPL program, at the time of loan approval, as
it supported better public governance by implementing policy and institutional reforms across
three overlapping areas: improving the investment climate; better public administration and public
finance management; and broadening of social inclusion.

46.      Ukraine is still emerging from the 2009 economic and financial crisis with serious
structural weaknesses left unaddressed. Fiscal imbalances remain significant and large social
transfers, inefficient public services and significant quasi-fiscal subsidies threaten sustainability.
Over the past decade, Ukraine’s authorities have shied away from addressing the challenges of
state capture and corruption, and public trust in the state has been undermined. This in turn has
created public resistance to necessary but painful reforms of social transfers and public services.

47.      In light of this situation, CPS 2012-16 aims to assist Ukraine in overcoming
implementation bottlenecks identified in the Presidential Program and thus help to make progress
in the declared ambitious reform and EU integration agenda. It will support efforts of the
authorities to improve relations with civil society and business; to turn social distrust into support
for reform and make government both more accountable and more effective. The Bank's support is
organized around two pillars, both emphasizing the importance of improved governance for
sustained socio-economic progress in Ukraine. Pillar I specifically supports deepened relations
between government and citizens, focused on improving public services, sustainability and
efficiency of public finances, and a more transparent and accountable use of public resources. The
objective of strengthening public financial management through improving operational efficiency
and transparency therefore remain relevant even today.

       Relevance of Design: Modest

48.      While the PDO of improving operational efficiency and transparency was relevant to the
country and sector context and also to the country partnership strategy and development programs
of the country, the project design was not fully consistent with these objectives. The PDO
indicator#1 of increased strategic alignment between budget and policy priorities, for example,
contributed to improving effectiveness of the PFM, but not to efficiency and transparency. The
PDO indicator#2 of reducing time taken in decision-making was not being contributed to by any
project activity specifically. The PDO indicator#2 on improving transparency was simply based on
improving accounting standards for better reporting rather than publishing the key fiscal data on
public domain.

49.     During Restructuring in 2012, several outcome indicators were linked with the PFMS.
This decision was taken despite the fact that the first PFMS procurement process had failed and the
project and the risks to involved in the timely completion of the procurement process of PFMS.
Linking outcome indicators to the operationalizing of PFMS significantly increased the risk that
the project would have and unsatisfactory outcome.

50.      The design of the project components and activities were relevant. The component 1 on
strengthening institutional capacity and operational effectiveness and component 2 on
development of integrated PFMS were both designed to contribute to operational efficiency and
transparency. The decision to opt for an integrated PFMS system was highly relevant given the
integration of the State Treasury into the MoF and the pressing need for MoF to gather timely
information across the full range of PFM functions. Given the long lead time to the completion of
the PFMS and the high risks of system integration, the project have mitigated these risks by
providing modest support for the continued upgrading of the e-Treasury system. In the end, the
Treasury funded upgrading from its own resources and this has allowed continuity in service.

       Relevance of Implementation: Modest

51.     Project activities remained relevant through implementation. Delays in project start-up
occurred after ratification by the Parliament owing to the authorities’ preference to strengthen
                                                11
business processes of PFM under component 1 before starting the development of the PFMS.
Ultimately the authorities agreed to proceed with both components simultaneously, after a delay of
approximately eight months. Thereafter, implementation of component 1 proceeded largely as
planned up to the point of development of the supporting PFMS. These activities complemented
support from the European Union’s ‘Effective State Budget Management’; DFID’s Regional
Strategic Budget Planning (including PFM)”; and French Treasury’s “Treasury Reform, Internal
Audit and MoF & MoE Reform Projects”. In contrast, activities under component 2 never started
owing to the failure of the ICB1 and ICB2 and subsequent ICB3 processes and the cancellation of
ICB4.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objective

52.      Progress against the elements of the development objective of the project – operational
efficiency and transparency – are reviewed in turn below, drawing on information from project
monitoring, supervision reports and third party sources.

         Improving Operational Efficiency: Partially Achieved

53.     The PDO indicator to measure improvement in operational efficiency was a reduction of
20 percent in the time required to get necessary information for managerial decisions through the
use of an integrated management and information platform. No assessment was undertaken during
preparation or the early stages of implementation to define a baseline. No assessment was
undertaken at project closing to assess progress against the target. However, the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) did conduct specialized surveys of four business processes to
determine the time required to take managerial decisions in 2012 and 2013. The results of this
assessment are presented below. Details of time taken in different sub-activities of each of these
business processes are provided in Annex 13. The results suggest that there was virtually no
change in the time required to get necessary information for managerial decisions between 2012
and 2013 and on this basis, there is no evidence of improvement in operational efficiency over this
period.

54.      Alternative Indicator – PEFA. An alternative approach to the assessment of operational
efficiency could draw on the PEFA assessments conducted in 2005 and 2010. The comparison of
relevant 20 PEFA dimensions is presented below. This points to improvements in: linkages
between investment budgets and forward expenditure estimates; the extent to which cash flows are
forecast and monitored; scope of reports in terms of coverage and compatibility with budget
estimates; quality of information in budget reports; and, completeness of the financial statements
between 2005 and 2010. Amongst these, improvements in the extent to which cash flows are
forecast and monitored and completeness of financial statements were substantial. While these
indicators do not support conclusions regarding operational efficiency as measured by reductions
in time taken for business processes, they do point to improvements in the integration and
operational efficiency in terms of delivering the desired outcomes over part of the project period.

55.     Alternative Indicator – Financial Inspections. The Risk-based Planning Methodology
developed with the Project’s assistance was adopted by the State Financial Inspection’s
Methodology Council in 2012. Selection of objects/units for the state financial revisions
(inspections) was based on 16 indicators for the budget entities and on 22 indicators for the state
enterprises. Objects/Units were classified as per three levels of risks: high, medium and low; and,
only “high risk” objects (budget units or SOEs) were included in the Audit-plan. Since PFMS was
not developed, the list of objects/units, their budgetary provisions and data to measure potential
risks was entered manually. The improved Risk-Based Planning Methodology helped the Financial
Inspections Directorate increase efficiency through better focus and control. First, the number of
violations detected increased as a percentage of the number of inspections. In 2012, the State
Financial Inspection Directorate conducted about 8,000 planned inspections, detecting 7,500
financial violations at a rate of 94 percent. However, after use of improved Risk-based Planning
methodology, State Financial Inspections Directorate conducted only 3,500 “high risk” inspections
which identified 3,400 financial violations at a rate of about 98 percent. Thus, with risk-based
planning methodology, in 2014, number of inspections was reduced by 56 percent in comparison
to number of inspections carried out in 2012, thereby putting lower pressure on staff and resources,
while the detection of financial violations rose from 94 to 98 percent. Second, and increase in the
percentage of referrals to law enforcement agencies. In 2012, 33 percent of violations detected
were referred to law enforcement agencies for prosecution. In 2014, this increased to 53 percent.
This suggests an improvement in the quality and follow-up to inspections. Summary performance
data from before and after adoption of risk-based planning methodology in the State Financial
Inspection Directorate are presented in the below Figure 1.

Improving Transparency: Negligible


56.     The PDO indicator for improvement in transparency was ‘compliance of public sector
financial reporting with international accounting standards and alignment with EU accession
standards’. The end of project target was – ‘national accounting standards are in use (via new
PFMS)’.

57.      Compliance with IPSAS: Modest. With the assistance of the World Bank, 19 new public
sector accounting standards4 have been developed and adopted based on the International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) accrual standards. On December 31, 2013, the MoF issued
Decree#1203 approving Unified Chart of Accounts compatible with the IPSAS. The government
has committed to transition to accrual accounting. National public sector accounting regulations
(standards) came into effect from January 01, 2015, and annual financial statements of fiscal year 2015
will be produced on the basis of these accrual standards. Despite the requirements of the CoM
resolution, it is not realistic that accrual accounting will be fully adopted during 2015. Ukraine
certainly has made great progress in the transition to accrual accounting. The current reporting
regime includes some of the elements required in an accrual regime, such as reporting of the stock
of certain financial assets and liabilities, including arrears. However, current practices hinder
progress toward full accrual accounting, notably: weaknesses in the accounting systems; the
budget execution focus of reporting; lack of capacity for accounting for the use of assets, liabilities
and inventories; and lack of coverage of all controlled entities in the accounts. Furthermore, while
IPSAS requires consolidated reporting on all of the entities under the control of the government it
is simply not possible to include State-Owned Enterprises and non-budgetary operations of the
social welfare funds in the short run. Despite ongoing enhancements to the current system in place
in the STU, there remain significant weaknesses in its capacity to support accrual accounting. The
current Treasury system is designed to track movement in cash deposit accounts and to control and

report against cash based budget appropriations. This system does not support transactions in
nonfinancial assets, nor does it record non-cash balances such as accounts payable or receivable.

58.     Compliance with Government Finance Statistics (GFS): Partial. An IMF report of
September 20145 notes that the Budget is classified according to administrative unit, program, and
economic classification. A functional classification is used in budget preparation and reporting but
is not used for budget execution control. The economic classification specified is quite detailed,
equivalent to a 4-digit GFS economic classification, but not fully compliant with GFSM 2001.The
new unified chart of accounts does bring Ukraine into partial compliance with GFSM 2001.
Additional alignment measures are to be introduced with effect from the budget of fiscal year
2016.

59.       Alternative Indicators – Open Budget Index and PEFA. As explained in Section 2.3
above, the PDO indicator does not fully measure the efficacy of the PDO of enhanced
transparency. The ICR team, therefore, referred to the Open Budget Index (OBI) as an independent
assessment of PFM Transparency in Ukraine during the project period. OBI measures the amount,
level of detail, and timeliness of budget information published made publically available.
Countries are scored between 0 and 100. In 2012, Ukraine’s score was 54 out of 100, which is a
little higher than the average score of 43 for all the 100 countries surveyed but is lower than the
scores of its neighbors Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, and Slovakia. Ukraine’s
score declined from 62 in 2010 and 55 in 2008. On the basis of this assessment, there little to
suggest that budget transparency improved during the project period. A similar conclusion can be
drawn from the PEFA assessments of 2005 and 2010. Scores for Performance Indicator 10 on
Public Access to Key Fiscal Information remained unchanged at “B” in both assessments.

60.      Intermediate Results - Budget data and policy assumptions published in greater
detail on the MoF website. The end of project target was publishing state budget execution
performance from the PFMS database on monthly basis. Notwithstanding the failure of the PFMS,
in accordance with Article 28 of the Budget Code of Ukraine, the MOF publishes this information
on state budget execution on a monthly basis on its website. This includes data on general and
special funds on revenues, expenditures and loans and credits. Draft laws on annual budget are
published with broad list of policy assumptions right after its presentation in the Parliament. A
book on Budget Execution report which included some analytical comments is also published on
the MoF website, but only for the FY2013. State and region (oblast) budgets execution reports by
functional, economic and program classifications are published monthly and quarterly on the State
Treasury web-site. However, in the absence of the PFMS, the quality of such information has
changed only slightly since the start of Project. For example, there are no details about state budget
programs performance in regular budget reports. Some of the key spending units publish such
information periodically. Available local budget database is aggregated by regions only and it is
not disaggregated by type of local budgets. Also, it is not possible to see an economic structure of
the budget expenditures by sectors and by units. So, a huge mass of dry statistics is published, but
there is an absence of illustration and explanation. In addition, the budget data base has not been
published on the Parliament’s website for already several years. When the project was designed,
such data was published on the Budget Committee’s web site regularly. Consequently, despite the
increase in volume of information published, the quality of information in the context of the
budget transparency is still insufficient and the information is not user friendly for general public.

61.      Intermediate Results - Timely and comprehensive fiscal management reports
produced from PFMS data warehouse: The end-of-Project target was a fully operational data
warehouse as part of integrated PFMS platform for online queries and, timely and comprehensive
reporting. Since integrated PFMS could not be established, no progress could be made in respect
of this indicator.

 Public Financial Management Overview, by Brian Olden, Dimitar Radev, Kris Kauffman and Deg Detter of Fiscal
Affairs Department of International Monetary Fund

           Improving Effectiveness: Modest

62.      This ICR considers improvements in effectiveness even though this was not specifically
part of the PDO because PDO indicator#1: “increased strategic alignment of the budget with
public policy priorities” would have contributed to this objective. The PAD noted in the Results
Framework, that at the baseline, existing budget formulation methodologies were not conducive
for the use of budgets as a policy instrument. The project aimed at preparation of annual budgets
and forecasts for MTBFs on the basis of economic and social development program and national
target programs. At the end of the project, it was envisaged that 2016 State Budget Forecast for
MTBF periods (2017-2018) would be prepared using the PFMS. While the end-of-project target
could not be achieved due to failure to establish PFMS, the project did made progress on
increasing strategic alignment of budget and policy priorities. However, overall the outcome of
the measures taken in terms of improving strategic alignment is considered modest.

63.      Guidelines on the preparation of budget requests by the key spending units were adopted
by the MoF’s order in 2012. According to these Guidelines, budget request form included two year
forecasts of expenditures needs. Since the MTBF was fully implemented, the budget request forms
were used for annual budget preparation. It is worth mentioning that according to the Budget Code
of Ukraine (Art 21), the Council of Ministers has to adopt a two years’ budget forecast in a month
after the Parliament’s approval of an annual budget law. During the project life, there was only one
time in 2012, when medium-term budget framework was adopted by a separate Government’s
resolution. This Resolution showed budget prognoses for 2013 and 2014 budget years was broken
down by the key types of revenues and expenditures. However, this Resolution included only the
list of budget programs aimed at implementation of public investment projects financed by IFO
and did not show clear links to strategic documents such as the State Performance Programs.

64.       Some steps towards improving links between budgeting and strategic planning have been
taken. The State Budget 2015 was prepared in line with the Council of Ministers’ Strategic
Program and the 2015 State Budget and Forecast for mid-term periods (2016-2017) were based on
the forecast of economic and social development of Ukraine for 2015 and key macro-economic
indicators of economic and social development of Ukraine for 2016 and 2017, the Action Program
of the Council of Ministers of Ukraine, and National Target Programs took account of tax, budget
and social sphere reforms. However, goals and objectives of this Program had mostly declarative
character that reduced its value for policy based budget planning. In addition there was a practice
of creating so called State Performance Programs which had been inherited from the Soviet time
and this practice had not fully integrated into the budget process. As a conclusion, the budgeting is
still not fully in line with strategic planning. At the same time, implementation of the MTBF and
improvement of strategic policy planning is still in the priority list of PFM improvements.

3.3     Efficiency: Low

65.     The Project was essentially a technical assistance/capacity building operation, which, as
such, did not lend itself to an economic and financial analysis. Similar to other World Bank-
supported projects of this nature, the PAD did not contain a Net Present Value/Economic Rate of
Return or cost effectiveness calculation. However, other proxy measure of efficiency can be used
as indicators of efficiency of implementation, such as an assessment of time overruns, cost
overruns and the operating costs.

66.      A summary of original Approved Cost, Expenditure, and original and actual
implementation period is presented below. While the project implementation period was increased
by 140 %, the actual expenditure was only 5.6 % of the original project cost, indicating that
allocation efficiency for the project as a whole was very low. However, the results vary by
component. The low efficiency rating is largely due the failure of Component 2 on ‘Development
of an Integrated Public Financial Management System (PFMS)’, where the actual expenditure was
only 0.3 % of the original allocated cost. Under Component 1 on ‘Strengthening Institutional

                                                 17
Capacity and Operational Effectiveness’, actual expenditure was 103 % of the original allocation
and most of the planned activities under this component were completed. Under Component 3 on
‘Project Management’, the actual expenditure was 66 % of the original allocation despite an
increase of 140 % in the original project implementation period. This reflects efficient use of
resources as one would usually expect that project management expenditure, which primarily
comprise of PIU staff salaries and project operating costs, would correspondingly increase with
increase in the project implementation period. The major problem was that under Component 2 on
‘Development of an Integrated Public Financial Management System (PFMS)’, the actual
expenditure was only 0.3 % of the original allocated cost, whereas this component had been
assigned 95 % of the original allocated cost and was the backbone for strengthening PFM through
improving efficiency and transparency.

67.     A summary of achievement of end-of project targets of key performance indicators is
attached as Annex 3. Since the integrated PFMS could not be developed, most of the end-of-
project outcomes could not be attained. Since most end-of-project outcomes could not be achieved
and only 5.6 % of the original cost could be utilized, Efficiency is rated “Low”.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

68.      Overall Outcome Rating is assessed as Unsatisfactory taking into account the extent to
which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved,
efficiently. The PDO of strengthening PFM by improving operational efficiency and transparency
was and remains relevant in the context of the country challenges and priorities, country
partnership strategy, and ongoing development programs supported by the Bank and Donors. The
project’s design, however, was not fully relevant to the PDO as some activities did not directly
contribute to achievement of PDO, while project could have included additional activities –
notably on-going support to the e-Treasury system – that would have directly and significantly
contributed to the achievement of the PDOs and mitigated some of the risks identified at the design
stage.

69.      Of PFMP’s three PDO indicators, two were not achieved and one was only partially
achieved. Two of these indicators were explicitly linked to the development and operationalizing
of integrated PFMS and the formulation of the third implicitly assumed that efficiency gains would
come from the IT solution. Similarly, all but one of the seven intermediate indicators was linked
explicitly to the implementation of the PFMS. Annex 3 demonstrates that four of these
intermediate indicators were not achieved, two were partially achieved, and one was achieved,
with progress made in implementing reforms up to the point when the PFMS was required to
generate system outputs. Consequently, the project’s unsatisfactory rating is largely due to the
failure of PFMS procurement process.


                                                    18
70.      Unfortunately, use of alternative indicators to assess progress towards the project
objectives does not lead to a more favorable assessment. A comparison of 2005 and 2010 PEFA
assessments does point to improvements in a number of areas of cash management and financial
reporting but these are not directly attributable to the project. The modest improvements in
strategic alignment of budgeting occurred after the most recent PEFA assessment and so are not
captured. The PEFA and OBI assessments undertaken during the project implementation period
suggest that there has been no significant improvement in operational efficiency and transparency.
Indeed, the only area where it as possible to demonstrate an improvement in performance using
quantitative indicators relates to the area of internal controls as reflected in the performance of the
State Inspection Department.

71.     Similarly, at the level of inputs and outputs performance was unsatisfactory. The project
disbursed only 5.6 percent of original allocation in 140 percent of the originally allocated time.
While activities under component 1 on “Strengthening Institutional Capacity and Operational
Effectiveness” were largely implemented and made a modest contribution to reforms, the most
important output for the project, the PFMS, was not delivered.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

        (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender aspects, and Social Development:

72.      The project contributed to improvements in strategic alignment between budget and policy
priorities. State Budgets and forecasts for the MTBF periods were based on economic and social
development programs and national target programs. A system of monitoring and evaluation of
budget performance, based on Performance Program Budgeting (PPB) method, was developed in
2010. A group of indicators: resources, outputs, effectiveness and quality (outcomes) were used by
the MoF. These indicators sought to align budget allocations with the Economic and Social
Development Program. Guidelines on evaluation of budget program effectiveness were introduced
in 2011. The PPB methodology was used for the local budgets as well. To the extent that
Economic and Social Development Program was aimed at poverty reduction and social
development, this will have helped allocate resources to those programs having an impact on
poverty and social development.

73.      An assessment of actual poverty, gender and social development impacts is beyond the
scope of this ICR. The aggregate data presented in Figure 2 shows the deviation between the
original plan, revised plan and actual outturn. This suggests that improvements in PBB budgeting
have not necessarily been translated into improvements in budget outcomes though the extent to
which priority, poverty reduction programs and social sectors have been protected from these in-
year adjustment is unclear.

        (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening:

74.       The project contributed to institutional change and the strengthening of the PFM system.
New business processes were developed. These include: instructions on preparation of budget
requests; a methodology for the evaluation of budget program efficiency; a performance program
budgeting system; establishment of budget performance indicators; optimization of number of
budget programs; agreement of norms of sectoral fiscal capacity; systems for monitoring and
evaluation of effectiveness authorities exercised by local self-government; a new system for risk-
based planning of financial inspections; and, strategic alignment of budget and MTBF with policy
priorities are a few such institutional changes that are going to remain with the government and
strengthen their management public finances. New national accounting standards were developed
that confirm to international public accounting standards and will enable better reporting on
budgetary expenditures and revenues. In addition to these system reforms, the project established a
PIU as a unit of professional staff that is committed to reforms. It will act as a well-equipped unit
to facilitate any future reforms in the area of public financial management.

        (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts:

75.      Following the MoF and Bank decision not to support further upgrading of the e-Treasury
system, State Treasury decided to continue with this activity using state budget resources. Progress
has been made independently of the project. The State Treasury System is now linked to all state
treasuries enabling them to collect daily expenditure and revenue information. It has now
functionality in terms of improved commitment controls, cash management and accounting based
on unified accounting system largely compliant with GFS 2001 and IPSAS. The system still
constitutes that main financial management information system for all levels of government.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

76.   The risk to the development outcome as expressed in the PDO is negligible given that the
PDO was not achieved. The improvements in PFM business process that were achieved have been
                                                 20
embedded in regulatory framework, internal operating procedures and budget routines.
Consequently, these achievements are considered relatively robust. Whilst this progress is
sustainable, MoF has not yet developed the internal capacity to sustain the reform process and
continues to rely on external technical assistance to support the design and implementation of its
reforms. Ironically the failure of the PFMS procurement process has strengthened capacity in this
area, giving MoF staff and leadership a greater appreciation of the risks and challenges in
implementing a complex PFMS system. This experience will be valuable when the MoF proceeds
with the development of its PFMS capability.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry : Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.      The project was well aligned with the strategic priorities of the Government and the World
Bank as defined in the 2002 PEIR, the 2003 CAS for Ukraine covering the period 2004-2007, the
2004 CEM, the 2005 CAS Progress Report, and the 2006 PFR. Implementation of a modern
integrated PFMS that would serve as a backbone to all public expenditure management processes
and interlinked with the revenue collection systems was essential to the MoF’s PFM reform
agenda at the time of preparation of this Project. The project’s implementation arrangements were
designed to be flexible and well integrated with the client’s administrative structure.

78.      However, significant shortcomings in the project’s design adversely affected
implementation and monitoring. The PDO did not fully reflect project activities aimed at
improving the ‘effectiveness’ of PFM and the M&E framework was weak with PDO indicators
that did not adequately measure the PDOs, lacked key baseline and targets, and, the final outcome
and intermediate outcome indicators were not always well linked with each other and project
activities. The project design would have benefited from a more thorough stakeholder assessment
and political economy analyses, examining the impact of then recent changes in the institutional
arrangements in the sector. In particular, the project would have benefited from an assessment of
the risk associated with the exclusion of the existing treasury systems in the definition of
components and activities. A more thorough risk assessment and a more flexible approach to the
project might have led the MoF to include the upgrading of the treasury system as a risk mitigation
measure, pending the delivery of the integrated PFMS in end of 2012 as originally planned.

      (b) Quality of Supervision: Moderately Unsatisfactory

79.     Technical supervision was strong throughout the implementation of the Project. The task
team was knowledgeable and provided sound advice on technical specifications and international
best practices for the integrated PFMS and the PFM business processes. It provided high quality
and intense support during implementation with 13 supervision/implementation support missions
between February 2008 and October 2013. Missions were supplemented by 40 video-conferences
held during the project period to monitor progress and remove implementation bottlenecks. In
addition, the Senior Economist based in the Country Office in Kiev provided on-going guidance to
the PIU and the MoF. The supervision of financial and procurement aspects of the project was
carried out in a timely, diligent and thorough manner and were supported by local staff that
maintained a day-to-day dialogue. Most stakeholders noted the high quality support and
responsiveness provided by the Bank Task Team with an adequate mix of skills.

80.      Shortcomings in supervision relate to the limited use of the results framework for
monitoring, decisions related to the PFMS procurement process and inadequate consideration of
alternative designs in the face of implementation failure.

81.   The results framework was not used as an instrument for project monitoring and
management, and monitoring was inconsistent. PDO indicator # 2, for instance, in respect of 20
                                            21
percent reduction in time required to get necessary information for managerial decisions, did not
have a baseline and target values at the start of the project and it was not monitored throughout the
project. The first survey was undertaken in 2012 close to the original closing date. Since the
results framework was not used as a monitoring, the deficiencies of the framework were not
identified. When the results framework was amended during the 2012 restructuring, the changes
tied the results to implementation of the PFMS system. Presumably this intended to create further
leverage on the authorities for successful completion of the PFMS procurement process. This
decision was misguided. The authorities have felt little accountability for the implementation of
PFMS.

82.      Supervision decisions may have contributed to the failure of the procurement process for
PFMS. ICB1 and ICB2 proceeded smoothly through a two-stage process until an anonymous
complaint (attached as Annex 12) was received in respect of ICB1. This stated some bidders had
not complied with the technical requirements. The complaint did not allege corruption.
Nonetheless, the task team referred that complaint to the INT. Even if all facts averred in the
complaint were true, the task team could have advised the PIU to evaluate the bids keeping those
facts in mind and had the right to withhold the ‘no objection’ if the bid evaluation was not proper.
OPRC approved the procurement process with full knowledge of the on-going INT investigation.
However, senior management intervened and instructed the team to cancel ICB1 and ICB2 even
though INT had not concluded its investigation. INT subsequently found that there was no
corruption in this procurement process. However, one of the partners in the consortium that was
the lowest bidder was found guilty of corruption in another project in another sector, leading to its
temporary suspension. Had the task team not referred the matter to INT on that anonymous
complaint and contract awarded to that consortium, the work could have started. During the course
of contract implementation if the temporary suspension would have come its way, necessary legal
action could have been taken but the project would have moved on.

83.     Subsequently, the Bank and the authorities adopted single-stage procurement process for
ICB3. This decision was motivated by the limited time left under project and considered to be
moderate risk given the recent market consultation which had allowed firms to acquaint
themselves with the technical requirements. However, the risk did materialize, all bidders
submitted unresponsive technical bids because of a lack of understanding of the authorities’
requirements and the procurement process had to be cancelled. ICB3 was introduced during the
Restructuring in 2012 when the project was extended by 2 years. The team could have extended
the project for a longer period to allow for the procurement, supply and installation of FMIS
following another two stage process in order to minimize procurement risks.

84.      Finally, the Bank had ample evidence of the continued resistance from the Treasury with
regard to project design and its impact on project implementation but did not explore options as to
how the project could address Treasury’s concerns. The Bank realized fairly early on in
implementation that the Treasury had taken its own initiative to continue work on modernization
of the e-Treasury system resources. However, this was seen as a threat to the project and resisted
rather than an opportunity to mitigate implementation risks. When the project was restructured in
2012, but the Bank focused exclusively on efforts to procure PFMS and made no attempt to
provide parallel support to the modernization of the e-Treasury system, a system originally
developed with World Bank support. In the end, the project delivered neither support to treasury
modernization, nor an integrated PFMS.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance : Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.    Considering the shortcomings in project design and supervision, the overall Bank
Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.




                                                 22
    5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory

86.      The Ministry of Finance made some progress in implementing reforms during the project
period using the technical assistance provided by the project. The Budget Department succeeded in
developing new budget preparation instructions including preparation of mid-term budget
framework; linked the Budget with economic and social development program and PTM; and,
issued budget-performance indicators. The State Treasury developed the Unified Chart of
Accounts which was largely compliant with GFS 2001 and IPSAS and published the budget
execution data on the State Treasury website regularly. The State Financial Inspections
Department used the Risk-based Planning Methodology to improve efficiency of their inspections
despite the project’s failure to deliver the integrated PFMS.

87.     Shortcomings in Government performance relate to the management of inter-departmental
and inter-governmental relations.

88.      Undoubtedly, the factor that most affected the project was the differences in perspective
between the Ministry of Finance and the State Treasury. There was inherent tension between these
institutions regarding the appropriate approach to Treasury modernization, Treasury’s role, degree
of subordination to the Ministry and authority to take independent decisions and the relative merits
of the e-Treasury and proposed PFMS systems. These differences have not been fully resolved;
Treasury continues to operate with an unusual degree of autonomy considering its formal
integration in the Ministry structure. Treasury pursued development of the e-Treasury in parallel to
the proposed PFMS from 2009. When the Ministry explored alternatives to project closure in mid-
2014, Treasury proposed that part of the funds should be allocated to further investments in the e-
Treasury system and supporting hardware. From Treasury’s perspective e-Treasury remained a
viable system that met most of their functional requirements, while Ministry of Finance still
regarded e-Treasury as meeting only part of the institution’s information system needs and unable
to deliver functional integration that the project was intended to achieve.

89.     The Ministry of Finance has made some progress in strengthening its engagement with
other Government institutions, notably through improvements in the budget process. As per
Council of Ministers’ Resolution # 61, the Ministry of Economy should prepare macro- economic
forecasts, on the basis of which, the Ministry of Finance should prepare the macro-fiscal
framework, and the Revenue department should prepare its revenue projections. However, the
Ministry of Finance continues to work independently of key central institutions, using its own
analysis macro-economic analysis as the basis for its macro-fiscal framework and MTBF rather
than the estimates of the Ministry of Economy. This undermines the role of the Ministry of
Economy and hinders effective linkages between planning and budgeting functions.

   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.     The Ministry of Finance failed to provide strong leadership through the appointment of a
senior official authorized to make all project-related decisions until fairly late in project
implementation. When a first Deputy Minister was finally appointed as Project Director in 2013,
the Deputy Minister was unable to devote adequate time to project management issues. Project
management was characterized by lack of continuity, differences in views and lack of
understanding among component managers, all contributing to delays in project implementation.
The Project Manager changed eight times during a five year period due to political transitions and
the reorganization of Ministry of Finance in 2011, which saw changes in the project team
including coordinator, tender committee and component managers.

91.    Project start-up was delayed because the Ministry of Finance wanted to complete
improvements in PFM business processes under the first component before starting procurement of
the PFMS. At the urging of the Bank’s task team, the authorities eventually agreed to implement
both PFM reforms and the acquisition of the PFMS in parallel. After this slow start, reasonable
                                              23
progress was made until implementation was interrupted by the cancellation of the ICB1 and ICB2
and subsequent failure of ICB3. Procurement Management was rated moderately unsatisfactory in
the second half of the project because of these failures. Financial Management was rated
satisfactory throughout the project with timely submission of IFRs and audit reports. Unqualified
Audit Reports were submitted by auditors who did not raise any issue on internal control or
accountability issues.     However, other project management functions were moderately
unsatisfactory with performance deteriorating over time. Periodic progress reports were submitted
regularly but there were delays in measuring key performance indicators and key baseline
information was never collected. There is little evidence that the monitoring information was used
to guide project implementation. Overall the performance of implementing agency is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
         Unsatisfactory

92.     In view of the performance ratings of the government and implementing agency, the
overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned
93.    This assessment focuses on the lessons learned that are specific to the design and
implementation of projects supporting public financial management reforms and the development
of complex integrated public financial management information systems.

94.      Projects implemented in the context of institutional restructuring should address
change management requirements of such reforms. The implications of the integration of the
State Treasury and Ministry of Finance were not adequately addressed in the project design or
implementation arrangements. An assessment of the risks of institutional resistance would have
helped the authorities identify mitigation measures and develop an appropriate change
management strategy. At the very least, explicit treatment of these issues would have focused
attention on the behavior of the stakeholders, facilitated dialogue and provided as basis for
monitoring of progress in the integration process.

95.      Projects supporting the implementation of complex integrated financial management
information systems can mitigate the risk of IT failure by keeping the IT options open during
project implementation. If PRMP had supported Treasury in the continued development of the e-
Treasury system during project implementation, pending the final delivery of the PFMS solution,
the project would have contributed to the development of a partial IT solution even if PFMS failed.
This would have given continuity to Treasury modernization efforts and could possibly
strengthened Treasury engagement in the project and reduced institutional resistance. There were
several opportunities to integrate support for the e-Treasury system. The original project design
could have included a small e-Treasury component when it was clear that the e-Treasury system
would have to continue in operation for four years even in the most optimistic scenario for the
development of the PFMS. An e-Treasury component could also have been included in 2012
during the project restructuring when it was clear that the delivery of the PFMS solution would be
delayed by two to three years and procurement risks had already materialized. Future projects
should consider how to maintain IT options open during project implementation, thereby avoiding
putting ‘all the eggs in one basket’ and mitigating the risks of project failure.

96.     The procurement method for complex IT systems should be designed to minimize the
risk of procurement failure. A single-stage bidding process was selected for procurement of
PFMS in ICB3 to expedite completion of procurement process in the face of significant delays in
project implementation. This coincided with project restructuring when the project duration was
extended for two years. At this point it would have been relatively straightforward to extend the
project by three years or more to accommodate a lower risk but longer duration two-stage bidding
process. Where a single-stage bidding process is used, particular attention should be given to
                                                24
mitigation of the risk that bids will be technically unresponsive, such as through detailed
specifications and market consultations to ensure that prospective bidders are well informed.

97.      PDO Indicators for PFM reform projects should focus on the PFM outcomes that the
project seeks to deliver rather than the IT solution. PFM reform outcomes can be achieved by
improving the regulatory framework, business processes and institutional capacity independently
of the IT-enabled FMIS solution adopted. While an effective IT-enabled FMIS will support
improvements in business processes, it is not a necessary condition for successful reform.
Following this approach, PFM reform projects can achieve satisfactory outcomes even if the IT-
solution fails. For example, publication of the relevant documents on a website, information
centers and primary service delivery units can enhance budget transparency significantly even if
this data is not accessed directly from an integrated IT system.

98.      The sequencing of project activities should be agreed during preparation and made
explicit in project documentation. In the case of PFMP, the Ministry of Finance’s decision to
postpone the start of procurement process for PFMS under Component 2 until changes in PFM
business processes under Component 1 were completed led to an eight month delay in project
start-up. This could have been avoided if the sequencing of project activities had been agreed with
the authorities during preparation and appraisal.

    7. Comments on Issues raised by Borrower/Implementing
       Agencies/Partners
99.     The Borrower has submitted its Implementation Completion Report, a summary of which
is placed at Annex 8 to this report. The Borrower’s ICR does not raise issues that require a
response here.

Re: Obtaining of Grant for Preparation of the “Treasury System Project II”

Dear Mr. Barbone,

         Through this letter I have the pleasure of confirming that the Government of Ukraine has
launched the preparation of the proposed second Treasury Systems Project, the “Treasury Project
II“. The objective of the project is to improve the scope and institutional capacity of the Treasury
system and the associated legal framework and procedures developed under the first Treasury
project to enable the system to become a better instrument for budget execution and control and
cash management. The preparation of this project will be carried out in a participatory manner with
relevant stake holders, through the State Treasury of Ukraine, in close partnership with a World
Bank team.

         We expect this project to be financed, in part, though a World Bank Loan with possible
financing from other donors who are also involved in reforms of public sector institutions in
Ukraine. The Government and the Bank have agreed in principle that the follow-on project would
build on prior work done under the first Treasury systems project and extend the scope and
functionality of the Treasury system. The current system is Treasury centric. The new system will
enable easier access of information processed by the Treasury system for other partners in the
budget execution process, such as the MOF, the main budget fund administrators. It will also
implement improved analytical tools for information analysis to enable better usage of the
information provided by the Treasury system in all phases of budget management, namely, budget
preparation, budget execution and control and cash management. The project would also pursue
the introduction of International Accounting Standards across public sector entities financed from
the budget to assist Ukraine in its transition to the EU over the medium term.

         The project would provide financing for: (a) technical assistance for the design of the
enhanced system and associated regulatory framework, policies and procedures; (b) procurement
of the technology platform required for its implementation; (c) training Treasury, MOF and line
agency staff in its use and (d) for project management. The project cost is expected to be about $45
million.

         Through the World Bank we would like to kindly request a project preparation grant from
the Government of Japan to finance the needed technical assistance to prepare the project. The
activities the grant would cover are estimated to cost about $550,000 and include technical
consulting services to: (a) develop the overall functional requirements of the new Treasury
system; (b) develop technical specifications for the technology platform required for the
implementation, of the new system, and (c) support to grant administration and audit.

                                                33
        We would like to express our sincere thanks to the Government of Japan, in cooperation
with the World Bank, for their support to the reform of key public finance institutions and
procedures in Ukraine.


Sincerely,

                 Annex 5. Economic and Financial Analysis
         The Project was designed to support public sector financial management reforms and
related capacity building. Advisory support and investments envisaged under the Project aimed at
improving performance of key government institutions at the central and local levels in
implementing specific public finance management, execution, accounting, auditing as well as
human resources management tasks. Therefore, return of investments under the Project was, to a
large extent, in the form of better performing public institutions capable of employing financial
and human resources in an effective, transparent and accountable way.

       Major benefits of the Project, in providing the means to ensure effective prioritization and
implementation of budget allocations and greater transparency in government’s financial
management, also in strengthening instruments of fiscal control, are more difficult to quantify and
measure.

        Implementing the integrated PFMS and streamlining budget preparation and execution
procedures would result in efficiencies in government budgetary transactions. This would also
enable better control on the targeted use of government financial and human resources. Better cash
management would reduce idle balances in government accounts. More efficient execution of
budgetary transactions would reduce delays in payments and would eventually reduce the cost of
goods and services to the government.

         Most of project’s outcomes heavily depended on the development and operationalizing of
integrated PFMS. However, that could not be achieved due to failure of procurement process. The
end-of-project targets for indicators of operational efficiency and transparency of PFM could not
be achieved. From analysis of independent assessments like the PEFA and OBI, it was revealed
that there was no improvement in operational efficiency and transparency. The evidence rather
suggests that there was no change at all. The only change that occurred was in the area of internal
controls as reflected in the performance of the State Inspection Department.

         The project could disburse only $3.94 million, which was only 5.6 % of original
allocation. This too was achieved in 140 % of the originally allocated time. This was due to failure
to install integrated PFMS for which, 95 % of the original project cost was allocated. While
activities under component 1 on strengthening institutional capacity and operational effectiveness
were largely implemented, the last mile connectivity to the PFMS could not be established, thereby
not allowing those activities to produce desired outcomes.

        In view of the fact that only 6 % of projected investments could be made and the major
outcome of the installing PFMS was not achieved, which resulted on 2 out of 3 PDO indicators
and 4 out of 7 intermediate outcome indicators ‘not achieved’, the economic rate of return (ERR)
of the project would be deemed to be ‘very low’. The ICR team didn’t dwell upon calculating the
exact ERR, as it was not estimated at the appraisal stage at first place, owing to the complexity of
the project design.

                      Supervision Processes
         Project supervision was strong and effective, throughout the implementation of the
Project. The task team was highly knowledgeable of the required technical specifications and
international best practices for the integrated PFMS and the PFM business processes. They
provided excellent technical assistance to the government team during implementation. The
intensity of supervision and technical assistance was ‘very high’ with 13
supervision/implementation support missions held during February 2008 and October 2013. These
were supplemented by 40 video-conferences held during the project period to monitor progress
and remove implementation bottlenecks. In addition, the Senior Economist based in the Country
Office in Kiev provided necessary guidance to the PIU and the MoF. The details are as under:

(b) Staff Time and Cost:

        A total of 196 staff weeks was provided for implementation support and supervision
during project period. It peaked in FY2010 with 42 staff weeks, when the team was providing
support under Component 1, dealing with issues related with procurement of PFMS, and sorting
out differences with the Treasury. It tapered off slowly thereafter, and reached its lowest in FY
2013 when things were not moving on the procurement front of PFMS.

         Annex 8. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
        A Stakeholder Workshop was organized on June 17, 2015 at the World Bank office, from
1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, to hold consultations with stakeholders on the ICR findings and lessons
learned. A copy of the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report was shared with
government officials and other stakeholders from donors and civil society ahead of the Workshop.
The Bank team was led by Mr. Qimiao Fan, Country Director, and was attended by Mr. Arun
Arya, Senior Public Sector Specialist and the ICR Team Leader; Ms. Iryna Shcherbyna, Public
Sector Specialist; Ms. Lalita Moorty, Program Leader; Ms. Svetlana Budagovskaya, ex-Senior
Economist and a member of the task team. Mr. Oleksii Balabushko, Public Sector Specialist,
joined the workshop through audio connection from Washington DC. The Government’s side was
led by Deputy Finance Minister; who was joined by representatives of the Budget department,
State Fiscal Inspections Unit, Local Budget Department, Revenue Department, Project
Implementation Unit, Treasury Department, and Tax and Customs Department. Donors or Civil
Society representatives did not participate in the workshop despite invitation.

        At the opening of the workshop, the Country Director, Mr. Qimiao Fan said that ICR is an
important document for internal accountability in the Bank, which will be evaluated by the
Independent Evaluation Group of the Bank as well. We expect feedback from the government and
stakeholders in the ICR document to reach an agreement on findings and lessons learned. The
Project could not procure PFMS, but achievements are to be recognized. The PFM remains
important reform area and the World Bank remains ready to support that. The Bank would
continue to provide technical assistance on PFM. On whether there will be a new PFM project, we
want to hear from the government and will then review it formally. It has to be reviewed in terms
of the Country Partnership Framework, which will be launched in the next couple of months.

        The Deputy Finance Minister thanked the Bank staff at the country office and
headquarters who had worked hard towards preparing the ICR. He highlighted project’s
achievements despite the fact that the main objective of installing PFMS was not achieved. He
cited examples of preparation and implementation of Unified Chart of Accounts, Risk-based
Planning of State Financial Inspections Unit, Medium-Term Budget Framework, and Coordination
with World Bank, EU, and KFW on PFM reforms, etc. He said that this report will help in
developing efficient system of PFM and also other aspects of PFM like the budget
decentralization.

        The Country Director further intervened to say that what did not work and why it did not
work should inform future. We need very clear commitment from the government to make
changes in business processes to improve efficiency. We focus far too much on details of project
design. We should rather focus on the larger picture and political commitment. We intend to use
lessons learned from Ukraine and Maldova in Belarus. We need to focus on how to minimize risks
by using, as much as possible, “commercial off-the-shelf” software, rather than “custom-built”
software.

        Thereafter, a PowerPoint (attached) was presented by Mr. Arun Arya, ICR Team Leader
on the ICR findings, ratings and lessons learned from the Project. This was followed by a session
of questions, comments and suggestions from participants. After detailed deliberations, following
agreements were reached. It was agreed that with following changes, the ICR will be deemed to
have been concurred by the government.

   1. There was an agreement on all ICR ratings in regard to Outcomes, Risk to Development
      Outcomes, Bank Performance, and Borrower Performance.

   2. In respect of PDO Indicator # 3, while there was agreement on the assessment of “Partially
      Achieved”, the government recommended change in the text on assessment. This indicator
      was worded as “Increased transparency and reliability of public sector financial reporting
      through compliance with international accounting standards and alignment with EU
                                              41
    accession requirements”. The end of project target was that “National accounting
    standards are in use (via new PFMS)”. The assessment text recorded that “Nineteen
    national accounting standards based on IPSAS accrual standards have been prepared and
    approved. However, only seven of these standards have been introduced in transition to
    accrual accounting including reporting of financial assets and liabilities”. The
    government representatives pointed out that following nine, instead of seven, national
    regulations (accounting standards) in the public sector became effective from January 1,
    2015, and were in use:

        (1)   121 Fixed Assets (MoF Order Nr. 1202 as of October 12, 2010);
        (2)   122 Intangible Assets (MoF Order Nr. 1202 as of October 12, 2010);
        (3)   123 Inventory (MoF Order Nr. 1202 as of October 12, 2010);
        (4)   125 Changes in Accounting Estimates and Error Correction (MoF Order Nr.
              1629 as of December 24, 2010);
        (5)   127 Impairment of Assets (MoF Order Nr. 1629 as of December 24, 2010);
        (6)   128 Liabilities (MoF Order Nr. 1629 as of December 24, 2010);
        (7)   130 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates (MoF Order Nr. 1022 as of
              August 8, 2011);
        (8)   132 Employee Benefits (MoF Order Nr. 1798 as of December 29, 2011);
        (9)   133 Financial Investment (MoF Order Nr. 568 as of May 18, 2012).

    The text of assessment of PDO indicator # 3 will be modified accordingly.

3. In respect of Intermediate Outcome Indicator # 4, it was argued by the government that it
   should be assessed as “Achieved”, instead of “Partially Achieved”. This indicator required
   that “MoF, STSU and SFIU staff, and spending units (SUs) are trained on new legislation
   & process changes”. The end of project target for this indicator was:

             2 workshops for Spending Units (SUs) (200 participants)
             Training of 200 staff

    This indicator was rated as “Partially Achieved”, on the assessment that while SFIU staff
    was trained in risk based planning methodology, the staff of MOF, STSU, and SUs were
    not trained. However, during the workshop, it was clarified by the Manager, Project
    Implementation Unit (PIU) that:

            “2,456 staff of the MoF, the STS, and SFI was trained on the new methodology and
            features of the PFMS. The topics of the training were as follows: Suppression of
            Fraud and Corruption in PFM Sector; Automation of the control and revision work
            planning process on the basis of the evaluation of risks of financial violations by
            controlled institutions; accounting reform and modernization; Change
            management in the context of the SFI Reform; Practical implementation of the
            control and revision work planning process on the basis of the evaluation of risks
            of financial violations by controlled institutions; planning of the control and
            revision activities; Major risks in the performance of local budgets and their
            impact on planning control and revision work; Public sector accounting
            modernization training; Structure and contents of the chart of accounts in the
            public sector; Operation of a database for the aggregation of risks of probability of
            financial violations and its use for planning of risk-based control and revision
            activities; Practical aspects of performance of internal audit in the system of
            ministries, other central executive bodies; public internal financial control;
            Support to change management—organization of seminars, study tours and
            training courses”.
                                             42
    This has been recorded in the Government’s ICR as well. In view of the fact that 2,456
    staff was provided the desired training on new legislation and process changes, this
    indicator will be considered as “Achieved”.

4. In Para 89 of the ICR, following text is recorded:

           “The Ministry of Finance has made some progress in strengthening its engagement
           with other Government institutions, notably through improvements in the budget
           process. However, the Ministry of Finance continues to work independently of key
           central institutions, using its own analysis macro-economic analysis as the basis
           for its macro-fiscal framework and MTBF rather than the estimates of the Ministry
           of Economy. This undermines the role of the Ministry of Economy and hinders
           effective linkages between planning and budgeting functions”.

    The representatives of the Budget department pointed out that as per Council of Ministers’
    Resolution # 61, the Ministry of Economy prepares Macro Economic Forecasts, on the
    basis of which, the Ministry of Finance prepares its Macro-Fiscal Framework. The
    Revenue department too supported this assertion that their revenue projections were based
    on the macro-economic assessment prepared by the Ministry of Economy. The ICR team
    asked them to provide evidence in terms of a Macro Economic Assessments sent by the
    Ministry of Economy for 2-3 years in the project duration and explain how they were
    aligned with the Macro-Fiscal Framework prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The
    Budget department of the Ministry of Finance has since not been able to provide the
    desired evidence. Nevertheless, the text of Para 89 will be amended to acknowledge the
    existence of Council of Minister’s Resolution # 61 to this effect and its possible lack of
    compliance.

5. In Annex 9, Summary of Borrower’s report, following text is recorded regarding use of
   risk-based audit planning by State Financial Inspections Unit (SFIU) on Page 44 of the
   ICR:
              “Risk-based Audit Planning Methodology was developed and approved by the
              State Financial Inspectorate. In order to enable the Methodology an automated
              database was created, and the necessary procedures were introduced into the
              business processes of the Inspectorate”.

    The representatives of the SFIU pointed out that an automated database has not yet been
    created for the risk-based audit planning methodology. It was agreed that this text will be
    accordingly amended.

6. In reference to Section 2.1.3 on ‘Adequacy of Government Commitment’ and Section
   2.1.4 on ‘Assessment of Risks’, as contained in Para 23 and 24 of the ICR respectively, the
   representative of the Treasury Department pointed out that Treasury and the Ministry of
   Finance have very good relations now and the former considers itself a part of the Ministry
   of Finance. The Treasury’s initiative to build e-Treasury system should not be viewed as
   going against the wishes of, or working in parallel with, the Ministry of Finance. It was for
   imperative upon the Treasury Department to upgrade an obsolete system which was
   putting its operations to risks, and it was done with funds provided by the Ministry of
   Finance. It was agreed to reflect these sentiments of Treasury department in the Annex 8
   Stakeholders’ Workshop Report and Results. However, this won’t change the narrative of
   the ICR Report that there was a significant shift of power from the State Treasury to the
   MoF during project implementation, which together with inability of the Project to directly
   support the Treasury’s modernization efforts, inevitably caused resentment and possibly
   generated passive and active institutional resistance to reforms.

       I.       Project Management:

1. From the World Bank’s Side

        During the preparation and implementation of the project there were two TTLs of project.
Since preparation of the project till October, 2013 Mr. Cem Dener has been the TTL of the project.
Since October 2013 till the end of the project Mr. Ivor Beazley was the TTL of the project. During
preparation and implementation of the project there have been regular monitoring activities
conducted to follow the project progress and all stakeholders were involved into the process.

2. From the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine

         The MoF assigned a Deputy Minister of MoF lead the project. There were eight Project
Directors during the project lifetime. Also, in order to implement the project, there were
established an Inter-agency Working Group and an Administrative Management and Procurement
Support Group (AMPSG) were established. An Action Plan on Implementation of the PFM
System Modernization Strategy was approved by a Joint Order of the Ministry of Finance, the
State Treasury and the Main Control and Revision Directorate #25/13/18 dated January 16, 2008.


3. Project Delays

       Extraneous factors affected implementation path of the project which resulted in delays in
implementation of the project. The factors were as follows:

            -        ratification process of the Loan Agreement by the Verkhovna Rada6 of Ukraine
                     took seven months;
            -        clarification of the initiative of the State Treasury of Ukraine on updating its IT
                     infrastructure that was not aligned with the project objectives took four months;
            -        two restructuring took place due to an INT investigation and low quality of
                     submitted bids resulted in extension of the project deadline.

    II.       Project Achievements

    1. Component 1 - Strengthening institutional capacity and operational effectiveness.

       a.      Methodology on mid-term budgeting for key spending units of the state budget
was developed and piloted in two ministries. The methodology was approved by the MoF’s Order
#687 dated June 6, 2012, and it has been utilized by main spending units for mid-term forecasting.

         b.      Methodological Recommendations for evaluation of Budget Program Efficiency
was developed. Main spending units can apply the Methodological Recommendations to evaluate
the efficiency of budget programs.

       c.       Analysis of local budgeting was conducted. Based on the findings, proposals were
made on the following area:
               the methodology on defining the norms of sectorial fiscal capacity;
               the practical elaborations to improve a formula on inter-governmental transfers
                distribution.

       The developed Methodology was in line with the norms of the new versions of the Budget
and Tax Codes.

      d.     Public Sector Accounting was aligned with the international accounting standards.
Recommendations on the following areas were developed:

                implementation of public sector accounting reforms in line with IPSAS standards;
                development of new forms of financial statements of budget-funded institutions
                 and budget performance reports;
                development and practical implementation of unified chart of public sector
                 accounts in accordance with requirements of international standards and the IMF
                 GFSM 2001 harmonized with the budget classification;
                development and implementation of the Public Sector General Ledger.

        Manual on application of national public sector accounting policies (standards) was
developed. Based on the recommendation a new economic classification, which is largely aligned
with requirements of IMF GFS 2001, was approved by Order of the MoF #1738 dated December
26, 2011. In 2012, the public sector accounting policies (standards) were approved by the MoF’s
Order, and the Public Sector Chart of Accounts were approved by MoF’s Order #1203 dated
December 31, 2013.

        e.     Analysis of budget revenue forecasting system was conducted, and Methodology
on Budget Revenue Forecasting was developed. The Methodology incorporated legislative
changes envisaged in the new version of the Budget Code. The Methodology improved accuracy
of revenue forecasting, and allowed identify interrelationship of certain economic indicators,
permitted to monitor linkages between macroeconomic indicators and budget revenues.

        Due to the improved accuracy of the revenue forecasting, a decision was made to apply the
gained knowledge to improve eleven tax revenue forecasting methods. As a result, MoF is working
on improvement of the developed methods.

        Due to the project delays and potential overlap with another project, a decision was taken
to annul the project activities on debt management system. Finally, the MoF developed a
methodology of debt management and legislation changes with support of technical assistance
projects financed by other donors.

        f.      Risk-based Audit Planning Methodology was developed and approved by the
State Financial Inspectorate. In order to enable the Methodology an automated database was

                                                45
created, and the necessary procedures were introduced into the business processes of the
Inspectorate.

        g.        Format of a report on internal audit results, manual on its compilation, and
structure of the analytical information of the report were developed.

        h.      Methodology on documenting results of control measures to document non-receipt
of revenues by budget was developed. Proposals were made on the automation of the process of
formation, consolidation and summarizing the status of budget receipts.

         i.      2,456 staff of the MoF, the STS, and SFI was trained on the new methodology and
features of the PFMS. The topics of the training were as follows: Suppression of Fraud and
Corruption in PFM Sector; Automation of the control and revision work planning process on the
basis of the evaluation of risks of financial violations by controlled institutions; accounting reform
and modernization; Change management in the context of the SFI Reform; Practical
implementation of the control and revision work planning process on the basis of the evaluation of
risks of financial violations by controlled institutions; planning of the control and revision
activities; Major risks in the performance of local budgets and their impact on planning control and
revision work; Public sector accounting modernization training; Structure and contents of the chart
of accounts in the public sector; Operation of a database for the aggregation of risks of probability
of financial violations and its use for planning of risk-based control and revision activities;
Practical aspects of performance of internal audit in the system of ministries, other central
executive bodies; public internal financial control; Support to change management—organization
of seminars, study tours and training courses.


    2. Component 2 - Development of an Integrated Public Financial Management System.


         a.      ICB-1 and ICB-2 procurement process was launched in mid-June 2010. However,
in 2012 due to the Bank’s investigation in another project, and uncertainties related to the
timeframe of the investigation, the Bank informed the MoF that it was unable to endorse the ICB-1
evaluation results. Moreover, in order to avoid the risk of implementing an obsolete system due to
longer than expected ICB processes and considerable legal and institutional changes that took
place over 2010-2011, a joint decision was taken to cancel the ICB-1 procurement procedure, and
undertake a second-level Project restructuring - without altering Project objectives. In order to
avoid further delays due to unforeseen circumstances, the restructuring revised key activities under
the component by merging two ICBs into one, and re-announcing the ICB-3 procurement process
in the form of single-stage bidding.

         b.       An International Consultant was hired to assist the MoF in preparing
documentation of the ICB-3. ICB-3 development process was launched simultaneously with the
Project restructuring in April 2012. The ICB-3 combined software development and hardware
installment into one package. The procurement procedure was launched in early August 2012. The
evaluation of the received bids revealed substantial deviations between the received bids and
technical and functional requirements of the bidding documents, and the non-compliance of bid
proposals with the required qualifications. It was confirmed by the international consultant that the
quality of received bids were low, and there were substantial risks related to the inability of the
bidders to implement the contract. In late January 2013, the Bank accepted MoF’s decision to
reject all three bids based on the information provided in the Bid Evaluation Report dated January
2, 2013.

        c.      In March 2013 a joint decision was made to restructure the Project again to enable
implementation of an FMIS by launching another ICB exercise (ICB-4). In line with restructuring
conditions to continue the project, a consultancy firm to support ICB-4 procurement process was
                                                46
hired to assist the MoF in improving functional and technical requirements of the bidding
documents, particularly the firm assisted the MoF in eliminating discrepancies between the MoF
requirements and capacity of proposed standard FMIS software, and in assessing bid proposals.

         d.       Taking into account the lessons learned as a result of ICB-3, and in order to
properly evaluate proposed ICT solutions, and to ensure visual demonstration of the proposed
software solutions ICB-4 should have been a two-stage bidding procedure. In order to provide
more flexibility to bidders, the country-specific qualification requirements should have been lifted
at the bidding stage. A section of bidding documents on technical requirements was published on
the MoF’s web site as an invitation for potential bidders to provide comments and proposals on
project specifications at the beginning of development of the updated bidding documents. It was
expected that this exercise would reduce the number of complaints and delays for clarifications.
The procurement procedure started in mid-August 2013. A refined First-stage Bid Evaluation
Report was updated according to the Bank’s comments, and sent to the Bank in February 2014. In
early March 2014, in order to avoid the risk of unforeseen customization issues after the contract
award, the Bank provided comments on the second-stage bidding documents in terms of clear
formulation of the off-the-shelf software package definition which could have resulted in delays
and increased costs of the contract. In March 2014, when the first stage bidding was almost
completed, the procurement process was suspended. It was associated with several letters from the
State Treasury Service on potential overlaps between the E-Kazna system commissioned into the
commercial operation by the Treasury Service and the treasury module envisaged in the bidding
documents of the ICB-4. Therefore, in order to utilize the existing domestic solutions, several
options were considered including: reduction of the ICB-4 scope at the second stage of the bidding
process; initiation of a new ICB-5 process; and initiation of a new project.

        In mid-April 2014 due to the complicated economic situation in Ukraine, and the urgent
need to cut state budget expenses, the MoF requested the Bank to reduce the amount of Loan, and
submitted a proposal on restructuring the current project or initiating a new project. Both proposals
were associated with waiving of the off-the-shelf software solution, and relying on the existing
treasury system with some upgrades. The first option proposed by the MoF was on partial
cancellation of the loan with reduction in the amount of $20 million, and investment of the
remaining $26 million into the large-scale upgrade of the existing treasury system. The second
option was associated with implementation of a $11.8 million project involving less ambitious
upgrade of the treasury system. The Bank considered both options, and in late July 2014 the Bank
informed that none of these two proposals could be supported by the Project, because the proposed
solutions were insufficiently aligned with the Project Development Objectives. The Bank stated
that there were only two options: either to proceed with the ICB-4 procurement process, or to
cancel the balance of the loan and close the Project. Since the ICB-4 process could have
substantially exceeded the lifetime of the project, making it impossible to utilize the project funds,
in October 2014 the MoF initiated a partial cancellation of the Loan and closure of the Project.

        On October 28, the Bank notified the MoF on the amendment to the Loan Agreement and
partial cancellation of the loan in the amount of $46,056,830. On October 31, 2014 the
amendments to the Loan Agreement and the partial loan cancellation were signed by the MoF

    3. Component 3 - Project Management

         a.       The purpose of this component was to ensure timely and efficient allocation of
resources, to carry out project procurement, financial management, and audit activities, to monitor
and evaluate the implementation and to interact with all local and international entities involved in
project execution. For these purposes several consultants were hired, who became members of the
AMPSG. Three translators were hired to ensure translation of bidding documents from Ukrainian
into English. The project financial reports were audited by an independent audit. Seven MoF staff
participated in training in Turin on the World Bank consultant’s selection rules and practical skills
in preparing requests for proposals, bidding documents, consultants’ bid evaluation methodologies.
                                                 47
    III.    Comparison of Target vs Actual Performance Indicators

         Positive achievements are associated with the Component 1 indicators - strengthening of
the institutional capacity of the MoF, the STS, and the SFI.

    IV.     Evaluation of Financial Resources by Source

         Several Donors co-financed project preparation activities. The Government of Japan (TF
054609) provided grant funds in the amount of $673 500 to assess institutional capacity and
functional efficiency of the PFM agencies, and develop a Concept Note of the project, and a
System Design Document, and Detailed Functional Requirements of the integrated PFMS. The
Government of the Netherlands (TF090722) provided grant funds in the amount of EUR 177,056
for proper completion of the Project preparation and covering the Project needs during the delay in
effectiveness.

        According to the World Bank’s Project Appraisal Document, the Project’s budget was $65
million, including $50 million provided as a loan by the Bank and $15 million co-financed by the
Government of Ukraine.

    V.      Evaluation of the Project Impact on the Social and Economic Development of
            Ukraine and the Relevant Sector or Region

        Adoption of new versions of the Budget and Tax Codes in 2010 contributed in
strengthening the MoF’s institutional capacity. The Budget Code introduced a new mechanism of
mid-term budget forecasting focused on strategic priorities. According to Article 21 of the Code,
the MoF based on the Government’s Programs, and economic and social development forecasts,
and state special-purpose programs, with the participation of the Ministry of Economic
Development and Trade, the National Bank of Ukraine, and main spending units shall develop
budget forecast for two budgeting periods following the planning period.

         Implementation of the performance budgeting (PTM) was an important issue in ensuring
the efficiency of the use of budget funds over the last years. The Code identified budget programs,
their implementing agencies, passports and results indicators as PTM components. The Code also
paved the legislative way for the implementation of the program-target method and mid-term
budget planning at the local level.

        Reduced role of the central state in providing regions with funds for their development and
simultaneous creation of opportunities for independent revenue generation, and efficient and
balanced development of regions has become an important achievement of the fiscal and tax
reforms for local authorities.

        In order to make public sector financial statements transparent and accurate, national
public sector accounting and financial reporting policies (standards) were developed in accordance
with requirements of IPSAS standards.

        Under Article 28 of the Budget Code, the MoF shall publish information on monthly,
quarterly and annual performance of the state budget on its official web site, while the State
Treasury Service shall publish monthly, quarterly and annual reports on the state budget execution
on its official web site. In addition, local state administrations and local self-government bodies
shall publish information on local budgets, including decisions on local budgets and quarterly
reports on their performance. The information about the performance of the State Budget and local
budgets (other than budgets of villages and towns) must be published in certain newspapers by
March 1 of the year following the reporting year.


                                                48
       Main spending units shall disclose and publish information about their budget at the level
of budget programs and indicators according to the format approved by Order of the MoF #1489 of
December 1, 2010, “On Approval of Requirements for, and Forms of, the Public Presentation of
the Budget Information by Main State Budget Spending Units”.

         Development of internal financial control system in accordance with international
standards is pursued in accordance with the State Internal Financial Control Development
Concept. The SFI is one of the authorized bodies to implement European models of the internal
control and internal audit. The priority activities of the SFI during years 2010 and 2011 according
to the Concept focused on development and approval of regulatory framework harmonized with
European standards for subsequent implementation of domestic internal control and internal audit
state authorities. While small amount of funds spent on this issue, the Project impact on Ukraine’s
social and economic development is quite substantial.

       Considering further improvement of PFM legal framework as well as the necessity to
implement certain EU Directives on accounting, audit, taxation, customs issues, and trade
promotion the prospective to implement a modern integrated FMIS still remains relevant.

        However, the main objective of the Project—building a modern integrated PFM system
being the core element of all public spending management processes and merging the entire
budgeting cycle on a single information platform under a single system of control, and supporting
the fiscal planning, budgeting, State Treasury Service, debt management, accounting and audit
improvement measures—was not achieved. As a result, this slowed down implementation of
measures related to strategic items of the modernization and development of the PFM system, and
forced the MoF to search new sources of funds to develop a modern information system or to
develop dedicated systems to support efficient and sustainable public finance planning and
management.

        In order to implement the PFM reform activities the implementation of the Project was
focused on the following reform areas:

               consolidating the PFM by improving operational efficiency and transparency by
                means of strengthening institutional capacity of the MoF, the State Treasury
                Service and the State Financial Inspectorate;
               development of new methodology and procedures in the field of the PFM;
               improvement of the public finance management system on the basis of state-of-
                the-art solutions in the field of ICT.

        Unfortunately, the main objective of the Project defined as building an integrated public
finance management system on the basis of state-of-the-art solutions in the field of information
and communication technologies has not been attained.

         The Project implementation was affected negatively not only by factors beyond MoF’s
control, such as the Bank’s internal investigations or low quality of bidding documents, but also by
frequent Project Leader replacements (8 project leaders over the implementation period).
Differences in views among component managers and lack of understanding among them also
contributed to delays in project implementation and resulted in the cancellation of the FMIS
procurement procedure.

         Success of such projects requires MoF’s ownership, particularly regular and ongoing
attention of a Minister during implementation of the project, and appointment of a responsible
officer authorized to make all project-related decisions. In addition, establishment of a dedicated
project implementation unit which reports directly to the project leader would also contribute to
more efficient project implementation.



                                                49
        In general, the Project implementation is deemed unsatisfactory, because its main
outcome—a new installed FMIS which supposed to substantially improve the automation of
business processes by supporting improved financial control, higher quality and timeliness of
information flows, and larger transparency—has not been achieved.

        The Project cancellation had a minor negative impact on the STS operations, as it
implemented E-Kazna solution, which almost fully covers functionality of the Treasury module
envisaged in the ICB-4. Implementation of an integrated FMIS is still an important issue for the
MoF, which will enable automation of many budget processes. Therefore, preparation of a new
project on building a modern PFM system and e-governance development remains an important
reform agenda for the MoF, the STS and the SFI.


    VI.     Evaluation of the Work (Measures) Implemented under the Project at the
            Expense of the International Technical Assistance

          The Project preparation was funded with grants of the Government of Japan (USD
673,500) and the Government of the Netherlands (EUR 177,056). The project preparation stage
included important Project development activities, including the functional analysis of the MoF,
the identification of changes required to improve the national system for the implementation of
reforms in the field of PFM, including development of system design and technical specifications.

        MoF coordinated donor assistance in the field of the PFM to avoid duplication of technical
assistance, and deliver the highest result for the Government of Ukraine with limited resources. A
Donor Assistance Coordination Group was established as one of the Project implementation
mechanisms to co-ordinate activities of the Project with other technical assistance projects.

          VII. Evaluation of Environmental Protection Measures Implemented under the
Project
          No environmental protection activities (measures) were planned within the scope of the
Project implementation.

      Business process #1
      Providing services to spending units (recipients of budget funds) and making other
payments.

        Objective.
        Determine the amount of time required to make managerial decisions in providing services
to spending units (recipients of budget funds), other customers, and making other payments.

        Brief description of the business process.
        One of the main functions carried out by the STSU is cash and settlement servicing of
spending units (recipients of budget funds) (hereinafter, the “SU(RBF)”. The services are provided
to spending units according to the Operations Process Regulations. Generally, the process of
providing services to the spending units includes several interrelated technological processes.

        Results of measurements in 2013.
        During the 2013 settlement servicing administrators (recipients) budget funds were carried
out based on the Software AS "Budget - Expenditures." The determination the baseline time to
make settlement services spending units in 2012 was also carried out based on of this software.

        At the same time, in December 2013 SCSU completed upgrading the software and
implemented АS «E-Budget». Commercial operation at SCSU and its territorial bodies АS «E-
Budget» was launched January2, 2014. As a result, the amount of time to perform settlement
services SU has started to decrease. The actual results of the implementation of АS «E-Budget»
and their influence on the amount of time taken by the various business processes in SCSU will be
determined by results of 2014.

         The results of measurements characterize the average amount of time spent at 2013 in the
STSU departments to open accounts and perform settlements for one weighted average client. It
was assumed that the said client operated properly observing the budget legislation. Thus, in
determining the amount of time required to provide services to and make payments of spending
units (budget funds recipients), the amount of time required to perform operations/actions
stipulated by the effective legislation in the event the SUs(RBFs) are found not to comply with the
legislation was not taken into consideration.

        The results of the survey are summarized in Appendix А. The amount of time for an
operation in para. 3.1. is defined as a maximum value, but it can be reduced as the case maybe
depending on different numbers of supporting documents provided by the spending units.

        Business process #2
        The time necessary for carrying out of one transaction for preparation of reports
(consolidated reports) on execution of the state budget, consolidated budget and consolidated
reports of key spending units.

        Objective.
        Determine time required to conduct a single operation when preparing reports.

        Brief description of the business process.
        Reporting on the execution of the State Budget of Ukraine (the budgets of the government-
funded institutions) includes financial and budget reports.

        Budget reporting reflects the progress in budget execution and contains information in
terms of budget classification.

        Financial and budgetary reports on execution of the State Budget of Ukraine are based on
aggregates derived from the main offices of the State Treasury Service of Ukraine in the
Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, cities of Kyiv and Sevastopol, and reports and
information received from independent subdivisions of the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, as
well as individual data on the reports of spending units (recipients of budget funds). The forms of
financial and budgetary reports are approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine #
1774 dated 12.28.2011.

        The procedure for drafting reports on the execution of the state budget, frequency and
general requirements for the reporting disclosures are determined by the regulations of the State
Treasury Service of Ukraine developed under the provisions of the Budget Code of Ukraine, the
Provision on the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, and other effective regulations.

        Reporting on execution of the State Budget of Ukraine shall be operating, monthly,
quarterly, and annual. Currently, the State Treasury Service of Ukraine prepares operative reports
on daily, weekly, and monthly basis, as well as each decade.

         The reports on execution of the consolidated estimates are submitted by the key spending
units to the State Treasury Service of Ukraine. Consolidated financial and budgetary reports of the
key spending units (presently, 93 spending units) contain information on all business transactions
performed that were accounted for.

        Calculation of the time required to conduct a single operation to create reporting forms for
reporting or verify one report of a key spending unit is provided in Appendix B.

        It should be noted that depending on the complexity of forms or issues that arose during
the preparation of reports, the time to be spent can vary greatly.

        The results of the measurements in 2013.
        Whereas the preparation of annual reports on budget execution will take place in February
and March 2014, during the inspection it was carried out by measuring the time operations are
performed in the preparation of monthly, quarterly reports (summary reports) on the state budget
and consolidated budget summary reports main spending units, and timely reporting of budget
execution.
        According to the results of the survey and implementation of measurement should be noted
that the compilation of the above statements shall be subject to the requirements of existing
regulations on the use of existing software and as a result, the amount of time to complete a
transaction when forming accountability has not been changed.

        Business process #3.
        Planning of control and auditing measures by the State Financial Service of Ukraine.

        Objective.
        Determination of the time required to make a decision on the selection of sites for the
formation of a plan of the main guidelines of control and revision work of Ukrainian SFI.

         Brief description of the business process.
         Planning of control measures involves compiling of the following:
                 plan of the main guidelines of control and revision work of Ukrainian SFI and its
territorial bodies prepared for a calendar year (hereinafter, the “Plan”);
                 plans of control and revision work of SFIU and its territorial bodies prepared for
each quarter (hereinafter, the “Plan for a quarter”).
         
         The SFI prepares and, in agreement with the MoF, submits, by December 1 of the current
year, to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine the draft plan of the main guidelines of control and
revision work of SFI and its territorial bodies. The plan is approved before December 20 of the
current year.

         Based on the Plan of the main guidelines of control and revision work, quarterly Plans of
control and revision work of SFI and its territorial bodies are developed; those plans include other
issues regarding the control and revision work within the competence of SFIU.

        The main grounds for the inclusion of activities to the plans of control and revision work
are:
            a) the laws, regulations and orders of the President of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers
of Ukraine, orders of the Ministry of Finance that do not require immediate execution without
being included in the plans;
            b) law enforcement agencies, businesses entities and individuals addressing regarding
the audits and inspections that could be performed routinely;
            c) proposals of the Accounting Chamber, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic
Development, STS, State Customs Service, and Treasury adopted by the SFI for execution;
            g) initiative sowed by the SFI and its territorial bodies based on the different criteria.

        To form the draft annual plan of the main guidelines of control and revision work, the
SFIU prepares requests sent to all stakeholders involved in the public finance management,
including the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and central executive authorities (State Tax Service,
State Customs Service, State Service for Financial Monitoring, State Treasury Service of Ukraine,
etc.).

         The plan is formulated by the Department of planning and analysis of control and revision
work of the Department of organizational work of the State Financial Inspectorate based on
proposals received by the SFIU from the concerned central executive bodies, as well as based on
the suggestions of the relevant sectoral SFIU departments generated with reference to the
legislatively established criteria.

         After preparation, the draft Plan is submitted to the sectoral departments of the State
Financial Inspectorate (6 departments, overall) and the audit department for processing and
suggestions. After receiving the responses from these departments regarding the draft annual plan
of the main guidelines of control and revision work of the SFI and its territorial bodies as required
by the legislative drafting technique, the draft act of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on
approval of the Plan is prepared, which is submitted to the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine for
further submission to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine for approval.
         The Department of planning and analysis of control and revision work of the Department
of organizational work of the State Financial Inspectorate, formulates a quarterly Plan of control


                                                 65
and revision work of the SFIU with reference to the proposals of the relevant sectoral SFIU
departments.

         Proposals for the formulation of the quarterly Plan are submitted for approval of the
sectoral departments and audit department.

          With reference to the proposals of the SFIU, the draft quarterly plan is submitted to the
SFI in the regions (27 regional SFIs) to formulate their own quarterly plans and update the lists of
entities by topics communicated by Ukrainian SFI units.

        Based on information received, the SFIU structural units specify the list of entities subject
to inspection when changing the topic of a control measure.

        The results of the measurements in 2013.
        The process of planning of audit activities of public financial service of Ukraine takes
place in accordance with regulatory laws. Fundamental changes in the planning process in 2013,
compared to the previous period have not taken place.

         At the same time, it should be noted that in 2013 a qualitative change in the process of
planning control and auditing work has begun. These changes are associated primarily with the
introduction of a new approach to planning control and revision work and selection of control
objects.

        The methodological framework for the implementation of the new approach was
developed in 2010 in the framework of the component " Improving coordination of public internal
financial control" The objective of this component was to develop proposals to improve
approaches to planning control and revision work by introducing a mechanism for selecting control
objects for inspection and audit risk-based probability assumption of financial irregularities.
According to the results of its implementation of a draft methodology storage was developed,
mixing and use of information for risk assessment and planning of the State Financial Inspection
SFIU risk-based.

         Based on this methodology the State Financial Inspection concept was developed risk-
selection control objects to control and plan revision work of State Financial Inspection of Ukraine
and its territorial bodies, that was approved by the Methodological Council Meeting Minutes SFIU
on April 23, 2012 № 7. According to the approach to planning control and revision work and
selection of control objects based on financial risk assumption violations was implemented.

        The appropriate approach provides a preliminary analysis of financial - economic activity
of control objects by results of which only in case of a significant amount of risk operations
decisions are taken on the inclusion of the entity to the relevant plan. The respective approach can
reduce the number of ineffective conducting audits to control objects with a low risk. The result of
these concerted attempts SFIU has become the reduce number of inspected objects. However,
reduce the number of control measures while the orientation of state financial control to cover most
risky areas for large volumes of financial flows increased the effectiveness of control measures
conducted by SFIU and its territorial bodies. As a result, the amount of identified financial
irregularities that led to the loss per each tested object has increased.

       Thus the process of selecting objects for monitoring risk-based employees of the
department of planning and analysis of control and revision work is carried out by SFIU with
manual processing of materials using existing software capabilities. In this context, the quality
improvement of planning control and auditing activity of SFIU did not affect the reduction of the
amount of time during this activity.

       At the same time, in accordance with paragraph. 1, article 2 of the Decree of the President
of Ukraine 05.24.2013 № 307/2013 "On measures to ensure the implementation of local state
administrations of executive power in the relevant territory". Project Plan Control and audit
                                              66
activities should be coordinated with the local administrations that have affected the completion
time of its formation.

        The results of measurements of time are given in Appendix C. The amount of time spent
on the planning control and auditing activity of SFIU per each quarter is given.

        Formulation of revenue forecasts in preparing the budget by the Ministry of Finance.

       Objective.
       Determine the amount of time required to make managerial decisions in forecasting
revenues of the state and consolidated budgets.

       Brief description of the business process.
       The initial basis and an important element of budget calculations are reasonable
macroeconomic and macro-financial projections, in the absence of which, first of all, in terms of
income and expenses, the budget cannot be accurately prepared. The peculiarity of the modern
budget process is that, in accordance with Art. 21 of the Budget Code, the Ministry of Finance of
Ukraine provides drafting the state budget for the next year and formulating budget forecast for
two budget periods following the planned one.

         Revenue forecast is prepared in several versions: baseline scenario, which assumes the
continuation of current fiscal and budget policy for the medium term, as well as optimistic and
pessimistic scenarios involving tax and budget reforms, including significant internal and external
risks. Revenues of draft budget are developed based on budget, tax and other legislation. Revenues
are generated by each code of budget classification and in terms of sources (general and special
funds).

         The basic stages and amount of time required for each stage of preparation of the forecast
of the state and consolidated budget revenues are presented in Appendix D.

       The results of the measurements in 2013.
       The amount of time to preparation of the revenue forecasts in the budget by the Ministry of
Finance has not been changed in 2013.
