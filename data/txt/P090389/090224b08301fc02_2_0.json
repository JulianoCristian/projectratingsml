{"cdata!": "The Public Finance Modernization Project\n            for Ukraine had an unsatisfactory outcome with negligible to\n            development outcome, and moderately unsatisfactory\n            performance by both, the Bank and the borrower. The lessons\n            learned were: (1) Projects implemented in the context of\n            institutional restructuring should address change management\n            requirements of such reforms. The implications of the\n            integration of the State Treasury and Ministry of Finance\n            were not adequately addressed in the project design or\n            implementation arrangements. (2) Projects supporting the\n            implementation of complex integrated financial management\n            information systems can mitigate the risk of IT failure by\n            keeping the IT options open during project implementation.\n            If PRMP had supported Treasury in the continued development\n            of the e-Treasury system during project implementation,\n            pending the final delivery of the PFMS solution, the project\n            would have contributed to the development of a partial IT\n            solution even if PFMS failed. This would have given\n            continuity to Treasury modernization efforts and could\n            possibly strengthened Treasury engagement in the project and\n            reduced institutional resistance. (3) The procurement method\n            for complex IT systems should be designed to minimize the\n            risk of procurement failure. A single-stage bidding process\n            was selected for procurement of PFMS in ICB3 to expedite\n            completion of procurement process in the face of significant\n            delays in project implementation. This coincided with\n            project restructuring when the project duration was extended\n            for two years. At this point it would have been relatively\n            straightforward to extend the project by three years or more\n            to accommodate a lower risk but longer duration two-stage\n            bidding process. (4) PDO Indicators for PFM reform projects\n            should focus on the PFM outcomes that the project seeks to\n            deliver rather than the IT solution. PFM reform outcomes can\n            be achieved by improving the regulatory framework, business\n            processes and institutional capacity independently of the\n            IT-enabled FMIS solution adopted. (5) The sequencing of\n            project activities should be agreed during preparation and\n            made explicit in project documentation. This could have been\n            avoided if the sequencing of project activities had been\n            agreed with the authorities during preparation and appraisal."}, "docdt": "2015-06-29T08:51:04Z"}
