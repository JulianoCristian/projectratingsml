                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank team provided project supervision by means of regular video conferences held on a monthly basis. In December (2013) and January (2014) the Ministry completed
                         the evaluation of the first stage bids for the acquisition of the FMIS system. A bid evaluation report was submitted to the Bank and provisionally cleared by the OPRC in February,
                         subject to clarifications designed to reduce the risks of poor supplier performance. Shortly after this there was a change of Government in Ukraine, following a political crisis and civil
                         unrest. This resulted in changes in key personnel responsible for the project, including the Minister of Finance, the Deputy Minister in charge of the project and the head of the State
                         Treasury. At this time the new Government carried out an internal reappraisal of the project and in late March the Deputy Minister verbally informed the Country Director that the
                         Government would like to cancel the acquisition of the FMIS, due to severe fiscal constraints. In April the new Government wrote to the Bank requesting that the Bank consider

                         E-Kazna system. Following further discussions between the task team and the Government at the end of April, the Government indicated that it was interested to continue with the
                         development of a new system (rather than continued development of E-Kazna), but with a reduced scope. In May the Country Director wrote to the Minister recommending that the
                         Bank team work with the Ministry to develop a new requirement specification, revised costings for the proposed FMIS and a business case, to be discussed with the Bank team. The

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following requests from the Ministry of Finance to restructure the project to save costs, the World Bank has agreed to consider a further restructuring of the project, based on
                         implementation of a Financial Management Information System with reduced scope. The World Bank has requested that the Ministry of Finance provide further details of the revised
                         system requirements, revised costing and a revised business case for the proposed investment.
