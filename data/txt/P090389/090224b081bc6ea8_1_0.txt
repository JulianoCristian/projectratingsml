                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank team visited Kiev during the week of February 25, 2013, to monitor the developments, review results indicators, and clarify the next steps after the cancellation of
                         ICB-3 process. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) management indicated that they are committed to the completion of remaining activities and wanted to continue with the project. The
                         MoF’s request was accepted by the Bank based on the Minister’s personal commitment and subject to the implementation of several key actions. The MoF and the Bank teams
                         identified mutually agreed conditions to improve the procurement strategy, and agreed on a timetable for key actions that should be completed before the closing date. It was decided
                         to amend the Loan Agreement (LA) for the inclusion of new covenants linked with the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) implementation (Part 2.c in Schedule 1 of the LA)
                         through a restructuring process. The agreement to amend the LA was made and reflected in the aide-mémoire of March 12, 2013, between the MoF and the Bank. Based on these,

                         the restructuring process was initiated in late March, and the LA amendment was signed on April 5, 2013. The MoF is in the process of launching a new ICB process for the
                         development of PFMS solutions.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank and the Borrower agreed to amend the Loan Agreement (LA) for the inclusion of several key covenants and dates. Any delays and failure of the Borrower to comply with
                         the new covenants and meet these target dates will jeopardize the Project.
