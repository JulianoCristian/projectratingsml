APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN ZAMBIA
Summary
i.       The Government of Zambia has requested Bank assistance in
financing an education project.  The! proposed project, as modified
during appraisal, would consist of:
the construction, furnishing and equipping of:
(a) nine new secondary schools;and
the improvement, extension, furnishing and equipping of:
(b) 56 existing secondary schools,
(c) two primary teacher training colleges,
(d) two higher teacher training colleges, and
(e) a technical college.
ii.      The educational attainment of the Zambian labor force is very
low; most middle and high level positions are held by foreign staff.
Present output from secondary and post-secondary institutions is insuf-
ficient to meet the manpower demand of a growing economy and to assure a
gradual replacement of foreign staff. The proposed project is directed
towards quantitative expansion and qualitative improvement of those parts
of the education system where manpower shortages are severe. In accordance
with government policy, the project provides also for a gradual upgrading
of the rural labcr force.
iii.     In quantitative terms-the proposed Drolect would constitute the
major part of a projected expansion of secondary school enrollments from
39.000 niioils in 1968 to ahont .;0-000 in 197h. which onuld raise the
percentage of the age group l4-18 years enrolled in secondary schools irom
1n0 5  to 17%=  The proposed project would contribute to this exp2nsiunfl
by providing 35,700 new places in secondary schools; 28,800 of these
wtould derive frOm better 11tiJiJAtion of existing school faMilities with
little acdditional investment.
iv.      The teaching of science would be strengthened by providing
equ.iipmen+t for 8n0§ of- all Qarcrn8r1yir% onenrclrma.ezt; practircal couirses~ woul.dr
be introcluced for all students in the junior cycle and diversified cur-
ricula in the senlor cycle , where lh3% of the students will be enrollecl
in the general arts and science sections and 57% in the pre-vocational

-vi.     TIhe proposed exvtensions of the higher teacher training colleges
by 625 places wLould greatly increase the output of secondary school



teachers and assist the government in meeting the total demaLod for
secondary school teachers by Zambians in the later seventies.    Until
then secondary education will rely on foreign teachers, mainly from
the U.K.; the government is taking st;eps to assure that an adequate
member of such teachers will be available.
vii.     The proposed extension of thie technical college would provide
training, in close cooperation with private industry, for about 210
engineering technicians a year at certificate and diploma level.
viii.    I'he annual recurrent budget of the Ministry of Education can
be expected to increase from K 34.7 million in 1968 to K 71.5 million
in 1974 of which K 7.6 million would result from the proposed project.
It is not expected that the Government will encounter difficulties in
meeting the capital cost not financecd by the Bank nor the recurrent
costs of the project.

needs. Estimated costs of construction, furniture and equipment are

I - Intruouction
1.01     A Unesco project identification mission visited Zambia in Feb:rua-
ryblrarch 1966 and identified priority needs for education. In February/
March 1968 a Unesco project preparation mission assisted the Government
to prepare an education project based on tnose needs. Tnis was appraised
by ia Bank mission, composed of Messrs. C. P. van Dijk (economist), C. A.
C. Hammerschnidt (architect), 0. Markgren (education specialist, consultant)
and J. C. Jones (technical education specialist, consultant) in April/May,
1968.
1.020    The project, as submitted to the Bank, comprised the construction
of :20 new and the expansion of 56 existing secondary schools, the construc-
tion of three new primary teacher training colleges and a new secondary
technical school, the expansion of a technical -ollege and the higher
teacher training college, and the expansion of the University of Zambia's
School of Natural Sciences, School of Engineering, School of Education and
student hostels.
1.03     During appraisal it was found that, (a) not all of the 20 proposed
new secondary schools could be justified by projected manpower needs and
that the location of eleven of these schools was not in accordance with
demographic and economic development patterns; the number of new schoo:Ls
in the project was, therefore, reduced to nine; (b) there was insufficient
justification for three additional primary teacher training colleges but
two existing colleges should be expanded; (c) a new secondary technicaL
school could be provided more economically by converting one of the 56
existing secondary schools to a multilateral secondary school with teclni-
cal bias; (d) the need for an expansion of the University's School of
Natural Sciences was not clear and the preparation of the other items in
the University sub-project was insufficiently advanced and would have -to
await the results of a comprehensive master plan for the University.
1.04     The remaining items were acceptable and, together with the expansion
of the two primary teacher training colleges mentioned at para. 1.03 (b)
above, constituted the proposed project.  After appraisal, the government ac-
quired an existiniz private school which was found suitable for the training
of secondary school teachers.  The expansion and equipping of this school
was subseauentlv added to the Droposed Drolect.
Social and economic background
1.Q5     The Renublic of Zambia occunies a land-locked tsrritorv of about
290,000 square mi:Les on a plateau in the southern half of Africa.  Population
and economncm  activity are ronnentrated Along the only rnilwav line tiwhierh runs
from Rhodesia via Livingstone in the south through Lusaka in the centre to
the Gopperbelt, centred -around Kitwe and eidola, in the north (See Map)  Most
of the main towns are situated along this line of rail.  The industria:L centei
of the country is at present the copper mining region in the North but a new
industrial township is being constructed near Kafue.
1.06     The population in 1968 is estimated at 4.1 million.  Approximately

in 1966 of which a'bout 500,000 was in the rural subsistence sector.
1.07     Copper mining is the mainstay of the Zambian economy, accounting
for about 1ulJo ofL OIA  GDP, over 970% ofl totual exp Ur earnJlngs adtU LJ;d.ir-LLy
70% of government revenue.  Development of other sectors, particularly
the rural tcUVJonrWq is urgenbly needed to reduce Zambia' s economic vuiner-
ability and expand employment opportunities for a rapidly rising supply
oLf laboU.
II - The Education System
Administration and Organization
2.01     The Minister of Education is responsible for policy, control and
supervision of primary and secondary schools and teacher training colleles.
A newly created Directorate for Technical Education under a Mlnister of
State controls all technical education outside the secondary schools. TChe
Minister of AgricuLture is responsible for agricultural education except
for agricultural courses in secondary schools. Control and supervision
of the University of Zambia is vested in a Provisional Council.
2.02     The organization of the Ministry of Education is shown in Annex 1.
The Minister and his Permanent Secretary are assisted by an advisory Na-
tional Council of 'Education and by four main divisions of the ministry:
Administration, Professional matters, Planning and the Inspectorate.   Staff
posi-tions in the Ministry are filled by competent officials but most are
non-Zambians (main:Ly from the U.K.) and the turnover is high.
2.03     T'here is urgent need for a formulation of planning objectives
and criteria, particularly as regards finance and manpower development,
for the introduction of modern statistical methods and for integration between
ministries. The Planning Unit is, however. under-staffed; it has not begun
to flnction effectively and needs strengthening.  The Inspectorate needs
broader expertise in pre-vocational education.  A specialist in agricultural
education has been appointed recently; there will be need for specialists
in technical secondary education. During negotiations assurances have been ob-
tained that these two units will be expanded.The National Council of Educa-
tion would be more effective if representatives of the private sector were
added.
2.o4     There are nine administrative regions, each with a Chief Education
Offiner and his staff of eduication officers. who are responsible for general
supervision of policy implementation.  Training of the regional staff is ur-
gent:ly needed; assurances to that effeet have been obtained during negotiations.

of 4 years and an ulpper cycle of 3 years (Annex 2).  Enrollment has more



thfan doubled from 279,780 pupils in 196O to 598,198 pupils in 1968 or
about 84% of the 7-13 years age group (Annexes 3 and 4). Government
projections show enrollment growing to 857,300 in 1975 and 974,900 in
1980. This latter figure approximates to universal primary education
(Annex 5). Of the 10,655 primary school teachers in service in 1967,
92% are qualified. Many of these latter, however, had only one year of
training after two years of secondary education and require further
training (para. 2.14).
Secondary Education
2.06     The secondary course comprises a 2-year junior section, leading
to the junior secondary school leaving examination and a 3-year senior
section which prepares for the Cambridge University Overseas School
Certificate examinations giving access to the University of Zambia and
other institutions of post-secondar:y education.
2.07     Present policy is to admit one-third of primarv school leavers
to secondary education (which is high in comparison with other African coun-
tries and to maintain a progression rate from junior into senior cycle
of secondary education of two-thirds of the pupils. In 1968, the respec-
tive percentages were 3Lt% and 57%. The prozression from junior to senior
cycle is too high to provide the required proportion of manpower educated
to these t-wo levels. The length of the iunior cycle of two years. moreover.
is too short. The government therefore intends to convert the present
structure. in which a 2-year iniior c;ycle is followed by a 3-year senior
cycle (2:3 structure), into a 3:2 structure and to reduce the progression
rate mid-way from two-thirds to one half. This will lead to an output of
more matures and beitter educated young people at the end of the junior
cycle and *to a sunply of mnnpower more in line with the pronictAd require-
ments at both junior and senior level as shown in para. 1X.07.
2.08     The present curriculum is almos't entirely academic. During ap--
praisal y agIeement was reached on a new curriculum., %hirh wrull include
8 periods a week of practical work for all pupils in the junior cycle
and, in +he senior cycle, would create prevocationa  sections, wJith 10
periods a week allocated to industria'l subjects, agriculture, conmmerce or
home economics, for 55e.6% of the s+udents. .4ttenAnce at these pre-
vocational courses would not deny pupils access to higher education.
2.09     Eirollmentis in general secondary schools have increased sharply:

2.10     ine government woulad be weli advised to reduce the admission
rate to ab(ot 30% along with the reduction of mid-way progression to 50%.
Enroliment would then reach about 80,000 pupils in 1974. Provided the



- 4 -
necessary teachers can be recruited, this figure is a reasonable target
for 1974 (Annex 6).
2.11     Schoos are generally well staffed, the teacher-pupil ratio being
1:22, but almost 90% of the teaching force of 1776 is foreign, mostly from
the United Kingdom. At the projected rate of growth in secondary school
enrollments, the need for teachers would increase to 3160 in 1974 (Annex 7).
Many headmasters are inexperienced.   The Institute of Education of the
University of Zambia. in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, is
developing an urgently needed program for the training of headmasters.
Teacher Training
2.12     Primary school teachers are trained in 1 and 2 year courses after
the first. qpondarv eyele (Form 2?); after 1970 all courses will be two years
with a common curriculum and an examination controlled by the Ministry of
R.rtlc-ati en.
2.13     Enrollments in the n      colleges    2072 students.  The teacher-
pupil ratio of 1:15 is to be increased to 1:20 as soon as possible. Seventy

2.11T  Vsting capaciVy is -vfcxn          +o.e-eurmens         radtoa

maUloity o  theteachers now in se-ce~ and- +he -"isr  -> -eie -   to-- 
extend twzo existing colleges for this purpose (para. 5.09-5.10).
2.15     Secondary teacher training is provided at the Higher Teacher

in junior secondr,y classes, and t,o start in Xitwin  n the near fut,ure, will
be reduced to 2 years in 1969 to meet the urgent need for teachers.    The
colleges will also traIn teachers oL home economn.ics, co.,gmrerce, indust,rial
arts and agriculture for both the junior and senior classes (para. 5.12).
Present, nrollment at Rabwe is 124 but will increase to 750 in both colleges
with an annual ouLtput of 325 teachers from 1974.
2.16     The School of Education of the University of Zambia provides teacher
training courses for students enrolied in Humanities and Natural Sciences.
The first group of 40 teachers will leave the University in 1971. The
School plans an output of 500 teachers a year by 1975.
2. L7    The combined efforts of the two colleges and the University of Zambia
should be able to meet the total demand for secondary school teachers by
1979, including the replacement of foreign teachers, if- expanded as planned
(para. 4.13). For a number of years to come, however, secondary education
wi:Ll reLy on foreign teachers (Annex 7).
2.18     During 1L968-1971 650 more foreign teachers will be needed than are
now in service.  The main source of supply has been the United Kingdom but
the Ministry of Overseas Development has indicated that financial limitations
wouild not allow further growth. The Zambian government is launching a recruit

Technical Education and Training
2.19     Organized technical education and training exists only to a
lim,ited extent but considderable grotr h 9i to be expected consequent upon
the recent creation of a separate Directorate of Technical and Vocational
Eduuation and Traiining under a Minister Of State directly responsible to
the office of the Vice-President,and the proposal to establish National
Advisory Councils at technician and craft levels.
2.20     At the pre-vocational level, the David Kaunda Secondary Techn-
ical School (under the Ministry of Education) offers four-year courses
preparing for apprenticeship in the engineering and building industries
or for admission to full-time diploma and degree courses at the Northern
Technical College and the University of Zambia, respectively. The school,
the only one of its kind in Zambia, has an intake of 120 pupils per year.
2.21     Full-time courses in brickwork and carpentry are given in govern-
ment Trade Schoolsat Livingstone, Lukashya, and M4ukobeko. Entry is re-
stricted to trainees who are sponsored by industrial firms with whom they
spend three months before entering upon the one-year trade school course.
Selected trainees may return for an advanced course after completion of a
minimum of one year in industry. A UNDP/ILO project presently has under conmd
eration a revision of apprenticeship arrangements and the construction of 7-2
new vocational training centres,raising the output from the existing total
of 272 to approximately 2,000 per year. The centres will also train
selected craftsmen for supervisory posts.
2.22     Training at technician level is carried out at the Evelyn Hone
College of Further Education (Lusaka) and the Northern Technical College
(Ndola). The latter is concerned mainly with the engineering and building
industries but is associated with "feeder" institutions at Kitwe and
Luanshya where commercial and general education courses are offered
(Annex 8). At Ndola a majority of the students are already in employment
as apprentices or learners and are released by employers to attend full-
time courses of six week's duration three times a year. Recently,full-
time courses of two years' duration have been introduced at certificate
technician level together with more advanced courses of four years' dura-
tion at diploma technician level. The demand for these full-time courses
is expected to increase with the economic development of the country and
some of the craft training will eventually be transferred to other centres
(Annex 8).  At present the intake of new students is of the order of 250
to 300 per year; enrollment in 1967 was 636 full-time and 934 part-time
stndents   A feature of the work of the College is its close co-operation
with industry in the conduct of block-release and full-time courses.
2.23     The Evelyn Hone College is responsible for work at a similar
var -e-y nf levels bu+ malnly ln the fields of corum-ece, home  cn.is
the social services, and general and social education. In addition to a
full=tlme enrol'ent of som,e 350 stu,dents, the College and its associQar ted



institutions have an evening enrollment of about 2,000 students.
2.24     The University of Zambia is responsible for the traininq of
technologists and engineers. Engineering students follow afive-year
course, the first year being common with science courses.
Agricultural education and training

and shorter in-service courses for students with primary education; the
institutes also train farmers. TvUelve Farmer Training Centers give short
courses to farmers and farmers' wives.  Twelve other centers are under
constructi 'on.
2.2<     The University has established a School of Acriculture which hab
neither sufficient staff nor accommodation. Seven students were enrolled
this year to the School of Natural 5ciences but it seems likely that they
will be sent abroad for further stucly.
2.27     Government plans for a rapid development of the agricultural
sector would indicate that agricultural education and training should be
expanded.  The need for such expansion is not yet fully reflected in
educational planning and in the proposed project, except for the introduc-
tion of pre-vocational agricultural courses in secondary schools. An
assessment of existin, agricultural training facilities and of the need
for further expansion at all levels will be undertaken. Identified needs
for further investment in agricultural training institutions could form
part of a second education project in the near future.
Higher Education
2.28     The University of Zambia was opened in temporary accommodation in
October, 1965 and permanent buildings are now being built some five miles
from the center of Lusaka. When completed in the middle seventies,the
new campus will offer teaching facilities and residential accommodaticn
for 5,000 students at a total capital cost of K 27.3 million (US$39
million).
2.29     Admission requires appropriate credits in the Cambridge University
School Certificate Examination (or its equivalent). Enrollment increased
frc,m 312 in 1966 to 767 in 1968.  Expansion is retarded by the shortage of
qualified secondary school leavers, especially in science.   Productivity
is further affecte!d by the large number of "drop-outs".
2.30     The University is attempting to provide courses in too many fields
affter only t,wo vears of existence.  It has alreadv established eight fac-

2.31     Planning of the University's further development is deficient.
There has been a series of master plans but none is now considered valid.
Projections of student enrollments are virtually non-existent; actual
numbers of qualified entrants have often been lower than expectations;
projections made by various faculties are often inconsistent. Physical
construction, consequently, cannot be accurately related to projected
accommodation requirement. The utilization of present facilities is low;
there appears to be an excess of smaller teaching spaces and a shortage
of larger lecture theatres. Government is concerned about the high recur-
rent cost of the University.
2.32     A major planning effort is needed to assure rational development
of further expansion. Such a plan should be comprehensive and make real-
istic projections of future enrollments in accordance with secondary school
output and manpower requirements. It should assure maximum utilization of
existing and new accommodation and recommend more functional and less -ost-
ly construction standards. It should aim at a higher student-staff ratio
and a corresponding reduction in recurrent expenditure.
III - COST ATD FThAN,7CIM OF EDUCATION
Fin: nrinc fEc.to
3.01     Finance for education is centralized in the budget of' the central
government. The role played by private schools is negligible. Mission
schDols, wnzhich are grant-=aided for 100% of recurrent and 75% of capital
costs, are considered part of the public sector.



- 8- 
3.02     Income f-rom school fees is very low: for primarv and secondarr
schools it is est:imated at K 300,000, or only 1% of government expendi--
ture on nrimarv and secondarv education.  Tiition fees of K 36 p.a. and
boarding fees of IC 162 p.a. are only charged in the small group of
ex-1federal ghrbn1!s knn-&m ag "qrhPA,iPH1" schools. No fees are charged
in the majority g:roup of "unscheduled" primary and secondary schools, the
trade schools and secondary tech+.ical school (except for some small board-
ing fees :in primary schools). Education is also free at the teacher

3.0.3    The Northern Technical College and Evelyn Hone College of Further

3.05     The contribution of private industry is important although the
exact amount is unknown.  Participation comes in many forms, such as
vocational training directly organized and financed by inclustry (partic-
ularly the mining industry), the sponsoring of students in public schools,
scholarships and donations. The total financial contribution of the
mining industry is estimated at K 6 million in 196D8.
3.06     In aggregate it is estimated that in 1968 K 61.5 million or some
7% of GDP was spent on education (Annex 9):

3.09     On the basis of present expansion plans and assuming that
salaries r.-.lill riss by abo,ut 2c5% over the next sJ yers   gt i  esti -tled
that recurrent expenditure by the Ministry of Education (in constant

3.10     Without estimates of future government revenue and total recur-
r Apend"iLures, it is not poUsibe bo ±L]UiLat  what prUopt      o   the
197L budget would be devoted to education. The projected increase in
education expenditure does not appear out of line with expected increases
in other sectors of government expenditure, however, and can be considered
feasIble.
Capital expenditure
3.11     The first National Development Plan 1966-1970 devoted K 79.5
million to education, accounting for more than 1h% of total public
capital investment planned for the period.    K 29.5 million (37j) was
earmarked for secondary education, K 3.1 million (4%) for teacher train-
ing, K 6.6 million (8)0j for technical and further education and K 16
million (200) for the University.
3.12     Realization of the planned rate of investment in education, at
around K 20 million per year, has fallen short so far. Capital expendi-
ture data for the first years of the plan are not yet available; but,
judging from the budget estimates, capital expenditure by the Ministry
of Education for the 21½ year period June 1966-December 1968 can be
estimated at K 35 million.   Annex 13 gives the annual capital expendi-
ture figures since 1964 and a breakdown by level of education.    The
emphasis given to the development of secondary education and to the
University is clearly shown.
IV - EDUCATION AN) TRAINING NEEDS
Existing manpower situation
4.Ol     The total working population in 1965/66 was estimated at
805,900 persons wxith 305,900 in the modern sector of the economy and
500,000 in the rural subsistence sector.    The educational level of the
African labour force is low. Only a very small number of Africans havre



1- 0i -
a University degree or a post-secondary diploma; even those who have
finished secondary education constitute only 0.2% of the African labor
force.  In 1966, of 56,l50 positions requiring 2 years of secondary
education or more, only 17% were filled by qualified ALfricans.  That
most; middle and high level positions are filled by non-Africans is
shown at Annex 14.
4.02     Crucial shortages of qualified manpower exist in nearly every
sector of the economy.  Private enternris e e3nerienes sperious difficu1l-

L.L) 5-7,'Q o.f Ulem wi±L J. ±LJU f MployVV,y1t::LJ U Ln tUhie moU'Ueni sector, eVenL ULJUner
very optimistic growth expectations. The remainder will fall back on
opporr-uui-ituS for usefui employmrenvt in th-te rural UeutLUr of IA1 eco y,
that is, small scale agriculture and closely related services. Unless
employment outlets are greatly increased, the absorption oI the rapidly
growing numbers of new entrants to the labor market could form the crux
of the numan resource development problem in the near future.   In the
long run this problem might become more important than the severe shortage
of qualified manpower at present.
4.04     In the rural sector, there is urgent need to increase production
and raise income levels for several reasons, including the creation of
additional employment, as is stressed in the First National Development
Plan 1966-1970. MLanpower projections should therefore make provision for
a gradual up-grading of the rural working population. Tne primary and
secondary school system should adjust its orientation and offer better
preparation for rural employment by teaching practical subjects, particu-
larly agricultural science and industrial arts. Agreement has been reached
with Government that steps to that effect would be taken (para. 5.U6).
4.05     In the modern sector, the demand for educated Zarnbians depends
mainly upon (i) the rate of replacement of foreign personnel and (ii)
the growth of total employment as a result of economic expansion. Govern-
ment pressure to speed up the process of Zambianisation is strong and
non-Zambians are being replaced at a faster rate than the supply of
qualified Zambian manpower permits. Positions are frequently filled with



- 11 -
personnel of inadequate education or experience and there is a danger that
such unqualified incumbents will block the way for more highly qualified
Zambians as these become available. To avoid long-lasting damage to labor
productivity, the output of the education and training system should be
increased without delay.
1.06     The growth of total employment in the modern sector of the economy
has been considerable. Between 1964 and 1966, total employment rose from
268,700 to 332,900 or by 24%. mainly, in manufacturing, construction, trans-
port and communications (Annex 15). The rate of expansion has probably
decreased recently and present conditions, including uncertainty as to the
future price of copper, on which the greater part of the economy depends,
make it difficult to estimate future emplovment. It is believed that the
rate of expansion is less than originally foreseen in the official manpower
projections. the nresently estimated annual growth being 8% for the period
1965-1970 compared with original expectations of 11%. For the purposes
of this appraisal. the 1966 governmcint manpower foreeasts have therefore
been reduced correspondingly.
4.07     Projections of manpower requirements for the period 1966-198C,
revised by the- mnission as i nated in pnras. c l.c and )4.fn6  hrnvr  incdicnte
a demand for the following numbers of new entrants to the labor market:
Degree-level                             10,000
Diploma level                            18,000
including: teachers         2,3 _J0
technicians      1,500

Junior secondary level                  106,000
TOTAL       186,000
Educational DeveLopment Needs
4.08     The present output of the Zambian education system is insufficient
ton meet+. +.'he mnrower needs oiu-tli-nedrI abrove.  rAwi t.1 a 'Form-t I evel  t-noutput of
only 1,600 graduates in 1967, the secondary school system is unable to feed
institutions of post-secondary education and to meet labor market demands=
Expansion of the University and other post-secondary institutions is hampered
by a lack of quiei   d f4   canA  .  A       4raid in-rease n the out-ut. from
secondary schools in the next few years - which can level off at a later stage
is therefore requ-ired.  In addition,  h.e q,ality of the secondary school
output, especially in science, should be improved.
4.09     Total enrollments in secondary schools should be increased from
or00 nrr  in4 1968 to..4 abou   80,00   in ]7;this wou"ld ra-ise the oupu  fo
the junior cycle! to 9,800 and from the senior cycle to 7,300 a year by
1974. T'his sub,stantial increase over the next six years should Se fCol owed

by a levelline off in the rate of expansion bevond 197h (Annex 6). Fo-
reasons given in paras. 4.05 and 4.08 above, this rapid increase over
the next fem years should be nreferred to a more even Prouth oath.
4.10     At this irate of g7rowth. the total outnut to the anhor market of
students Leaving school at the end of the junior cycle or dropping out

4 . 13)  As detailed in paras. 2.17-2.18 and 4.07, there is a considerable
shortage of secondary school teachers.  The training of secondary school
teachers, botn at tne Higner Teacher Training Colleges at Kabwe and Kitwe and
at the School of Education of the University of Zambia should therefore be
greatly expanded to provide the number of teachers required for expansion
of secondary education and to replace expatriates now in service before 1980.
4.14     Of high economic priority is the training of technicians and engi-
neers, which has only recently started.  Estimated requirements of tech-
nicians are specified in para. 4.07.  The Northern Technical College
program to train engineering technicians at certificate and diploma level
will assure an annual output of some 210 technicians, which is still below
the country's requirements.

Secondary Schools
5.03     The proposed construction of nine new secondary schools and exten-
sion of 56 existing secondary schools form the major part of a school ex-
pansion program which will raise total enrollments in all secondary schools
from 39,000 in 1968 to about 80,000 in 1974 (see para. 2.10); 35,600 new
places would be provided by the project, and 5,600 places will accrue from
7 new schools at present under construction from government funds.
5.04     The 56 extensions would permit a major rationalization of the sec-
ondary school system through more intensive use of existing accommodation.
By changing from form-room to a subjiect-room operation, enrollments will be
greatly increased with only minor additions to buildings. In most cases,
only a limited number of snecial facilities;such as workshops and laborato-
ries, will be added. Standards of equipment will be greatly improved for
all nunils in the schools    Cl1ass sizes will be raised to l40 pLupils in the
junior and. 35 pupils in the senior cycle, leading to a redLction in teacher
requirements and recurrent cost per rppil.

studies will be more advanced and equipment more sonhisticated than in the
industrial sections of the other secondary schools; the curriculum wil:L be
that of a technical secondary school.    Students will be a'p -itted from all

Primary Teacher Training
5.09     A request for the financing of three new primary teacher training
colleges was inclu,ded in the project proposal.   During appraisal it was
found that the existing colleges are uneconomically small and could be
expanded without Tmuch additionai cost.   However, there is io apparent need
for a further expansion of regular courses in this field, since the total
output of teachers from the existing colleges between 19008 and 1979 will
be sufficient to meet the demand. There is, however, an urgent need to
retrain the majority of teachers now in service.
5el0     hne proposed project item has been therefore amended.     To meet
the latter need, two existing teacher training colleges would be extended.
One (in Chalimbana) would annually re-train 900 teachers in three 12-week
courses for groups of 300, requiring the college to be extended to 300
places. This would enable the government, in the next decade, to retrain the
majority of the 10,000 primary teachers now in service. The second college (n



- 1i) -
Kitwe) would be extended to 525 places to replace the regular 2-year
pre-service courses of the college in Chalimbana. Tne output from the
2-year course will be 250 primary school teachers a year.
5.11     The proposed project would provide nine classrooms, 15 laborato-
ries and special rooms and boarding facilities for 340 students. Both
colleges are fully boarding.   No difficulties are foreseen in staffing the
two colleges. Teacher training colleges are generally overstaffed at
present and, with better utilization of the available teachers, little
increase in staffing would be required for the modest expansion provided
by the project.
Secondary Teacher Training
5.12     The two Higher Teacher Training Colleges at Kabwe and Kitwe will
train teachers of academic subjects for the junior cycle of secondary schools
and teachersof practical subjects for both the junior and senior cycles.
The project would provide for an extension of the Colleges from 125 to 750
students. Teachers of industrial arts and agriculture for the senior cycle
would receive additional training at the Northern Technical College and at
the Natural Resources Development College of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The maximum output of the 2-year course would be 325 teachers a year.
5.13     The proposed project would provide 13 classrooms and special
workshops, boarding facilities for 3h0 students and five staff houses.
All students will be boarders. The colleges would have to add about 4o teach-
ers to their present .taf f of 13.      The IT.K. Ministrv of Overseas
Development has expressed interest in providing these teacher trainers.

iIr,jprouvemr,eri's  been included in the proposed prujecL.  ±L1 cos  oe
sions and alterat:ions is included in the estimate and is acceptable.
5.20     The size of classrooms, laboratories and workshops has been
reviewed ana standaras are austere.   Estimates of furniture ana equipment
costs assure satisfactory provision of these ite:.s at realistic costs.
Boarding accommodation in secondary schools is based on double bunking; in
the teacher training and technical colleges two students would share a
bedroom. Agreement with the Government was reached on utmost economy in
calculating circulation spaces and lay-out of buildings.
5.21     Site development costs have been estimated on the basis of austere
standards, include external works and, where necessary, connection to ;nain
services. In a number of existing schools which would be extended under
the proposed project, the government has not constructed surface drains,
roads and footpaths. Erosion is threatening the buildings. In a number
of cases, the supply of water and electricity from the main supply is inad-
equate for the proper functioning of the schools. Provision for site improve-
ment and for electricity supply has been included in the proposed project.
During negotiations assurances have been obtained from the government that
schools will be provided with the necessary utilities.
5.22     The project cost estimate includes 12%o for physical contingencies
and 15% for anticipated price increa.ses during the execution period. rhe
latter percentage is based on actual price increases in the last three years.
The former percentage is to cover normal contingencies and to account for
extraordinary expenses which might arise from alterations of existing build-
ings and transportation problems.
5.23     The foreign exchange component of the construction cost is about
37%. Clay and cement products are locally made but most other building
materials. electric eauipment and sanitary fixtures are imported. Locally
manufactured furniture has an indirect foreign exchange component of 60%.
All instructional eouinment and books are imnorted. The foreign exchange
component of professional services is estimated at 40%.
C. EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT
5.24     Site ac uisition. Sites for the nine new schools have been selected.
Most are goverrnment oned but apnproval hy +he regional nnd town planning
authorities and reservation by the Commissioner of Land will be required at
least one ypear before constraction starts.  A          to this effect have
been obtained during negotiations. Available sites of the existing schools
are large enough for the ~ planAned ex.nsos.

ary schools and for the Northern Technical College. Site plans for the
remaining schools have been requested.
5.26     Project Unit. To coordinate, administer and supervise the execution
of the project, a Project Unit woulcd be established in the Ministry of Edu-
cation, headed by a full-time Projec:t Director, who would be acceptable to
the Bank, assisted by an architect and supporting staff for equipment pro-
curement and accounting. The architect, who would also be acceptable to the
Bank, would be appointed by the Ministry of Public Works to form part of the
Project Unit and would maintain close liaison between his Ministry and the
Project Unit.
5.27     Properly qualified clerks of works would be engaged by the Project
Unit and stationed in the provincial centers to supervise (under the direc-
tion of the responsible architecturELl firms) the day-to-day construction
work on a number of project items within range of their offices.
5.28     Architectural services. The Ministry of Works is understaffed and
private firms of architects. engineeirs and quantity surveyors would there-
fore, be engaged to execute the project. Such firms would be responsible
for design, contract documents. contract arrangements and sunervision.   To
achieve eConomy through standardization, one firm of architects would be in
charge of all seconndarv qe.hono.q new nnci pwtP. nq i on.q - Othpr firms could be
employed for the three teacher training colleges and for the Northern Tech-

overseas affiliation would have the manpower to carry out the work. A suf-
ficient nrmber of such firms are establiseidA in 7Zmhia +.o assuire proper

5.31     For the execution of the project, contractors should be givern an
overall government permit enabling them to recruit skilled expatriate per son-
nel in key positions.  Assurances to that effect have been obtained during
negotiations.
5.32     Construction period. To keep annual construction work within the
capacity of the building industry and to avoid inflationary pressures, it
is recommended that the implementation of the project would be spread over
5 years including a preparation period of 15 months and a defects and lia-
bility period of 12 months (Annex 1l)Y.  As an incentive to builders, the
pheLsing of construction should allow a continuous flow of work to be carried
out in each region during the project period.

5.33     :Disbursernents. The proposed loan of $17.4 million would fi7anrce:
(a) 100% of the direct foreign exchange costs of the project, which are
presently estimated at $ 4.9 million (instructional and other equipment
and books), as well as (b) 40% of the remaining costs of the project, which
is equivalent to the estiLmated foreign exchange component of these costs.
Thus, the total amount of Bank financing would amount to 48% of the total
cost of t:he project.  The r4rccntape referred t.o at (b) above would be
adjusted as necessary to ensure that disbursement vinuld be spread throughcut
the neriod Af oxypmtion. Undinbursed amounts would he availahle for cancel-

6.03     The proposed project, moreover, would contribute to qualitati'v
improvement of secondary education by assuring a fully qualified Zambian
teaching force before 1980, by providing better equipment for uu0 ol all
secondary enrollments, by strengthening the teaching of science and by
contributing towards a properly trained staff of school headmasters, edu-
cation officers and inspectors. In addition, the project would bring abou-t
a greater diversification of the secondary school curriculum and an orienta-
tion towards more practical work.  It would also lead to a better utilizaticl!
of existing school facilities (paras. 5.04 - 5.06, 5.12).
6.04     in the field of teacher training, the proposed project would enau.le
the government to re-train the majority of insufficiently trained primary
school teachers now in service.  At a higher level, the project would enacile
the higher teacher training colleges to attain an adequate output of Eeccrt:n.;iY
school teachers (paras. 5.10-5.13).
6.05 In technical education the proposed project would expand the traxi

Note.-   It is ver;y difficult to estimate the "output" of the Northern Technical
College, a majority of whose students will be industry-based and may leave at
any point in a caarse of from one to four years duration. Moreover, a course
may commence with a craft bias and terminate at the technician level. In the
following approximation it has been assumed that, for most courses, stuldents who
leave at a "half-way" stage can be included in the craft output.
