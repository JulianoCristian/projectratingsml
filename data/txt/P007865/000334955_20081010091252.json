The project was satisfactorily\n            implemented with an overrun of only 5.2 percent of the\n            original cost. The project was completed within the\n            estimated time with savings. To utilize these savings the\n            Bank and the Borrower agreed to construct 11 primary schools\n            in the Asuncion area and to extend the original closing date\n            about one year. Success of project implementation may be\n            attributed primarily to the fact that a Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) staffed with a stable cadre of\n            full-time qualified professionals, who had been given ample\n            autonomy by the Minister of Education, had been carrying out\n            its duties since implementation of the First Education\n            Project in 1973 and was thoroughly familiar with Bank\n            guidelines and procedures."}, "docdt": "1983-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
