    covers Paro, Haa and Thimphu Districts in Western Bhutan\n            where the coniferous forest has been affected by a pest\n            outbreak.

The project is\n            adminstered by the Bhutan Logging Corporation (BLC) and the\n            Department of Forests (FD) over a six-year period and\n            supports (a) FD activities in pest and forest management,\n            and (b) BLC activities, including road construction,\n            logging, workshop development, marketing, nursery\n            development and reforestation in the project area, and\n            improvement of the financial management system.
