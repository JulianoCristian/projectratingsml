   for Bhutan achieved a satisfactory overall outcome.\n            Institutional development is rated as substantial.\n            Sustainability is rated as uncertain because the Bhutan\n            Logging Corporation (BLC) has been unable to set prices for\n            its products which cover its operating costs, plus a reserve\n            for equipment financed under the project, and a modest\n            profit. Activities funded by the IDA Credit have made a\n            positive contribution to forest sector development through\n            physical works and institutional and human resources\n            development. Potential environmental problems arising from a\n            bark beetle epidemic were resolved. Introduction of\n            mechanized logging utilizing low-impact cableways was\n            timely. The project successfully differentiated and\n            strengthened the institutional capacities of BLC and the\n            Forest Department. The Borrower's performance in\n            carrying out its obligations resulted in project targets\n            being met or exceeded for road construction, forest\n            nurseries and reforestation, and engagement of technical\n            assistance. Lessons learned from the project are as follows:\n            (i) high quality at entry and borrower commitment contribute\n            to satisfactory project outcome; (ii) cofinancing and\n            technical assistance can contribute to effective project\n            performance, but the details of these relationships should\n            be defined during project preparation, not after credit\n            approval; and (iii) clear definition of, and commitment to,\n            policies on natural resource use and pricing must be sought\n            during project preparation to avoid disagreements during implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
