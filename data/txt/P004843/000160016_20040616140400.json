Improvements to Can Tho Port will\n            provide for better cargo handling, cargo storage, and\n            treatment/disposal of ship wastes. This environmental\n            assessment evaluates adverse biophysical impacts related to\n            project activities both during construction and operation\n            phases; presents mitigation measures to reduce both\n            predicted and actual impacts; and reports on the\n            environmental aspects of the project, including temporary\n            and permanent adverse impacts and benefits. During\n            construction of the waterway and the Thoi Binh Lock, various\n            mitigation measures will be adopted to reduce impacts\n            identified as unacceptable, that is, a more than 20 percent\n            change in oxygen levels and pH concentrations in the\n            waterway; a more than 20 percent change in other critical\n            elements (totally suspended liquids, oil or fecal\n            coliform-bacteria, and the 5 trace metals) in potable water;\n            or a decrease of 2 pH units beyond the normal range in\n            aquaculture. Measures include: altering dredging activities\n            to reduce release of suspended solids and associated\n            contaminants by either reducing dredging intensity; or\n            changing dredging operational practices. Dredging of the\n            bank of some waterway sections may change the pH of water in\n            the channels - this must be considered a residual\n            non-mitigable impact. If unacceptable changes also occur in\n            the pH of potable water and in water used in aquaculture,\n            other options are to modify dredging operational practices,\n            to increase monitoring, and to re-evaluate physical soil\n            conditions. Actions to mitigate unacceptable changes in the\n            normal range of concentrations in dissolved oxygen, total\n            suspended liquids, fecal coliform bacteria, or a decrease\n            below the normal range of pH concentration will prompt a\n            reduction in the rate of water discharge from any or all of\n            the water basins. Persistent or abrupt noise exceeding a set\n            decibel level will be mitigated by installing additional\n            noise dampening on the dredge or the booster pumping\n            stations; altering the timing of certain work practices; or\n            penalizing the contractor and transferring these funds to\n            the community as compensation. The operational phase of the\n            waterways and the Thoi Binh Lock will cause increased\n            erosion and the collapse of canal banks, with stronger tidal\n            effects leading to greater seawater intrusion, significantly\n            impacting aquatic and terrestrial ecology (food source loss,\n            and destroyed habitats, aquatic plants, and animal species)\n            and agriculture, lessening the ability to use canal water\n            for other uses, promoting sedimentation, and increasing\n            salinity. Canal dredging will increase fresh water from\n            upstream, and discharge and acidic and salt water will be\n            pushed further downstream, particularly in the wet season.\n            Increased vessel traffic will lead to: 1) uncontrolled\n            discharge, which will increase existing waste impacts to the\n            general aquatic ecosystem of the canals and rivers, coastal\n            marine ecosystem and human health of waterway users; and 2)\n            increased potential for spillage of petroleum hydrocarbon\n            products, such as fuels, hydraulic line oils, etc. Noise\n            will be mitigated by controls, such as banning whistles and\n            horns or fining vessels with inadequate muffler systems. The\n            operational phase of the Can Tho Port will increase noise,\n            which will be mitigated by installing upgraded mufflers on\n            cranes and vehicles. The port will be required to provide\n            facilities to receive and treat oil-contaminated waters,\n            chemical-contaminated waters, sanitary sewage, and\n            shipwaste. Stormwater drainage will transport surface runoff\n            of pollutants into the Bassac River. A resettlement action\n            plan conforming to the World Bank's operational\n            directive is included."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
