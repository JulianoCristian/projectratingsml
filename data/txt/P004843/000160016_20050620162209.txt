                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      THE PROJECT

The project works consist of:

(i)     Dredging of 53.7km canal conformed to inland waterway class III - TCVN
        5664-92 (reducible). This canal technical standards coincide to design standards
        of two main waterways of the Project
(ii)    Installation of new Navaids
(iii)   Clearance of all possible obstacles obstructed to navigation
(iv)    To minimize possible impacts to households living close to water frontage.
        Resettlement will be directed to places whereas necessary (such as confluence
        of Ganh Hao river and Bac Lieu - Ca Mau canal).

RAP 2005 will be applied to carry out:
- Removal of houses encroaching and obstructing navigation.
- Lease of land for spoil relocation areas (SRAs).

2.      LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ENTITLEMENT POLICY

-    The legal frame specified in RAP 2003 will be applied duly as RAP 2005.

-    RAP 2005 assures the due application of basic principles on involuntary
     resettlement by Bank safeguard policy. This can be cited as rehabilitation
     assistance aims to improve living standards and income productivity or at least
     PAPs may recover their living before the Project.

3.      THE PROJECT IMPACTS ON LAND ACQUISITION

-    Number of PAPs: 4 HHs
-    Land loss: 0 m2
-    House loss: 474 m2

4.      CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION

Information on the Project and the resettlement consequences have been regularly
provided by the PMU-W to all Province and District and Commune People
Committees. A simplified campaign of public dissemination was given to communities
in Mid-January 2005 as well. Through community meetings, public information
booklets, overleaf, PAPs were also informed of project objectives, possible impacts on
people's assets and RAP policy. People will be consulted during DMS work to
negotiate, to determine their preferences for type of compensation and consulting the
rates of compensation applied to set up entitlement's amount.

VIET NAM INLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL DREDGING OF GANH HAO - GIA RAI SECTION



                          CHAPTER 1: THE PROJECT

Viet Nam inland waterways and port rehabilitation project (the Project) focuses to
upgrade two main waterways, to improve economic outcome of river fleets and lower
transport cost of cargo and raw materials in the Mekong Delta.

In order to uplift benefit by loan application agreed with World Bank (IDA), Ministry
of Transport (MOT) appoints Project Management Unit of Waterways (PMU-
Waterways) as an implementing agency, administers the Project through various Plans.
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) stipulate policies and detailed plan of
resettlement, compensation rehabilitation assistance related to losses and impacts to all
kinds of assets and property owned by Project affected People (PAP). Incorporated
with prevailing Laws of the Government of Viet Nam (GOV) and directives of WB,
RAP was prepared to serve improvement works of Bac Lieu - Ca Mau canal (Ganh
Hao - Gia Rai section) in 2005 (abbreviated RAP 2005)

The works consist of:

(i)     Dredging of 53.7km canal conformed to inland waterway class III - TCVN
        5664-92 (reducible), least available depth T= 2.5m (at level -2.7m/Mui Nai
        datum - approximately 95% design lowest low water (LLW), bottom width
        B=22m, vertical clearance V=7m (over high water at frequency of 5% highest
        high water HHW), horizontal clearance H=30m. This canal technical standards
        coincide to design standards of two main waterways of the Project;
(ii)    Installation of new Navaids;
(iii)   Clearance of all possible obstacles obstructed to navigation;
(iv)    To minimize possible impacts to households whose living closes to water
        frontage, resettlement will be directed to places whereas necessary (such as
        confluence of Ganh Hao river and Bac Lieu - Ca Mau canal).

RAP 2005 is a pattern of integration between prevailing land law regulations in
country and policy of financing institution to promote Project benefits to PAPs to
normalize their living upon removal in the least time.

The anticipated impacts of canal dredging are identified from detailed measurement
survey (DMS) of assets and land property to be removed from dredged areas and spoil
relocation areas along Project canal.

-    Based on approved detailed technical design, no land acquisition is required during
     deepening dredging. Some four houses will be removed to enlarge sight view of
     shipmaster at canal confluence Ganh Hao ­ Bac Lieu.

-    There are some 500 ha of land used as temporary spoil relocation areas (SRAs)
     without transferring of land - use right. Land owners are entitled to leasing rate
     (through an agreement) and compensation of tree and crop losses even appropriate
     assistance measures.

The Project summary and RAP leaflets will be distributed to PAPs to inform all
concerned people to understand benefits of the Project and the entitlement to be

applied to affected households so as to encourage their participation in the public
consultation in the communes.

The local administrative authorities involved to RAP implementation at various
commune, district and province levels include:

-  Commune resettlement team (CRT)

-  District resettlement Committee (DRC)

-  Provincial Resettlement Committee (PRC)

The above resettlement institutions undertake directly all required RAP activities from
lost asset measurement, entitlements, recommendation of appropriate rehabilitation
assistance, grievances and redressal. PMU-Waterways as an implementation agency of
the Project works closely with locals and PAPs to ensure RAP to be carried out
properly.

The monitoring of RAP implementation will be assigned to an external independent
agency for periods of dredging and post-dredging (2005). PMU-Waterways undertakes
to RAP 2005 disclosure and dissemination to provincial people's committees before of
dredging.

The Resettlement Action Plan - 2005 (RAP 2005) provides all guidelines and
requirements to acquire land by transferring of land - use right certificate (L URC) or
land lease before and during the improvement dredging on Ganh Hao - Gia Rai
section.

RAP 2005 was revised and updated from RAP 2003 applied to dredging of extension
waterway sections (Kien Luong to Ha Tien and Ca Mau to Nam Can). The dredging of
Ganh Hao - Gia Rai aims at deepening of navigable channel without widening
therefore it reduces almost structures and land losses.

RAP 2005 will be applied to carry out:

- Removal of houses encroaching and obstructing navigation.
- Lease of land for spoil relocation areas (SRAs).


1.1.   Purpose and scope of work:

Purpose: deepening dredging, navaid procurement and installation on Ganh Hao - Gia
Rai section in purpose of navigation improvement

Scope of work:
(i)   Dredging on 53.7 km (from Ganh Hao to Gia Rai) with total cubic meter
      1,910,000 (m3), of which 7km of Ganh Hao river with 150,000m3 and 46.7 km of
      Bac Lieu - Ca Mau canal with 1,760,000 m3 under standards of canal class III
      (B=22m; T=2.7m; V= 7m; H=30m). Canal is only deepened without widening.

(ii)  Navaid will be installed all over the section to enable safe navigation in day and
      night time of all year round.


Dredging will be executed along the existing alignment of navigable channel.

                                                                           Type of

1.2.   Physical conditions of works sites:

Works sites are characterized by rice plain affected by semi-diurnal tide. There are
neither forests nor dense vegetation in both sides of the canal. National Road #1 is in
one side while rice field is in opposite side of the canal. There are some small internal
towns with houses in the water frontage of the canal confluences. Soils in both sites
are acid sulfate soil (ASS).

1.3.   Socio-economic survey of PAPs:

The socio-economic survey of the PAPs under the project component was carried out
together with DMS survey. The socio-economic survey will provide a baseline of
social group to draw­up appropriate policy and adequate plan of PAPs rehabilitation.

The socio-economic survey focused on family composition, occupations, income,
access to utilities such as water and electricity, distance to school and government
offices, and ethnicity. The combined data of socio-economic survey provides a
detailed insight of PAPs and the impact of the project on their existence.

There are only four PAPs affected by additional dredging work that are tolled and
characterized socio-economically as follows:

- Race: Viet (75%) ­ Chinese (25%); Age >18 =93% - Age <18 = 7%
- Occupation: trad e (retailed) 2 PAPs (50%); retired (1PAPs); employee (1PAPs)
- Education: Students (7%)

                   CHAPTER 3: THE PROJECT IMPACTS


Improvement dredging does not require widening of channel; hence there are no land
acquisition and no land loss in general. There are only four PAPs having houses built
on water frontage which will be removed before dredging.

Land for spoil relocation areas: negotiation will be encouraged between Contractor
and landowner due to it does not request to transfer of LURC. PAPs benefits for
possessing fill spoil and rising of land bed. Their low-yield land will be improved its
productivity after filling of bottom logs.

3.1. Structure /house loss:

Most structure/house loss is house and warehouse to classify as partial or sever loss.
-  House loss: There is one PAPs is fully affected auxiliary house (4 x 6 = 24 m2) but
   remaining land is sufficient for reorganizing (HH Cao Tu Hung). There are two
   PAPs are partially affected houses (HH Huynh Cong Dung and HH Nguyen Binh
   Thu).
-  Structure loss: There are two PAPs are fully affected on warehouses and to be
   relocated. In fact, these families possess two stable houses of Class IV located in
   the internal land along Ganh Hao river. The details are:
   · HH Phung Ngoc Mai, the area of the main house (7.6 x 12 = 91.2 m2) built on a
     land of the total area of (12 x 20 = 240 m2).
   · HH Cao Tu Hung, the area of the main house (12 x 16 = 192m2) built on a land
     of the total area of (24 x 30 = 720 m2).
   The main houses and residential lands of these HH are not affected by dredging for
   Ganh Hao-Gia Rai section; therefore residential plot allocation is not necessary.
   Moreover, these warehouses were built over the water for trading of foodstuff for
   shrimps and cattle with local boats. The warehouses were temporarily built of
   corrugated iron roof, wooden wattle and planking on the wooden piles. Being built
   over the water, these warehouses obstruct the navigation of boats and vessels
   traveling across the confluence of Ganh Hao river and Bac Lieu - Ca Mau Canal.
   Therefore, they need to be relocated. These HH will be entitled to compensation
   for their affected warehouses and will be entitled to shifting allowance and special
   allowance for business income loss to order their business in the unaffected houses
   in land.

3.2. Land loss: none

3.3. Tree and crop loss: none. In case of land lease, any loss of crops by cultivation,
farmers are entitled to compensation at current market prices under the same
compensation policy applied to PAPs.

Entitlement Matrix) as below:

  5     Number of PAPs having impacted crops andtrees                       0

Compensation and rehabilitation assistance applied to these PAPs will be identified in
Chapter 9.

3.4. Mitigation measures:

In technical design work, the following approach criteria are strictly considered to
minimize possible impacts:

- Reduce bottom width to 22m; slope: 1/1/or less providing that no widening of
   canal banks is required.

- Remove only households having houses built over and obstructed navigable
   channel to enlarge the sight view of skippers.

3.5. Land acquisition:

- Noland acquiredis requiredfor canal dredging.
- Land for spoil relocation: Dredging of two main waterways was experienced that
   leasing of land with limited time and without change of land -use right is a
   successful option, PAPs having this type of land leasing will have a chance to
   improve the ir low-yield or uncultivated land into productive or residential land
   after filling by dredged spoil, therefore the Project will not acquire land for spoil
   relocation.
