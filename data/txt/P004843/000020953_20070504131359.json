Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) Differences on matters of policy between the\n            Borrower and IDA would best be resolved prior to Board\n            presentation; 2) Resettlement in the project took longer to\n            complete than expected. Ideally, resettlement should have\n            been completed before the award of contracts whose execution\n            could be affected by the resettlement process; 3) For future\n            dredging operations, it may be helpful to include\n            hydrographic surveys in the scope of work of supervision\n            consultants. Dredging operations could have been expedited\n            if the quality and timeliness of surveys prior to and post\n            dredging had been better; 4) Cargo handling facilities\n            should be designed not only in accordance with engineering\n            standards but to also take into account the services to be\n            provided; 5) Competitive Bidding Benefits both Cost and\n            Quality; and 6) In the future, modal administrations should\n            take a much more central role in managing waterways projects\n            and dictating their direction. This would increase ownership\n            of the infrastructure and the desire to maintain it."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
