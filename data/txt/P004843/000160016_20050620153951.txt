           IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
                                       ASSESSEMENT

The Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project has set up an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report, which has been approved by the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) in March 1999.

At present, this project has been expanded an Additional Dredging Works of the
Ganh Hao - Gia Rai extension canal. Following the guidelines of Vietnam and the
World Band (WB), this environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the additional
works is prepared.


1.1     OBJECTIVES               OF        THE           ENVIRONMENTAL             IMPACT
        ASSESSMENT

This EIA report is to clarify the issues as follows.

-   Brief description of the additional works of the project.

-   Brief description of the existing environment of the additional sites of the
    project and its surroundings.

-   Identification, assessment and prediction of main impacts that the project may
    cause to the environment in the phases of pre-construction, construction and
    operation.

-   Proposal of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) including measures for
    mitigating the negative impacts, and an environmental monitoring program for
    the project.

-   Recommendation of public consultation for the project.


1.2     LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK

1.2.1 World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment

Environmental Assessment (January, 1999). This describes guidance on Bank's
policies and procedures for conducting environmental assessments of proposed
projects.

Additional World Bank policies that were considered through the EA process for
this project include:

-   OP 4.04 Natural Habitats
-   OP 4.11 Cultural Property
-   BP 17.50 Public Disclosure

1.2.2 Vietnamese Policy and Administrative Framework on Environmental
        Assessment

· Vietnamese Policy Framework

Vietnam's most relevant environmental policies for environmental assessment are
as follows:

Law on Environmental Protection (LEP) was enacted in January 1994

The LEP:

-   Identifies the responsibilities of the state centre, provinces, organisations and
    individuals to prevent and remedy environmental deterioration and pollution
    and carry out specified environmental protection functions;

-   Provides for the development of environmental standards and submission of
    environmental impact assessment reports on new and existing facilities;

-   Provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;

-   Establishes the right of individuals and organisations to petition for enforcement
    of environmental regulations;

-   Calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations; and

-   Encourages international environmental co-operation.

Decree 175/CP was promulgated in October 18, 1994 by the Government to guide
implementation of the LEP and provides broad guidelines for division of
responsibility among Ministries; environmental impact assessments; pollution
prevention and disaster control; sources of finance; and environmental inspections
and standards.

Circular No. 490 was promulgated in April 29 1998 by the MOSTE to provide
guidance on setting up and appraising environmental impact assessment reports for
investment projects. The Circular identifies the legal requirements according to the

___________________________________________________________________                        1-2
CHAPTER ONE

_______________________________________________________________________________________

stages of implementation of a project and its category; defines the content of project
subject to the EIA procedures; and specifies management of the EIA report
appraisal.

Law on Forest Protection (1992), this law regulates forest management, protection,
development, and exploitation, prevention of wood-cutting, and forest destruction.
It also encourages individuals and organisations to protect and develop forests.

Decree 24/2000/ND-CP specifies the implementation on the Law on Foreign
Investment in Vietnam (Article 82) concerning environmental protection as follows:
1) enterprises with foreign investment capital and joint ventures are obligated to
observe regulations, satisfy standards in environment protection, and comply with
Vietnam legislation on environment protection; 2) if investors apply international
advanced environmental standards these standards should be registered with
MOSTE.

Decree 52/1999/ND-CP was appended to include environmental considerations for
construction management as follows: 1) for PFS, Provision 3 of Article 23
stipulates that requirements for environment study relating to the "selection of
construction sites, estimation of land use area needed, in ways which comply to the
principle of minimizing land use and environmental and social impacts, and
resettlement to the lowest possible level". 2) Provisions 4 and 7 of Article 24
stipulate that FS must propose "specific site options (or regions, routes) which much
match with construction plans (including documents on site selection, together with
proposed solutions for minimizing environmental and social impacts)", and
"architectural alternatives, construction solutions, preliminary designs suggested for
selection, environment management and protection solutions". 3) For technical
design: Section B, Provision 1, Article 37 and Section A, Provision 2, Article 38,
contain regulations on appraisal and approval of "techniques for the protection of
environment and ecology; for prevention and combating of explosion and fire and
for occupational safety and industrial sanitation."

Decree 26/1996/CP provides regulations on the punishment of administrative
violation of Environmental Protection Law. Chapter 1 describes the general
provisions for punishment under the Environment Protection Law. Chapter 2,
Article 6 details recommended punishments for parties who violate environmental
pollution and prevention act. These punishments include financial penalties for not
submitting an EIA report.

Vietnam Standards for the Environment (TCVN) are national standards published by
MOSTE in 1995, 2000 and 2001 and applied to all government and non-
government agencies, organisations and companies. The Vietnamese environmental
standards include acceptable limits of pollutants in ambient air, air emission, surface
water, ground water, waste waters, soils, etc. In general the list of physical -
chemical parameters are broad enough such that most monitoring programmes can
employ the standards for of evaluation. There are some exceptions - for example,

sediment, biological, and vibration standards do not yet exist. In these cases, it is
common practice for ODA projects to use standards fro m other countries or
international organisations.

· Vietnamese Administrative Framework

The Government of Vietnam is in the process of creating a new administrative
framework for environmental management. For the Additional Works Project, the
framework's relevant institutes are as follows:

Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE). MONRE was
established by a Prime Ministerial Decision on November 11, 2002. This new
ministry includes four vice-ministers, 16 departments, one newspaper, and one
magazine. MONRE merges numerous departments from several national agencies.
These are outlined in Decree 91/2002/ND-CP: Providing for the functions, duties,
powers and organisational structure of the Ministry of Natural Resources and the
Environment.

Environmental Impact Assessment and Appraisal Department. This Department is
under MONRE. According to Decree 91/2002/ND-CP, the Department's function
includes: To appraise environmental impact assessment reports of projects and of
business and production establishments. Environmental Impact Assessment and
Appraisal Department is guided by the Vietnam's established regulatory
framework: i.e. LEP, Circular 490, CP 175, etc.

Provincial Departments of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE). Each
provincial DONRE houses an Environmental Management Division (EMD). The
EMD is responsible for ensuring environmental protection and management of
provincial matters in accordance with LEP, Decree 175, and Circular 490. Hence, it
is DONRE - and in particular, its EMD - that will likely play a key regulatory role
during project construction and operation.


1.3     EIA ORGANISATION


The Project Owner (PMU - Waterway) in collaboration with the EPC of the
Vietnam Environment & Sustainable Development Institute has conducted various
field surveys on the natural and socio-economic environment, sampling, analysis of
environmental samples, desk studies and prepared EIA report. Various meetings
with the project effected households (PAHs) and representatives of local
organizations were held during the EIA study process.

· Rapid assessment

Methods of rapid assessment applicable to source of pollution in conjunction with
air, land and water, prepared by Economopoulos, and issued by the WHO in 1993.

· Public consultation

Organizing public consultation for environmental impact assessment. In this process
of public consultation procedure was followed the WB guideline.

1.5     CLASSIFICATION OF IMPACTS

In this study, the anticipated negative environmental impacts are classified into five
categories: "major", "moderate" "minor", practically "not significant" or "no
impact" and "unknown impacts".

-   A "major impact" can change an element of the environment or create a strong
    environment modification. Such an impact can strongly affect an environmental
    component and/or on a large group of the population.

-   A "moderate impact" can change a part of the environmental component or
    creates a moderate environmental modification. Such an impact can significantly
    affect an environmental component or on a group of the population.

-   A "minor impact " may slightly change value or use of an environmental
    component. Such as impact can slightly affect an environmental component or a
    small group of the population.

-   A "not signification or no impact" may not significantly chance value or use of
    an environmental component. Environmental assessment will not be detailed but
    some commentaries may be given for this type of impacts.

-   Some activities of the project may cause some impacts but the magnitude of the
    impacts can not be predicted. This type of impacts is identified as "unknown
    impact ".

In each type of impacts, there are "negative" and "positive" ones.

Beside the 5 categories, each impact may be assessed as "mitigable", "controllable"
or "uncontrollable", "local", "temporary", "short-term" or "long-term", depending
on the intensity and scale of the impact.

Based on the impact classification in the Environmental Management Plan different
measures will be recommended to mitigate different types of impacts.

-   No impact or No significant impacts: These impacts do no need to have
    measures for mitigation.

-   Minor and moderate impacts: For this type of impacts, the appropriate measures
    for mitigation should be developed.

-   Major impacts: it is necessary to have more detailed information and
    quantification of impacts, and measures for mitigation have to be designed more
    carefully during project preparation and construction.

-   Unknown impacts: it is necessary to have further study to know the nature and
    scale of the impact.

  OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT FOR ADDITIONAL DREDGING OF
        THE WATERWAY SECTION OF GANH HAO ­ GIA RAI

2.1    TITLE

The project for additional dredging of the waterway section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai
is a part of the project for upgrading two southern waterways and Can Tho port.

2.2    INVESTOR


The Project Management Unit for Waterway Projects (PMU) ­ the Ministry of
Transport, 131 Nguyen Trai, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City.
Tel.: 8365148,         Fax: 8365149


2.3    NECESSITY OF INVESTMENT

The investment in dredging of the waterway section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai will
create favorable conditions for the inflow of goods to the two inland waterways,
and at the same time, contribute to the socio-economic development of Ca Mau
peninsula.

2.4    OUTLINE OF TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Technical specifications such as the depth, width, straightening, and curving of the
canal as well as the new system of marking buoys for the two extended waterways
are designed so as to meet standards on canal grade III (Vietnamese standard 5664 -
1992). The investment in dredging of the waterway section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai
will create favorable conditions for the inflow of goods to the two inland
waterways

The main contents of the project are as follows:

(i)    Upgrading the canal of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai, which is 53,7km long and
       necessitate the dredging volume of 1,910,000 m3.

(ii)   Upgrading the signaling system so as to streamline the waterway.


Dredging:
-   The section from Ganh Hao to Gia Rai (from the juncture of Luong The Tran
    canal to Gia Rai), 53.7km in length, in order to meet the technical specifications

   applicable to rivers and canals of grade 3 with adjusted depth (B1 = 22m;
   LAD= 2,7m; clearance 7.0 m) with two sub-sections:

  (i)   The sub-section overlapping the Ganh Hao river: about 7 km long, from the
        juncture of Luong The Tran canal (Km 336 + 800 EX) to the juncture of
        Ganh Hao­ Bac Lieu canal ­ Ca Mau; dredging volume: 150,000 m3.

    (ii) The sub-section overlapping Bac Lieu canal ­ Ca Mau: from the juncture
         with the Ganh Hao river to the juncture of Cong Cai Cung canal (Gia Rai
         district, Bac Lieu province): 46.7 km long; dredging volume: 1,760,000 m3.
-  Dredging is for deepening without expanding.

Signaling system:

-  A complete signaling system is invested to secure the streamline and safe traffic
   on the waterway in both daytime and nighttime.

Dredging method:

The soils to be dredged are both acid sulphate and non-acid sulphate, dredging
therefore includes the jobs as follows:

-  The dredged soil should be discharged to spoil relocation areas (SRAs), which
   are designed specifically therefore and sufficiently large.

-  The acid sulphate soil discharged to SRAs should be covered with and thereby
   maintained under a 0.5 m-thick layer of non-acid sulphate soil. This is also to
   prevent acid sulphates from crystallization on soil surface.

-  SRAs should be embanked with protective dikes and the water therefore should
   be controlled. Protective dikes should be 0.5 m higher than the discharged soil.

-  A ditch should be built around mud yards for collecting muddy water. It should
   be connected with the main irrigation ditch for driving both muddy water and
   rainwater back to the waterway.

a) Spoil relocation areas

The function thereof is to mitigate the negative impacts of mud and dredged soil on
the environment. Most dredged soil is disposed in dike-protecting SRAs so as
neither to neither damage crops and plants nor leak muddy water to canals. SRAs
are designed with two parts, one for storing and another for settling.

SRAs are designed optionally according to the available land. Although their
dimension and shape are not fixed, mud yards should have protective dikes as given

in Fig. The dike body (particularly at the points on deep pits or ponds) should be
reinforced with cajuput stakes and bamboo grids.

b) Selection of position for SRAs:

Because the dredging will expand the left bank of the canal of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai
(in opposite to National Road 1), SRAs should be positioned on the left bank. They
should be positioned every 1,000 m from each other and at most 500 m from the
bank. The area of a SRA may be 1 ­ 2 ha.

SRAs should be positioned at hollow regions, where agriculture is neither easy nor
effective. Detailed matters in relation with positions of SRAs will be solved and the
damages resulted from using the land as SRAs will be determined during
implementation of the project.

                                CHAPTER THREE

        THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT IN THE PROJECT SITE

3.1 THE PROJECT SITE

The waterway link s Bac Lieu province with Ca Mau province. The project site
starts from An Trach commune in Dong Hai district let to the Ganh Hao River in
Ca Mau City. The canal section to be dredged is about 25 km long and the dredging
will give condition for local economic development. A diagram showing the project
site is given in Fig. 3.1.

3.2 NATURAL CONDITIONS

3.2.1 Topography

As a wetland, Ca Mau Province has a low and comparatively plan terrain (average
altitude: 0.6-1.5m) which is always suffered the influence of the sea and inundated
in the rainy season. It is defined that wetland are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or
water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or
flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low
tide does not exceed 6 meters (UNEP). Wetlands include the regions temporarily or
frequently inundated such as rice field, waterlogged forest, mangrove forest or
surfaces of lake, river and the like. Ca Mau has a wide wetland area (mangrove
forest and acidic water logged melaleuca forest) with very specific natural
ecosystems.

Over the project site (the section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai), the topographical
features include waterlogged area during the flood tide and well irrigated thank to
large tidal amplitude and big rivers as discharge channels to the sea. The region
incurs saline intrusion over the whole section all year round and even in the end of
the rainy season, salinity of the river water is still high.

Ca Mau has a system of interlacing rivers and canals with many estuaries such as
Ong Doc, Bay Hap, Ong Trang, Bo De, and Ganh Hao, etc. The rivers there have
the water regime dependent on the tidal characteristics of the sea and create a well-
developed system of waterway.

3.2.2 Climate

Ca Mau is located in the Mekong Delta then it suffers the influence of tropical
monsoon. The air convection in the delta influenced mainly by NE and SW winds,
forming two distinctive seasons, the rainy season from May to October (concurring
with the W and SW), and the dry season from December to March (concurring with

the E and NE). April and November are the two transitions between the two
seasons. In the rainy season there usually is a sunny of 2 to 3 weeks in August or
September that is called the draught of "Ba Chang".

· Temperature

The annual average of temperature in Ca Mau in 2000 is 27.3oC and relatively
stable in the period from 1997 to 2000.

The temperature variation in the hottest and the coldest months is within 4oC,
whereas the temperature difference between the daytime and the nighttime is large,
about 8 -10oC in the dry season. The highest temperature is 38.3oC and the lowest
15.3oC.

The total temperature accumulation is approximately 8,500 -10,000oC.

· Rainfall

Because of geographical factors, the distribution of rain in Ca Mau varies together
with not only the season but also the locations of regions from Southwest to
Northeast.

The rainfall is high but its distribution in a year is uneven with the rainfall in the
rainy season making up more than 90% of the total.

The rainfall in Ca Mau is usually the highest in the Mekong Delta, varying from
1,500 to 2,300 mm, being divided in 3 distinctive regions, namely the west with the
highest rainfall of 1,500-2,300 mm, the center 1,500-1,800 mm and the east with
the lowest, approximately 1,500 mm.

· Average humidity and evaporation

The annual average humidity in Ca Mau is 85.2 %, higher than other regions such
as Rach Gia (82%). The annual average of evaporation in Ca Mau is approximately
992mm. The changes in climate parameters in Ca Mau over many years are shown
in Table 3.1.

3.2.3 Hydrology

· Hydrological characteristics of Ca Mau province

Ca Mau is under two tidal regimes. The hydrological regime is clearly different
between the eastern and the Western coasts (Ca Mau has 254 km of coast, of which
the Eastern makes up 107 km and the Western 147 km). The interference of the
Eastern Sea with the semi-diurnal tide and the Western sea with the diurnal tide
gives favorable conditions for biodiversity and advantages for regions of
environmental sensitivity and high-value of biota sources. Particularly, the
formation of the swamps in the West of Ngoc Hien district that moves forwards to
the sea contributes to the expansion of land and development of wetland
ecosystems.

The tidal regime of the Western and Eastern seas controls almost all the rivers in
the province (except for Quan Lo Phung Hiep, an area newly freshened in 1997 -
1998). However, the tidal regime of the Eastern has stronger influence than that of
the Western one. A study into the movement of water in rivers shows that water
flows mainly from the Eastern Sea to the Gulf of Thailand because the water level
in the Eastern Sea is higher.

3.3 LAND

3.3.1 Land use

- Agricultural land:

The area of agricultural land changed significantly in 2001 with the soaring of land
for aquaculture (mainly shrimp farming) and the drop of the areas for cultivation of
rice and industrial crops.

- Forestry land:

Forest land in Ca Mau includes mangrove forest and melaleuca forest, respectively
61.6% and 38.4% of the total. In details, it is distributed in districts of Ngoc Hien
with 50,723 ha, U Minh 32.499 ha, Dam Doi 7.985 ha, Tran Van Thoi 8,124 ha,
Thoi Binh 99 ha, and Cai Nuoc 5.386 ha. Forest over 50% at Ngoc Hien and 34.2%
at U Minh districts.

- Specific land:

The area of specific land in the province in 2000 was 17,024ha. In 2001, it was
expanded by 3,000ha to 19,500 ha, mostly by the use of land for irrigation,
transportation, construction, national defense and construction ofcemeteries.

- Residential land:

The area of land for settlement is on the rise because of the increasing population
and urbanization. By the end of 2000, this kind of land covered 5,501ha,
accounting for 1% of the total land. It can be divided into two types:

-  Urban land: mainly in Ca Mau City (636 ha) and small areas in districts,
-  Rural land: 4,865 ha, in details, it consists of 930 ha in Ngoc Hien, 900 ha in
   Tran Van Thoi, 602 ha in U Minh, 867 ha in Thoi Binh, and 852 ha in Dam Doi.
   Rural land in the province is usually located along canals and roads.

- Unused land: While the residential and specializing land is expanding, the unused
land is shrinking. In 2000, unused land in Ca Mau covered 40,769 ha, which was
not concentrated by scattered alongside canals, interposing in agricultural land,
including saline - or acid - contaminated land, warp and the like. In details, it
included 3,696 ha in U Minh, 2.748 ha in Dam Doi, 1.386 ha in Thoi Binh, 5.148
ha in Cai Nuoc and 3.982 ha in Tran Van Thoi district.

The changes in land over years are shown in Table 3.3.

Administration.

3.3.2 Kinds of soil in Ca Mau province

From statistical data it is possible to divide land in Ca Mau province into 4 groups
of soils as follows:

· Saline soil

Accounting for 28.84% of the total, this cover 150,278ha, of which 82,351 ha has
medium salinity, 57,987ha has low salinity and heavy salinity is found in the
remainder, which further includes the land under wetland. Wetland is distributed
mainly in the coast of the Eastern Sea and the South of Ca Mau, in districts of Dam
Doi, Cai Nuoc, Ngoc Hien and Tran Van Thoi.

The saline soil in the province has similar fertility. The content of organic matter is
medium to low (<4.2%OM), the total nitrogen is low (<0.2%N), and in opposite,
the total phosphorus is higher than other kinds of land in the region (>0.08%), the
total potassium is very high in the inundated saline land (>0.15%K2O) and low in
the slightly saline land (<0.6% K2O).

Pertaining to mechanical physical characteristics, almost all kinds of saline soil
have the same size distribution with the dominance of clay (50-60%). Consequently,
in the dry season land is chapped and salt (NaCl) is brought to the surface layer by
capillarity.

· Acid sulfate soil

This covers some 334,925 ha, accounting for 64.27% of the total. This soil has a
constraint for use, because of its toxic ingredients such as Al3+, Fe2+, SO4 ... It is
                                                                                   2-

also saline in the dry season and influenced by the tidal inundation. According to
I.P. Abrol, and CP. Moclu (1985), under tropical conditions, the accumulation of Fe
and Al cat ions in this kind of soil gradually increases and the cat ions combine

with ions such as Cl-, SO4 forming acidic salts Fe2(SO4)3, Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3 ... and
                             2-

all may cause environmental impacts.

Acid sulfate soil in Ca Mau can be further divided into two sub-groups, namely
potential and actual ones, the former covers 147,039 ha, accounting for 47.409% of
the province and the latter 87,886 ha and accounting for 16.866%.

This soil, however, has high potential fertility with the rich organic content of 4-
12% OM equivalent, high total nitrogen (N: 0.2-0.3%), potassium (0.5-2%), and
comparatively low phosphorus (0.04-0.09%). The high contents of alkaline cations,
inclusive of Ca2+, Mg2+ mean the soil incurs the influence of saline water.

Acid sulfate soil in Ca Mau is distributed mainly in districts of U Minh (43,853 ha),
Thoi Binh (66,307 ha), Tran Van Thoi (30,508 ha), Dam Doi (44,783 ha). In Ngoc
Hien and Cai Nuoc, the area of acid sulfate soil is smaller.

The acid sulfate soil in U Minh, where is also a great source of peat, usually located
under the peat layer, at the depth of 1-3 m, equal to the underground water level in
the dry season. Therefore, exploitation of peat may release acid sulfates and cause
pollution as a result of oxidation of pyrite to jarosite.

· Peat soil

Covering 2.03% of the province, this is considered a big mine of organic minerals.
It was formed thank to natural conditions with vegetations buried and inundated
anaerobically for a long time. However, this resource has decreased out quickly due
to destruction of mangrove forest (U Minh forest) and up to now, its reserve is as
small as 40-50 million tons (compared with 300 million tons in the past), mostly in
U Minh plantations 1, 2, 3 and Tran Van Thoi plantation.

Peat in Ca Mau was formed from marsh in the form of bed and riverbed. A study
with geological drills shows that:

-   At the depth of 0-0.5m, it is brown, light, soft and mixed with vegetation bodies.
-   From 0.5 to 1m, it is black and sometimes under which is a layer of vegetation
    decay.
-   From 1 to 3m is a layer of sticky pasty wet bluish gray clay with vegetation
    decay.

Under the peat layer is usually the layer of potential sulfate acid soil with high
pyrite (FeS2), which, in the reaction under the sun and with oxygen in the air is
oxidized easily to jarosite, acidifying the surrounding water and soil. This
phenomenon is very popular in the areas where peat is exploited, exposed to the air
or where fire of woods occurs.

· Swampy soil

This is the soil newly formed along the coast. It covers some 9.057 ha, accounting
for 1.82% of the province. It concentrates mostly in districts of Ngoc Hien (7.632
ha), and Cai Nuoc (1.875 ha). Together with the formation of swamps the
formation and development of the wetland vegetation populations occur, which are
also favorable conditions for the reproduction and growth of brackish and saline
fish species. Therefore, it is essential to protect strictly the originality of the saline
swamps for the quick formation of wetland ecosystems in the coast of Ca Mau.

The velocity of encroachment of swamps on the sea over periods is as follows:

-  1930-1965: 15.3 m/year
-  1965-1985: 26.6 m/year
-  1985-1991: 38.2 m/year
-  1991-1998: 30 m/year

On average, the expansion of swamps is 136 ha per year.


3.4 FOREST RESOURCES

Due to various reasons, by far there remains only a limited area of natural forest in
Ca Mau. The existing is mostly newly planted or secondary exhausted forest with
low reserves and small areas. Furthermore, the 5th Storm (Linda storm) in 1997
destroyed at least 5,000 ha of rich forest with half a million of trees then the forests
in Ca Mau remain no more than 1,495,986m3, i.e. 15.8m3/ha on average. Plantation
and restoration of forests are frequent and active tasks of local authorities. The
production and the policy on allocation of forest land to inhabitants have been new
economic motives. However, the quality of forest has dropped drastically and the
property of forest was fully changed. In recent years, forestation and restoration
have received special attention from leaders of the province and obtained many
results. The changes in forestation in Ca Mau province over years are as follows:

3.4.1 Biodiversity of Ca Mau wetland

In Ca Mau, up to 98% of 5,211 km2 of the wetland is inundated, seasonally or
permanently, with natural ecosystems as follows:

       - Wetland,
       - Marsh and waterlogged forest,
       - Estuary.

Each ecosystem has specific value and functions but all these ecosystems are very
sensitive, any change in environmental conditions will break up their stability.

The wetland has large vegetation and wild animal diversities, stable function of
coastal protection and consolidation. The mangrove forest develops on tidal
marshes, forming tree walls, protecting the coastline against the erosion of waves
and destruction of flood. It is also the reproduction places of fish, amphibians,
reptiles, mammals and birds species.

The waterlogged forest provides for local peoples wild animals and vegetation with
fresh or brackish water species all year round. It limits the acidification of soil,
creating a thick vegetation carpet, preventing the oxidation of pyrite layers. With
stable sufficient water, it gives places for fish to lay eggs, others to reside and local
inhabitants can live on it by jobs such as breeding fish, shrimp and bee, making
coal, etc. Overall, it provides for local residents with raw materials, food,
entertainment and jobs.

The estuarine ecosystem is one of the most diverse and aggressive one. However, it
is also easily polluted by the human activities and changes in water regimes.

3.4.2 Flora

According to data provided by the Center for Mangrove Forest Research and
Application of Minh Hai, the total species of vegetation of ecosystems in Ca Mau
province are 239 of 76 families, of which:

- Fern: 19 species of 09 families.
- Dicotyledonous: 139 species of 51 families, including:

       -   Xylophyte: 43 species of 21 families
       -   Shrub: 17 species of 10 families
       -   Liana: 24 species of 10 families
       -   Herbage: 55 species of 15 families

- Cotyledons: 81 species of 16 families, including:

       -   Gramineous: 68 species of 15 families
       -   Liana: 03 species of 2 families
       -   Xylophyte: 03 species of 01 families

Those species mainly distribute on the two ecosystems, namely the mangrove forest
and the melaleuca forest. There are some species that can live in both regions. In
both ecosystems, species can be present over the whole forest, including the tidal
water logged regions and the high impacted land, i.e. degenerated with no forest.

The reduction of area and quality of the forests is the main cause of the decrease in
biodiversity and vegetation.

Species of wild animals distribute differently in 2 ecosystems: mangrove forest and
melaleuca forest.

The melaleuca forest has diverse species composition and number. According to a
study of the EPC and WWF in 1998: in the Vo Doi forest there were 12 amphibian
species, 32 reptile species, 100 bird species, and 18 mammal species. Besides, there
were some rare and precious species such as boar, monkey, and birds. Now animals
in melaleuca forests decrease significantly in quantity. No more tiger, panther, and
deer are found and there are only a very small number of birds listed in the
Vietnamese Red Data Book.

In Ca Mau province there were 21 bird sanctuaries, of which 1 is semi-natural, 3
abandoned (Dam Doi, Cha La, and Ho Thi Ky) and 3 uninvestigated. In general,
the sanctuaries are owned by local inhabitants, who, unfortunately, have poor aware
of natural resource management, and therefore no aware of protection. Besides,
careless hunting and exploitation of forest for sale or making shrimp ponds did
eradicate 10 bird sanctuaries. Some rare bird species which years ago existed in Ca
Mau such as Pelecanus onocrotalus, Ibis leu cocephalus, Leptoptilos dubius are no
longer observed.

However, some migrant bird species choose Ca Mau to live. The saline swamps
which now is returned to be a natural system, will be attractive to aquatic bird
species because foods at the swamps are abundant.

Comment

Considering the aforementioned analyses, it is possible to bring out some
comments on the water quality of the section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai as follows:

- Turbidity

Turbidity measured along the river was 115-167 mg/l. It was high at almost all
measuring points.

- Suspended solid (SS)

The total suspended solid measured in the river was in the range of 35 ­ 54 mg/l.
As such, the concentration of suspended solid in the river still met the Vietnamese
Standard (TCVN 5942-1995 stipulates it at 80 mg/l for Source Class B), which is
shown in Annex 3.1.

- Dissolved oxygen (DO)

The measured concentration of dissolved oxygen met the Vietnamese standard
(TCVN 5942-1995 stipulates on Source Class B at 2mg/l).

- Nitrous, nitrate and ammonia concentrations

The nitrate concentration (NO3 ) varied in the range of 0.42-0.87 mg/l, which is still
                                  -

acceptable according to the Vietnamese Environmental Standard (TCVN 5942-
1995, stipulates it at < 10mg/l).

The nitrous concentration (NO2 ) varied in the range of 0.005 to 0.009 mg/l, lower
                                   -

than the Vietnamese Environmental Standard (TCVN 5942-1995 on Source Class
B is 0.05 mg/l).

- Organic pollution

The COD concentration of the river met the Vietnamese Standard (TCVN 5942-
1995: <35mg/l).

The BOD concentration measured in the river was lower than the Vietnamese
Standard (TCVN 5942-1995: <25 mg/l).

- Total Coliform

All monitoring points showed high concentrations of coliforms, even higher than
the Vietnamese Standard on Source Class B (TCVN 5942-1995: 10.000
MPN/100ml) at several points.

       The obtained data shows that the concentration of heavy metals such as Pb,
Cr, Hg in the project area is relative lower than the Dutch Standard for Sediment
(Appendix 3.2). However, to assess the impact to water environment, aquatic life
and aqua faming in the operation phase, the project will monitor the contamination
of heavy metals in water canal to inform timely to the local authorities.

Considering the species composition, it is possible to remark as follows:

-  The group of dominant saline species include Cyclotella                      stylorum,
   Coscinodiscus asreromphalus, Coscinodiscus radiatus, Coscinodiscus subtilis,
   Chaetoceros compactum, Biddulphia obtusa, Triceratium favus, Synedra ulna,
   Nitzschia sigma, Nitzschia lorenziana, Pyrophacus horologium ...

-  Cyanophyta ­ a phylum living in fresh water is not observed in the section of
   Bac Lieu ­ Ca Mau during this sampling.

-  The species indicating a nutrient-rich environment include all Cyanophyta
   species, Cyclotella stylorum, Coscinodiscus subtilis, Chaetoceros compactum,
   Synedra ulna, Nitzschia longissima, Nitzschia sigma and also 5 Euglenophyta
   species.

-  There are few species indicating the saline acidic land such as Phormidium
   tenue, Arthrospira gomontiana, Eunotia tautonensis.

-  The species present in almost all sampling points such as Oscillatoria sp1,
   Oscillatoria sp2, Phormidium tenue, Cyclotella stylorum, Coscinodiscus subtilis,
   Nitzschia longissima, Nitzschia sigma are typical of a nutrient-rich environment.

-  The number of phytoplankton species tends to increase along with the direction
   from Bac Lieu to Ca Mau, i.e. in accordance with the population density
   alongside the canal.

-  The density of phytoplankton in the section of the section of Bac Lieu ­ Ganh
   Hao is low, approximately 600.000 ­ 4.050.000 cells/m3, maybe due to the fact
   that disturbed water hinders the growth of phytoplankton. The species typical of
   a nutrient-rich environment are dominant, including Desmogonium, Nitzschia
   longissima, Coscinodiscus radiatus, Oscillatoria lemmermannii, Cyclotella sp.

Zooplankton

In the investigation of the section of Bac Lieu ­ Ganh Hao in December 2004, the
species composition of zooplankton was obtained as follows (Table 3.9).

Table 3.9: Composition of Zooplankton species

 Phylum                            Number of species                    Percentage
 Copepoda                                  5 sp.                           55.6%
 Mysidacea                                 1 sp.                           11.1%
 Larva                                     3 sp.                           33.3%
 Total:                                    9 sp.                          100.0%
Source: EPC ­ VESDEC, December 2004

Considering the results, it is possible to remark as follows:

-   The composition is simple with only copecoda species and one mysidacea
    species all migrate from the sea. Particularly Acartiella sinensis is a copecoda
    species typical of slightly brackish water.

-   Acartia clausi and Oithona similis species are typical of an environment rich
    and polluted by organic matters.

-   The density of zooplankton is high, 11,800 ­ 22.400 individuals/m3, with the
    dominance of the brackish species of Acartia clausi typical of a nutrient-rich
    environment.

Zoobenthos

The number of zoobenthos species observed in the investigation of the section of
Bac Lieu ­ Ganh Hao in December 2004 is as follows (Table 3.10)

Table 3.10: Composition of benthic animals

 Class                             Number of speceis                    Percentage
 Polychaeta                                2 sp.                           25%
 Crustacea                                 5 sp.                           62.5%
 Echinodermata                             1 sp.                           12.5%
 Total:                                    8 sp.                          100.0%

-   The number of zoobenthos species at sampling stations 3 and 4 was more than
    that of the remaining stations. At station 5 there were only 2 polychaeta species.
    Possibly, the bottom mud polluted by the organic matters in the sanitary
    wastewater discharged by too many people living along the canal destructed the

   system of crustacean species that have high demand for oxygen. Therefore,
   there remain only species indicating mesosaprobic environment. Bispira
   polymorpha, a settling polychaeta species, is considered as indicator of -
   mesosaprobic environment (medium polluted).

-  The density of zoobenthos was 80 ­ 7.990 individuals/m2. It was high at stations
   3, 4 and 5 (1,220 ­ 7,990 individuals/m2). From station 3 to station 5, Bispira
   polymorpha sp. was absolutely dominant in term of quantity, accounting for
   55.7 ­ 99.5%.

· Biological parameters

Similarity:

The similarity of aquatic species groups is analyzed for the section of Bac Lieu ­
Ca Mau.

-  Phytoplankton: station 3 and station 4, station 4 and station 5 have high
   similarity (y = 0.56).

-  Zoobenthos: On the basis of the similarity of zoobenthos, the environment of
   the section of Bac Lieu ­ Ca Mau can be divided into two zones:

   · Zone I covering monitoring stations 1 and 2.
   · Zone II covering stations 3, 4 and 5.

Diversity of aquatic organisms

-  It is found that the diversity at stations 1, 2 was high, D = 1.061 ­ 1.265, at
   stations 3, 4, and 5 it was 0.071 ­ 0.454 and it was lowest in station 5 ­ i.e. the
   curve of Ganh Hao in Ca Mau City, D = 0,071. As such, the closer to Ca Mau
   City is, the organic pollution increases.

· Conclusion

1- The environmental background of the section of Bac Lieu ­ Ca Mau is typical
   brackish water with no fresh-water aquatic species.

2- The water in the section of Gia Rai ­ Tac Van (stations 1 and 2) is polluted by
   organic matters at the level of -mesosaprolse ­ and that of the Tac Van ­ Ca
   Mau section is -mesosaprolse.

3.8 WATERWAY

On the basis of the study into the topography of the whole section in December
2004, the actuality of rivers therein is described as follows:

- Bac Lieu ­ Ca Mau section:............................

- The Ganh Hao River:

A natural river with a length of 51.5 Km flows from Ca Mau City to Ganh Hao
estuary, discharging water to the Eastern sea. The river flows mainly in Dam Doi
district and the project section starting from Luong The Tran canal to Bay Hap
canal is 1.4 km long, 140m wide on average and -2.5÷ -3.5m deep (Mui Nai
standard level)

3.9    LAND USE IN THE PROJECT SITE

By site study, it is possible to assess the usage of land along the canal of Ganh
Hao­Gia Rai as follows:

- Existing of house

Ca Mau city covers an area of 24,551 ha square, in there, land is used for
resettlement is about 636 ha in area, the population density of this area is 790
persons per square kilometer in 2004. Actual state of houses land along the Ganh
Hao-Gia Rai canal crosses some communes such as Ba Dinh, Cai Ngang, Tan
Phong, is thinly populated; the population density of this area is 300 - 350 persons
per square kilometer. However, section crosses Ward 7 and Ward 6 of Ca Mau city,
Ganh Hao bridge has a quite dense of houses. Therefore, the project meets with
difficulties in traffic regulation and avoiding of waterway traffic accident.

- Land use

The land use along the Ganh Hao-Gia Rai canal is most used for houses, is distant
the canal of the project about 20-30 meters of the left edge is aquacultural and
agricultural land. However, this area is infected acidic sulfate and salty so
agricultural product is not high, shrimp product is reduced gradually in recent years.
Thus, it is appropriate to use for SRA in this area.

Besides, by surveying at the field it's shown that the traffic of the left edge is rather
difficult, so using excavated soil for upgrading the local traffic system Tac Van to
Tan Phong is appropriately in economy and environment. The constructer unit
should use the area ­ it has distance of 20 meters from the left edge of the canal ­
for the SRA combine to build the rural traffic.

- Agriculture

As a result of quick economic structural change from rice cultivation to shrimp
farming in districts of Dam Doi, Cai Nuoc, Tran Van Thoi and Ca Mau City, the
area and output of rice drop drastically. The area of cultivation in 2001 is estimated
at 131,700 ha and the output of food crops 460.000 tons, i.e. half of that of 2000.
Besides, the area of coconut garden reduced by at least 1,500 ha.

- Forestry

At present, the province has pushed forward the restoration and development of
forest ecosystems (mangrove, melaleuca), diffusing forestation and plantation of
riverside forests. The models of forestation in combination with shrimp farming or
fish farming have given good results and been expanded.

- Aquaculture and fishery

By the end of 2002, there were 20,200 ha of shrimp ponds in the province,
increasing by at least 50,000 over the end of 2000. Of the total, shrimp farming ­
forest accounted for 18,000 ha, shrimp breeding­ orchard 10,000 ha, shrimp
breeding­ rice cultivation 60,000ha, extensive shrimp farming 113,700ha and
intensive (industrial and semi-industrial farming) 300ha. In addition, breeding of
fish in rice fields or cajuput forests is very common. Some models of shrimp
breeding combined with forestation and rice cultivation, coastal breeding of blood
ark-shell, etc. have given good results and been expanded.

Shrimp farms in Ca Mau have quickly developed and by the end of 2001, there
were 741 farms and at least 800 traders involving in spawn, feed, chemical and
biological preparations for shrimp breeding. Concentrated in districts of Ngoc Hien,

Dam Doi, Cai Nuoc and Ca Mau City, etc. they are suppliers for coastal and
transitory areas.

At present, there are 12 companies and 18 enterprises specializing in seafood
processing and hundreds of sale agents (in details, 15 enterprises of shrimp
processing, 1 of fish and 2 of fish powder). Furthermore, 2 enterprises are under
construction (one for processing of shrimp and one for fish powder). In the
province, 06 enterprises met the HACCP standards and received the codes for
exporting to EU market and 2 received ISO 9002 certificates. In general, seafood
companies have actively upgraded their technology so as to meet the new demand
and improve their product quality.

- Industry

The main industries are food and seafood processing, accounting for 94% of the
total industrial production. The remainders include foodstuff, wood proceeding and
mechanical production. The industrial growth over years is as follows: 110.24% in
1996, 98.59% in 1997 and 121.77% in 1998, 106.91% in 1999, 132.37% in 2000
and 112.73% in 2002.

The province has big ability of supply of raw materials and processing as well. At
present, there are 18 seafood enterprises which are capable of processing 40,000
tons of seafood per year.

Some industrial parks were built in Ca Mau City. For instance, industrial parks in
Precincts 1 and 8, the LPG-Electricity-Urea Combination in Ca Mau, the industrial
park of Song Doc (Tran Van Thoi district); ports of Ca Mau (Ca Mau City), Nam

Can, Hon Khoai (Ngoc Hien) are going to operate; particularly, a sugar mill of
1,000 tons of sugarcane per day in Thoi Binh district has operated since 2000.

3.10.2 Social matters

The rate of the poor households in the province is still high, which is about 15.48%
with 34.640 households according to the standard of the Ministry of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs.

The per capita income is low, which is about VND 477,000 per month in 2001,
though it increased by 9,91% over the preceding year.

As for economic integration, Ca Mau with advantages of agriculture, forestry,
fishery and processing of seafood for export has big potentials for integration into
the regional and global eco nomies.

The province also has the conditions for developing the human resources for its
industrialization and modernization on the basis of regional cooperation as well as
in combination with national and international centers for science and technology.
Recently, its education and health care have been improved with special attention
from the provincial authorities. Training of teachers has been standardized.
Sciences and technologies have gradually been absorbed into living to solve hot
issues. Health care has been enhanced and therefore it has contributed to the
protection of community health.

In general, the living standards in Ca Mau are still low and so is the education level.
The provincial economy is still dependent on agriculture and as a result of poor
skills of exploitation and use of natural resources, its development is limited. The
infrastructure is poor and the ability of saving for the development of industry and
service is limited. Being dependent upon on exploitation of natural resources, it
easily causes negative impacts on the nature. Furthermore, the low economic start
point and the increasing population will be the challenges and difficulties of the
province.

            PREDICTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

4.1 IMPACTS DURING DREDGING

4.1.1 Outline of impacts during dredging operation

The environmental impacts caused by dredging operation along the dredging site
are identified as follows:

-  Pollution of rivers and canal water due to dredger operation;

-  Increases in turbidity and concentrations of heavy metals, organic chemicals
   due to disturbance of bottom mud;

-  Water pollution due to effluent returning from the spoil relocation areas (SRAs)
   to canals;

-  Damages to agriculture and fishery due to the farms receive polluted water from
   the dredging canals;

-  Impacts on aquaculture and domestic water supply in case of spillage of effluent
   from SRAs.

4.1.2 Impacts on water quality due to dredging operation

Dredging operation may create the following impacts:

-  Short-term impacts due to dredging activities;

-  Short-term to medium term impact due to oxidation of acid sulphate soil;

-  Water pollution due to turbidity, heavy metals pesticides in the duration of
   dredging operation.


· Impacts by increase in turbidity and suspended solids

In principle, the operation of dredgers will cause an increase in turbidity and
suspended solids (SS), particularly when the canals are dredged with the mud-
suction technique.

The great increase in turbidity, heavy metals and pesticides from canal sediment
during the dredging period can threaten the supply of water for aquaculture and
domestic uses.

The monitoring programs conducted by EPC­VESDEC in various regions when
the upgrading of two Southern waterways and Can Tho port from 2001 to 2003 was
clearly showed turbidity of river water was locally high around the dredging sites
with the interval of 400 to 600m (Table 4.1) and compared with turbidity of the
river before dredging, turbidity at distance over 600m during the dredging
operation was almost the same. It is therefore possible to conclude that turbidity is
high locally around the dredging site only.

The monitoring results of river water quality in dredging sites from 2001 to 2003
are shown in Table 4.1.

Notes:- Site 1: A station located about 600m downstream from the dredger.

        - Site 2: A station located about 400m downstream from the dredger.
        - Site 3: A station located about 200m downstream from the dredger.

        - Site 4: A station located about 200m upstream from the dredger.

        - Site 5: A station located about 400m upstream from the dredger.

        - Site 6: A station located about 600m upstream from the dredger.

The great increase in water pollution because of suspended solid and turbidity may
damage to fish and shrimp. A major part of fish species cannot live in the water
that has the suspended solid concentration of over 2000 mg/L. Therefore, they must
migrate out of the water of high turbidity. High turbidity and suspended solid
concentration hinder oxygen from the air dissolving into water, limit the ability of
fish in preying upon and thereby damage fish.

It is an international experience that dredging with dredging buckets causes lighter
impacts than dredgers.

· Disturbance of bottom sediment and increase of toxic pollutants

The construction and dredging activities will move bottom mud to banks and move
soil at two banks. They may significantly increase in suspended solid as well as
pollutants from bottom mud and from acid sulfate soil at the banks.

The disturbance of bottom mud and acid sulfate soil will acidify and reduce pH of
the canal water, thereby increase in concentrations of metals (iron, aluminum and
heavy metals) in canal water. In some other sections, the suspended solid contains
pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, grease and oil and bacteria
accumulating in bottom sediment. Therefore, dredging operation may pollute canal
water by toxic chemicals.

In principle, the polluted water may adverse affect aquatic animals. Many species
may migrate from the polluted area. Furthermore, pollutants in water can be
accumulated in shrimp, fish, shellfish and vegetation in the canals, causing
damages to human beings through the food chains.

However, from the data of the monitoring programs in 2003 at other sections of this
project, canal water contamination by toxic chemical such as heavy metals and
pesticides were not evident. Therefore, this impacts is may be assessed as minor,
and no significant.

· Possible increase the heavy metal in canal water

Although heavy metals in sediment of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai canal is much lower
than the Dutch Standard for sediment disposal (Chapter Three), but dredging
activities will increase their content in the canal water. Heavy metals in sediment
along the canal are showed in Table 3.11 and Table 3.13 and Dutch Standard is at
Appendix 4.2.

The high toxicity of heavy metals (mercury, lead, chromium...) and pesticides at
high concentration can effect on human heath and aquatic life. Drinking water
standard of WHO for mercury, lead, chrome is 0.05mg/L, 0.05mg/L, 1µg/L,
respectively. Water quality standard of several international organizations and

The data collected by the environmental monitoring program of EPC-VESDEC
during the construction phase in 2001, 2002, and 2003 shows that the concentration
of heavy metals in canal water, where dredge carried out, is much lower than
Vietnamese Standard for Surface Water (TCVN 5942-1995).

Possible increase of pesticides in canal water

· Impacts on the biological environment

Generally, dredging activity causes negative impacts on the biological
environment. It affects both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, especially to fish and
shrimp species:

-  Enlarging canal banks 3-5m causes damage to plants (mainly Nipa palm and
   aquatic weeds) grown on the banks.

-  Dredging canal bottom causes direct influence on planktons and benthic
   animals. They are the basic components of the habitat, feeding to fish and other
   aquatic animals. The loss of the habitats due to changes in the existing banks
   will reduce the food source and the vegetation cover then fish and other aquatic
   animals must migrate away. The reduction in food, turbid water, reduced
   dissolved oxygen and increased pollutants together with the increase in acidity
   will force some mollusk and crustacean species, shrimp and crabs to migrate or
   die. At the dredging sites the concentrations of pollutants will likely do not meet
   the water quality standards for aquaculture.

-  To restore the biological environment and species composition, it can take
   several years or longer after the river bed and banks become stable.

-  Other aquatic species such as water hyacinth and reed and the bottom vegetation
   cover can also be damaged. Those species have an important role to play in the
   supply of oxygen, food and at the same time in stopping the waves that ship in
   operation cause.

The above mentioned impacts may occur at 2 canal sections. However, dredging
capacity will not be high (almost 3.0 mil tons of soil and sediment), these impacts
are expected as minor and temporary.

· Possible increase in water pollution during dredging operation at acid sulphate
   soils areas

The Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai canal section crosses large areas of acid sulfate soil. When
exposing to the air and water, pyrite in acid sulphate soil may create acidic
materials.

The acidification of water source increases the solubility of metals (iron,
aluminum) in the soil. The impact is clearly seen at the section being dredged and

furthermore, it influences the surroundings because of runoff water. The reduction
of pH and increase of metal contents can cause damage to both aquatic and
terrestrial eco systems as well as to quality of agricultural land.

This impact can be more severe in the beginning rainy season when rainwater runs
off from the SRAs to surroundings or adjacent waterway sections.

The transport of dredged soil via pipelines of dredgers can cause extensive impacts
in case of leakage or spillage OF MUDDY WATER. The leakage will lead to
increases in turbidity and acidity near the dredging site and the spillage can damage
water and agricultural land that surround the dredging site.

From the monitoring reports of EPC-VESDEC for the other sections of this project
in 2002-2003, this impact is assessed as minor and mitigable.

Increase of acidity in water, particularly at the section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai is
expected as significant but short-term.

The dredge of canals in regions of sulfate acid soils results in the exposure of pyrite
(FeS2) to the air, and with the presence of water, the oxidation of pyrite and
formation of acid occur with the mechanism as follows:

       2FeS2 + 2H2O + 7O2              2 FeSO4+ 2H2SO4 (strong acid)
       2FeSO4 + O2 + 2H2SO4            2 Fe2(SO4 )3 + 2H2O
       FeSO4 + 6H2SO4                  2 Fe(OH)3 + 3H2SO4

       At a lower pH pyrite can be oxidized with the presence of Fe3+ ions:

       FeS2 + 14Fe3+ 8H2O  15Fe2+ + 2SO4 + 16H+     2-



The conversion of ferrous sulfate to ferric sulfate is very slow at a pH lower than 4
but it very quick with micro-organic catalyst (soil-oxidizing microorganism).

The acidification of water is dependent on the following factors:

    -  The dredged volume of acidic bottom mud and the acidity of bottom mud;
    -  Dimension of SRAs where acid sulfate soil and bottom mud are disposed;
Run off of acidic water from SRAs to surroundings.

· Assessment on environmental impacts due to high water acidity (low pH)

Many studies show that in the Mekong Delta in the dry season, the acidic water
goes up by capillarity to the soil surface. The acidic materials stagnate together
with aluminum and iron sulfates on those surfaces. In the first months of the rainy
season (May to July), the acids accumulated on the soil surface are washed away to

canals and fields to acidify water and soil. According to the previous observations,
In the Kien Luong - Ha Tien section, in beginning of the rainy season, acidifying
water from Long Xuyen Quadrangle flow down causing acidification the whole
canal, result in the high water acidity.

Increase in the water acidity of canals and fields may lead to affect life of fish and
shrimp. The harm of acidity (through pH) of water to shrimp and fish is outlined
and shown in Table 4.5

Table 4.5:     Acute effect of acidity to fish species

             mg/l) or Fe2+ is present

3.5 ­ 3.9    Fatal damages to some fish species but some species of black fish
             (anabas, catfish, etc.) are survived.

From above mentioned information it may indicate that : the acidification and
transfer of acidic water that is generated by dredging and digging canals crossing
acid sulfate soil area will cause negative impacts on water quality, aquatic biota,
aquaculture, water supply and irrigation inside and around the dredging zone.
However, this Ganh Hao-Gia Rai canal, where is affected by salt water with pH of
over 7.5, the increased acidity by dredge may be neutralized. Therefore, this impact
is expected as negative, but minor and short-term.

4.1.3 Impacts due to effluent from spoil relocation areas

· Acidic water from theSRAs

Acids in disposed sediment might not transfer immediately to the environment but
retain in the dredged mud for many years. Pyrite in the mud is gradually oxidized
over many years because of oxygen penetration. In the oxidation of pyrite, the
diffusion of its end products to surfaces occurs also at a low speed. In heavy clay,
the transfer of oxidation products (H+, Fe2+, Al3+ and SO4 ) takes place mainly by
                                                                 2-

capillarity. On reaching the surface, those substances accumulate in acidic salt form

that may be washed by water to rivers, canals, fields or ponds and thereby they
acidify water.

· Impacts by effluents from the SRAs

The effluent from the SRAs, if not passing settling compartments prior to returning
to canals, has high suspended solid concentration and very high turbidity. The
monitoring programs on the Rehabilitation of Southern waterways and Can Tho
Port Project in 2000-2004 conducted by EPC of VESDEC have indicated contents
of the pollutants in effluent from some SRAs (Table 4.6, Table 4.7).

From the monitoring data it is clear that, effluent from SRAs has high concentration
of suspended solid, which many times exceed the Vietnamese environmental
standard for industrial effluent (TCVN 5945-1995). pH values of the effluent is
low, not meeting the standard. Therefore, discharge of effluent from SRAs may
damage to the aquatic environment of the canals

· Environmental incident such as breakage of protecting edges and leakage
   of waste matters

During dredging operation, any incident such as breakage of protecting edge of the
SRAs and leakage of effluent to the environment will cause adverse impacts on
agriculture aquaculture of SRAs and water supply for irrigation and domestic uses.
The impacts resulted from breakage of protecting edges include:

-  Effluent overflowing from the SRAs may shrimp and fish when it reaches to
   aquacultural ponds;

-  Effluent overflowing from the SRAs may acidify cultivated soil when it reaches
   to rice fields;

-  Effluent overflowing from the SRAs may damage people's living conditions
   when it reaches their houses;

-  Effluent overflowing from the SRAs may cause sedimentation in canal bottom
   to shallowing the canals.

The expected incidents have been occurred in the regions such as canals of Xa No,
Trac Cay Tram, the Cho Gao River, the canal of Rach Gia ­ Ha Tien, etc. during
the dredging operation at the two Southern waterways and Can Tho port. However,
the level of damage was low and the constructors did solve the incidents timely. As
such, environmental incidents in relation with SRAs are likely to occur but they
may be controlled by managerial measures.

4.1.4 Pollution due to acidified soil from theSRAs

In the acid sulphate soil areas soil from the of the project normally has low pH.
Data on the monitoring of pH of soil from the SRAs in the Rehabilitation of two
Southern Waterways and Can Tho Port project in 2003 are shown in Table 4.8

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to
evaluate soil acidity the following classification is used: pH range.

pH
                            4,5           5,0            5,5             6,0          8,0

                                 acidic        acidic        neutral


       The data given in Table 4.8 show that in the middle and near the discharge
gates of the SRAs, pH was < 5 and soil therein was slightly or medium acidic.

Environmental Impact Assessment on Additional Dredging Works of the Ganh Hao - Gia Rai
Extension Canal of the Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project
_____________________________________________________________________________
       Soil in the project site is a kind of actual acid sulfate soil (AASS). Therefore,
at the beginning, it has low acidity but after dredging, it is oxidized, turning to be
acidic and polluting the soil environment, possibly damaging to agricultural
production.

4.1.5 Possibility of increase in salinity intrusion

       The canal of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai will be deeply dredged for improving the
waterway. However, the dredging volume is limited. Furthermore, because water in
the project site is saline for all year round, the impacts caused by dredge on salinity
intrusion in the region is not expected.

4.1.6 Impact on aquaculture

       The construction phase will last some months at each section. This may
cause negative effects on local aquaculture, due to the following reasons:

-   Water in taken for shrimp culture may be contaminated by turbidity and acidity.
    Particularly, soil along section of Kien Luong ­ Ha Tien is heavy acidified,
    therefore, the dredging activities may increase the water acidity, possibly caused
    damage for aquaculture in the surrounding area.

-   Effluent leak from the SRAs may cause death of shrimp in the surrounding
    shrimp ponds.

       The overflow of effluent and embankment breakdown may kill shrimp and
fish in canals and ponds.

-   Wastewater from construction sites and dredgers containing organic compounds,
    grease and oil, discharged into the canal may damage water quality that effect
    on aquacultural ponds where intake canal water.

       It is able to evaluate that the dredging activities of the two additional
waterways may cause significant effect on aquaculture at Ha Tien and Nam Can
areas. This negative impact is assessed as moderate, but controllable. Therefore,
Project Management Unit will co-operate with the consultants (SMEC) and the
constructors to choose the right area for SRAs and implement a proper monitoring
program to prevent the predicted impact.

4.1.7 Waste oil from dredgers

       During the dredging operation, effluent and oily waste from the dredgers
may be a problem. That may pollute rivers and canals, damaging the aquatic
organisms and the mangrove trees grown along the canals.

_____________________________________________________________________________
     The standard on water quality for aquaculture permits the oil concentration of <
0,005 mg/L. according to the previous monitoring program of this project, oil
contents in the dredging canals were only sometimes a little higher than that limit.
Therefore ,this impact is assessed as negative but slight, local, temporary and
controllable.

4.1.8 Impacts of workers' activities in dredgers

In the dredging phase, some 30 to 40 workers may aggregate in some dredgers.
Their activities may cause environmental and social problems, which is mainly due
to sanitary waste and relation to the local peoples.

Water pollution

The averages of wastes from 40 workers are estimated as follows:

- Daily sanitary wastewater: 4-5m3

-   Daily solid waste: 20-30 kg, containing organic matters (60 ­ 70%), other
    components such as paper, plastic, glass, metals etc. (30 - 40%).

-   This amount of wastes, if not properly collected and treated, may damage to
    water environment

- Conflict with local people

       In some nations the conflict between construction workers from other
regions with local residents are likely to occur with the causes as follows:

       -   Difference of habits and living style;

       -   Difference of income;

       -   Encroachment of construction workers to local cultural or traditional
           values.

       -   Environmental problems created by the constructors.

It is, however, experienced in many projects in Vietnam that conflicts will not
occur if construction workers are well educated and disciplined. Furthermore, in
Vietnam the good relation between workers and farmers is traditional and at the
same time, people residing along the site understands the project activities. For this
reason, the conflict between workers and local people has no ground to exist.

Along the canal section to be dredged, particularly in the region of Ganh Hao
bridge in Ca Mau City, a large number of boats transporting passengers and trading
goods. Therefore, the dredging operation will make constraint for those activities.
Nevertheless, because the dredging duration in that sub-section will be short (about
10 to 15 days) so this impact is expected as minor and short-term.

4.1.10 Traffic hindrance

A site study into the canal section of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai shows that the traffic
density on the canal is relatively high and the canal also crosses over Ca Mau City.
Therefore, the dredging operation may hinder the movement of boats, transporting
passengers and goods, particularly at the area near the Ganh Hao bridge.

However, as mentioned in section 4.1,9 the area occupied by the dredgers is small
and the dredging duration is short, this impact is assessed as minor and temporary.
Measures for mitigation of traffic hindrance will be implemented by the
constructors.

4.2 IMPACTS DURING THE OPERATION PHASE OF THE TWO EXTENSION
WATERWAYS

Currently, increase in number and traveling speed of boats significantly results in
erosion of the banks of rivers, canals and increased water pollution as well.
Particularly, oil spill from engines boats will make pollution of water and may
damage to aquatic biolo gical resources, aquaculture and water supply at the areas
along the waterway.

Scales of those impacts are not easy to predict precisely but the impacts can be
expected as follows. For mitigation of the impacts various appropriate managerial
and technical measures will be applied.

4.2.1 Pollution due to boat protection materials

The increase of river fleets can lead to water pollution by wooden hull-protecting
materials. The common materials for this purpose in Vietnam include bitumen,
charcoal, and paints. The aromatic hydrocarbons from those materials can be
dissolved partially in water. Nevertheless, this impact is not significant because of
the amount of boat protection materials is small, the materials are hardly dissolved
in water and the discharge of the river is large.

4.2.2 Bank erosion

The increase in number and velocity of boats may cause erosion to banks of rivers
and canals. This impact has occurred in many places in the Mekong Delta, where

river banks are not strong. This impact will be significant, long-term but mitigable.
Measures for mitigation are recommended in Chapter Five.

4.2.3 Oil spill

The upgrading of two extension waterways, Ca Mau - Nam Can and Kien Luong -
Ha Tien, will to a significantly increase the waterway traffic. Therefore, the risk of
water pollution due to grease and other oily wastes may occur. Traffic accident as a
result of heavy traffic density is easier to occur and cause oil spill. In such a case,
the damages to aquatic, terrestrial ecosystem, agriculture, aquaculture and water
supply will be significant. In Vietnam, there were various cases of oil spill (mainly
in the Dongnai-Saigon river) damage aquatic ecosystems and aquaculture. They are
lessons for management of this waterway.

       Fuel spills to watercourses cause negative impact on the water environment
and aquatic ecosystem.


       When oil or petroleum products fall into water, the mechanic, physical and
chemical processes occur and turn its state in a very complicated manner. Oil
spillage increases the hydrocarbons in sediments. The ecological toxicity of
petroleum products are assessed as shown in Tables 4.9 and 4.10. In some cases of
oil spill in Vietnam concentrations of crude oil and FO were 1-10mg/L, which may
cause death for some aquatic animals.

       Oil spill prevention and response at the waterways are recommended in
Chapter Five.

4.2.4 Environmental risks due to transport of materials on the river

       Environmental risks may occur in the following cases.

-  Overloaded transport

-  Boat operation not abiding navigation regulations

-  Failure of built-in lighting and signal system of boat in nighttime

-  Navigation in bad weather

-  Colliding with underwater obstacles such as a sunken boat.

       In case of oil spill or breakage of ships, boats transported agricultural
chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) caused by the incidents the impacts on the
environment and local economy is expected as moderate, due to population,
aquacultural farms along the canals have high density.

4.3    GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT IMPACT ON THE
LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIO-ECONOMY

       During the construction and operation phases of the additional waterway
sections, bridge and LSs the following direct negative impacts may be happen at
different scales:

-  Air, noise and vibration pollution. This impact is minor and mitigable.

-  Water pollution: this impact is minor; the water quality will be recovered after
   the completion construction activity. Only at the section Kien Luong ­ Ha Tien
   water pollution by acidity may be at moderate scale but it is temporary and
   controllable.

-  Possible damage on aquaculture at Ha Tien and Nam Can: this impact in the
   construction phase is moderate but controllable if the project has an
   appropriative measure of environmental management.

-  Riverside land: Plants along the canal will be cut, caused increase of erosion
   and landslide. This impact is expected as minor but long-term.

-  Change in aquatic ecosystem: the bottom aquatic ecosystem structure may be
   changed but it will be recovered in several years after completion of canal
   dredged.

-  Local living conditions: impact on living conditions of households settle closed
   to the spoil disposal site during the dredging period. This impact is minor if the
   constructors will have good management plan for SRAs, but it is major if the
   spoil disposal management will be failure.

-  Environmental risks : during the operation phase, oil spill may be a major
   environmental risks, caused by ship, boat accidents. This type of impacts may
   be moderate or minor depending on the scale of accidents but it is controllable.

In order to prevent and mitigate the predicted impacts an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP), including measures for impact mitigation, project
monitoring and strengthening management capacity is suggested in Chapter Five
and Chapter Six.

5.1.2 Design of spoil disposal sites (SRAs)

In order to limit the negative impacts of mud (produced by dredging) on the
environment as well as the water quality of the canals, the dredged sediment should
be transported to the SRAs.


The bottom mud (dredged sediment) is pumped a containing area of the SRAs, then
it overflow to a settlement pond, where turbidity and total suspended solids are
settled. After some, effluent is returned to the canals. (Figure 5.1)


As for the regions of acid sulfate soil (Kien Luong ­ Ha
Tien section), SRAs' dikes should be covered with PVC
sheets so as to prevent the leakage of acidic water to
the surrounding canals and fields.

5.1.3 Limiting the disturbance of watercourse

Improvement of this waterway includes dredging and enlarging the canals. The
following measures should be taken so as to minimize the disturbance of the
watercourse and to prevent polluted water transferring to surroundings.

In the zones where the concentrations of heavy metals and pesticides in sediments
are higher than the Standard, a monitoring program for heavy metals and pesticide
contamination in water and in fish tissue should be done.

On laying dredging machines on a barge, constructors can use a proper mud -stopping
net for enclosing the dredging site and keeping back mud on land, not to let it goes
back to the canal. However, a major part of the dredged sediment is clay with high
adhesion then mud-stopping net is not compulsory. At the sections where the canal
expansion is more than 2 m, the dredged spoil should be kept dry onthe bank so as
not to leak turbid water in the canal.

On installing dredging machines on ferries for expanding the canal banks,
contractors should limit the flow of mud returning back to the canal. At the sections
where the canal is expanded by more than 2 m, the dredged soil should be kept dry
on banks and prevented from falling back to the canal.

After the bank part is dredged, a suction dredger should be used to transfer all the
mud and soil in water to the SRA, which is located within 2 km from the bank. The
length of dredging sections should be limited less than 1 km and the dredging should
be done one by one.

The dredging direction should be arranged such that aquatic animals can move to
better places; meaning that fresh water fish can move to field while estuarine fish can
move out to the sea.

As for the sections where sulfate acid soil is determined like the project site, the
dredging should be carried out in the rainy season for having more fresh water for
diluting acidic water.

5.1.4 Mitigating impacts due to widening of the canal

In order to reduce the volume of site clearance, compensation and rehabilitation, the
widening of the canal should be carried out on the one bank where the density of
houses and population is low, where neither agriculture nor the natural ecosystem is
important. And after the canal is expanded, its bank should be covered by proper
trees as soon as possible.

Plankton communities can recover together with the return to normal state of
turbidity and suspended solid in water (meaning that water will get back the
transparency for light penetration) then zoo benthos will recover after several
months.

5.1.5 Protection of riverside mangrove trees

In order to limit the impacts on the riverside salt-marsh vegetation species during the
dredging operation, the project will implement the following measures:

-  Designing of sideward dredged so as to minimize site clearance and destruction
   of the riverside vegetation cover.

-  Selecting abandoned land to locate SRAs, not building SRAs inside mangrove
   forests

-  Building and laying pipelines such that no riverside tree is damaged.

5.1.6 Public consultation

On preparing for dredging operation in sensitive regions, the Project Management
Unit should cooperate with contractors in communal information, which is targeted
at bringing out the matters as follows:

-  Objectives and meanings of the investment in the project.

-  Potential impacts due to dredging operation on the water environment, agriculture
   shrimp farming, water use such that people could apply countermeasures to
   minimize damages, if any.

-  Measures of mitigating the negative impacts on local aquaculture.

-  Improvement of community's participation in environmental protection.
   Addresses and telephone numbers of responsible units should be provided then
   people can inform any environmental incident in due time.

-  Obtaining feedback from local people and the project affected households on the
   environmental issues of the project

Guidelines and requirement in public participation are detail indicated in Chapter
Seven.

5.1.7 Selection of Spoil Relocation Areas (SRAs)

The right selection of location of the SRAs will mitigate impacts of the project on the
environment and livings and productions. A selected SRA should meet the
conditions as follows:

     - Land use

Public land, land for construction of rural roads, public works, private land, etc. may
be used, with an agreement with the project affected households. It should also meet
local plans for land use.

     -Size

A selected SRA should be large enough or larger than the designed size which has
been approved.

     - Location

A selected SRA should be located at least 1 km from any Bird Sanctuary or protected
sites, at least 200 m from public works (schools, administrative offices, markets),
temples and churches, and at least 200 m from aquacultural farms. It should not be
located in mangrove forests.

5.1.8 Improvement of environmental monitoring and management

The environment should be monitored in the pre-construction, construction and
operation phases. PMU-W will consolidate the relationship with the Provincial
Departments of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE) and local authorities
in relation with the project for information disclosure, particularly to PAPs, and
assist the contractors to find out suitable SRAs and inspect the implementation of
mitigation measures during the construction.

Budget for environmental monitoring during the construction phase and 3 first year
of the operation phase is taken from the project's budget (see Section 6.5).

Budget for environmental monitoring after 3 years from the beginning of the
operation phase will be provided by the PMU-W if this monitoring will be necessary.

5.1.9 Measures against accidents

In a bid to prevent traffic accidents during construction, the project has prepared a
plan for regulating the traffic specifically for each region so as to meet the demand
for transport of every locality.

_________________________________________________________________


Because of heavy traffic on the waterway, the regulation is made by dividing it into
many short sections that are suitable for dredging machines arranged along the canal.
The Waterway Administration Division 14 is in charge of traffic regulation during
the dredging. The plan for traffic regulation in every region is as follows:

- Contents

Informing vehicle holders in the construction site by mean of mass media.

When the passage is closed, directions to the construction site are warned. Small and
light vehicles can continue their usual travel, whereas heavy ones are detained and
arranged out of the site.

When the passage is opened, vehicles are guided for passing the site, not to jostle or
surpass in the site; one way or two way traffic over the site is allowed periodically.

Subcontractors are coordinated with functional bodies in arrangement of schedules of
daily works so as to ensure traffic over the site and at most 16 hours of construction
per day.

- During the construction

The passage is closed until the construction is complete. The administrative division
will set up warning positions to control the traffic to the site. Those include two 33-
Hp boats as two upstream and downstream positions.

-   Affter complement of the construction

Dredgers should recollect pipes and anchoring cables, get close to one side of the
passage and leave the remaining for traffic over the site.

5.1.10 Protection of canal banks and limitation of soil erosion

After the waterway of Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai is dredged and upgraded, the flow of
traffic therein will certainly increase. That however causes noticeable impacts on the
environment and the flow of canal. Waves in the canal may be risen when increase of
number of boats and boat speed. This may create erosion of the banks. Therefore, in
order to ensure the safety of people's houses and assets as well as the good traffic of
the waterway, we building bank-protective works at critical positions, which have
been eroded is recommended. The selection of the stone should be made, considering
some main criteria as follows:

The bank section has been eroded or is likely to be eroded when the waterway is
launched into operation;

The section with important works of the state or populated areas.

The section, where construction of stone jetty is the most reasonable because other
measures are ineffective or expensive.

The structure of stone embankment is shown in Fig. 5.3

In order to protect the bank of the waterway, the project will takes also the measures
as follows:

-  Planting species capable of preventing strong erosion.

-  Guiding people who reside on the riversideto plant species such as Nipa and
   grass for protection of the canals banks.

To timely assess the impact of environmental project in the construction and
operation phase, to assess the effect of reducing pollution methods, monitoring and
management program of project is below ­ mention. This monitoring environment
will be implemented by Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project
combine with Environmental Project Center (VESDEC).

6.1    LEGAL       AND       MONITORING          ORGANIZATION             IN    THE
       MONITORING PROGRAM

6.1.1 Legal documents

Environmental monitoring for project implementation is required by the
Government of Vietnam as well as the World Bank (WB). The major legal
documents related to the requirement in environmental monitoring are indicated as
follows:

6.3.2 Monitoring the drainage of water from the spoil disposal site (SDSs)

As for the SDSs, all drainage water will be driven to the drains thereof for
discharging back to the canal. All the SDSs should be designed such that the
deposit volume of dredged materials there in is maximal.

As the dredged is in the state of mud, soil particles are suspended for 24 to 48
hours. In the time of drainage and discharge, pH and the content of suspended
solids should be measured 3 times a week at the discharge point.

· Monitoring parameters

For leakage water from the SDSs : pH, DO, TSS, temperature, fecal coliform.

· Monitoring sites

4 times a year (2 times in the dry season, 2 times ni the rainy season) end the
monitoring times will be the same with the times for water quality monitoring.

· Monitoring method

Water quality is evaluated at the field based on 5 basic parameters, e.g pH, DO, SS,
T, Coliform and temperature. The remaining parameters are examined in
laboratory. The measured results are compared with the data collected at the same
sites in the pre-construction phase.

                               monitoring programs.


6.4    MONITORING DURING THE OPERATION PHASE

6.4.1 Canal water quality monitoring

In the first year after dredging on a waterway section finished, the PMU-W will
implement a monitoring program for evaluating water quality in the operation
phase.

· Monitoring sites

Monitoring sites after construction will be determined at the transects along the
canal where samples were taken into checkup before construction which are
presented in Figure 6.1.

· Monitoring frequency

Water sample will be taken at each transect one day in March and September.

· Monitoring parameters

Samples will be analyzed with 17 parameters: pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity,
BOD, COD, nitrate, nitrite, suspended solid, dissolved solid, ammonia,
temperature, cadmium, lead, aluminum, zinc, mercury and E. coli form. Some
parameters will be measured at site and samples will be examined in laboratory.
The data to be used for comparison is of water quality of the surroundings prior to
construction and the national environmental standard on quality of surface water
(TCVN 5942-1995).

6.4.2 Monitoring effluent from SDSs

                               EXTENSION CANAL

7.1    POLICIES OF THE WORLD BANK AND GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM
       ON PUBLIC CONSULTATION IN EIA

7.1.1. World Bank Policy

       World Bank (the Bank) policy regarding community involvement is provided
in detail in the WB Environmental Assessment Source Book, Vol. 1 (1991). It is
summarized as follows.

       Bank policy directs the borrower to publicly solicit, hear and consider the
concerns of the local community, other affected groups and local NGOs (non-
governmental organizations) and to fully incorporate into the design and
implementation of the project and the Environmental Assessment (EA). The
rationale for consideration and incorporation of the concerns of the affected parties is
to assure community acceptance and enhance the viability of the project. The Bank
has found that where such views have been successfully incorporated into the design
and plan of implementation, the projects are more likely to be successful. The Bank
has not found community participation to be an impediment to project execution. On
the contrary, projects in which affected parties views have been excluded are more
likely to suffer from delay and quality issues resulting from community resistance.

       The Environmental Assessment Operational Directive (EAOD) clarifies Bank
policy, which for more than a decade has encouraged community participation in
Bank-supported projects. Sociological considerations were added to the Bank`s
operational manual statement on project design and appraisal in 1995, specifying that
effective project implementation requires the full commitment of all beneficiaries
and associated stakeholders and that to be effective a project appraisal should verify
that affected parties were fully informed and involved in project identification and
preparation.

       The    operational   directive   on   collaboration    with   non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) also urges Bank staff "as a matter of Bank policy" to develop
contacts and operational collaboration with NGOs (OD 10.70). The directive defines
NGOs as "private organization that pursues activities to relieve suffering, promote
the interests of the poor, protect the environment, or undertake community
development".

       At identification of an EA category "A" project, or as soon as the project is
classified as a category "A" project, any borrower who does not consult with local
NGOs, or does not seek and consider the informed views of the affected parties
through the release and public comment on the relevant EA, are considered to be out
of compliance with this policy. It is therefore unlikely, in such cases, that the Bank
would continue to support that project. EA requirements should be reviewed well in
advance of the implementation of any project to ensure compliance with the
principles outlined in the EA OD.

       The EA OD's provision for public consultation reflects a larger social trend.
Forces are converging to convince both government and development agencies to be
more responsive to public concerns and participation because popular support is a
key factor in project viability. In some countries, this trend has helped to motivate a
popular shift towards democracy. Experience with "people-centred" development is
growing and gaining acceptance and attention.

7.1.2 Policy of the Vietnamese Government (GOV)

       Vietnam is a socialist country. The State is determined by the fundamental
principle "of people, from people and for people". The democratic approach to the
social management of GOV is expressed in the basic principle of "people know,
people discuss and people control" all activities of the Government.

       At present, based on these basic principles, all policies, programs or projects
of the Government, private and/or foreign investors should be disclosed and
discussed with the people in the affected areas so that the reasonable comments and
concerns of project affected people (PAHs) are fully considered and incorporated.

       In the recent years, the rapid pace of industrialization and urbanization has
impacted environmental quality, causing adverse impacts on public health, the
general ecology and associated economy in various regions in Vietnam. As a result,
inclusion of relevant environmental considerations in the socio-economic
development decision process have became an important issue, and compliance is of
concern by not only to the Government (MOSTE, DOSTE, MPI, Ministry of
Industry, MOT) but also affected parties associated with the project.

       To avoid negative impacts of the project, Governmental Decree No. 175/CP
issued on 18th October, 1994 requires that all projects in the development of industry,
energy, transport, water resource, agriculture, etc. should conduct a compliant EIA
study meeting the requirements of the environmental management authorities and
that the contents of EIA reports include predicted impacts and mitigation measures
must be discussed with the PAHs.

       The PAP should submit their comments and concerns to the project
proponents through their authorized representatives, e.g Governmental agencies (the
People's Committee, People's Council) and/or socio-political organizations (Front
Fatherland Committee, Farmers Association, Women Union etc.) or non-government
organizations (e.g Vietnam Association for the Conservation of the Nature and
Environment, Biological Association, Economic Association, Foresters Association
etc.). These organizations should collect all comments from the local people and
send them to the environmental management authorities (DONRE at provincial level
or MONRE at central level) or even to Provincial People's Council or National
Assembly. During the environmental review process, all comments and requirements
of the PAP should be discussed and conclusions reported to the project proponents,
so that the project can develop proper alternatives and implement measures for
mitigation of the negative impacts. The project will receive an investment license,
only after appropriate modification of location, design, capacity and/or technology of
the project to meet the requirement of environmental protection and resettlement.

       Relating to compensation for the PAHs who lost land, dwellings and/or
income as a result of the projects, the GOV issued Decree No. 22/1998/ND-CP
(24/4/1998).

       This Decree is the legal base for preparation, implementation of proper
resettlement action plan (RAP) which supports the PAHs in finding new jobs and
new settlement sites, maintain living standard and avoid adverse impacts of the
project on the local socio-economy.

7.2    THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESS

7.2.1 Guideline

       The following items comprise the full public consultation process required by
WB.

· Levels of public consultation

    -  Informed    public    participation  in  the   environmental   review   process
       encompasses consultation with those parties both directly and indirectly
       affected. In the first case are the groups that would be directly impacted by a
       proposed project, for example fishers' folk downstream from a dam. It is
       important to remember that the most critical effects may occur so me distance
       from the project itself, that the informed views of all potentially affected
       communities should be taken into account in the pre-design stages of the
       project, and that these communities should be involved in the EA.

_________________________________________________________________

   -   The second group to be involved in public consultation consists of those who,
       because of their particular concern or expertise, have relevant information and
       specific input regarding the nature or scope of potential environmental impact.
       Obvious examples are societies of consulting engineers, experts on cultural
       property, environmental NGOs, or grassroots organizations concerned with
       environmental quality. Less obvious, but frequently important because of their
       perspective, are educators or human rights, anti-poverty or religious groups.

   -   The distinction between these groups cut across two criterions: one is the
       degree to which a group will be affected by the proposed project; the other is
       the kind of knowledge the group can bring to the EA. Local and external
       groups at various points along each axis should be consulted during the EA
       process. By far the most important point is that such consultations must start
       very early in the process if they are to be meaningful and influence decisions
       made during the development process, which will affect their lives. The views
       and concerns of the potentially affected people and the local NGOs should be
       solicited no later than the process beginning.

       It is advisable during the identification phase, to have preliminary contacts
with affected parties. Public participation in the EA should start when the preparation
of the feasibility study begins. The EA is an integral component of the feasibility
study. Public participation is usually fostered by the social scientist members of the
EA team, although the full co-operation of the EA -physical and biological
disciplines is needed. Where social impacts have significant scale or severity or
where they are particularly complex, a social science team of local residents may be
required at several intervals during the process of project feasibility and preparation
studies. Where few people are affected, a single social scientist can often reside in
the area for a few months total time spread over a year, so that the studies will
encompass the entire annual cycle.

       Although the bulk of the work is during preparation, there is still a great deal
of social input needed during construction, less during operation and thereafter. The
affected people and local NGOs and the public at large should participate in
monitoring during operation and assist in post hoc evaluation.

· Consultation at the Community Level

       Communities may be large or small; they are easily defined by recognized
geographical boundaries in either urban or rural areas, and may encompass a number
of villages over a large area. The people of an affected area may be homogeneous
and speak the same language, be at roughly the same economic level, share the same
customs and values and make their living in similar ways. Conversely, they may be
highly differentiated in language, culture, occupation and income levels. If the

community is diverse and the people heterogeneous, the consultative process will be
particularly demanding.

       Public consultation is accepted as an essential part of the EA process in
industrial countries, but EA performed in industrial countries provide little guidance
for the inclusion of local communities in developing countries. The premise of public
consultation in most industrial countries is: (a) if the citizens are informed about a
project and the opportunity to discuss its environmental implications, those citizens
most interested will respond; (b) most citizens have access to newspapers, radio and
television and can read and understand notices; and (c) citizens who participate are
accustomed to the frank dialogue associated with democratic discussions, and are not
exposed to any personal or political risk in questioning proposed governmental
action.

       In many developing countries, an EA team cannot operate on this premise and
often cannot function in the responsive stance suitable to industrial countries, but
must take a proactive, initiatory approach to encourage and to promote citizen
participation. This means sharing whatever information is available about the project
so that informed views can be obtained.

       A primary objective of consultation with a community is to encourage
opening discussion of all issues and concerns. To this end, the challenge is to provide
means that are congruent with local cultures and customs and that provide a safe and
comfortable setting to voice the issues as they see them. If the sociologists or
anthropologists attached to a multi-disciplinary team are expatriates, the team will
need members from the country who are familiar with the people, culture and
language of the affected area. In many cultures, women specifically will be needed to
talk with the women involved.

       Selecting team members in this way, who speak the language and are
culturally acceptable to the communities is crucial to the project's success. Advice on
recruitment can be sought from local staff of development agencies or from NGOs
with specific experience in the area. The recruits may be researchers from colleges
and universities, staff of local NGOs, or social workers or extension workers with
ties both to government ministries and to the community.

       Exploration at the community level should not be rushed. The team members
should be involved at various stages, including the early stage when the official and
informal leadership of the co mmunities ­ all the key figures in the authority structure
­ are briefed on the project and invited to participate and express their views. The
sociological members of the EA team should reside in the area while gathering
information. Often, this is the only way to achieve reliable consultation.

        Large meetings are sometimes inappropriate forums for public consultation at
the community level. Small meetings and individual interviews are often more
useful. All communities have social groups through which they normally organize
activities, such as work groups, savings societies, schools or cooperatives, or small
enterprise groups. Groups that primarily involve women should be sought out.
Religious groups also provide useful forums. The structure of the small meetings will
vary according to country and culture; but in general, new organizational forms with
which people are unfamiliar (e. g., committees) should be avoided in preference for
existing social groups within people feel comfortable.

        A major difficulty in consulting with people who may be affected is the
inability of many either to understand how their world can be different from what it
is, or to realistically understand what their real needs might be when the project
materializes. Where feasible, graphic illustrations should be used to clarify the
issues; scale models of the area showing villages and the project are generally better
understood than speeches alone. Videotape can be useful in presenting this sort of
information. Posters, illustrated pamphlets and cartoons have proved effective in
literate communities; they can be displayed at schools, religious buildings, shops,
clinics, co-operatives and other centres of community activity.

        Involving affected people, especially the poor, often requires additional
expenditures. The costs include travel and subsistence for attendance at meetings,
translation and expert advice that the community needs to help to formulate a
response to the proposal, etc. Such costs should be systematically budgeted. The EA
team must ensure that issues raised in affected communities are communicated to the
other participants in the EA process, including various public agencies and NGOs
that may be involved in the larger process of public consultation.

        As the EA proceeds, the people in the affected area should be kept informed
routinely and systematically. Written material must be translated into local
languages. Where many are unable to read, oral discussion and visual presentations
sessions (often, by the resident social promoters or facilitators) should be used.
Throughout the EA process, the project agency should continue seeking views from
and providing feedback to the affected community.

7.2.2 Organization of communal consultancy for the project:

        By far there is no concrete guidance for communal consultancy in Vietnam. In
        combination of the Vietnamese government's policies and the World Bank's
        Directive, on implementation of the project, the following activities have been
        and will be organized.

· Official meetings:

                                     CONCLUSION

        The project for rehabilitation of two Southern waterways and Can Tho port plays
an important role in the socio-economic development of the whole Mekong Delta and
Hochiminh city. The project contributes in improvement of life of people and poverty
alleration in the Mekong Delta region. Therefore, it selected as one of the 6 priority
projects in the development plan for the Mekong Delta.

        The EIA report on the project was approved by the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Environment (now the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment)
according to Decision 1021/QD-BKHCNMT dated 3 June 1999.

        In 2004, the Dredging Works of Ganh Hao-Gia Rai extension canal is additionally
researched. That, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report for this additional
project is implemented by the Project Management Unit (PMU-W).

        The construction and operation of the Additional Dredging Works of Ganh Hao-Gia
Rai extension canal will cause the environmental impacts as follows.

-  Water pollution due to dredging canal sections and building landing stages and
   bridges. This impact is assessed as negative but minor and mitigable, canal water
   quality will be recovered shortly after completion of construction activities.

-  Impact on aquafaming at the areas along the Ganh Hao ­ Gia Rai canal. This ompact
   is assebed as negative, moderate but not serious if the project will have adequate
   measures for environmental management and pollution control.

-  Loss of riverside vegetation cover and consequent increase in erosion of banks. This
   impact is minor and local.

-  Impacts on the structure of the aquatic habitat in the project site. This will be minor.
   The structure of the canal section will be recovered in a duration of one to some years
   after the project completion

-  Impact on fish sources and fishery during the dredging of the extension waterway.
   This impact is expected as minor and temporary.

-  Impact of the production and living conditions of people at the SDSs during dredging.
   This impact is assessed as moderate but controllable

   In order to mitigate the negative impacts, the Project Management Unit has proposed
various feasible managerial and technical measures. Those include:

-  Measures to managing and treating effluent having high turbidity and suspended
   solid.

-  Measures to protecting local agriculture and aquaculture in the construction phase;

-  Measures to minimizing the impacts on sensitive zones such as shrimp farms and bird
   sanctuary.

-  Measures to reduce the transfer of        acidic water and water pollution during
   construction and dredging.

-  A detailled a program for environmental monitoring in the pre-construction,
   construction, and operation phases which has been approved by the WB.

       The above indicated environmental impacts and mitigation measures were
imformed by the PMU-W to the local authorities and people. They were accepted by the
stakeholders.

       The Project Management Unit will be fully responsible for any environmental
problems, including pollution and risks, in the cons truction and operation of the
additonal works.

       On the bases of the conclusions as mentioned above, the Project Management Unit
(PMU-W) requests the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to approve the
EIA report on the Additional Dredging Works of Ganh Hao-Gia Rai extension canal of the
Vietnam Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project.
