Management Project under the STATCAP (APL) Program for\n            Colombia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            while conceiving a whole-of-government M&E system it is\n            critical to include both technical and political economy\n            considerations to ensure that such system is both\n            technically sound and that it\u2019s effectively utilized by its\n            intended users. In the case of this project, the design of\n            dashboards tailored to the needs of the Office of the\n            Presidency and line ministers, illustrates the importance of\n            addressing the needs of strategic users. The institutional\n            and economic impact of an operation is not necessarily\n            correlated to its size. While this operation was very small\n            in the context of the Bank\u2019s portfolio in Colombia, it has\n            had a significant impact in Colombia and beyond, as SINERGIA\n            is considered by OECD standards as a cutting-edge M&E\n            system with characteristics to be emulated elsewhere. It is\n            important to note that if a Project of similar\n            characteristics were to be prepared today, Reimbursable\n            Advisory Services (RAS) will be a more adequate instrument\n            than an investment loan. Borrowers, particularly\n            sophisticated ones such as Colombia, can be the natural\n            drivers of sector-wide initiatives. While the Bank played a\n            key role in helping Colombia build awareness and consensus\n            over the importance of strengthening its M&E system, the\n            DNP played a central role in steering implementation of this\n            project. This, in turn, brings attention to the range of\n            roles to be played by the Bank in sector-wide interventions\n            in which IBRD funding is relatively small and the Borrower\n            has strong technical and institutional capacity and\n            strategic vision."}, "docdt": "2015-06-24T02:53:05Z"}
