Inter-Sectoral Committee for Evaluation and Management for Results (IEC) and
government entities; (ii) social accountability by the Office of the President; (iii)
investment planning by DNP; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation capabilities, at the local
and regional levels (PAD, p. ii, 8; Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, p. 5).

     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Government of Colombia (GoC) had achieved considerable success in the creation and
strengthening of its whole-of-government monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system: the National
System of Evaluation of Public Sector Performance (Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de
Resultados de la Gestión Pública - SINERGIA). The system, which was formally created in 1994,
had its roots in seminal initiatives that went back to the early 1990s, such as the 1991 revision to
the constitution mandating program evaluations. Like many M&E systems, SINERGIA has had its
ups and downs. However, in the early 2000s, SINERGIA was brought back to the center of the
government’s agenda as an indispensable tool for enhancing social accountability and the
generation of quality information to inform government policy-making.

Support for the continuous development of SINERGIA went beyond the Office of the President
(Presidencia), with other key stakeholders such as the National Department of Planning (DNP) and
the Ministry of Finance (Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público – MHCP) also exhibiting strong
commitment toward strengthening the country’s M&E system. Concomitantly, the National
Statistical Office (DANE) was pursuing a similar agenda under its National Strategic Plan for
Statistics (PENDES), which included a variety of potent tools for strengthening the quality of
information, including the certification of ministries and agencies for producing quality data.

In 2003, the Inter-Sectoral Committee for Information Policy and Management (COINFO) was
created with the strategic objective to improve access to information by civil society and introduce
strategies for the improvement of the quality of information by enhancing the coordination of IT
policies throughout the government. The enthusiasm for quality M&E had also trickled down to
local governments, as illustrated by the efforts of the municipal governments of Pasto and Medellin
to build local M&E systems at the time of preparation.

The collective efforts of the various government entities over the previous five years had made
SINERGIA one of the strongest M&E systems in Latin America, in terms of the range of M&E
activities it covered and its utilization. However, significant challenges still remained, including:
(i) lack of a single, clear conceptual framework; (ii) the need to clarify the roles and responsibilities
of the ministries and agencies which support the government’s M&E system; (iii) absence of clear
links between planning, budgeting and evaluation; and (iv) severe problems with the availability,
frequency, and quality of data.

The Bank was well positioned to assist the GoC in its objective of further strengthening and
institutionalizing SINERGIA. A Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) grant
that had been in place since early 2007 to support the preparation of this Project, had funded
significant capacity building and consensus building among key stakeholders, giving the Bank
thorough knowledge of Colombia’s M&E system and high credibility with the GoC. The Bank had
also supported successful M&E activities within other lending operations. 3 In addition, the Bank’s

  The Bank supported several M&E activities under various lending operations, including the Programmatic
Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment Loans (Loans No. 7193-CO; 7259-CO; 7400-CO); the
Public Financial Management Projects (Loans No. 3669-CO; 7049-CO); the Social Safety Net Project (Loan
No. 7337-CO); and the support for improved evaluation and quality of information in selected ministries
through the Technical Assistance Loan (Loan No. 7260-CO).



                                                   1
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted a thorough diagnosis of Colombia’s central M&E
system in 2006.

The Bank’s efforts to support the GoC in the strengthening of its M&E system lent itself to the
utilization of a newly available lending vehicle (i.e., the STATCAP). The STATCAP was aimed to
improve the statistical capacity in several countries through a sector-wide approach, through a
Statistical Master Plan prepared and owned by the country. The GoC met all STATCAP eligibility
conditions: (i) preparation of a national statistical development strategy and statistical master plan;
(ii) strong national commitment and leadership; (iii) willingness to comply with good statistical
practice; (iv) participation in global development and monitoring activities; and (v) use of
sustainable financial and institutional arrangements. The key element of STATCAP was the
government’s commitment to the implementation of a national statistical development strategy and
approbation of the Statistical Master Plan, which, in the case of Colombia, was reflected in the
development and adoption of PENDES. In this way, the Bank was able to support the CoG’s M&E
efforts to consolidate, strengthen and expand SINERGIA as part of a wider multi-country program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The PDO was to assist the Government in strengthening its M&E system to ensure the availability
and production of quality information pertinent to improving the Government’s: (i) program and
policy design by Inter-Sectoral Committee for Evaluation and Management for Results (IEC) and
government entities; (ii) social accountability by the Office of the President; (iii) investment
planning by DNP; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation capabilities, at the local and regional levels
(PAD, p. 8; Loan Agreement – LA, p. 5). The Project’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were
defined as shown on Table 1.

                         Table 1: Original Key Performance Indicators
 KPI 1 - DNP collects information following strict protocols for data quality, reliability and
 timeliness on at least 80% of national spending in regions by end of project
 KPI 2 - IEC members as high level representatives of their Ministries have increased the
 number of programs evaluated by 50% over the project lifetime, with respect to the inventory
 of programs collected in the first year
 KPI 3 – 40 percent of recommendations of evaluations completed during project lifetime have
 been implemented by corresponding authorities at the end of the project.
 KPI 4 - Presidencia, Hacienda and DNP report higher satisfaction, based on structured
 independent interviews (years 3 and 5) and audits of the provision of quality information
 provided by SINERGIA (SIGOB and Evaluations) that will feed into performance based
 budgeting.
 KPI 5 - Leading NGO’s and civil society members, report higher satisfaction levels in terms
 of access and quality of information on public spending based on independent surveys (years 3
 and 5 within SINERGIA reviews).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project underwent a Level 1 restructuring in 2012, which introduced several changes, including
introduced a slight modification of the PDO to reflect the GoC’s decision to replace the IEC with
the Economic and Social Council (CONPES) as the government entity responsible for approving
the evaluation agenda. The revised PDO read as follows:

“The objective of the Project was to assist the Borrower in strengthening its monitoring and
evaluation system to ensure the availability and production of quality of information pertinent to




                                                  2
improving the Borrower’s: (i) program and policy design by CONPES and government entities;
(ii) social accountability by the Office of the President; (iii) investment planning by DNP; and (iv)
monitoring and evaluation capabilities at the local and regional levels.

At the GoC request, the restructuring also introduced comprehensive revision of the PDO and
intermediate outcome results indicators to ensure consistency within the PAD and between the
PAD and Loan Agreement, to simplify the results framework and to reflect the modifications
proposed with this restructuring. The five original KPIs were dropped and replaced with two new
KPIs, as shown on Table 2. Changes to Intermediate Outcome Indicators are indicated in the
Datasheet (Section F(b)).

                        Table 2: Revised Key Performance Indicators
 KPI 6 - Percentage of increase in visits from citizens to SINERGIA.
 KPI 7 - Percentage of increase in visits of the High Government to Control Panels

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
While the PAD does not explicitly identify the Project’s intended beneficiaries, the overall
Project description points to, among others: i) the President, who would benefit from
having at his/her disposal the information needed to discuss with the regions and line
ministries the advances in terms of project and financial execution; ii) national authorities,
which would be better equipped to support policy making with evidence-based data,
including funding allocations among programs and regions; iii) government agencies,
which would be able to use results from program evaluations in program design and
redesign; and iii) civil society at large, as it would be able to rely on government
information when engaging in dialogue on government priorities and performance.

1.5 Original Components
1 - Institutional strengthening for M&E of public investment projects at the national and
    sub national level.
This component provided support to the GoC in improving and strengthening the institutional
capacity for the evaluation and monitoring of public investment. Activities were grouped in two
sub-components, which focused on:
1.1 Institutional strengthening at the central level for the collection and analysis of national and
     regional expenditure information; and
1.2 Information on regional indicators in existing regional module of public investment
     information systems.
2 - Consolidate and expand the use of the national M&E system
This component provided support to the GOC to institutionalize the central government M&E
system and promote a greater use of monitoring information and evaluation findings for
improving budget planning and management. Activities were grouped in two sub-components,
which focused on:
2.1 Strengthening institutional arrangements for the government’s M&E system—the IEC and its
     Technical Secretariat, the Directorate for the Evaluation of Public Policy (DEPP) in
     particular—and defining a strategy to better face increasing demands to support sector
     capacity and strategically focus its efforts; and
2.2 Increasing the utilization of monitoring and evaluation findings in the planning and budget
processes.
3 - Support the development of local and regional M&E systems




                                                 3
This component provided support to the GoC to develop and strengthen local and regional M&E
capacity. Activities were grouped in three sub-components, which focused on:
3.1 Developing and consolidating the M&E municipal pilot systems in Medellin and Pasto and
    use them for planning, budgeting, accountability, and social control; and identify conditions
    for their expansion to other municipalities;
3.2 Strengthening the management capacity of the departmental government of Choco in the
    areas of planning and budgeting oriented by results; and
3.3 Promoting the harmonization of technical M&E concepts between the nation (central sectors,
    ministries and agencies), and the municipal M&E systems for increased coordination and
    utilization of M&E information.
4 - Establish the mechanisms to improve quality and relevance of public information
This component provided support to the measures taken to improve the quality of the public
sector information flow process―generation, use, distribution, and storage―by strengthening
institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks, and technical areas. Activities were grouped in
two sub-components, which focused on:
4.1 Modernization and strengthening of the information-flow process; and
4.2 Modernization and integration of the information-flow’s technical aspects, systems, and
    delivery channels, by setting common standards in the information process of SINERGIA.
5 – Project Administration
This component provided support to manage the implementation of the different components and
activities in the loan.

1.6 Revised Components
1 - Institutional strengthening for M&E of public investment projects at the national and
    sub national level.
There were no changes made to this component.
2 - Consolidate and expand the use of the national M&E system
2.1 Activities related to the improvement of the functioning of the IEC and its technical
    secretariat, the DEPP, were eliminated since the IEC had not been operational up to this point
    of the implementation of the loan, and instead CONPES had been responsible for approving
    the evaluation agenda.
2.2 No change.
2.3 A third sub-component was added to support the development and piloting of an open data
    platform with four databases of the DNP.
3 - Support the development of local and regional M&E systems
3.1 No change.
3.2 No change.
3.3 No change.
3.4 A new subcomponent (3.1d) was added aimed at supporting the development of SINERGIA
     Territorial for the expansion and mainstreaming of M&E to departments and municipalities.
4 - Establish the mechanisms to improve quality and relevance of public information
4.1 Activities in this component were limited to supporting the modernization and integration of
     the information-flow’s technical aspects, systems, and delivery channels, by setting common
     standards in the information process of SINERGIA. Support for other areas was terminated,
     including: DANE, as the CoG considered that this agency needed a much larger, integral,
     stand-alone project to support it; the development of a new system of access to public
     information, as such system had been developed by the DNP and the Ministry of
     Technologies and Communications, with support to public information issues will be carried
     out under a new subcomponent (sub-component 4.1c below)




                                                4
4.2 No change.
4.3 A new subcomponent (4.1.c) was added to complement the evaluation of public information
    management and use its findings to prepare a National Policy on Open Data to be approved
    by CONPES.
5 - Project Administration
This component provided support to manage the implementation of the different components and
activities in the loan.

1.7 Other significant changes
The Loan Agreement was signed on December 19, 2008 and declared effective on January 21, 2009.
It was amended three times during the Project’s lifetime, as follows:
• A Level 2 Restructuring was approved on September 9, 2010 in response to the GoC’s request
    to revise the funding allocations of Components 1, 3 and 4 in order to accommodate the
    additional need for a significant number of training events, dissemination activities, and editing
    and publication of materials. In addition, the definition of “training” was revised accordingly
    in the Loan Agreement.
• In addition to the change in the wording of the PDO and the modifications to the Results
    Framework, the Level 1 Restructuring that was approved on July 17, 2012 introduced other
    changes aimed at providing more flexibility in use of project funds and reflecting new
    Government priorities. Project components were modified, with new activities being
    incorporated (e.g., activities related to Open Data and “SINERGIA Territorial”) and activities
    no longer critical to the achievement of the PDO being removed (see Section 1.6). The
    restructuring also simplified the disbursement table included in the Loan Agreement to provide
    greater flexibility in the administration and management of Project funds.
• A Level 2 Restructuring that was approved on November 26, 2013 reallocated resources
    between disbursement categories and components to support an expanded evaluation agenda.
    It also extended the closing date from March 14, 2014 until December 31, 2014 to allow for
    the completion of the envisioned evaluations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
a. Soundness of the background analysis
Although lengthy, the preparation stage was particularly important in the context of this operation,
as it not only provided needed background analysis to support the operation’s design but also
helped build substantial capacity and consensus among the main stakeholders within Colombia.
With support from a Trust Fund (TF) from Japan’s Policy and Human Resources Development
(PHRD) Fund, several activities were conducted as part of Project preparation that helped
government officials gain a better understanding of the challenges ahead, including study tours and
high-level seminars focusing on performance-based budgeting, municipal performance-based
participatory budgeting, and results-based management as well as training provided in advanced
techniques for impact evaluation. These activities also helped align funding coming from various
DPs, including the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ)
towards the objectives of developing a whole-of-government M&E system. 4 In addition to the



4
  The IADB funded several individual impact evaluations and provided technical assistance in the context
of the PRODESEV initiative; the GTZ focused on providing technical assistance to strengthen institutional



                                                   5
diagnostic studies conducted under the PHRD grant, the Project’s design benefited from two
different studies that had provided exhaustive diagnosis of the GoC’s M&E system (CONPES,
2004; IEG, 2007).
b. Assessment of the Project design
Project design exhibited both strengths and weaknesses. In particular:
Strengths
• The sector-wide approach required under the STATCAP program was well suited for
    Colombia, as the development of a whole-of-country M&E system went beyond the orbit of
    single government agency. The development of such an M&E system also had the support of
    multiple donors in crucial aspects of its M&E, which enabled the GOC to draw on diverse
    sources of M&E experience.
• The operation’s design reflected a holistic vision of an M&E system that went beyond the
    technical perspective to include also political economy aspects that would ultimate determine
    the acceptance and utilization of the system. In this regard, the engagement of key
    stakeholders, including the Office of the President, as part of project preparation was crucial
    in building government-wide support. The emphasis on the utilization of the M&E system
    was also reflected in the Project Result Framework.
• The operation’s design effectively capitalized on two of the important areas of Bank
    expertise. On the one hand, it built upon the experience of public sector operations (in
    particular, the Public Financial Management Project II – PFMP II), 5 bringing a systemic
    perspective to the task of developing management tools of-government M&E system. On the
    other hand, it effectively capitalized on the in-depth expertise in impact evaluation within the
    Bank’s poverty network and the momentum generated by the evaluation of highly visible
    social programs, including the emblematic Familias en Acción Program. 6
• The choice of instrument was appropriate given that the only options at time were lending
    instruments or analytical or non-lending technical assistance. It is important to note,
    however, that if the same Project were to be prepared today, Reimbursable Advisory Services
    (RAS) would be a more adequate instrument. 7
Weaknesses
• The operation was highly ambitious, particularly when considering the relatively small
    amount of the loan. It had a wide scope and involved several large government entities at the
    central level (i.e., DANE and DNP) as well as departmental and municipal governments.
    Although this complexity certainly posed a significant risk to the Project’s overall



capacity in the most vulnerable municipalities in the country; and USAID provided technical assistance and
funding in the design and development of selected M&E systems at the sub-national level.
5
  Approved March 22, 2001, the PFMP II (Loan 7049-CO in the amount of US $35.47 million) and its
predecessor (the PFMP I) supported reforms in revenue administration and public expenditure management
at the national level, including the initial stages in the development of the SUIFP and, although in a very
limited manner, the strengthening of SINERGIA.
6
  The expansion of the Familias in Acción Program received joined support from both the IADB and the
Bank (IBRD support was under the Social Safety Net Project (Loan 7337-CO in an amount of US$84.6
million). This program provided cash transfers to poor families conditional on their children’s enrollment in
basic education and visits to health centers for basic care. In addition to the impact evaluation of the expansion
of Familias en Acción by the DNP, the operation included a component to improve the monitoring and
evaluation systems of the Ministry of Social Protection in order to better track and critically review the
country’s social safety net portfolio.
7
  Under RAS programs, the World Bank works with middle- and high income countries at their request,
providing technical advice, analytical and convening services, and implementation support. The Bank is
then reimbursed for the costs of delivering these advisory services.



                                                       6
     effectiveness, the outstanding technical and institutional capacity of DANE, the DNP, and its
     directorates served to counteract this risk.
• Some of the areas of intervention, such as DANE’s efforts to improve the quality and
     relevance of public information across the government under PENDES were overly complex
     and may have merited dedicated support under a separate operation. Moreover, the original
     implementation arrangements in which the administration of all Project funds was under the
     DNP, required a high degree of coordination between DANE and the DNP.
• While some components were clearly defined in terms of both the specific objective as well
     as the activities to be supported under the Project (in particular, the strengthening of the
     M&E system for public investments supported under Component 1), others were less clearly
     delineated and took shape only during implementation.
• There were also weaknesses in the PRF, mainly a dependence of some indicators on results
     from an impact evaluation, ambiguous operational definitions, as well as an unduly large
     number of indicators, particularly in term of intermediate outcomes (see Section 2.3).
c - Relevance at Appraisal
The assessment of the GoC’s commitment toward enhancing its M&E system was correct. The
strong commitment from the Presidency and key government agencies, particularly DANE and
DNP were a key element in the successful implementation of the Project.
The Project design was highly relevant, as it addressed the main weaknesses that had been
identified during preparation. It built upon the institutional framework in place at the time,
providing support to the various institutional actors in relation to their assigned roles and
responsibilities. Particular emphasis was given to the strengthening of the newly established IEC
and DEPP, its technical secretariat. Likewise, by including relevant directorates within DNP, the
operation contributed toward creating a single, clear conceptual framework for SINERGIA. Also,
it addressed existing problems with the availability, frequency, and quality of data in the context
of the SUIPF and SINERGIA systems as well as government-wide data under PENDES.
The operation was also consistent with two of the three pillars outlined in the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Colombia, approved in December 2002: (i) building quality
government; and (ii) sharing the fruits of growth. As a result of the full institutionalization of the
government’s M&E system and improved and higher utilization of M&E information, the
operation was expected to contribute to the CAS objectives by: (i) building quality government
though a greater performance orientation, leading to more efficient and effective use of the
country’s scarce resources and increased government accountability; and (ii) sharing the fruits of
growth through a more egalitarian allocation of resources across geographical regions and
population groups.
d. Assessment of risks
The Project was correctly identified as having Moderate risks at Appraisal. The main risks were:
i) the underutilization of results of the M&E system by the government at both national and sub-
national levels and civil society; and ii) a potential disruption during the change of administration
in August 2010. None of these risks materialized as the Project was built on strong ownership on
the part of the Borrower. The risk that the scope of the operation might be too broad was not
identified.

2.2 Implementation
                            Major Factors Affecting Implementation
 Favorable economic and political implementation environment: Stable economic and
 political conditions rendered a favorable implementation environment. Colombia weathered the
 2008-2009 financial crisis rather well, with GDP growth falling to less than 2 percent in 2009
 but recovering thereafter. From 2010 onward, Colombia exhibited a robust economic
 performance with the support of a strong policy framework—anchored by an inflation-targeting



                                                  7
regime, a flexible exchange rate, a structural fiscal balance rule, and effective financial
supervision and regulation—that has allowed GoC authorities to respond adequately to shocks
and pursue effective demand management, with real GDP growing consistently at a pace above
4.0 percent during 2010-2014 (IMF, 2014, 2015).
The presidential transition in 2010 was a smooth one, particularly in relation to this operation,
as the incoming President Juan Manuel Santos also gave high priority to the continuous
development of an effective M&E system. The re-election of President Santos to a second term
in office has also provided stability in the country’s agenda and strategic priorities. Although the
opposition increased its representation, the ruling coalition maintained a working majority in
Congress in the congressional elections held in March 2014, Colombia held congressional
elections. Lastly, the peace talks between the GoC and the main guerrilla group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), that began in November 2012 are
proceeding and agreement has been reached on three of the five topics under discussion.
Sector-wide approach: During implementation, DNP—as IEC, and later, CONPES Technical
Secretariat—took over the coordination of the various efforts in strengthening Colombia’s
SINERGIA that were being carried out under its various Directorates. Although it was ultimately
decided that DANE’s program would be better managed outside this operation, coordination
between DANE and DNP continued in areas of shared responsibility, such as the development
of poverty measures. DNP—rather than the Bank—played a central role in coordinating sector-
wide efforts, as it is indeed desirable, particularly in the case of a sophisticated Borrower such
as Colombia.
Great fluidity in the GoC’s M&E strengthening agenda: Despite broad support among key
constituencies, the strategy toward strengthening Colombia’s M&E system underwent several
changes during the operation’s lifetime, including the GoC’s decision to reassign responsibility
for approving the evaluation agenda from IEC to CONPES. In addition, DNP and the Ministry
of Technologies and Communications (MINTIC) developed a new system of access to public
information, which rendered some of the activities initially formulated in the PAD no longer
relevant. It is important to underscore that the changes did not impact the Project, as strong
commitment toward enhancing M&E tools continued under the new institutional arrangements.
Cancellation of DANE’s activities: During the pre-restructuring period, DANE was responsible
for the implementation of activities under its orbit, although the administration of the
corresponding loan proceeds was DNPs’ responsibility. As part of the restructuring, the DNP
requested that the Project no longer provided support to DANE, indicating that this agency
merited a much larger, integral, stand-alone project to support it. Moreover, the administration
arrangements proved cumbersome for both entities, as DANE’s activities involved a large
number of relatively small contracts. Other factors contributing to this decision were changes in
DANE’s top administration, newly found fiscal space within DANE for the financing of
PENDES activities, and the desire on the part of both DANE and DNP to avoid the cumbersome
institutional coordination required to procure the numerous (albeit relative small) contracts
related to DANE’s activities. As mentioned earlier, collaboration between DNP and DANE
continued in areas of joint responsibility.
Strong sense of direction of the part of DNP: The operation benefited not only from
particularly strong ownership on the part of the key stakeholders in the Colombia’s public
administration, but also from DNP’s clear vision of the future of SINERGIA. This vision,
together with DNP’s strong technical and institutional capacity, were clearly the most
important factors contributing to the achievement of the operation’s PDOs. Likewise, as the
operation was implemented directly by DNP’s technical and administrative units, the operation
has resulted in the strengthening of DNP, including FM and procurement functions.
Substantial delays in the processing of the restructuring: Although the need to restructure
the Project was identified as early as in 2010, the DNP did not initiate the formal process until




                                                8
 November 2011, when a formal request to process the restructuring was submitted to the
 MHCP. The Bank sent a proposed amendment to the GoC in September 2012, which was
 formally signed by Colombian authorities only in February 2013. These delays in processing
 the restructuring slowed down disbursements and may have contributed to the need to extend
 the original closing date for another nine months. However, it is important to note that the
 delay in the restructuring was not the only reason for the extension of the closing date.
 Primarily, it was a strategic decision to extend the closing date in order to make sure that
 results of the evaluations could feed into the NDP of President Santos’ second administration.
 Frequent changes in Project management within both the DNP and the Bank: There were
 a total of five Team Task Leaders responsible for the Project during the operation’s lifetime.
 Likewise, there were six different Project coordinators on DNP’s part. Despite everyone’s best
 efforts to ensure a smooth transition to his/her successor, the high level of rotation disrupted
 continuity in the implementation process. This was one of the contributing factors to the delays
 in the restructuring as well as the need to extend the operation’s closing date from March to
 December 2014. Changes within the DNP were also contributing factors to the need to extend
 the PHRD grant twice during preparation.
 The operation as leverage for additional financing and expertise: The operation served to
 secure financing for the strengthening of the M&E tools under SINERGIA, including US$15.8
 million directly allocated to the Project (i.e., US$8.5 million in IBRD financing and US$7.3 in
 an earmarked budgetary allocation to DNP). In addition, the operation served as leverage to
 attract financing from other sources. The development of the SUIFP, for example, received
 additional financing from IADB, USAID, as well as US$1.2 million from the Bank’s
 Consolidation of National Public Management Information Systems Project. Likewise, the
 Project served to attract substantial additional financing for program evaluation, as a
 Memorandum of Understanding was signed with both IADB and the Bank to guarantee that all
 program evaluations financed by these institutions be conducted as part of SINERGIA
 Evaluation. Likewise, DNP authorities effectively cooperated with other government agencies
 interested in evaluating programs under their orbit by providing evaluation expertise and/or
 financing in exchange for including the program evaluation under SINERGIA Evaluation. This
 was a highly effective strategy on the part of the DNP for expanding the evaluation agenda and
 for acquiring evaluation expertise beyond social programs.
 The operation effectively used its resources to forge critical strategic alliances: DNP
 authorities were highly effective in providing technical support to key stakeholders, such as the
 Office of the President, to help them design and implement management tools to fully
 capitalize on the M&E information being generated by SINERGIA. In particular, different
 types of dashboards were developed for various users, including the Office of the President,
 line ministers, and the monitoring of cross-sector themes under the NDP. With Bank technical
 support, a strong priority was also given to the development of an effective website and user
 interfaces for SINERGIA. In addition, perception surveys were designed and implemented to
 identify differences between actual and citizens’ perceived achievement of the NDP’s targets.
 These tools, and most importantly the responsiveness of the DNP to the needs of SINERGIA’s
 final users both within and outside the government, were critical in expanding its utilization.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design
 Project Result Framework (PRF): The Project had a weak PRF, both as originally designed
 and as revised during the 2012 restructuring. Specifically:
 Original PRF: The main weaknesses in the original PRF included:
 • There was not a full alignment between the PDO definition and the KPIs, as some of the
     dimensions embedded in the PDO (i.e., data quality, pertinence) were not captured.




                                                9
    •   The indicators did not have a clear operational definition—rather, they were loose definitions
        open to interpretation (i.e., KPIs 3 and 4 in particular).
    • Some of the indicators were overly dependent on the results from the impact evaluation (i.e.,
        KPI 3 and 4), including the prompt construction of the corresponding baseline.
    • There was an excessive number of indicators, particularly in terms of Intermediate outcomes
        (IOI), with an excessive focus on outputs and activities that made reporting cumbersome
        without adding substance.
    Revised PRF: The revised KPIs showed some improvement, most notable clearer operational
    definitions as well as easier to measure and fewer indicators. However, some of the weaknesses
    persisted. In particular, the two revised KPIs focused on access to SINERGIA information
    portals for government officials and the general public. Although usage of the information can
    be considered as a proxy for quality, availability, and pertinence of the information (in all
    likelihood, the use of the system would not have increased so much if those attributes were not
    present) it would have been desirable to include other indicators focusing directly on the various
    dimensions of the PDO. To mitigate this weakness, this ICR has relied on additional evidence to
    assess PDO achievement, much of which was obtained from the M&E tools developed under the
    Project.
    Impact evaluations: Two evaluations of SINERGIA were envisioned, one at mid-term (Year
    3) and one in-depth evaluation at completion (Year 5). These evaluations were to include, among
    others, surveys of key stakeholders to assess the credibility, reliability and utilization of
    SINERGIA. The inclusion of impact evaluations as part of the M&E design was a strength,
    although a closer alignment with the evaluation’s design and the Project’s PDO would have been
    required.
    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Implementation
    PRF monitoring: KPI reporting was weak during the pre-restructuring period, partially because
    the baselines for several of the indicators were still under construction. It improved significantly
    during the post-restructuring period.
    Impact evaluations: There were delays in the implementation of the impact evaluations, with
    the baseline and Mid-Term Impact Evaluation of SINERGIA were carried out in 2010 and 2013,
    respectively. Extensive interviews were conducted under the Mid-Term evaluation with a wide
    spectrum of actors within GoC’s public sector at different management levels (i.e., 266
    interviews) and a sample of 24 external actors. 8 The end-of-Project impact evaluation was not
    carried out.
    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Utilization
    PRF utilization: As mentioned earlier, during the pre-restructuring period the PRF was not
    properly monitored, partly due to weaknesses in the PRF design. The PRF did not provide
    particularly useful information during the post-restructuring period, as the two KPIs were
    exceeded soon after restructuring.
    Impact evaluations: The baseline and Mid-Term evaluation proved critical to conducting the
    Project ex-post evaluation under this ICR, even though the evaluation did not fully capture the
    Project’s PDO. Having the final impact evaluation would have enhanced the measurement of the
    Project’s impact at completion.

  The selection of respondents was based on: i) a census of all top-government officials, including planning
heads of national departments, directors and sub-directors within DNP, managers of SINERGIA targets, and
directors of programs that had been evaluated (a total of 266 respondents); and ii) sampling of DNP staff and
external users (a total of 38 interviews for the assessment of SINERGIA Monitoring and Evaluation) and
staff in 16 municipalities (a total of 154 interviews for the assessment of SINERGIA Territorial).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
 Environmental and social safeguards
 No environmental or social safeguards were triggered during the preparation of the Project,
 which was rated Category C.
 Financial Management (FM)
 The project Financial management (FM) risk was assessed as Moderate. Throughout
 implementation, FM performance was assessed as Satisfactory, except during the supervision
 carried out in February 2012 when the FM rating was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory
 as a result of some possible ineligible expenditures, the need to update the operational manual
 and deficiencies in the monitoring of the project budget and reporting by project components.
 These issues were quickly and adequately resolved and the rating was upgraded to Satisfactory
 during the subsequent FM supervision. The project FM risk was assessed as Moderate.
 The audit reports were submitted within the contractual date. From 2009 to 2011 the project
 was audited by the Contraloria General de la Republica, and from 2012 through 2014 by
 private audit firms, and except for 2011, the auditors issued unqualified (clean) opinions. The
 auditors’ qualification on the 2011 project financial statements did not have an impact on the
 project financial situation of the project, and the issues qualifying the opinion were adequately
 documented by DNP. Furthermore, DNP implemented the recommendations of the audit
 reports on internal controls in a timely manner. Similarly, acceptable interim unaudited
 financial reports were submitted within the contractual date.

 Procurement
 As this was the first Bank operation to be implemented by DNP, procurement faced similar issues
 as financial management. The Bank provided capacity building on procurement procedures and
 policies throughout the project implementation, which ultimately strengthened the
 administrative capacity of DNP.
 In general, procurement and contract administration were performed in accordance with the
 agreed procedures and documents and the approved procurement plan. However, minor
 weaknesses in procurement procedures regarding the selection process persisted throughout the
 lifetime of the project, resulting in a Moderately Satisfactory rating during most of the
 implementation. Nonetheless, DNP was able to comply with agreed action plans in a timely
 manner to resolve any procurement issues and prevent them from impeding overall Project
 implementation.
 Legal Covenants
 There were no covenants applicable to Project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The GoC has already allocated budgetary resources to DNP for the continuous strengthening of
SINERGIA at the national and regional levels. In particular, a total of US$20.4 million have been
allocated to the DNP over the 2015-2018 period to continue with the development and
consolidation of SINERGIA Monitoring and SINERGIA Evaluation.

Activities focusing on the strengthening of M&E capacity at the subnational level under
SINERGIA Territorial continue with financial support from the Subnational Institutional
Strengthening Project (Loan 8320-CO), which was approved on December 2013 for an amount of
US$70.0 million. DNP’s Directorate for Territorial Sustainable Development is responsible for its
implementation with technical assistance from Colombia’s Territorial Development and Fiduciary
Agency (FINDETER).

3. Assessment of Outcomes



                                               11
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: High (during both pre- and post-restructuring, since the PDO is
essentially the same)

The operation’s PDOs are fully consistent with the 2014-2018 NDP – All for a New Country: Peace,
Equity and Education. 9 Specifically, by providing relevant, high-quality and timely information,
the operation indirectly supported policymaking under the three pillars of the NDP—i.e., peace,
equity and education. It was also directly aligned with the transversal strategy focusing on good
governance. It is also important to underscore that the two main innovations within the current NDP
underscore the importance of the PDOs supported under this operation: a stronger focus on results,
and an operationalized territorial dimension. In terms of results focus, the 2014-2018 NDP is the
first to have a built-in value chain linking products, intermediate outcomes, and main outcomes. In
terms of the territorial dimension, this is the first NDP to have indicators and targets defined at the
regional level (NDP, 2015).

The operation’s PDO also continues to be relevant in the context of the current World Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Colombia (i.e., CPS FY2012-2016, Report No. 60620-CO,
discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on July 21, 2011). Specifically, the operation’s PDO
is fully aligned with one of the three areas of results—i.e., Improved Public Sector Management
and Equity and Efficiency of Economic Policies—under one of the three main strategic themes—
i.e., Inclusive Growth with Enhanced Productivity. As noted in the CPS, by helping the GoC to
increase the use of information for policy design and accountability in a cost-effective way, this
operation has addressed the challenges of low accountability and weak basis for managerial
decisions. Moreover, the focus on M&E at both the national and subnational levels was particularly
attuned to the priority being given to decentralization. Finally, the CAS stressed the Bank’s
commitment to continue to provide technical support to the NDP in consolidating results-based
public management and rigorous evaluation of public programs and policies (World Bank, 2011).

Relevance of Original Design: Substantial
The operation’s design continues to be largely relevant. The focus on strengthening M&E in
relation to public investments under SUIFP, progress toward the NDP under SINERGIA
Monitoring, and the evaluation of government programs under SINERGIA Evaluation continues
to be highly relevant. Likewise, the original strategy of providing support to a small number of
reform-prone municipalities and departments reflected the conditions at the time of Project
preparation. Strengthening the M&E capacity of subnational governments continues to be a highly
relevant area of intervention, particularly in the context of ongoing decentralization. Finally, while
further enhancing the quality of government statistics is still an important area of intervention, the
GoC’s strategy has changed significantly, with the newly established MINTIC now playing a
central role in this area.

Relevance of Revised Design: High
The operation’s revised design continues to be relevant. As mentioned above, the focus on M&E
in the areas of public investments, monitoring of the NDP, program evaluation continues to be
relevant areas of intervention at both the national and subnational levels. Moreover, other areas

  The 2014-2018 NDP focuses on three pillars: i) peace, ii) equity, and iii) education. In turn, five transversal
strategies contribute to the achievement of these pillars: i) competitiveness and strategic infrastructure; ii)
social mobility; iii) transformation of the countryside; iv) security, justice and democracy for peace building;
and v) good governance.

supported under the revised design, such as the open government data, are placing Colombia at the
forefront of information management policies.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
PDO achievement is deemed to be Substantial to High, as the Project has effectively supported its
objective of assisting the GoC in strengthening its monitoring and evaluation system. As
characterized by OECD, SINERGIA Monitoring is, by Latin American and OECD standards, one
of the most advanced whole-of-government performance-monitoring systems used in the world
today. The system tracks policy performance government-wide using an elaborate series of
performance-based indicators covering the entire spectrum of activity related to the implementation
of the NDP (OECD, 2013, p. 171). Likewise, the Project effectively supported the implementation
of other M&E tools, including SIUFP, SINERGIA Evaluation, and SINERGIA Territorial focusing
on public investments, program evaluation, and the strengthening of M&E capacity among
subnational entities.

For the purpose of this ICR, PDO achievement is assessed against the three different dimensions
embedded in the operation’s overall PDO definition:
        PDO 1 – Availability of public information
        PDO 2 – Quality of public information
        PDO 3 – Pertinence of public information for improving:
         a. Program and policy design by IEC/CONPES and government entities;
         b. Social accountability by the Office of the President;
         c. Investment planning by DNP; and
         d. Monitoring and evaluation capabilities at the local and regional levels.

The overall outcomes of the operation in relation to the various PDOs can be summarized as
follows:

 PDO 1 – Availability of public information (i.e., Project’s Intermediate Outcomes)
 High Achievement: With Project support, there have been significant improvements in terms of
 the amount, type, frequency, and ease of access to public information available under SINERGIA
 and the SUIFP. Specifically:
     Public investments
     • The SUIFP compiles detailed information on public investment projects at all stages of
         the project cycle, including project documentation, approval process, sources of
         funding and modifications in the allocations (i.e., national budget, royalties, local
         resources, etc.). Information on individual investment projects, such as implementation
         progress or modifications, is available through the Project Monitoring System (SIP)
         website.
     • The number of investment projects incorporated each year into the SUIFP has grown
         significantly during the operation’s lifetime (2008-2014): i) from none to 1,277 under
         SUIFP with financing from the national budget; and ii) from none to 2,769 under
         SUIFP with financing from the Royalty System.
     KPI 1 – DNP collects information following strict protocols for data quality, reliability and
     timeliness on at least 60 percent of national spending made in regions by Year 3 of the
     project. (144% level of achievement).
     • There has been substantial progress toward the regionalization of public investments,
         with 81.2 percent of the total investment budget for which disbursements could be
         regionally tracked in 2014. This is equivalent to 94 percent of the investment budget that




                                                13
   is subject to being regionalized, as 13.5 percent of the total investment budget was not
   subject to regionalization.
SINERGIA Monitoring
• Periodic reports are issued on the progress in the implementation of the NDP utilizing
   quantitative and qualitative information derived from SINERGIA Monitoring
   dashboards, including the Annual Report to Congress and the President, Balance of
   Results, and Thematic Periodic Progress Reports.
• Progress toward the achievement of NDP targets is also publicly available in
   SINERGIA Monitoring’s website. In addition to more detailed information on
   individual programs presented in individual data sheets (I.e., program description,
   responsible entity, objectives, targets, quantitative and qualitative progress),
   information on progress under the various thematic areas, programs and individual
   targets is communicated effectively through color-coded dashboards. A total of 31
   dashboards have been developed, including a dashboard for the President’s Office, 6
   cross-sectoral dashboards, and 24 sectoral dashboards.
• Average composite scores of SINERGIA Monitoring’s website range from 3.4 to 3.7
   in a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) in the Impact Evaluation (see Figure 1).

           Figure 1. Users’ assessment of SINERGIA Monitoring’s website




        Source: DNP (2014).

•   The number of indicators under SINERGIA Monitoring has increase from 500 in 2007
    to 1,100 in 2014.
•   The frequency with which indicators are measured has also increased, with the
    percentage of indicators measured every six months or less increasing from 71 to 83
    percent between the NDP 2006-2010 and the NDP 2010-2014 (see Table 3).

            Annual                    29%                17%
            Semi-annual               11%                16%
            Quarterly                 27%                30%
            Monthly                   33%                37%
        Source: DNP (2015).

•   Reporting on progress toward the achievement of DNP targets is now updated monthly
    as required under Presidential Directive 021 of 2011. This Directive requires all
    entities in the public administration to update progress toward NDP indicators in




                                         14
            SINERGIA Monitoring within the first ten days of each month. This Directive has
            contributed to enhancing the timeliness of the information under SINERGIA
            Monitoring.
        •   The 2014-2018 NDP is the first development plan to be regionalized, with
            performance targets being defined at monitored at the regional level. This constitutes a
            significant landmark in the development of Colombia’s M&E system, which, until this
            point, only had a national scope.

        SINERGIA Evaluation
        KPI 2 - IEC members as high-level representatives of their Ministries have increased the
        number of programs evaluated by 50 percent over the project lifetime, with respect to the
        inventory of programs collected in the first year. (300 percent level of achievement.)
        • The number of programs evaluated increased from 24 to 108 between 2008 and 2014.
        • The scope of the evaluation agenda also increased significantly with Project support,
            increasing from only two sectors to 16 sectors in 2014 (se Figure 2).

        Source: DNP (2014).

        •   The new “Radar” initiative developed under SINERGIA Evaluation serves as an
            evaluations clearinghouse, systematically compiling evaluations performed by public
            entities. Currently there are 171 evaluations available for downloading at the
            SINERGIA Evaluation website and an additional 530 are being reviewed. 10
        •   Users’ average composite scores of SINERGIA Evaluation’s website range from 3.6 to
            3.9 in a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) (see Table 4).

   SINERGIA Territorial
   • 63 of the 95 territorial entities that participated in SINERGIA Territorial now have
       performance dashboards and 63 of them generate regular monitoring reports.
   Other results
   • The Project contributed to restoring long-term comparability in the measurement of
       poverty after a disruption during 2006-2007 as a result of changes in data collection
       instruments. In addition, DANE has assumed responsibility for calculating and
       publishing the results of the official measurements of poverty in Colombia, including
       traditional measures of monetary poverty as well as multi-dimensional poverty. Multi-
       dimensional poverty measurements have been available since 2011.
   • The impact of the Project with regards to the measurement of poverty went beyond
       methodological improvements, contributing as well to greater transparency in the
       governance of poverty measurement. In particular, it provided support to the
       establishment and early work of the Monetary Poverty and Multi-dimensional Expert
       Poverty Committees, including the financing of national technical experts to sit on the
       committees and support the development of the new methodologies.
   • In 2013, the DSEPP began the documentation of databases according to international
       standards and best practices under the Accelerated Data Program (ADP), including
       ensuring the anonymity of micro-data to encourage open dissemination of
       information. 11 By 2014, there were 31 documented databases. In addition, the
       documentation of databases has been included as a requirement under all evaluations
       conducted under SINERGIA Evaluation.
   • With Project support, the DNP is now routinely carrying out "Public Perception
       Surveys” aimed at capturing relevant information from citizens regarding their
       perception of government policies and programs with the ultimate objective of
       ensuring their alignment.
 PDO 2 – Quality of public information (i.e., Project’s Outcomes)
 High Achievement:
    Public investments
    • In addition to the stringent logic-framework methodology that is in place for the
        identification, formulation and approval of investment projects defined jointly by the
        DNP and the Governing Committee of the National Royalty System (Comisión
        Rectora del Sistema General de Regalías), 12 the DNP collects information following
        strict protocols for data quality, reliability and timeliness on all public investments
        with financial resources from the national budget under the SUIFP.
    SINERGIA Monitoring
    • OECD describes SINERGIA as an elaborate and well-designed performance
        evaluation tool of exceptional quality that has been developed to exacting standards
        (OECD, 2013, p. 29).


11
   Since April 2006, the Accelerated Data Program has been implemented as a satellite program of the
PARIS21 Secretariat at OECD with World Bank support. It aims at strengthening country capacity in
producing statistical data relevant for policy design, monitoring and evaluation by: i) better documenting,
preserving, and disseminating existing micro-data; ii) better exploiting existing datasets (quality assessments,
further analysis); and iii) better strategizing and aligning survey programs and statistical outputs to priority
data needs.

        KPI 3 - Presidencia, Hacienda and DNP report satisfaction with the quality information
        provided by SINERGIA Monitoring and Evaluations.
        KPI 4 - Leading NGO’s and civil society members report higher satisfaction levels in
        terms of access and quality of information on goals monitoring.
        • Although data is not available for these operational definitions, these two indicators are
            considered to have been achieved given the substantial increase in respondents’
            satisfaction with SINERGIA’s quality of information under the Impact Evaluation.
            Specifically:
        • Respondents in the Impact Evaluation reported a significant improvement in the
            quality of the SINERGIA Monitoring’s information, with the composite qualification
            (i.e., timeliness, clarity, usefulness, credibility, and relevance) increasing from 3.3 to
            3.8 between 2010 and 2013. 13 All five dimensions showed an improvement during the
            same period, with timeliness increasing from 3.2 to 3.7, clarity from 3.2 to 3.7,
            usefulness from 3.5 to 3.9, credibility from 3.3 to 3.9 and relevance from 3.4 to 3.8
            (see Figure 3).

                              Source: DNP (2014)

        •    Likewise, there was a significant increase in the percentage of respondents
             characterizing their assessment of information under SINERGIA Monitoring as “Very
             Good” or “Excellent.” Specifically, this percentage increased from 36 to 63 percent for
             timeliness; from 35 to 56 percent for clarity; from 49 to 74 percent for usefulness; from
             38 to 74 percent for credibility; and from 44 to 69 percent for relevance between 2010
             and 2013 (see Figure 4). When including those respondents that responded “Good,”
             the percentage of satisfaction increases to 84 percent or higher for the various
             dimensions of quality.




13
     The score range was between one (1.0) to five (5.0), where 1.0 was poor quality and 5.0 was excellent.

•     Respondents also rated favorably the quality of the documents produced under
      SINERGIA Monitoring, including the Annual Report to Congress and the President,
      the Balance of Results, and methodological documents, with ratings consistently above
      4.0 in a scale from 1 (low quality) to 5 (high quality) (see Table 5).

SINERGIA Evaluation
• Respondents reported a significant improvement in the quality of the SINERGIA’s
   information, with the average composite score (i.e., timeliness, clarity, usefulness,
   credibility, and relevance) increasing from 3.5 to 4.1 between 2010 and 2013. 14 All
   five dimensions showed an improvement during the same period, with timeliness
   increasing from 3.2 to 4.3, clarity from 3.6 to 4.0, usefulness from 3.6 to 4.2,

 PDO 3 – Relevance of public information (i.e., Project’s Outcomes)
High Achievement: As noted by OECD, “evidence-based policy making is clearly informing
important policy decision taken by the GoC, notably in relation to the implementation of its
National Development Plan” (OECD, 2013, p. 29). The report then goes on to describe how
SINERGIA is systematically used by the GoC to evaluate and monitor the performance of key
Plan-related public policies and programs, based on the information provided by the system in
terms of whether policy objectives are being reached.
     • Knowledge of SINERGIA Monitoring among respondents increased from 84 to 97
          percent between 2010 and 2013, indicating that this M&E tool is a routine mechanism
          of consultation by government agencies as well as citizens.
     • Knowledge of SINERGIA Evaluations among respondents increased from 65 to 69
          percent between 2010 and 2013, signaling that there is still some room for
          improvement regarding its dissemination and insertion within Colombia’s public
          sector.
 3.a Program and policy design by CONPES and government entities
     KPI 7 - Percentage of increase in visits of high-government officials to control panels (342
     percent level of achievement).
     • The usage of the SINERGIA Monitoring control panels has exceeded expectations,
          with the number of visits from top government officials increasing from 1,706 to
          12,144 between January 2012 and December 2014 (equivalent to a 712 percent
          increase compared to a 6 percent target).



14
     The score range was between one (1.0) to five (5.0), where 1.0 was poor quality and 5.0 was excellent.



                                                      19
     •   The number of visits from other government users increased from 11,921 to 68,543
         between January 2012 and December 2014 (equivalent to a 575 percent increase).
     • Under the Impact Evaluation, more than half of SINERGIA users (51 percent) report
         utilizing information from SINERGIA Evaluation to enhance program and policy
         design, including adjusting program targets (27 percent), policy redesign (18 percent),
         and reallocation of financial resources (6 percent).
 3.b Social accountability by the Office of the President
     • Highly visible reports based on information from SINERGIA Monitoring are
         published periodically reporting progress toward the achievement of NDP targets,
         including the Annual Report to the Congress and Balances of Results.
     • Data from SINERGIA Monitoring is publicly available online, where it is being
         increasingly accessed by non-government users.
     KPI 6 - Percentage of increase in visits from citizens to SINERGIA.
     • The usage of the SINERGIA by non-government users has exceeded expectations,
         with the number of visits per month increasing from 44,932 to 325,276 in between
         January 2012 and December 2014 (equivalent to 724 percent increase compared to a
         13 percent target).
     • Roughly 23 percent of SINERGIA Evaluation’s users report utilizing the information
         for dissemination purposes.
     • In 2014, the President visited each line Ministry to review progress toward the 2010-
         2014 NDP using SINERGIA Monitoring’s sector dashboards. Dashboards are also
         routinely utilized during ministerial meetings.
     • Evaluation results from SINERIGIA Evaluation are reported in the Report of the
         President to Congress.
 3.c Investment planning by DNP
     KPI 5 – 40 percent of recommendations of evaluations completed during project lifetime
     have been implemented by corresponding authorities at the end of the project.
     • A baseline was being constructed in 2011 but measurement was discontinued as the
         indicator was dropped. A review of four programs that were evaluated under
         SINERGIA Evaluation indicated that the implementing government agency agreed to
         implement on average 59.5 percent of the recommendations. 15
     • Results from program evaluations conducted under SINERGIA Evaluation have
         resulted in changes being introduced in several programs. 16
     • More stringent mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of recommendations
         have since been adopted, including the Recommendation Management Matrix (Matríz
         de Gestión de Recomendaciones - MGR). This matrix defines the recommendations to
         be implemented by the agency responsible for the program, including responsible
         parties, action plan and timetable.
 3.d Monitoring and evaluation capabilities at the local and regional levels
     • 94 percent of municipal officials reported a positive change as a result of the technical
         assistance received under SINERGIA Territorial.


15
   Política Nacional Ambiental para el desarrollo sostenible de los Espacios Oceánicos (45 percent);
Proyecto de Fortalecimiento de los Servicios a la Justicia (52 percent); Programa Nacional de Vivienda de
Interés Social Rural (61 percent); and Programa de Desarrollo Rural con Enfoque Territorial (80 percent).
16
   These programs include: Familias en Acción, Vivienda de Interés Social Urbana, Condiciones de
Habitabilidad, Política de Reintegración, Agro Ingreso Seguro, Programa de Renovación de la
Administración Pública, Asistencia Técnica del Sector Agrícola, BATUTA and the Programa Integral de
Rehabilitación y Mantenimiento.



                                                  20
     •   Municipal capacity has improved among participating territorial entities, as measured
         by the performance index built by DNP for subnational governments (DNP, 2014b).
         Between 2012 and 2013, 50 of the 85 municipal governments that participated in
         SINERGIA Territorial (58.8 percent) improved their Efficiency Score, while 59 of
         them (69.4 percent) improved their Overall Municipal Performance score.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

The Project’s economic efficiency is deemed Substantial. As shown on Annex 1, the overall cost
of the operation was as anticipated. Although there was a reallocation of costs among to
components to reflect changes introduced under the 2012 restructuring, as reported by the Borrower,
prices of goods and services procured under the Project were in line with those originally
anticipated (see Annex 3).

No formal economic analysis was conducted during Appraisal since this type of Project is not
amenable to traditional cost-benefit analysis. Alternatively, the PAD indicated that the economic
benefit from this operation was to be derived from the provision of higher quality and more timely
information, which, in turn, would allow the GoC to take better decisions and an improved
allocation of public resources. The efficient allocation of public resources was particularly relevant
in the case of Colombia given the increase in government participation in the economy exhibited
during the previous 15 years, as well as the ongoing process of decentralization, which was
accompanied with increasing expenditure responsibilities at the subnational level, thus meriting the
strengthening of the M&E at both the national and sub-national levels as supported under the
Project.

While it is still not possible to conduct a formal economic analysis at closing given the lack of data
in terms of increased efficiency due to the enhanced M&E framework developed with the Project’s
support, experience worldwide indicates that whole-of-government evidence-based decision-
making leads to greater effectiveness and efficiencies in achieving strategic outcomes (OECD,
2013). In the case of this operation, the economic benefits of the operation can be expected to be
substantial given the particularly large mass of expenditures covered under SUIFT and SINERGIA.
As an illustration, Table 3.1 shows the economic benefits that can be expected from enhanced M&E
under the SUIFT and SINERGIA Monitoring, SINERGIA Evaluation and SINERGIA Territorial,
as well as the corresponding mass of investments that can expected to be positively affected each
year. This analysis indicates that the amount of public investments being monitored and/or
evaluated under these M&E systems amount to roughly US$128.7 billion per year. Thus, it would
require only a marginal improvement in the economic return from these investments (a mere
0.0012 percent) as a result of enhanced M&E to exceed the cost of the entire operation (US$15.8
million) in one year alone (see Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The operation is rated Satisfactory during both the pre- and post-restructuring periods, resulting in
an overall Satisfactory rating. Specifically:

Pre-restructuring period: Overall rating is considered Satisfactory given the High relevance of
objectives, Substantial relevance of design, High efficiency and Substantial efficacy in the
achievement of development objectives.




                                                 21
Post-restructuring period: Overall rating is considered Satisfactory given the High relevance of
objectives, High relevance of design, High efficiency, and Substantial efficacy in the achievement
of development objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The operation has supported the joint efforts of DNP and DANE to ensure the comparability of
poverty measures over time and to complement traditional measures of monetary poverty with a
more encompassing measurement of poverty across multiple dimensions. It also helped enhanced
the governance of poverty measure by supporting the newly established expert poverty committees,
which are now responsible for validating monetary and multi-dimensional poverty data generated
by DANE.

In terms of social development, the Project has set the foundations for enhancing social
accountability and generating greater credibility with civil society.

In response to the initiatives of the UN Office of Evaluation, gender was explicitly incorporated
into program evaluations conducted under SINERGIA Evaluation. The gender perspective has
already been included in four program evaluations and now part of the methodological
requirements to be followed for future evaluations. 17

It is also noteworthy that, in the context of the 2014-2018 NDP, SINERGIA Monitoring will
include a special component focusing on Indigenous Peoples, including the design of culturally
appropriate indicators and a control dashboard.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
By promoting a greater use of M&E results for budget, planning, policy development,
implementation, and social accountability functions, and by strengthening the information base of
the M&E system, the Project is expected to have a considerable long-term, government-wide
impact on policy and program design and implementation. Thus, its contribution to Colombia’s
institutional development is deemed high.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
• The Project has contributed to Colombia playing an active role in sharing its experience in
    development of SINERGIA in international forums and, thus, contributing to South-South
    capacity building. The OECD and the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (IIIE) have
    amply disseminated SINERGIA as a successful experience. As a new member organization of
    the IIIE, the DNP is also playing a more active role in sharing its experience in international
    forums.
• SINERGIA has also contributed to enhancing transparency and accountability by facilitating
    internal auditing procedures.

•   As reported by technical staff from other line ministries during the ICR mission, SINERGIA
    Evaluation and its participatory approach toward evaluation has contributed to promoting an
    evaluation culture within those government agencies responsible for the implementation of
    programs evaluated. Likewise, more than one third of users of SINERGIA Evaluation report
    utilizing the evaluations and methodological documents to learn about evaluation
    methodologies, including external users (DNP, 2014).
•   With support from the Bank, a strategy was developed and implemented to foster the supply
    of private sector firms with the technical expertise needed to conduct program evaluations.

Results from the surveys with SINERGIA users under the 2013 Impact Evaluation are reported in
Section 3.2 – Achievement of Objectives.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
The outcomes achieved under this operation are expected to be maintained over time, with
several factors underlying their sustainability. These include:
• High government commitment to the continuous development and institutionalization of
    SINERGIA as demonstrated by the strong support received and substantial progress made
    under this Project;
• The strong ownership by key M&E stakeholders, including DNP, MHCP, the Office of the
    President in general demonstrated under this operation;
• The allocation of resources to DNP under the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework to
    specifically continue with the consolidation of SINERGIA Monitoring and SINERGIA
    Evaluation;
• The positive assessment on the part of government and non-government users of the quality
    and usefulness of the information provided under SINERGIA;
• The actions supported under the Project areas are already fully embedded within DNP’s
    organizational and institutional structure, as its technical units were directly responsible for
    Project implementation; and
• The strong legislative and regulatory support for SINERGIA, including Decree 1,290/2014
    that formally established SINERGIA’s organizing principles, composition, organization, and
    M&E responsibilities of the various government entities, as well as Decree 2844/2010 that
    requires the use of SUIFP by all government entities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
During preparation, the Bank effectively capitalized on the ongoing momentum and commitment
on the part of top government authorities and key constituencies toward further developing a whole-
of-government M&E system, with a particular emphasis on program evaluation. Project
preparation also benefited from sound technical evaluations that provided a sound diagnosis of the
system’s weaknesses and challenges, including an evaluation of SINERGIA on the part of IEG. It
was also critical in building capacity as well as consensus among the key institutional stakeholders.
Although the original project design was in retrospect overly ambitious, it reflected a systemic,
whole-of-government view that encompassed the enhancement of M&E processes under the




                                                23
various agencies as well as the utilization of M&E outputs by critical stakeholders, such as top
government officials and the public.

Although the PRF included important aspects, such as the impact evaluations under the operation’s
original design, it also exhibited some weaknesses, including the lack of full a alignment between
the KPIs and some of the dimensions embedded in the PDO, the lack of clear operational definition
for some indicators and the excessive number of intermediate indicators. Also, in retrospect, the
original design appears to have been overly ambitious, not just in terms of scope but also the number
of institutions involved, including several departments within DNP, DANE, and municipal and
departamental entities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
The operation was regularly supervised with well-documented missions that included the support
of sector specialists being conducted semi-annually. Throughout the Project’s lifetime the Bank
provided relevant technical expertise in the areas of program evaluation, poverty measurement,
public sector management tools, and IT, which contributed to the project achieving its objectives.
Supervision efforts also included close monitoring of fiduciary compliance, which, together with
the training in FM and procurement that was provided to DNP administrative staff, resulted in
substantial capacity building in these areas. While the need to restructure the operation was
identified early on during implementation, the processing of the restructuring took too long.
Changes in TTLs may have been one of the contributing factors to this delay. However, it is
important to note that delays in the restructuring and changes in TTL did not affect the achievement
of Project outcomes.

Although the Borrower also acknowledged shortfalls in supervision, primarily the delay in
processing the 2012 restructuring, the assessment of the Bank’s overall performance is Satisfactory
(see Annex 7). In addition, it was explicitly acknowledged during the ICR mission the Bank’s
contribution in terms of the continuous technical assistance provided throughout the Project’s
lifetime.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Overall Bank performance is deemed Moderately Satisfactory to reflect the moderately
satisfactory performance at preparation and the satisfactory performance in supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Project received full support from the GoC, including the Office of the President, which gave
high visibility to SINERGIA. Government support was also demonstrated with the passage of
supportive regulations (among others, Decree 1290/2014) and the allocation of budgetary resources.
In this regard, it is important to note that, due to delays experienced in the restructuring, the GoC
contributed additional resources to avoid interrupting activities being supported under the Project.

Wide support from top government officials for the Project in particular and the strong commitment
toward the development of a whole-of-government M&E system in general was also demonstrated
by Colombia’s high level of participation in the 2009 Conference of the Latin American and




                                                24
Caribbean (LAC) Monitoring and Evaluation Network, 18 which was hosted by the DNP in Bogotá.
About 150 Colombian participants, including both professionals and high government officials
from DNP, the Colombian Ministry of Finance, and the Office of the Presidency attended the
conference. The Colombian government also took this opportunity to launch a national chapter of
the M&E Network. The GoC continued to have a strong presence at subsequent annual conferences
of the LAC Monitoring and Evaluation Network.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The DNP and its directorates exhibited a remarkable degree of ownership of both SINERGIA and
this Project, The DNP effectively coordinated implementation efforts among its various
directorates and, during the pre-restructuring period, with DANE as well. Although minor
weaknesses in procurement persisted throughout the Project’s lifetime, DNP administrative units
effectively overcame their lack of previous experience with Bank FM and procurement procedures
and provided adequate support to Project implementation. Although swifter action in the context
of the restructuring would have been desirable, DNP’s overall performance was otherwise
outstanding. As mentioned earlier, it did not affect the achievement of Project outcomes, as the
DNP allocated its own resources to avoid disruptions in implementation.

The DSEPP was the critical engine in Project implementation as a result of its robust organization
and the strong technical capacity and high motivation of its professional staff. The DSEPP also had
a clear strategic vision of SINERGIA, which was critical in steering the course during
implementation and ensuring the achievement of the Project’s PDOs. While reporting on the PRF
was weak during the pre-restructuring period, it improved substantially during the second half of
the operation’s lifetime. The DSEPP submitted its ICR early in the evaluation process and provided
ample support during ICR preparation.

DNP’s Directorate of Public Finance and Investments (DIFP) exhibited similar qualities in
implementing the activities under Component 1, including a strong sense of ownership, clear vision,
and strong technical capacity.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Overall Borrower performance is deemed Satisfactory to reflect the satisfactory performance on
the part of both the Government and the DNP.

6. Lessons Learned
•    Technical assistance during Project preparation is not only critical to ensure sound Project
     design but it can also result in other benefits, such as capacity and consensus building among
     key stakeholders.


18
   The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) Monitoring and Evaluation Network was established in 2005
by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to promote and strengthen the use of
M&E systems in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Fifth Annual Conference of the Network took place
in Bogota, Colombia, from November 5–6, 2009. The Conference gathered more than 350 practitioners,
government officials, academia, and international organizations (IDB, World Bank, the Food and Agriculture
Organization, Comisión Económica de América Latina, RELAC) from more than 30 countries around the
world, and an additional 300 people watched the event by Webcast.




                                                   25
•   While conceiving a whole-of-government M&E system it is critical to include both technical
    and political economy considerations to ensure that such system is both technically sound and
    that it’s effectively utilized by its intended users. In the case of this Project, the design of
    dashboards tailored to the needs of the Office of the Presidency and line ministers, illustrates
    the importance of addressing the needs of strategic users.
•   The institutional and economic impact of an operation is not necessarily correlated to its size.
    While this operation was very small in the context of the Bank’s portfolio in Colombia, it has
    had a significant impact in Colombia and beyond, as SINERGIA is considered by OECD
    standards as a cutting-edge M&E system with characteristics to be emulated elsewhere.
•   It is important to note that if a Project of similar characteristics were to be prepared today,
    Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) would be a more adequate instrument than an
    investment loan.
•   Political support and ownership on the part of the Borrower are key ingredients for project
    success. This finding does not, of course, constitute a novelty. However, its importance was
    once again underscored in the context of this Project, in which support from top government
    authorities, key government agencies, as well as the DNP were critical engines in furthering
    the development and consolidation of SINERGIA.
•   Borrowers, particularly sophisticated ones such as Colombia, can be the natural drivers of
    sector-wide initiatives. While the Bank played a key role in helping Colombia build awareness
    and consensus over the importance of strengthening its M&E system, the DNP played a central
    role in steering implementation of this Project. This, in turn, brings attention to the range of
    roles to be played by the Bank in sector-wide interventions in which IBRD funding is relatively
    small and the Borrower has strong technical and institutional capacity and strategic vision.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Institutional strengthening for M&E of public investment projects at the
national and sub-national level
• This component supported the establishment of standards for collection and classification of
    public investment spending by region. As a result, regionalized budget information budget is
    now available for 94 percent of the investment budget that is subject to being regionalized in
    2014.
• Additionally, this component supported the design of methodologies, indicators and guidelines
    for the monitoring and evaluation of investment projects at the national and regional level under
    the Unified System for Investment and Public Finance (Sistema Unificado de Inversiones y
    Finanzas Públicas - SUIFP), including the development and implementation of modules for:
    i) formulation; ii) programming; iii) project execution; and iv) monitoring of public
    investments financed under the national budget.
• It also supported the delivery of training and dissemination on the use of the SUIFP and the
    Project Monitoring System (SIP), which tracks progress toward project implementation.

Component 2: Consolidate and expand the use of the national M&E system
Under this component the operation supported the continuous development of SINERGIA
Evaluation, a system to evaluate the outcomes of the main public policies and programs
implemented within the framework of the NDP. Every year, the policies that will be evaluated are
elected by a Committee of the DNP and approved by the CONPES. Additional resources were
made available to Component 2 in the 2012 restructuring to support an expanded evaluation agenda
that fed into the current National Development Plan. Specific outcomes under SINERGIA
Evaluation include:

•   Several improvements were introduced, including the standardization of evaluation
    methodologies, the creation of an annual evaluation agenda, the development of improvement
    plans and monitoring to ensure that recommendations were being properly implemented. The
    experience built under the operation resulted in the creation of the National Assessment System
    (SISDEVAL).
•   A total of 84 program evaluations were conducted during the operation’s lifetime, 23 of which
    were financed under the operation. In addition to the increase in the number of evaluations,
    there was significant progress toward sector diversification.
•   Evaluations are conducted by recognized, experienced third parties so as to guarantee
    objectivity and transparency in the process.
•   Evaluation results are increasingly being used as inputs in the design of the NDP 2010- 2014
    and reported in the Report of the President to Congress.




                                                 28
•   Results from program evaluations conducted under SINERGIA Evaluation have resulted in
    changes being introduced in several programs. 19
•   The new “Radar” initiative developed under SINERGIA Evaluation serves as an evaluations
    clearinghouse, systematically compiling evaluations performed by both public and no-public
    entities. Currently there are 171 evaluations available for downloading at the SINERGIA
    Evaluation website and an additional 530 are being reviewed. 20
•   Dissemination of results of evaluations were actively disseminated to enhance public
    awareness, with results reports results being published and a series of events on evaluation
    being performed.

Component 3: Support the development of local and regional M&E systems
During the pre-restructuring period, this component provided support to municipalities and
departments that were reform-oriented, with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of sound M&E
tools at the subnational level. Some of the specific outcomes included:
• Medium-term expenditure framework was being presented to the municipal council yearly in
    the context of budget discussions in Medellin;
• By December 2011, two departments (i.e., Atlántico and Santander) and four municipalities
    had designed and implemented an evaluation agenda.
• The PBB annex was presented to the municipal council yearly with the budget in Medellin and
    Pasto.
During the post-restructuring period, this component supported the development and
implementation of a regional strategy aimed at enhancing the M&E function at the sub-national
level under the so-called SINERGIA Territorial. Technical assistance was provided to 95 territorial
entities (i.e., municipalities and governaciones) in four areas: i) M&E methodologies; ii)
information systems; iii) training; and iv) follow-up and verification of the monitoring of regional
and local development plans. These activities helped the development and implementation of M&E
system within territorial entities, including production of quality performance information by
subnational entities to assess the performance of their local development plans. This capacity
building in the M&E function at the subnational level is critical in the context of the ongoing
decentralization as well as the efforts to strengthen monitoring of the NDP at the subnational level.
Some of the specific outcomes include:
• Between 2012 and 2013, 59 municipalities improved in the Integrated Performance Score
    (IDM).
• Between 2012 and 2013, 50 municipalities improved their relative positions in the efficiency
    index
• 63 of the 95 territorial entities now have performance dashboards
• 63 of the 95 territorial entities generate regular monitoring reports
• 78 of the 95 territorial entities created and/or strengthened their monitoring teams
• 53 of the 95 territorial entities formalized its M&E system through decrees, resolutions or
    ordinances
• There was substantial capacity building achieved, as shown by the progress towards higher-
    levels of capacity of territorial entities, with 15 achieving the sustainability level at closing (see
    on Table 2.2).

Component 4: Establish the mechanisms to improve quality and relevance of public
information
This component supported the modernization, integration and improvement of the quality of public
sector information flow (generation, distribution and storage) and strengthening the institutional,
legal, regulatory framework and technical areas. Component 4 also supported improving the
technical capacity of SINERGIA to monitor the quality of performance information provided by
government agencies. Finally, Component 4 supported the improvement of the DNP web platform
and interface to make it more user-friendly with greater ease and access to the use of the data.
Specific outcomes during the pre-restructuring period include:
• Formulation of the DANE’s National Statistical Plan (PENDES), including the reclassification
    of 1,227 statistical procedures to improve information flows and therefore, the quality and
    availability of information. These activities were continued by DANE outside the operation
    after the 2012 restructuring.
• The Project contributed to restoring long-term comparability in the measurement of poverty
    after a disruption during 2006-2007 as a result of changes in data collection instruments. In
    addition, DANE has assumed responsibility for calculating and publishing the results of the
    official measurements of poverty in Colombia, including traditional measures of monetary
    poverty as well as multi-dimensional poverty. Multi-dimensional poverty measurements have
    been available since 2011.
Specific outcomes during the pre- and post-restructuring period include the continuous
strengthening of SINERGIA Monitoring, which consists a set of performance indicators that
measures policy outputs and outcomes identified by the NDP. The system is built following a
pyramidal structure with three main levels: strategic, sector and management. Strategic indicators
are at the top and are related to the main government pillars as stated in the NDP. The President
and the Council of Ministers monitor progress toward strategic indicators. Sector indicators
describe sector-specific goals and are monitored by the President and each Minister in bilateral
meetings and within each Ministry. Finally, Management indicators are standard indicators that are
measured for all of the entities to track institutional efficiency.

Some of the specific outcomes include:
• Control dashboards were designed and implemented to provide government officials with early
   warnings on delays progress and the achievement of NDP targets. These dashboards are
   designed to communicate the information effectively, utilizing different colors to show various
   degrees of progress. There are three types of boards: i) sector dashboards for DSEPP internal
   use; ii)) bi-lateral ones to support dialogue between the President and line ministers; and iii)
   cross-sector ones to track progress made in different sectors under a transversal policy area.
• In 2013 the DSEPP began the documentation of databases according to international standards
   and best practices under the Accelerated Data Program (ADP), including ensuring the




                                                 30
     anonymity of micro-data, to encourage open dissemination of information. 21 By 2014, there
     were 29 documented databases. In addition, the documentation of databases has been included
     as a requirement under all evaluations conducted under SINERGIA Evaluation.
•    With Project support, the DNP is now routinely carrying out "Public Perception Surveys”
     aimed at capturing relevant information from citizens regarding how they are affected by
     government policies and programs with the ultimate objective of ensuring their alignment.
•    M&E performance methods and tools have been adopted in several national departments and
     has cultivated participation and interest in the Colombia chapter of the Latin American and
     Caribbean Monitoring and Evaluation Network.

  Since April 2006, the Accelerated Data Program has been implemented as a satellite program of the
PARIS21 Secretariat at OECD with World Bank support. It aims at strengthening country capacity in
producing statistical data relevant for policy design, monitoring and evaluation by: i) better documenting,
preserving, and disseminating existing micro-data; ii) better exploiting existing datasets (quality assessments,
further analysis); and iii) better strategizing and aligning survey programs and statistical outputs to priority
data needs.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project’s economic efficiency is deemed High. As shown on Annex 1, the overall cost of the
operation was as anticipated. As reported by the Borrower, prices of goods and services procured
under the Project were in line with those originally anticipated.

There was a reallocation of costs among to components to reflect changes introduced under the
2012 restructuring. Specifically:
• Although all activities under Component 1 were completed, the lower actual cost of Component
   1 relative to the one anticipated at Appraisal (i.e., 0.75 percent) reflects DNP’s decision to
   finance some of the activities with its own budgetary resources.
• The actual cost of activities under Component 2 was slightly higher than anticipated (110
   percent) due to a larger evaluation program that envisioned at Appraisal
• The actual cost of activities under Component 3 was three times higher than anticipated at
   Appraisal (330 percent) due to the GoC’s decision to implement a more extensive intervention
   at the subnational level (i.e., SINERGIA Territorial) than anticipated at Appraisal.
• The actual cost of activities under Component 4 was half than anticipated at Appraisal due to
   the elimination of activities under DANE under the 2012 restructuring.

No formal economic analysis was conducted during Appraisal since this type of Project is not
amenable to traditional cost-benefit analysis. Alternatively, the PAD indicated that the economic
benefit from this operation was to be derived from the provision of higher quality and more timely
information, which, in turn, would allow the GoC to take better decisions and an improved
allocation of public resources. The efficient allocation of public resources was particularly relevant
in the case of Colombia given the increase in government participation in the economy exhibited
during the previous 15 years, as well as the ongoing process of decentralization, which was
accompanied with increasing expenditure responsibilities at the subnational level, thus meriting the
strengthening of the M&E at both the national and sub-national levels as supported under the
Project.

While it is still not possible to conduct a formal economic analysis at closing given the lack of data
in terms of increased efficiency due to the enhanced M&E framework developed with the Project’s
support, experience worldwide indicates that whole-of-government evidence-based decision-
making leads to greater effectiveness and efficiencies in achieving strategic outcomes (OECD,
2013).

In the case of this operation, the economic benefits of the operation can be expected to be substantial
given the particularly large mass of expenditures covered under SUIFT and SINERGIA. As an
illustration, Table 3.1 shows the economic benefits that can be expected from enhanced M&E under
the SUIFT and SINERGIA Monitoring, SINERGIA Evaluation and SINERGIA Territorial, as well
as the corresponding mass of investments that can expected to be positively affected each year.
This analysis indicates that the amount of public investments being monitored and/or evaluated
under these M&E systems amount to roughly US$128.7 billion per year. Thus, it would required
only a marginal improvement in the economic return from these investments (a mere 0.0012
percent) as a result of enhanced M&E to exceed the cost of the entire operation (US$15.8 million)
in one year alone.

Introducción

El Contrato de Préstamo BIRF 7620co se ejecutó durante seis (6) años, fue suscrito por las partes
el 19 de diciembre de 2008 y finalizó ejecución el 31 de diciembre de 2014; concebido con el
propósito de generar el fortalecimiento de los sistemas de Monitoreo y Evaluación (M&E) del
Gobierno de tal forma que provea información de calidad para ser usada por los programas y los
diseñadores de política, para la rendición de cuentas del Gobierno Nacional hacia la Ciudadanía en
general.
De acuerdo a lo anterior es necesario presentar ante el Banco Mundial y demás agentes interesados
este informe final, el cual se entrega como parte de la etapa de cierre del proyecto, y tiene como
objetivo presentar su estructura, los cambios realizados durante la ejecución y componentes, los
logros alcanzados en su implementación, el estado de las actividades a la fecha de cierre y la
sostenibilidad del proyecto sin el Crédito del Banco Mundial.
Complementando lo anterior y como parte del “Implementation Completion and Results Report –
ICR”, el presente informe contiene la evaluación de desempeño del prestatario y del Banco, durante
la ejecución del proyecto.

    1. Antecedentes

En 1994 fue creado formalmente el Sistema Nacional de Evaluación de Gestión y Resultados –
SINERGIA, el cual durante 1996 y 2002 tuvo un decaimiento de su uso dentro del Gobierno, pues
se encontraron dificultades en el manejo de sistema y el acceso a la información. Lo anterior tuvo
como consecuencia que el Presidente de la República (2002 – 2006), promoviera el uso activo de
la información generada por SINERGIA para aumentar la responsabilidad de la Rama Ejecutiva y
apoyar la transparencia del Gobierno hacia los Ciudadanos y el Congreso.
Los esfuerzos colectivos del Alto Gobierno y otros agentes durante los últimos años, ha logrado
que SINERGIA se consolide como unos de los sistemas de M&E más fuertes técnica y
conceptualmente de América Latina, pero que aún cuenta con algunas deficiencia identificadas por
agentes externos al DNP y que se convierten en retos por abordar a futuro y que se relacionan a
continuación.
La declaración de la política de Gobierno expedida en 2004, en donde el Consejo Nacional de
Políticas Económica y Social – CONPES, en su documento CONPES 3294 aportó un diagnóstico
de la situación de M&E en Colombia, en donde los principales vacíos fueron:
      La falta de un manual metodológico único y claro sobre cómo llevar a cabo el M&E
      La necesidad de aclarar los roles y responsabilidades de los ministerios y agencias
         involucradas en el sistema de M&E del Gobierno
      La ausencia de conexiones claras entre planeación, presupuesto y evaluación de políticas
         públicas
      Problemas con la disponibilidad, frecuencia y calidad de la información.




                                               38
Estas falencias y retos que enfrentaba el sistema de M&E en Colombia, también habían sido
identificados por el Banco Mundial 22, en los diagnósticos realizados al sistema en 2006, en donde
se identificaron los retos que esperaba apoyar con el Crédito BIRF 7620co:
      Información limitada acerca de la inversión del gobierno central a nivel sub –nacional. No
         existían datos sobre la ejecución del prepuesto por parte de los departamentos y municipios;
         al igual que la falencia o ausencia de metodologías para la formulación estandarizada de
         proyecto de inversión.
      Fortalecer el marco institucional de SINERGIA para asegurar su consolidación y
         sostenibilidad. Con lo anterior se busca que la desde la Dirección de Seguimiento y
         Evaluación de Políticas Públicas – DSEPP, estandarice procedimientos y transfiera
         capacidades a los ministerios y entidades.
      Teniendo en cuenta los pilotos realizados en Medellín, Tocancipa y Pasto, en donde se
         mostró interés de las administraciones públicas territoriales, para fortalecer los sistemas de
         M&E, desarrollar y transferir capacidades de M&E a los gobiernos locales.
      La información que en su momento alimentaba SINERGIA a nivel nacional era de baja
         calidad debido a la falta de estándares unificados y protocolos para producir, auditar y
         diseminar la información a través de los ministerios y entidades del gobierno.

De acuerdo a lo anterior y también partiendo de la premisa de que a un sistema de M&E, no solo
lo hace exitoso la calidad de la información que provee, sino también el uso que el gobierno y la
ciudadanía le dé a la misma, siendo sostenible en el tiempo y sobreviviendo a los cambios de
gobierno, en otras palabras que logre ser un sistema institucionalizado.
De esta manera el Banco Mundial fundamentó su intervención, afirmando que con el fortaleciendo
de SINERGIA se ayudaría al Gobierno de Colombia a mejorar su efectividad en la inversión
pública del país, con el de cumplir con objetivos económicos y sociales más ambiciosos; partiendo
del acompañamiento esxitoso que ha tenido el Banco Mundial en temas de M&E, promoción de
transparencia de los gobiernos centrales, responsabilidad social mediante evaluaciones periódicas
y una veeduría ciudadana más participativa.

Estructura por componentes

Tal como fue concebido, el Proyecto se estructuró en cinco componentes: 1) El fortalecimiento
institucional del Prestatario y evaluación de sus proyectos de inversión pública nacional y sub -
nacional; 2) Consolidación y expansión del uso del sistema nacional de M&E del Prestatario; 3)
Respaldo al desarrollo local de los sistemas de M&E locales y regionales; 4) Establecimiento de
mecanismos para mejorar la calidad, relevancia y efectividad al costo de la información pública y
5) Ejecución del Proyecto.
A su vez cada componente, cuenta con frentes específicos de intervención o “subcomponentes” los
cuales fueron ejecutados por algunas Direcciones Técnicas del DNP y otras entidades nacionales,
según el área de intervención; como se muestra en el siguiente cuadro, el cual incluye los cambios
efectuados a los componentes según el contrato de empréstito modificado y reformulado.

Modificaciones durante la ejecución

En agosto de 2011, el DNP solicitó al Banco Mundial una enmienda que tenía como fin realizar
una revisión al proyecto y la reprogramación de los recursos disponibles con el fin de dar respuesta
a las nuevas prioridades del Gobierno Nacional. Si bien el crédito tenía objetivos concretos, se hizo
necesario realizar reestructuración al proyecto con el fin de focalizar los recursos disponibles en
áreas y temas que generaran mayor beneficio e impacto ajustándose a las necesidades del momento.
Con el fin de responder a las nuevas necesidades del seguimiento y la evaluación de las políticas
públicas en Colombia, y garantizar una mejor acción gubernamental en materia de diseño de
política, rendición de cuentas, planeación de la inversión y generación de capacidades en las
entidades territoriales, en noviembre de 2011, la DSEPP como Director Técnico del proyecto,
solicitó al Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público - MHCP tramitar ante el Banco Mundial una
restructuración enfocándose en 5 aspectos fundamentales:
     1. Modificar el PDO (Project Development Objective) para que incluya el CONPES (antes
         Comité Intersectorial de Evaluación - CIE)
     2. Modificar algunas de las actividades del PAD (Project Appraisal Document) en los
         componentes del proyecto que lo requerían.
     3. Modificar PDO y los indicadores de resultado intermedio en la matriz de marco lógico.
     4. Revisar los costos del proyecto por componente para reflejar las circunstancias actuales,
         después de 3 años de implementación.
     5. Revisar las asignaciones de cada componente de acuerdo al préstamo y una re -
         categorización

Cambios en la medición del objetivo general del programa: es levemente modificada en cuanto
se cambia el comité responsable de las decisiones del sistema de M&E, en particular de la
aprobación de la agenda de evaluación. En efecto, el Comité Intersectorial de Evaluación se
reemplaza por el CONPES. De esta forma, todas las actividades asignadas en el programa al comité
pasan al CONPES y el objetivo del programa queda así: “apoyar al Gobierno de Colombia a
fortalecer su sistema de monitoreo y evaluación para asegurar la disponibilidad y la producción de
información de calidad para mejorar: i) el diseño de programas y políticas por parte del CONPES
y las entidades de gobierno 24; ii) la rendición de cuentas por parte de la Presidencia de la República;
iii) la planeación de la inversión por parte del Departamento Nacional de Planeación, y iv) las
capacidades de monitoreo y evaluación en los niveles regionales y locales”.



24
   Es de aclarar que a partir de 2011 con base en el artículo 229 de la Ley 1450, el DNP debe producir informes
periódicos sobre los avances del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo como son: i) el Informe Anual sobre el balance del PND
que debe contener al menos los indicadores de seguimiento al Plan con corte a 31 de diciembre del año anterior, los
resultados de las evaluaciones de política pública adelantadas durante el año anterior y la agenda de evaluación
vigente y ii) el Informe al Congreso sobre el avance del PND.




                                                        42
Cambios en el componente 2 : Se modifica a través de la inclusión de un subcomponente que
busca apoyar el desarrollo y el pilotaje de una plataforma de open data construida sobre cuatro (4)
bases de datos del DNP; así como sobre las bases de datos entregadas al DNP en el marco de las
evaluaciones. Para esto último se plantea incluir en los términos de referencia una cláusula para
obligar al contratista a entregar la documentación técnica de las bases de datos de las evaluaciones
de acuerdo a estándares internacionales. Esto ya se está realizando en los términos de referencia de
las evaluaciones.
Cambios en el componente 3: Se modifica incluyendo el desarrollo e implementación del sistema
de M&E a departamentos y municipios (SINERGIA Territorial) de tal forma que se logre el
seguimiento a la ejecución del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo. El desarrollo del sistema se prevé a
través de metodologías, sistemas de información, capacitación y seguimiento y verificación a los
planes de desarrollo locales.
Cambios en el componente 4: Se excluye el apoyo al DANE, en la medida que la entidad requiere
un programa de mayor alcance para atender sus necesidades. De la misma forma, dado que las
acciones inicialmente propuestas para apoyar la Comisión Intersectorial de Políticas de
Información y Gestión para la Administración Pública - COINFO perdieron pertinencia, éstas no
se continuaron. Por otra parte, se incorpora un nuevo subcomponente para la modernización y la
integración de flujos de información a través de la estandarización de procesos que mejoren la
calidad de la información de SINERGIA. Igualmente, se promueve y apoya la política nacional de
Open Data.
En septiembre de 2012 el Banco envía la enmienda para firma por parte del Gobierno Nacional –
Director del DNP y Ministro de Hacienda y Crédito Público.
El 31 de enero de 2013, el Banco emitió un comunicado mediante el cual autorizaba la extensión
del periodo establecido para la firma de la enmienda hasta el 15 de febrero, sin embargo, ésta fue
firmada por el Ministro de Hacienda Mauricio Cárdenas el 5 de febrero y remitida al Banco.
Teniendo en cuenta el tiempo de aprobación (1 año y 3 meses) que se tomó la enmienda en marzo
de 2013 fue necesario replantear la destinación de los recursos entre componentes de acuerdo a las
necesidades de la DSEPP para esta fecha, igualmente la extensión de la fecha de cierre del Crédito
BIRF 7620-CO del 15 de marzo de 2014 hasta 31 de diciembre 2014 fue aprobada por el Banco
Mundial el 26 de noviembre de 2013 mediante una Restructuración de segundo nivel.
En marzo de 2014 se solicitó una reasignación entre componentes, con el fin de financiar 2
evaluaciones de la agenda de evaluaciones 2014, la mencionada reasignación fue aprobada
mediante no objeción por parte del Banco Mundial el 15 de abril de 2014.
La información que se presenta a continuación, contiene todos los cambios que se realizaron la
estructura inicial con la mencionada enmienda.

    3. Evaluación de desempeño

    3.1 Evaluación del objetivo de la operación

De acuerdo a la estructura general del proyecto que se presentó en el capítulo 2 del presente informe,
a continuación se detallan los logros y avances obtenido en cada uno de los 5 componentes y el
resultado final del avance de los indicadores a 31 de diciembre de 2014.

Vale la pena resaltar que los logros del proyecto se evidencian a partir de los responsables de su
ejecución, en donde el componente 1 fortaleció el ciclo de la inversión pública, mediante el Sistema
Unificado de Inversiones y Finanzas Públicas, los componentes 2, 3 y 4 se enfocar en fortalecer el
modelo de M&E mediante Sinergia, y finalmente por medio del el componente 5 se ejecutó todo
lo relacionado con la administración y operación del crédito, como se pude observar en la siguiente
imagen.

    3.2.1     Componente 1: El fortalecimiento institucional del Prestatario y evaluación de sus
              proyectos de inversión pública nacional y sub – nacional

    Se cuenta actualmente con información de presupuesto regionalizada, lo que implica que la
    inversión del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo se encuentra actualizada con las bases históricas y
    mensuales, igualmente se lleva a cabo el seguimiento de la regionalización del presupuesto. Las
    fichas técnicas se han rediseñado de acuerdo a los requerimientos del Director General del

3.2.3   Componente 3: Respaldo al desarrollo local de los sistemas de M&E locales y
        regionales

•   Se alcanzaron los objetivos planteados para los pilotos de Medellín, Pasto y Tocancipá, los
    cuales tenían como fin la consolidación de sus experiencias referente a sus sistemas de
    M&E para así diseminarlas y expandirlas como ejemplo de buena práctica.

•   En Chocó y Medellín se dio apoyo y asesoría administrativa, jurídica y financiera a los
    funcionarios encargados, con el fin de generar transparencia, mejor información y crear las
    bases de una cultura de M&E en dichas regiones.

•   En lo referente a la mejora y retroalimentación de la Metodología de Medición del
    Desempeño Municipal que utiliza el Departamento Nacional de Planeación para medir la
    gestión local el DNP, se identificaron recomendaciones viables a ser implementadas,
    acorde a parámetros técnicos y económicos y la difusión de experiencias exitosas a través
    del desarrollo de dos talleres de divulgación y socialización.

•   En 2012 se realizó una batería de indicadores para Sinergia Territorial, y la articulación,
    con lo anterior se finalizó la propuesta conceptual, en donde se definieron los municipios
    y departamentos para la primera fase de la estrategia y se elaboró el plan de trabajo para
    2012.

•   Fortalecimiento de la capacitad institucional para la medición del desempeño y la entrega
    de información relacionada con las transferencias fiscales (capacitaciones).

•   Desde 2012 la DSEPP consolida información territorial, a partir de unas fichas
    municipales y departamentales, que contiene información relacionada con la
    implementación del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo en el territorio.

•   Asistencia técnica insitu mediante la Estrategia de Sinergia Territorial - ST, se tiene como
    principales logros la asistencia brindada a los Municipios y Departamentos que así lo
    solicitan y el Seguimiento Territorial.

    Durante el 2014 se logró consolidar sistemas de seguimiento en más del 80% de las 86
    entidades territoriales – ET vinculadas a la estrategia; así mismo, más del 70% de las ET
    vienen realizando seguimiento a sus planes de desarrollo de manera permanente y
    periódica, realizan informes de seguimiento y han formalizado e interiorizado a través de
    equipos y decretos (u ordenanzas) los sistemas de seguimiento con lo cual se garantizará la
    sostenibilidad de los logros hasta ahora alcanzados.
    Vale la pena resaltar que la operación de la estrategia de Sinergia Territorial a partir de
    2014, se está financiando a través del Proyecto de Fortalecimiento de las Entidades
    Territoriales, Crédito BIRF 8320-CO, ejecutado por la Dirección de Desarrollo Territorial
    Sostenible - DDTS del DNP con la asistencia técnica de Findeter.

       •   En 2010 se puso en funcionamiento las Plataformas Tecnológicas SISDEVAL: se
           desarrolló la carga y consulta de la dinámica de la agenda de evaluaciones y de las
           evaluaciones finalizadas, y SISMEG: se desarrolló el Datamart básico para la consulta de
           información gerencial y se terminó el módulo de consulta para el ciudadano. Se
           independizó la consulta de indicadores SIGOB, es decir toda la información ahora se carga
           y se consulta en SISMEG.
       •   Dentro del segundo subcomponente, el cual tiene como fin la modernización e integración
           de los mecanismos técnicos, sistemas y canales de entrega de los flujos de información, se
           efectuó la contratación de la firma Activa Marketing en el año 2013, la cual correspondió
           a la etapa de generación de un plan para mejorar la experiencia del usuario en el sistema
           Sinergia, a través de un diseño parcial con técnicas y herramientas de última generación en
           desarrollo de páginas web, diseñando un desarrollo de una plataforma tecnológica sólida
           e integral para Sinergia.

           usuario final, utilizando herramientas de última tecnología en diseño e implementación
           web para computadores y dispositivos móviles.
       •   Por lo anterior y con el fin de dar continuidad al desarrollo tecnológico y a la contratación
           con la firma Activa, para 2014 el DNP ha aunado esfuerzos en conjunto con el Programa
           de Tierras & Desarrollo Rural de USAID – “Agency for International Development” para
           realizar el rediseño e implementación del nuevo “Front End” de Sinergia.

Por este componente se financió la administración y operación del proyecto, garantizando así una
correcta ejecución, contratación y operación; teniendo en cuenta que los consultores contratados
para tal fin estaban capacitados en las nomas de Selección y Contratación de Consultores del Banco
Mundial, así como en las operaciones y administración financiera; quienes además contaban con la
experticia para asesorar al Director del proyecto, a la Secretaria General del DNP y demás
Direcciones Técnicas que participaron en la ejecución del proyecto: los roles financiados por el
componente administrativo fueron:

clausula en la cual se solicita que las firmas entreguen las bases de datos documentadas (para este año fueron
11), por otra parte de las 85 evaluaciones que se han ejecutado desde el 2002 (no incluye evaluaciones
ejecutivas), en listado se encuentran evaluaciones realizadas antes de 2011 que solo después de finalizada su
ejecución se realizó la documentación de los datos (ver anexo 4)

    3.3 Evaluación del desempeño del prestatario durante la operación.

Con base en los resultados descritos lo largo de este informe se generan a continuación unas
conclusiones generales sobre la implementación del programa y el desempeño del DNP como
ejecutor:

•   Pertinencia: De acuerdo al objetivo del programa y de los distintos componentes, se evidencia
    que son pertinentes para las necesidades del país en cuanto a información relacionada con
    presupuesto, seguimiento y evaluación, resaltando también que la Dirección de Seguimiento
    y Evaluación – DSEPP y la Direcciones de Inversiones y Finanzas Públicas - DIFP del DNP,
    eran la instancias técnicas del Gobierno nacional llamadas constitucionalmente para el
    desarrollo e implementación de las actividades en marcadas en este crédito.

•   Eficiencia: En cuanto a los costos finales del programa, estos correspondieron con los costos
    previstos, las actividades y productos se obtuvieron con los recursos programados, se dieron
    todas las contrataciones previstas y no hubo sobre precios. En los casos en que se presentó
    desfinanciación de algún componente el DNP oportunamente solicitó reasignación de recursos
    entre componentes.

    Al 31 de diciembre de 2014 se ejecutaron en 99% los recursos del crédito, quedan así un saldo
    de usd$85.000.

•   Eficacia: En cuanto al cumplimiento de las metas, estas se lograron satisfactoriamente. Sin
    embargo, los indicadores definidos inicialmente para el seguimiento y la evaluación del
    programa no fueron pertinentes. Con la enmienda los 5 indicadores de resultado se eliminan y
    se acuerdan 2 nuevos indicadores; lo mismo sucedió con los indicadores de cada componente
    en donde se pasó de 17 indicadores a 4, lo que simplificó su seguimiento y facilito el
    entendimiento de los logros a partir de los indicadores.

•   Lecciones aprendidas:

    -   Este crédito además de los fines técnicos con los que se concibió, también fue un piloto
        para la implementación y ejecución de créditos al interior del DNP, teniendo en cuenta que
        este fue el primero en ser ejecutado directamente por la entidad.




                                               50
    -   La estructura para la implementación del programa al interior del DNP probó ser un
        esquema viable y efectivo, que además permitió generar documentos que registraron los
        avances y decisiones estratégicos del programa, como el Manual Operativo, el Plan de
        Adquisiciones y el Plan Operativo Anual.

    -   También se evidenció que el organigrama con el que se ejecutó el crédito al interior del
        DNP, fue exitoso en su implementación; teniendo en cuenta las diferentes instancias de
        aprobación y que las decisiones no estaban centradas en la DSEPP como responsable
        técnico. Lo anterior se evidencia también con la figura de comité operativo que se
        constituyó para los fines administrativos operativos del crédito.

    -   Se presentó un período de tiempo considerable entre la solicitud de la enmienda y su
        aprobación (de junio de 2011 a febrero de 2013), la ejecución de las actividades no se
        retrasó debido a que el gobierno financió con sus recursos del Presupuesto General de la
        Nación – PGN, las actividades requeridas en dicho período.

    -   Se evidenció la importancia y relevancia de formular indicadores de los programas de
        manera consistente con los objetivos del proyecto planeando un mediano plazo y sobre
        todo de disponer de manera rápida y sistemática de la información necesaria para su
        construcción tanto en la línea de base como en el seguimiento. No contar con los
        indicadores idóneos dificulta la valoración de los avances y la toma de decisiones oportuna
        para los correctivos en caso de requerirse.

    -   Durante la ejecución, el crédito contó con 6 coordinadores diferentes por parte del DNP,
        pero aun así el DNP garantizó que no se perdiera la trazabilidad de las actividades y el
        seguimiento de las mismas.

    3.4 Evaluación del desempeño del Banco durante la operación.

Se agradece al Banco los estudios anteriores al crédito, en los cuales se identificaron las necesidades
existentes del Gobierno en materia de información, monitoreo y evaluación; los cuales fueron
insumos primordiales en el momento de las estructuración del proyecto.

Desde el punto de vista del DNP, el desempeño del Banco durante la preparación y ejecución de la
operación se considera satisfactorio, incluyendo la participación activa y siempre pertinente de los
especialistas de administración financiera y de adquisiciones.

Durante la ejecución del proyecto, el equipo del Banco siempre atendió las consultas y solicitudes
algunas veces tomando tiempos de revisión adicionales; el Banco realizó constantemente misiones
de supervisión y misiones financieras, supervisando de esta manera la operación y asegurando el
cumplimiento de los objetivos de desarrollo.




                                                 51
El tiempo de trámite y respuesta que tomó la enmienda, fue un periodo desperdiciado en términos
de ejecución, en este caso falto más participación del Banco para involucrarse con los temas y
agilizar de alguna manera esta situación, esta fue la razón principal para extender el crédito por 9
meses más y de esta manera lograr mayor ejecución de los recursos y culminar con los objetivos
propuestos.


       3.5 Descripción de las medidas propuestas para la futura operación del proyecto.

De acuerdo al ciclo y apropiación presupuestal de los recursos que ejecutan las entidades nacionales,
el ciclo de la inversión pública definido por el DNP y el MHCP implica la formulación de un
proyecto de inversión, mediante el cual se apropian y se ejecutan los recursos independientemente
de la fuente de financiación (crédito, nación, donación, otros).
Asimismo fue como se ejecutaron los recursos apropiados del crédito en donde el proyecto
“Fortalecimiento y fomento de la cultura del seguimiento y evaluación de políticas públicas en el
nivel nacional y territorial” con código Bpin 2011011000244, contó con la financiación de recursos
crédito y nación. Lo que implicó que si bien el crédito no contaba con contrapartida según el
contrato de empréstito, la DSEPP contó con recursos adicionales para el cumplimento de las
actividades misionales también incluidas en los componentes del crédito.
Con el fin de continuar fortaleciendo el sistema de M&E y teniendo en cuenta que desde 2015 no
se apropiaron recursos de crédito, se formuló un nuevo proyecto de inversión solicitando un
incremento en los recursos del PGN, con lo que se logre compensar los recursos de crédito. En
donde sus principales características son:
Nombre: Fortalecimiento del sistema nacional de evaluación y de gestión de resultados -
Sinergia en el nivel nacional y territorial
Código Bpin: 2014011000087
Horizonte del proyecto: 2015 - 2018
Con una programación presupuestal, distribuida anualmente de la siguiente manera:

                                     2015             2016                2017                 2018
     Recursos   solicitados 33   9.847.615.961   11.704.742.967      11.771.616.972       12.538.412.572




33
  Los recursos solicitados están en la formulación del proyecto, lo cual no implica que en la ejecución se
vayan a apropiar el 100% de los mismos, lo anterior está sujeto a las discusiones del presupuesto que se dan
anualmente en el Congreso de la República y al respectivo Decreto de Liquidación que se expide para cada
vigencia.
