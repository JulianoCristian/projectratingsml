On November 1,\n            2011, the Government of Colombia (GoC) requested a second\n            restructuring of the project. The changes, described in this\n            restructuring paper, seek to: i) modify the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) to reflect the name of the new\n            Government agency which will approve the evaluation agenda\n            in the future; ii) modify some of the activities outlined in\n            the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for each of the project\n            components: iii) modify the PDO and intermediate results\n            indicators in the results framework matrix; iv) revise the\n            project cost per component to reflect the current\n            circumstances after almost three years of implementation;\n            and v) revise the funding allocations of the loan agreement.\n            The request entails a Level one restructuring due to the\n            slight modification of the PDO. The implementation schedule\n            will remain the same. A level two restructuring was approved\n            by the World Bank on September 9, 2010 in response to the\n            Government's request to revise the funding allocations\n            need for a significant number of training events,\n            dissemination activities, and editing and publication of\n            materials. In addition, the definition of\n            'training' was revised in section four, Part of\n            the loan agreement. The changes are to provide more\n            flexibility in use of project funds in order to avoid future\n            amendments to the loan agreement and to reflect new\n            government priorities by incorporating new activities\n            related to open data and 'Sinergia Territoral' and\n            removing activities no longer critical to the achievement of\n            the PDO. The restructuring will also slightly modify the\n            PDO, as the government has decided to replace the authority\n            to approve the evaluation agenda from the\n            Inter-institutional Evaluations Committee (IEC) to the\n            Economic and Social Council (CONPES)."}, "docdt": "2012-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
