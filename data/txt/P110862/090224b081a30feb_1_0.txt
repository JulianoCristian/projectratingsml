                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Iraq Public Financial Management (PFM) project was started as an emergency operation in July 2009 under the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF). The project is to be completed in August
                         2013. The total estimated cost of the Project is US$18 million: i) US$16 million to be Recipient-executed; and ii) US$2 million to be Bank-executed on behalf of the Recipient. At the
                         time of last ISR rating in April 2012, against the project cost of $16 million under the Recipient-executed part; only $1.6 million (11 %) was disbursed and $8.2 million (51 %) was

                         uncommitted. Under the Bank-executed part, $1.4 million (70 %) was disbursed. There were significant delays in procuring goods and signing consultancy services contracts. The
                         payment approval procedure used was not appropriate and led to delays in payments. However, as per Bank’s task team’s advice, the payment approval system has now been
                         streamlined, eDisbursement system activated, and the project has made some good physical progress under all components since April 2012. As a result, under the Recipient-
                         executed part, $4 million (25 %) has been disbursed so far and under the Bank-executed part, the entire $2 million (100 %) has been disbursed. Thus, against the total project cost of
                         $18 million, $6 million (33 %) has been disbursed. Although there has been an improvement in the physical and financial progress recently, the implementation progress is still rated
                         Moderately Unsatisfactory due to an overall low disbursement rate.
